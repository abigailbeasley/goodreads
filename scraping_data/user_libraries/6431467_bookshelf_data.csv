Told by a trans masc tailor who has many lovers but has never felt compelled to stick around and love, it is a story of finding one’s heart stitched somewhere unexpected. A simple yet fun line-art style bring this brief and breezy story to life, drawing on Pygmalion from Ovid’s Metamorphoses in a new way for this tale of a tailor in love with a doll named Theu.[image]‘But it is a love fully realized.’Quirky but surprisingly touching, Yugo Limbo takes a story that is often explored for critiques on objectification and ownership and makes it rather soft and warm. The narrator gives love to the doll, finds happiness in its companionship and feels that it is ‘something that transcends the idea of “unreciprocated love…” It is still, like Pygmalion, a love professed to an object from their owner, yet here it is shown as a way to feel joy in a situation where the doll is quite literally an inanimate doll (I believe this is definitely meant literally and not metaphorically) and a place to which the narrator can give emotional connection. ‘To love an object. You give your love. You expect nothing in return. Simply to give is your joy. Your love.’Following the story, Yugo Limbo includes a short segment on people feeling a sense of love for an object, such as their own experience as a 10 year old for Miro’s Chicago, the statue right across from the Daley Center in Chicago. There are stories of love for a VW bus, a VCR, an abandoned building, and an art exhibit ‘Love Beyond Expression’ that dealt with this subject. [image]Short but fairly sweet in its unconventionality. It was interesting to see this take on things, especially as it is quite different than any other versions of Pygmalion. This also made me want to check out Yugo Limbo’s much longer work, Be Kind, My Neighbor, which sounds quite unique as well. A surprising little gem.

Today for National Library Week, the American Library Association released their annual State It is Right to Read Day and I have a few things to say. Today for National Library Week, the American Library Association released their annual State of the Library Report which details a rather alarming growth in attempts to infringe intellectual freedoms and speech or harm public institutions. The new data shows an alarming 65% surge from the previous year for a total of 1, 247 demands to remove 4,240 unique titles among other library services. This represents a 92% increase in titles challenged in public libraries while schools saw an 11% increase. For context, the previous year’s data revealed 700 attempts to ban 1,915 titles.  [image] And these are just the challanges we know about as  an estimated 82-97% of challanges go unreported. So we are seeing continued surges in these challenges and bans (PEN America compiles an index of them all here), as well as an increase in harassment and threats of violence against public educators and library staff. And while 69% of people oppose book bans by government officials and 65% by school or library boards, the problem continues to increase with more than 150 bills in 35 states to restrict access to books and punish library workers. The top most banned and challenged books of the year have also been released. First, for the sake of clarity, it should be remembered that a challange is an attempt to remove or restrict public access to materials, a ban is the actual forced removal. Even if a book is not removed, challenges tend to be a large waste of time and public money. These were the 10 most banned and challenged books in the US in 2023:1.Gender Queer by Maia Kobabe2.All Boys Aren’t Blue by George M. Johnson3.This Book Is Gay by Juno Dawson4.The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky5.Flamer by Mike Curato6.The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison7.Me and Earl and the Dying Girl by Jesse Andrews8.Tricks by Ellen Hopkins9.Let's Talk About It: The Teen's Guide to Sex, Relationships, and Being a Human by Erika Moen & Matthew Nolan10.Sold by Patricia McCormick*All these statistics come from public institutions but be aware that in the US the largest book bans actually occur in prisons, which is not often discussed.*It is important to keep in mind the Library Bill of Rights (read it HERE) and that sweeping bans violate the rights of patrons and intellectual freedoms. Such as Item 1:Books and other library resources should be provided for the interest, information, and enlightenment of all people of the community the library serves. Materials should not be excluded because of the origin, background, or views of those contributing to their creation.Also the third point: Libraries should challenge censorship in the fulfillment of their responsibility to provide information and enlightenment.In the interest of the public, libraries should always be looking for ways to remove barriers to access. Arguments such as ""not with my tax dollars"" fall apart quickly as the patrons who do want access to books being challenged are also paying taxes. Right to read should be protected for all, as Judge Arthur Brooks wrote in the case Fayetteville Public Library et al v. Crawford County, Arkansas: '“[T]he public library is not to be mistaken for simply an arm of the state. By virtue of its mission to provide the citizenry with access to a wide array of information, viewpoints, and content, the public library is decidedly not the state’s creature; it is the people’s. It is the purpose of the First Amendment to preserve an uninhibited marketplace of ideas in which truth will ultimately prevail.... It is the right of the public to receive suitable access to social, political, esthetic, moral, and other ideas and experiences which is crucial here.'discomfort of one individual (which is often more posturing than anything) does not validate the denial off intellectual freedoms for the entirety of a community. Especially considering the majority of challenges are made by those not even in the library district in which they are issuing the challenge. The majority of these challenges come from a small number of people—in 2002 just 11 people were behind 60% of all bans—andgroups like Moms for Liberty, Citizens Defending Freedom and Parents' Rights in Education have been rallying people as book ban hobbyists in order to relentlessly attack despite having little to no substance behind their complaints. Mom’s For Liberty, who have been linked to issues of harassment and violence, are associated with many white supremacist and other extremist groups, and have been designated as a hate organization, tend to throw a lot into the media without context or via willful ignorance to inflate the appearance of issues or generate clicks. For instance, a recent claim of censorship when a library denied a purchase request for a book was made without the context that it was Amazon kindle exclusive meaning physical copies don’t exist and Kindle does not sell libraries ebook rights. Similarly, many of the bills are unenforceable and show no understanding on how library collection development or checkouts actually operate, it is primarily grandstanding with public tax dollars in hopes of dissuading people from working in libraries. There has been a large focus to demonize the ALA in general, such as the current bill in Louisiana, HB 777, that criminalizes library staff for any interaction with the ALA with the rather eye rolling and cartoonish sentence of “two years hard labor”. So many anti-library takes are aimed at people with no working knowledge of library operations written by people of the same that never seem to try to research it because thinking the ALA is a nation-wide marxist conspiracy theory is also hysterical when we can’t even get a regional library collective to all put barcodes in the same place. A larger issue, however, is the idea that concepts such as information literacy are a conspiracy form of control and not simply a way to recognize bias and better process information. Language is inherently political and biased, being able to productively navigate language and propaganda is key for societal health.  [image]The messaging being used by those attempting to restrict access is largely disingenuous as well, with the idea of “protecting children” being pushed despite most challenges occurring in public libraries and over books that are shelved in the adult services section. Last week my own library was visited by someone who falsely identified themselves as a member of the press and insisting they were checking to “uphold the first amendment” by demanding they can film in the library (they can but cannot film children, which they did anyways) but then posted highly edited videos making the case that books should be banned from the library. Which is a rather conflicting set of values when desiring government to ban books and restrict speech is the goal of someone claiming to uphold the Freedom of Speech.  [image]The fake reporter was actually the son of the founder of Ottawa Impact who have made national news for their efforts to eliminate local health departments and defund public schools (you can read about them here), and the book in question in the video is, of course, Gender Queer, which is part of the adult catalog not the children’s catalog as he claims.  Yes this is all anecdotal but it brings me to a major issue: there is no logic or even a system of beliefs. These people will say anything, contradict anything, they only care about accessing power. Arguing over semantics or pointing out inconsistencies will not help, they simply don’t care and getting people worked up on issues like that is half the goal. It distracts from doing actual work. This is part of a larger issue with social media ""meme activism"" that betrays a lack of seriousness through sensationalism, always on the attack without a coherent platform of opinions. This was recently writ large when the influencer behind LibsofTikTok was unable to produce any answers to her opinions when questioned in an interview, resorting to reversals or distractions instead. What was once a culture war has now become shallow marketing, such as a long-shot Missouri GOP candidate burning books with a flamethrower as part of a donation ad. It is all merely outrage marketing for attention, the issues are interchangeable. So What Can You Do?Access is key. When removing a book you are restricting access. The irony that people saying they don’t want their taxes going to a book on the shelf is that they already did and removing it is costing more and also now whenever someone wants a copy of that book they are pushing the work off onto another library to retrieve it and send it, while still having their local library perform the labor of placing it on a hold shelf. While well-intentioned people come up with ideas of donating books or making banned books little libraries, this is actually not that helpful. The point is unrestricted access for ALL, not just those in your neighborhood, and collection development teams are already overworked trying to get books on the shelves. Donated books rarely make it to the shelf anyways. If you want to help, take the money you would have used buying a stack of banned books to donate and send it to groups fighting against book challenges such as PEN America or Bookstoprisoners.net that help get books to those in the most restricted places: prisons. But returning to access, part of the larger goal of dissolving public institutions is to replace them with similar privatized versions that can and certainly will restrict access at will, picking and choosing who gets education, books they want, etc. and almost certainly spending a lot of effort on gatekeeping. A cursory glance at history will tell you all you need to know about who gets in and who doesn’t. Moms for Liberty have denied that book bans are real because you can still buy the book and even notable authors such as Stephen King have made statements about “just go buy the book and read it,” which is really unhelpful because by that logic information access having a price barrier is normalized, which goes against the entire point of public services.What else can you do? Well, a lot. First, pay attention to local elections and vote for people who don’t have a goal to defund public libraries or schools. Show up to board meetings and defend intellectual freedom, these are rarely well attended and just a small vocal minority can do a lot of damage when unopposed. Write to your local paper about the importance of intellectual freedom. Most importantly, use and support your local library. The most commonly banned books are those from queer or authors of color, so request those books at your library to show there is a need in the community or donate time and money to help. Review and recommend banned books on social media, like this very website here. Books are for everyone, and a small group of people should not be removing access to books from people who need them. If you don’t like a book, don’t check it out, but don’t stop others from doing so.Thank you for your time....more",Notes are private!,8,71,1,not set,not set,"Apr 08, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60694649-read-these-banned-books

Lines burst out from unexpected angles of emotional insight, language becomes malleable and adapts surprising shapes, a poem arrives at an unforeseen destination, and the astonishing resonance from a pairing of words can leave you staggering in beauty. I also find with poetry a uniqueness that you can never tell what will be your favorite poems until far later. A poem may strike you deeply in the moment but I’m often surprised to see which ones linger long in the heart, which ones you turn to in times of need, which grow roots into your soul so that their lines become aphorisms that alway appear in the mind like a mantra or a prayer. Ocean Vuong’s debut collection, Night Sky With Exit Wounds is a volume of poetry that has remained deeply nestled in my heart and one I frequently return to. Accessible and highly quotable without sacrificing depth, the poems in this collection have a lasting power as Vuong crafts words like ancient gods of old crafting the cosmos. These poems are ablaze in emotion as Vuong’s luminous language and imagery shine on themes of desire, family, violence, self-acceptance among others in this impressive debut that may not be without its faults but, nearly a decade later, it certainly deserves to stand tall in the hallowed history of poetry.Dear God, if you are a season, let it be the one I passed throughto get here.Here. That's all I wanted to be.This is such a crisp yet bountiful collection of poetry that showcases the magnificent possibilities of language to access and honor the past or oneself, and cast words into the hearts of others to share the beauty of existence and the emotions we pass through. This is such a highly quotable collection with imagery that really bursts with vivid, poetic intensity. Take the snow in Devotion for instance:Fresh snowcrackling on the window,each flake a letterfrom an alphabetI've shut out for good.Ideas of language are omnipresent in these poems. Vuong, who was born in Saigon and moved to the US, credits literature for his learning to speak and read, often referencing the works of poet Frank O'Hara as a teacher of sorts. He has a lovely and inimitable style. As Daniel Wegner wrote in a profile on Vuong for the New Yorker:‘His lines are both long and short, his pose narrative and lyric, his diction formal and insouciant. From the outside, Vuong has fashioned a poetry of inclusion.’One of my favorites in the collection is indebted to O’Hara, with “after Frank O’Hara” credited after the title. Many of my favorite lines come from this poem, many I quote often and are never far from my mind. So here it is in it’s entirely:Someday I’ll Love Ocean VuongOcean, don’t be afraid.The end of the road is so far aheadit is already behind us.Don’t worry. Your father is only your fatheruntil one of you forgets. Like how the spinewon’t remember its wingsno matter how many times our kneeskiss the pavement. Ocean,are you listening? The most beautiful partof your body is whereveryour mother's shadow falls.Here's the house with childhoodwhittled down to a single red trip wire.Don't worry. Just call it horizon& you'll never reach it.Here's today. Jump. I promise it's nota lifeboat. Here's the manwhose arms are wide enough to gatheryour leaving. & here the moment,just after the lights go out, when you can still seethe faint torch between his legs.How you use it again & againto find your own hands.You asked for a second chance& are given a mouth to empty out of.Don't be afraid, the gunfireis only the sound of peopletrying to live a little longer& failing. Ocean. Ocean —get up. The most beautiful part of your bodyis where it's headed. & remember,loneliness is still time spentwith the world. Here'sthe room with everyone in it.Your dead friends passingthrough you like windthrough a wind chime. Here's a deskwith the gimp leg & a brickto make it last. Yes, here's a roomso warm & blood-close,I swear, you will wake —& mistake these wallsfor skin.This is such a marvelous collection and I love it so much. There are such great lines about desire such as ‘Don’t we touch each other just to prove we are still here? Queer love rings out so proudly yet aware of the dangers of being out and open in a culture that is less than welcoming and violence and desire often come paired in the imagery. There is a glorious transcendence of emotion in these poems that often borders on the epic—many poem titles channel greek mythology to further this effect—and one cannot help but be overtaken by the imagery.O minute hand, teach mehow to hold a man the way thirstholds water. Let every river envyour mouths. Let every kiss hit the bodylike a season.(from A little closer to the edge)Violence is never far from this collection. There are reflections of war that tore apart his family back home and also the violence from an abusive father. His parents find their ways into many of these poems, and once again we often see how expressions of love come hand in hand with images of violence such as in A Little Closer to the Edge:Young enough to believe nothingwill change them, they step, hand in hand,into the bomb crater.Family is very central in this collection as well as his larger reach of work across now two volumes of poetry and one novel, On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous, a fantastic and poetic book that focuses primarily on his mother. The title for the novel is taken from a poem in this collection, another favorite of mine, that contains such startling lines like:‘Tell me it was for the hunger& nothing less. For hunger is to givethe body what it knowsIt cannot keep.’Ocean Vuong’s Night Sky With Exit Wounds is a marvelous debut and a collection of poems that has certainly stuck with me. There are lines here that are always at hand in my mind. I always know I like a poem when I feel compelled to do a painting with it:  [image][Image: poem with lines from Into the Breach]     I want to leave     no one behindto keep& be kept     the way a field     turns its secretsinto peonies     the way light     keeps its shadowby swallowing itSo do yourself a favor and check out Night Sky With Exit Wounds. It is a lovely collection and began an already impressive career from Ocean Vuong. It is also probably my favorite of all his works.

At least when you work for a crime syndicate such as in Lee Mandelo’s The Finite Canvas, a shocking sci-fi story of where both revenge and paying tribute to the dead involve a lot of bloodshed. With incredibly expansive world building for such a small package and an excellent framing of stories within stories, The Finite Canvas come roaring off the page with zero chill–except for the ones it’ll make you feel at the end. Bold, surprisingly heartfelt and delightfully queer, this is quite the entertaining tale full of tension and twists where desperate people must make brash choices and hope to still be standing when the gunfire clears.‘It was ugly and it hurt, so I stopped feeling it, and started hunting.’This was my first introduction to Lee Mandelo, of whom I’ve heard high praise for their abilities to create amazing worlds and action that center queer characters under the umbrella of speculative fiction. This story is tough as nails and hits with fury. I’ll admit I was initially apprehensive when the first sentence read a tad overwritten but it really drops into the tangled and layered narrative and makes for a fun, one sitting read. I love the framing. Jada gets a doctor, who seems stuck on a mostly-destroyed earth for unpleasant reasons, to add another scar to her body in tribute to her latest murder. Over the several days of taking scalpel to skin, Jada tells doctor Molly the story of how she came to kill someone close to her and the narrative moved between the tension of Jada’s story and Molly’s present and how she will handle the information she is receiving. It’s very cloak and dagger with death always ready to strike.‘Being lovers doesn’t mean you know each other. Nobody ever really knows anybody; you just think you do.’This is a quick but well constructed burst of sci-fi that has quite a wealth of depth to it. The Finite Canvas was a gritty but great little read and I can’t wait to check out more of Lee Mandelo’s work.⅘‘I was wrong. I was big, bad wrong.

That’s right, The Love that Split the World is the first novel by Emily Henry from back when she wrote YAs and it is a fun debut. Being told ‘there’s nothing scarier than loving someone’ in a book where a rift in reality opens up a parallel universe that sends our protagonist time-traveling makes love sounds pretty damn scary, but in this aptly titled novel love not only splits but also heals. This is a heartwarming story on family and the power of love and being loved that tries to pack a lot into the story and mostly pulls it off. Indigenous histories and myths weave into the present as Natalie, sent by “Grandmother” who’s unexplained appearance at night makes her and the reader question if this is a supernatural or psychological journey, must team up insta-love companion Beau to solve the mysteries of the past before time runs out. An ambitious debut that feels very indicative of the time it was written but manages to stick the landing, The Love That Split the World is cute and ponderous enough to overcome its own shortcomings.‘Every moment you live, every darkness you face, they’ll all feel worth it when you’re staring light in the face.’An aspect of Emily Henry's writing that I feel has been a constant thread through her works is how connected to a sense of place they are. I don't just bring this up because I enjoy that, having went to college in my town, she tends to include the vibes of Holland in a lot of her novels (Beach Read shouts out to our downtown donut shop, for instance). Place is very important to Henry and she has discussed in interiews how she feels place influences the people who are there. 'I want my characters to feel like they grew up in the place where [my books are] set,' she says. Henry spent her childhood in Kentucky and Natalie's sense of place in Kentucky really informs the story beyond her emotions about soon leaving it behind to go to college just like Henry herself experienced. It is also integrated in the magic and slow, steady pace of the story: 'I think that with setting, when I really have a deep love for a place, it’s so easy for me to imagine the magic of that specific place. Kentucky is very humid and it gets very hot in the summer and everything is very lush and sticky. I think the magic in a place like that is going to be a slower magic, a warm, sensuous dripping thing, and I think with time travel it works so perfectly. When you’re in a small humid town like that, you feel like time is moving differently and it really is moving differently than different places.'This comes across quite effectively in the book, and I really enjoyed how in her later YA novel, A Million Junes, she captures the feeling of West Michigan so well too because ' I do think that June is Michigan as a person.' She even set out to write a novel for all the places she had lived and I think that nostalgia and love for location really helps give a lovely texture to her stories.I enjoyed how much Emily Henry’s YAs tend to dive into a lot of social issues around race and racism—the legacy of racial violence sparks the paranormal aspects of A Million Junes—with The Love That Split the World having big discussions on indigenous cultural heritage and stories as well as a look at issues surrounding adoption. This latter aspect touched off a bit of a twitter discussion at the time of publication (you can read about that here) and reading this I couldn’t help but notice how the book seemed very indicative of its time as a moment in the maturation of this type of discourse. Stories often serve as cultural artifacts that give a unique vantage point into a period of time, which isn’t to say that The Love That Split the World has aged poorly but just that it is a fascinating look at what publishing in 2016 look like. It feels very much of the era when paranormal romance was the Big Thing in teen publishing (when I worked at a Barnes and Noble Paranormal Romance was its own section, curious if that will come back with the success of books like Hazelwood’s Bride) because this fun blend of time-travel, parallel worlds and other elements of magical realism along with the large romance plot felt natural under that umbrella term. It is very different than the current “romantacy” label which already has authors offering critiques that the umbrella term can be harmful as a marketing term because fans of Fantasy or fans of Romance have very different genre expectations or that it seems like a diminutive label mostly applied to works from women as if they aren’t “serious fantasy”. Personally I don’t find having labels with strict genre guidelines to be very helpful aside from making library book lists and see it mostly as product marketing terms that center the commodity aspect of a book.Which brings me back to the first point because this book coming out in 2016 probably felt a lot more progressive at the time than it does now. It is cool to see indigenous histories centered in a book, but then its a reminder this came out before the big discourse on who can profit off of who’s stories (we all remember American Dirt and the largely unfulfilled promises of major publishers to be more inclusive) and the #OwnVoices movement that was later criticized for forced-outing authors like Becky Albertalli or making authors feel they had to prove their own identities as marketing pitches. This was a major theme in the novel Yellowface where author Kuang makes the argument that for-profit publishing turns identity into a product and largely leads to tokenism and forcing authors of color into genre boxes instead of being true inclusivity. During a recent talk when an audience member admitted they are stressed their own stories “aren’t queer enough,” Kuang said “there’s no such thing as ‘not queer enough’ because your sexuality isn’t a capitalist commodity driven by scarcity and people who gatekeep that are making identity a marketing pitch not an authentic self.” To be clear, this isn’t a criticism of this book at all. more the train of thought I had reading it as I found it interesting to be able to see the way ideas are discussed in novels and how they can be indicative of a certain moment along the growth of discourse around social issues.‘Sometimes the most beautiful moments in our lives are things that hurt badly at the time. We only see them for what they really were when we stand at the very end and look back.’But on to the book. It’s really cute though the romance aspect relies on insta-love that grafts deep emotions onto thin air and relies on it to propel the story. How you choose to process or trust the romance will likely make or break this book for readers, though personally I enjoyed being pulled along with it. Beau is kind of bland as a character so the fact that he is hot and has massive biceps and ‘a mouth that somehow manages to look like a shy kid’s one minute and a virile Greek god’s the next,’ does a lot of heavy lifting in making you believe he’s a romantic interest. Though as someone that values being able to have chunks of solitude lines like ‘being with him feels like a better version of being alone,’ made me think “yea, sure, he seems cool.” What helps is that Natalie is an extremely likable and well-done character. She’s quick, she’s snarky, but she also has a big heart and open mind. There are a lot of strong friendships between women who support each other (Natalie being very supportive of her ex’s girlfriend was rather charming despite him being a bit cartoonishly shitty) and the writing really pulls you along. For a debut, Henry rocks some great lines and solid narrative. Its no surprise she would go on to become a Big Deal. I’m happy for her.‘No story is truer than any other story that has the truth in its heart.’I did really enjoy how much indigenous myths are central to this book and I thought Henry did a wonderful job balancing the question if the happenings were paranormal or psychological. I like the stories told and how it shows that life and culture are made up of stories and bind us all together.‘The thing threaded through all the world and refusing to be reduced to a name or a set of rules and instead winding itself through millions of stories, true and made up, connecting all breathing things.’It does get very “lets explain the Myers-Briggs” at one point that made me chuckle because Henry had just graduated college and being very “lets talk about the Myers-Briggs” was HUGE in all my classes at the very same time (INFP by the way) and just something people around Holland, MI loved to talk about (she attended Hope College here in Holland, for the record and I could feel it in every page of this book, but in a cool way). It does get fairly dependent on the plot going through an elaborate series of twists like a high-thrill roller coaster, but she pulls them off effectively and it makes for a fun read.‘No story is truer than any other story that has the truth in its heart.’Emily Henry has had an impressive career and The Love That Split the World is a lovely debut that kicked it all off. It is interesting to see how much her stories have shifted as she shaped her style so its fun to see the early days. A lovely little story full of a lot of heart that, while imperfect, still manages to be a success.3.5/5‘the world's going to keep right on being terrible and beautiful all at once’...more",Notes are private!,16,109,1,not set,not set,"Apr 06, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/25467698-the-love-that-split-the-world

CChange is hard and the transition from into teenage years are a whirlwind of new emotions and experiences as childhood begins to fade into the past. Cross My Heart and Never Lie from Norwegian author and artist Nora Dåsnes gorgeously captures the highs and lows of this period of metamorphosis through the diaries of 12 year old Tuva as she enters 7th grade. Winner of the 2024 ALA Stonewall Book Award and translate into English by Matt Bagguley, this YA graphic novel is as beautifully told as it is illustrated, with colors that really pop in a loose but playful style that manages to convey incredible amounts of emotions through the color choices and faces. It is a story about how ‘its always hard being in between’ as certain friends have moved into dating and away from childhood games while others have no interest in the games of teenage romance and Tuva feels pulled between friends. This coming-of-age story layers on complex emotions on complex emotions, especially when Tuva discovers she has feelings for the new girl in her school. Brilliantly told through a diary style that captures a whirlwind of feelings and gorgeously illustrated, Cross My Heart and Never Lie is a truly moving and lovely book.  [image]I once worked with someone who was a retired Middle School guidance counselor. We all said how difficult that age must be. I mean, I was probably a nightmare and its such a confusing and chaotic age being pulled by different emotions and friends groups as you feel no stability over yourself while trying to figure out just who you are. He admitted it was a challenging age but also an important time to find ways to reach out to kids on an individual level. The real challange, he said, was that half the 8th graders are starting to explore sexuality while the other half are still playing with childhood toys. Dåsnes truly harnesses that dichotomy here as Tuva is caught between a friend abandoning their usual games to see her boyfriend while the other find the idea of dating stupid. And then there is Tuva confused if she should admit she also has a crush and further flustered as she begins to discover she is queer. The whole thing is brought to life in artwork that really shines:  [image]I mean look at this! The colors are amazing, its bold and beautiful. And she is able to capture sadness so eloquently through her art as well:  [image]This is a big book with a lot of heart. The diary style works marvelously, capturing pre-teen emotions and voice quite well and showing that delicate balance between wanting to act adult and still finding joy and comfort in more “childish” things. The relationship with her single-father is also an endearing aspect of the novel, particularly his acceptance when she comes out and the way he keeps things lighthearted while also being someone she can rely on and get advice from. It’s beautiful, I got teary a few times. This book covers a lot of emotional ground and does an excellent job of looking at how scary it can be to develop romantic feelings and the confusion over discovering your own sexuality. But most importantly, this book is empowering and delightful.  [image]‘Acting like a teenager feels awkward,’ Tuva says, and Cross My Heart and Never Lie is an extraordinary YA graphic novel that captures this feeling perfectly. Well paced, full of dynamic characters and emotions, this is a wonderful coming-of-age story that rings true. It’s also a joy to look at. What a great book.5/5  [image]...more",Notes are private!,10,83,1,not set,not set,"Apr 04, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/125080438-cross-my-heart-and-never-lie

I love a novel that spirals in on its own intensity and insights, that’s my happy zone of books even if there is nary a plot to be found. French author Maud Ventura’s debut, My Husband, is an unnerving psychological whirlwind of overthinking, manipulation and dark comedy that examines a woman’s obsession with her husband over the course of a week and it is such a gripping cacophony of chaos. I loved this so much and found myself fixated on this novel as much as she was on the minute details of her interpersonal interactions. A translator and high school literature teacher by day, the narrator’s acutely insightful mind latches onto every minute detail and assesses them the way one would a novel with Ventura brilliantly capturing the ways anxious overanalysis can culminate towards catastrophizing and reckless behavior. As the distress rises towards a fever pitch and all the screws begin to rattle loose, what is revealed are the harsh reactions to a patriarchal society and the tensions between conformity or resistance in a mental chess match to assert control. The prose, wonderfully translate by Emma Ramadan, really helps keeps the intensity going and this book just pulls you along. A disquieting and intensely introspective examination of marriage, manipulation or the fragile and faulty sense of self when constructing oneself for the gaze of others, My Husband is a dark delight that crackles with social criticisms and suspense and builds towards an impressive surprise punch of an ending.‘When it comes to love, I’ve learned nothing: I love too intensely and I’m consumed by my own love (analysis, jealousy, doubt)—so much that when I’m in love, I always end up slightly extinguished and saddened. When I love, I become harsh, serious, intolerant. A heavy shadow settles over my relationships. I love and want to be loved with so much gravitas that it quickly becomes exhausting (for me, for the other person). It’s always an unhealthy kind of love.’This book is wild, yet it remains playfully ponderous and engaging as the narrator’s mental state swirls like a stormcloud. It’s an addictive book that captures the idea of an addictive and overthinking personality and couldn’t stop thinking about it, and I’d like to extend a massive thank you to Luh for recommending this and discussing it with me for days. I even bought clementines because of the incredible scene where, in a party game where they are all assigned different fruits, she is utterly appalled that her husband picks a clementine for her and a pineapple for his friend’s wife. ‘he associates his best friend’s wife with a summery, exotic fruit, acidic and ample…he married a clementine. He lives with a winter fruit, a banal and cheap fruit, a supermarket fruit. A small, ordinary fruit that has none of the indulgence of the orange nor the originality of the grapefruit. A fruit organized into segments, practical and easy to eat, precut, ready for use, proffered in its casing.’This segment is indicative of the spiraling, anxious thoughts she has and how outraged she can become over perceived insults. She does not let the clementine slight go and I giggled every time it came back up. The novel does well to draw the reader into seeing the narrator as unhinged though will ultimately ask big questions on why this is our perception.‘I don’t have to tell him everything: the couples that last are the ones that keep the mystery alive.’ ‘I was very much in love with my boyfriend. So I kept wondering, why am I so passionate, so very intense?’ Ventura admits in an interview with The Bookseller on her inspirations for the story, ‘I was very sad too because a honeymoon phase doesn’t last. But that kind of intense love changes over time and I wanted to explore that in fiction. Can it ever last? But then I thought: ‘Would it be worse if it didn’t go away?’’ Ventura captures the feeling of overwhelming emotional intensity, showing a woman who—despite 15 years of marriage—is still caught in the uncertainty and insecurity of the crush stage and will do anything to keep that intensity alive. Her actions are all highly calculated and manipulative, secretly recording conversations to analyze them later, keeping a notebook of observations and a double-entry of perceived slights from her husband and the punishments she’ll dole out to balance it out. Her punishments and then grief are discussed in her feeling of affininity with Phaedra of Greek Mythology.‘No one can see my neuroses except me. The way I see myself is not how other people see me. Everything is okay. I belong here.’Control is a major part of this story and our only perspective on the events are from the rather claustrophobic vantage points of the narrator’s disquieted inner monologue ‘which center on my husband to a worrying degree—it’s difficult to quantify, but I’d say approximately 65 percent.’ She lives her life trying to present a calm and collected exterior to hide the maelstrom of emotions inside her and this lends itself to every aspect of her life being highly calculated and organzied, even assigning different colors to each day of the week in a rather self-fulfilling prophecy on how that day will play out. This works well into the narrative tension: ‘the white of Sunday is not as simple as it seems. Optics teaches us that white is the result of a combination of every color (and not the absence of color, as I once thought). It’s not the purity of the bride or the emptiness of the blank page: Sunday is neither neutral nor naive. White is the synthesis of every color, just as Sunday is the synthesis of every day of the week. It’s the final result, the last chapter, the solution.’What we see, however, is a sense of identity that is merely self-mythologizing in order to feel control over her own interiority. We are aware, however, that this is likely incongruous with the self as seen by others. It is reminiscent of ‘being a sovereign and unique subject amidst a universe of objects,’ while also ‘an object for others…nothing more than an individual in the collectivity on which [she] depends,’ as Simone de Beauvoir discusses in The Ethics of Ambiguity. Ventura excels at having the narrator manipulating the reader and keeping us on a very short leash to guide us through her week only as she wishes us to see it. ‘Their grammar is inclusive: if one of the two of them is the main character of the story, the other is never erased because of it—the other’s point of view is always included in the narrative.’An aspect that really had this book sink under my skin was how the narrative follows through rather quotidian life but incisively analyzed down to the detail with her picking apart even the most mundane events as if it were a novel to be decoded. ‘He says “I,” referring only to himself, and it embarrasses me,’ she observes at a party, ‘I’ve analyzed enough literary texts in my life to know that it’s not innocuous.’ She also interprets her life in context to the books she reads, with The Lover by Marguerite Duras adding texture to her thoughts, such as fixating on the line ‘I’ve never done anything but wait outside the closed door’ as a premonition of her future married life where she feels ‘like furniture’ always awaiting her husband. The aspects of her job as translation are quite interesting as well, with her obsession over words and how the language we use might inform our thinking and expressions of love/ ‘Absorbed in my translation, I wonder if that expression, so difficult to translate into French, testifies to the fact that English-speakers love differently than us. Do they make more effort? For them, is it possible to make love last? To reignite a desire that’s been extinguished? How do they do it? ’ When translating from an English novel it distresses her that their expressions could corrupt her marriage. ‘Will “let you go” one day seep into my marriage?’ she stresses, ‘how can we protect ourselves from this English blight?’ In terms of language too, its poignant that her husband is never named, ‘My husband has no name; he is my husband, he belongs to me,’ she quips which is part of a larger subversive attitude towards gendered objectification where her husband is more an object for her to control through her manipulations. The idea of him existing outside her gaze—or before she knew him—‘ is surreal, even revolting.’ Its why his acting out of character, at least how she expects, triggers a panic in her. Her husband orders lasagna when he never does, her husband has a work nickname not belonging to her, or even her husband being overly friendly with a waitress are all cause for alarm to her. The latter especially as the waitress seems inferior to the abilities she has cultivated: ‘There’s an English expression for this: wife material.’‘I read somewhere that there are three kinds of women: the woman in love, the mistress, and the mother. That seems right to me. I spent my childhood and adolescence being the woman in love…when I had children, I never moved to the next stage. I never changed categories to become a mother.’At the heart of the story is a rather blistering critique on gender normative roles under patriarchy and how she feels constricted by them. She purchases a book of etiquette to ‘learn all of these rules by heart’ in order to present as proper “ladylike” by standards of society, she obsesses over her appearance to satisfy the male gaze, but she also resents a lot of the expectations. She observes that husbands get to be the “fun” parent while she deals in the mundane and labor aspects, or that questions about the family and kids are always addressed to her instead of the husband. In her belief that there are three types of women–those in love, the mistress or the mother–she finds only love to be a worthy role. Which has lead her to resent her children because ‘most of the time I’m too busy being in love to be a good mother’ and controlling the intensity of her marriage occupies all her thoughts and is never enough.‘In reality, marriage didn’t calm me down. I realized at the very moment we said “I do” that my husband could still divorce me…I was constantly awaiting the next step. I discovered a world of proofs of love, with commitment everywhere and love nowhere. And fifteen years after our first date, I still sleep just as poorly.’As Glennon Doyle once wrote, ‘a very effective way to control women is to convince women to control themselves,’ and we see how the narrator has fallen under this sort of control and self-sabotage by putting her entire identity into the intensity of her marriage. As Ventura discusses ‘what she has done in living for her man is making her miserable.’ It is a false self entirely constructed in the reflection of a man. ‘So with these two opposites—independent or dependent characters—you end with the same point: women should live for themselves.’ Otherwise we see her controting her own logic to justify anything and, without spoiling anything, there are some shocking revelations that are rather humorously rationalized.The book ends on a real knockout moment that perfectly encapsulates Ventura’s messages and themes. My Husband rides a frenetic energy that spirals on its own anxieties and builds towards a nearly maddening tension. Though we also much wonder who is the truly unhinged person here, the narrator or the society that imposes the stresses that lead her to believe her actions are justified in order to perform her role for the sake of society and love. A twisted but darkly comic novel and one where I found myself just as obsessed with reading it as the narrator’s obsession with her husband, My Husband is a startling and satisfying little book. 4.5/5...more",Notes are private!,50,258,1,not set,not set,"Apr 04, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/63017297-my-husband

Such is the case of the titular lovers in Isabel Allende’s Lovers at the Museum who defy both legal and logical laws in their amorous adventures around the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain. Pitting pragmatism against passion, Allende examines art and romance as the bits of magic and wonder left alive in a harsh world of volatile politics and scandals. As a lover or love, a lover of art and especially a lover of art museums, I found this to be a delightful little short story that is a bit slight but still rather sweet, surreal and satisfying. There is a rather alluring charm to the idea of a magical museum that opens its heart to those caught in a maelstrom of passion. The story focuses on the investigation of the two, dubbed the “Bewitched Lovers,” after they are found wrapped up together—she in a tattered wedding dress and he fully nude—on the floor of the museum as if they were an installation piece on the topic of sudden and overpowering ‘carnal love.’ Their presence eludes logic, having confronted no guards, set off no alarms and appearing on no cameras despite confessing to a series of sexual escapades around the museum. But was it truly the museum or an alternate space in the fabric of time, ‘some fantastical palace.’ Or was everyone too focused on the latest scandal—we are told a scandal involving the Pope has gripped the world—and too wrapped up in politics and sensationalism to notice the magic working right under their noses? I enjoy how their story even takes on political connotations in the newspaper.'But in this case it was the vice of love, easy enough to forgive.'Short, sweet and full of Isabel Allende’s direct but lovely writing, Lovers at the Museum is a nice little piece that reminds us that art is still a space for magic in the world. It is charming how it chucks aside social conventions, such as her being a runaway bride fleeing expectations, and emboldens the whimsicality of impulsivity in the face of desire. And while I gather the attempt to write a moment of swift and potent romance, it felt like there's some murky question around consent that didn't sit quite right. It felt a bit uncool that the runaway bride was quite drunk and in a state of grief while he admits he had not drank at all, giving an impression he may have taken advantage of her. While the story is nothing overly fantastic, its embracing of the fantastical is worth the quick trip into this story.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,12,109,1,not set,not set,"Apr 03, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/204820050-lovers-at-the-museum

The artwork is supremely serene and reminds me a bit of Studio Ghibli and I love how each house is examined through small blurbs about various details that culminate as if to point the way towards a whimsical story just out of reach for your imagination to construct. For instance:‘One day after a storm, the lighthouse keeper picks up a stick of driftwood. The flotsam is about as large as a human femur and glows with a pale light when a storm is approach-ing. The lighthouse keeper, drawn by curiosity, observes the branch during a storm. As though in response to the branch, a faint voice from the lighthouse's cellar stirs memories from two decades ago that the keeper had forgotten…’What does the solitary lighthouse keeper remember? Who is the mysterious knight in oversized armor in the guard tower? Can we climb into the Dreamer’s treehouse and paint with her?

There’s nothing that warms my heart more than artists of any kind encouraging everyday people to interact with art and encourage them to attempt their own, and I really enjoyed seeing Fasano share all the poems people sent him based on a prompt he created for a school visit he did to teach 2nd graders ‘about the craft and magic of poetry.’ You can try it for yourself:Self PoemMy name is (name).Today I feel like a/an (adjective) (noun)(verb)ing in the (noun).Sometimes I am a/an (noun).Sometimes I am a an (noun).But always I am (adjective).I ask the world, ""(question)?""And the answer isa/an (repeat your words from line 2).Interspersed with short inspirational one-liners on the power of the imagination and filled with fantastic examples of completed prompts from people across any age, these prompts have just as much value for their fun as they do educational value. I really enjoy all his brief descriptions of each poetry prompt, which often incorporates quotes from writers and poets to help spark inspiration and to think deeper about the themes. There are poem prompts for a really wonderful variety of topics, both happy and sad but I really appreciate how much ideas of self-acceptance and self-empowerment take a focus in this book.SELF-ACCEPTANCE POEM PROMPTThe (animal) cannot help being (adjective).The (plant) cannot help being (adjective).The (celestial body) cannot help being (adjective).And I cannot help being (your name).Even in my sleep, I dream of (something you like).Even in my sadness, I love my (noun).I swim in the rivers of my (emotion).I climb through the mountains of my (emotion).I travel for years and years.And on the other side is (your name), beautiful (your name), his/her/their (adjective) (noun) (verb)ing in the (noun).

The Deep Dark plunges readers in the California desert where a dark secret keeps Mags detached from a social life and pulls her childhood friend, Nessa, back to the hometown bothered by what is either a childhood fever dream or a horrific memory stained in blood. Aging the characters up from her typical coming-of-age tales, Ostertag takes on grittier subject matter in a story that is still very much about accepting and embracing one’s true self amidst the many monster the world may throw at us. The Deep Dark is a deeply moving and haunting look at the crushing weight of duty and secrets, generational trauma, identity, comings out and tension between friendship and love.  [image]As always, Molly Knox Ostertag delivers eye-popping art that conveys an incredible sense of emotion and place. While the full graphic novel will be in color, this ARC was most black and white but even without color it completely engulfed me in its dynamic beauty. The vastness loneliness of the desert creeps in through the pages and the characters feel alive. There’s some cool experimental stuff like inclusion of actual photographs and a really intense scene that conveys a fascinating duality of how the character is reacting in reality and how it is coming across in their own head that I just want to stand up and applaud for.The story follows Mags, a queer young woman struggling with a dark family legacy as well as the sole care for her dying grandmother, and Nessa, a trans woman who has returned to seek out Mags. Accompanied with her pinhole camera, she hopes to create art with an imperfect medium to capture imperfect memories, though as the two begin to stroll down memory lane the darkness of the past begins to overtake them. This is a story of characters caught juggling the secrets they carry, both their own and the secrets of others that come either willingly or as burdens. This is also a story about being unsure whether to flee or stand one’s ground, in life or in love, and it seems everyone has their own form of monster on the prowl for them.   [image]I’ll revisit this  once the book is out, but the story is exceptional and we find the cast of characters struggling with their past as well as their present in ways that are often as dynamically metaphoric as they are menacing. Secrets and sadness lurk in every decision but while the story lives up to its title of being deep and dark, there are also warm bursts of hope that keep the story going and the tension building. A very nuanced and emotional read with wonderful representation and narrative, The Deep Dark might just be the best graphic novel of the year.

The summers I spent in my university years working the grounds for a Metro Park are always a warm memory to return to and even the harshest of days never left much of a sting when I soaked in the beauty of the plants and animals around me beneath the vastness of the sky. Such is the message in Kengo Kurimoto’s Wildful, a strikingly beautiful graphic novel that, in few words as possible, immerses us into the peace of wild things. When her dog escapes through a fence during her daily walk, Poppy discovers a dense wilderness tucked away inside the urban sprawl. With stunning artwork and a heartfelt look at overcoming grief, coming together and rediscovering nature, WIldful is a lovely read.[image]This was such a moving little story that focuses just as much on the human element as it does nature. On her first excursion into this hidden little eden she meets Rob and her awakening into the wonders of the natural world parallels a growing friendship with Rob. The two meet every day to bask in the brilliance of the outdoors and Rob teaches Poppy how to track deer, recognize the calls of birds and open her eyes to the wild. Her homelife, however, comes across under a weight of sorrow in the wake of her grandmother’s death, which has hit her mother particularly hard. ‘Both Poppy’s mum and her gran are both loosely inspired by my own mother,’ author and artist Kurimoto explained in an interview with Forward Review, and there is a sensitivity and earnesty to these characters that really shines. [image]Image Text: When I’m with you the world feels aliveI was rather impressed how much emotion comes through this story and how well it is told with very minimal dialogue. There is a hushed tone to the tale like one is in the brush with the characters remaining quiet and still in order to not disturb the wildlife. The art is stunning, with vivid details that really pop even with the lack of color. Kurimoto explains that the book came from a desire to return to the simplicity of pen and paper and observe the world around him: ‘One time I became intrigued by how chestnuts form and over the course of a year I drew each stage; starting from a bud, bursting into leaves and flowers, then from flowers into the nut. When you really look, each transformation is nothing short of miraculous, and when you learn to see it in all plants, you see the whole forest in a new way.’It is a gorgeous book and there are tons of great and adorable illustrations of animals. Such as one of my favorites, the fox![image]Okay maybe fox is #2 to red pandas, but I love me a fox. During my time in Dublin I greatly enjoyed the way foxes roam the streets at night like cats do in the city streets of the US. It always felt quite magical, stumbling back as foxes raced around like twilight companions. Shoutout to Irish foxes.Wildful is a book about opening our eyes to the world but also about opening our hearts to each other. As pretty as it is poignant, this is a book that can be enjoyed by any age. 4.5/5[image]The Peace of Wild Things- Wendell BerryWhen despair for the world grows in meand I wake in the night at the least soundin fear of what my life and my children’s lives may be,I go and lie down where the wood drakerests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds.I come into the peace of wild thingswho do not tax their lives with forethoughtof grief.

The story follAn unfathomable terror awaits In the wreckage of a massive and deadly explosion 12 years prior in Chris Gooch’s sci-fi horror In Utero. The story follows 12 year old Hailey as she sneaks away from her chaotic daycare inside a closed-down shopping mall and befriends Jen, who turns out to be far more than anyone could ever imagine and needs a companion before the great horrors beneath the mall begin to rise. While the artwork is breathtaking and conveys some seriously creepy sights and vibes, the monster plot falls a bit flat through a rather cumbersome execution and unfortunate lack of context. In Utero delivers surreal thrills and mind-bending concepts making it a worthwhile read though riding along the story feels like being jostled along a bumpy road too quickly to enjoy the scenery and left in the dark about where you are going or why.  [image]Okay, but for real the art is amazingThere’s a lot to enjoy in In Utero. The characters are pretty fun like the frazzled head of the daycare who is more concerned with confrontation than caregiving, or Hailey and her habit of rattling off random facts. There’s a great bit too with the frustration of the scientists trying to study the specimens and the general who is ready to go in guns blazing and kills some monsters. Or be killed. It doesn’t go very well for anyone and this has some great action moments.  [image]And then there is Jen. I really enjoyed the aspects of a metaphysical “monster” who can project into the world or draw Hailey into her strange alternative universe (shown above) and the whole idea of rival beasts fighting across space and time and over generations was cool it just never quite came together. The general confusion is a bit fun at first since its all so creepy and surreal, but the tiny bits of context given don’t add up to much and feels less like a creepy feature and more like a flaw. The pacing is also pretty jumpy and while I appreciate the effort of jump-cuts between locations and characters it isn’t always successfully handled. Also the timeline just doesn’t feel natural for the amount of things happening. ‘It's not the ground we're worried about... it's what came out of it.’That all said, the art here is extraordinary. I really liked the two-tone art with scenes in either all red or a dark blue. The style reminded me a bit of a favorite graphic novelist, Tillie Walden, especially in the architectural aspects and honestly, even if you are confused this is just a great graphic novel to look at. It handles the surrealism quite well and there are some really strange things going on in this book.  [image]Ultimately, In Utero is a fun and eerie graphic novel that feels like its missing some elements but ultimately is a worthwhile read. Gorgeous art, gory monster battles and just a good time.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,6,68,1,not set,not set,"Mar 25, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/133206544-in-utero

Suffering from a fevered state, the narrator in Ia Genberg’s The Details experiences such a voyage down memory lane on the wings of literature and observes that ‘some books stay in your bones long after their titles and details have slipped from memory.’ This striking and succinct Swedish novella was awarded he August Prize for fiction in 2022 and is now longlisted for the 2024 International Booker in its impressive English translation from Kira Josefsson. A story sure to stir the souls of those with a profound fondness for the written word for its examination of the connections we form with books and with whom we read them, The Details is also a deeply soul-searching investigation on the ways the self is shaped by those around us. The way we ‘let them become part of me’ becomes the thread the narrator untangles across this non-linear novella. With acute observations and majestic prose, Genberg’s The Details is a moving look at the way we carry the past with us and ‘that in some sense no relationship ever ends.’‘In one way life begins anew each day and every second but is also true I keep returning to the same places in myself.’I cannot help but swoon at the way Genberg’s examination of the self is informed by the novels one has read. In bed with a vague illness, the narrator reaches for an old copy of Paul Auster’s The New York Trilogy only to find herself pulled back two decades previous down the halls of memory by an inscription from her then-girlfriend, Johanna, who gifted her the book during a similar state of illness. Her fever burns across the pages in the intensity of the prose and the feverish fashion in which the story avoids linearity as ‘time folds in on itself’, not progressing along a chronological plot but instead circling the timeline as ideas leap into others. ‘As far as the dead are concerned, chronology has no import and all that matters are the details, the degree of density, this how and what and everything to do with who.’It presents a wider scope of the narrator’s “self” with all the different pasts and present spiraling together. But it also becomes a method to juxtapose the people she knew with the ways the their fingerprints on her life present themselves later. ‘That's all there is to the self, or the so-called 'self': traces of the people we rub up against,’ she observes and this is, essentially, the core lesson of the The Details: that we are made of, quite literally, of small details. ‘That’s where this sharper sense of being alive is found, in the alert gaze on another.’Books are an important part of the relationships examined in The Details. ‘Literature was our favorite game,’ she thinks about her time with Johanna, ‘hermetic but nimble, both simple and twisted, at once paranoid and crystalline, and with an open sky between every word.’ Later, a battered copy of Birgitta Trotzig’s Dykungens dotter is all that remains after her roommate Niki vanishes from her life. Books, like relationships, are an ephemeral affair, but highly significant.‘the ownership of books was distinct from other types of ownership, more like a loan that might run out or be transferred onto someone else at the drop of a hat.’I enjoy how Genberg has books serving as monuments to moments that would be lost to time if books weren’t also a portal of memory and emotional resonance. The story moves through four key figures in her life. There is the aforementioned ex-girlfriend, who she will later feel a sense of betrayal from when during an interview she claims to have never liked Paul Auster. Next is Niki, a roommate with an intensity ‘as if the full cast of Greek gods and all the emotions and states they represented had been crammed in behind her eyelids.’ Then there is the relationship with Alejandro that strikes and leaves like a storm.‘our relationship was the length of a breath and yet he stayed with me, as if there was something in me that bent around him, a new paradigm for all my future verbs.’The push and pull between temporality and legacy creates an excellent emotional tension, particularly as the juxtaposition of Alejandro’s brevity in the text with the lasting impact from their collision of selves. Finally we come to Birgitte and issues of trust, with Birgitte’s anxieties that are not all that unlike a description of the narrative structure of the novel:‘to run ahead and touch everything, circle potentialities with the intention of preventing them from happening, on and on and on in a process that never stops.’Though while the book explores these four characters, what we gain most of is an understanding of the narrator as reflected back in them and through them. It becomes like those fun-house hall of mirrors, where each person is made up of the residue left from each encounter with others and reflecting each other back upon one another until where one ends and the other begins starts to blur. ‘And I suppose that's what's at the heart of it for every person suffering from anxiety; the fact that life, by its very nature, is impossible to manage.’Not unlike the relationships in the novel, The Detail is brief yet powerful. A wonderful examination of the self and the way we shape and are shaped by those around us as well as a lovely tribute to the power of literature, this is a truly moving and thought provoking work. The love of literature shines brightly here. Oh, and in regards to my opening question, Crime and Punishment, 2666 and The Passion all transport me to the moment of my first read with them. This book also made me realize how much I enjoy the connection with people here on goodreads and the conversations and discussions we share.

I’ve always been fascinated by the way a story can, like a snowball rolling down a hill, gain in velocity as it is passed along and grow in menacing mass as details soften into murky dread and possibilities. But what horrors and terrible events lend themselves to legends that perpetuate through the ages? Flyaway from Australian author Kathleen Jennings is a darkly immersive journey into Australian folklore and frights as a young girl discovers that the haunting tales whispered around her town might have such sinister truths at their heart. It is folk horror at its finest and reads like an Australian Gothic as the pain of the past haunt the present. Jennings’ prose spirals through haunting figurative language and surreal imagery that pulls the reader along through this beguiling tale as if the novel were a ferocious fairytale forest instead of words on a page. Full of mystery and surprises with brief stories of folklore interwoven with the main plot, Flyaway is alive with fairytale sensibilities as in this tale about generation trauma and uncovering hard truths that are swept under the rug only to return more frightening than ever.‘Strange, what chooses to flourish here. Which plants. Which stories.’I’d like to thank Ceallaigh and her excellent  for guiding me to this eerie tale. The story revolves around teenage Bettina Scott who, with the help of two former friends she sometimes thinks of as enemies, is trying to discover a mystery of her family’s recent past when a threatening message written on her fence is followed by an ominous threat that arrives in the mail. Flyaway is best enjoyed with as little knowledge of the plot as possible going into it, and the narrative does—admittedly—begin rather obfuscating though this is all by design. The book garners comparisons to Shirley Jackson’s We Have Always Lived in the Castle for a similar gothic atmosphere, ominous dread and unreliable narrator with Bettina being a successful successor to Mericat with her social standoffishness and glaring gaps in personal history while her thoughts are continuously assailed by the voice of her mother chastising her manners and encouraging “ladylike” behavior. It can be tricky to follow at first but hang in there. It is a worthwhile fumbling through the narrative dark because around halfway there is a brilliant moment that suddenly blows aside your confusion like the dispersal of a fog, the seemingly disparate pieces slide into place, and the larger picture comes gloriously into focus. It is like those cartoons where a character walks into the mouth of a beast mistaking the teeth as trees and only gains clarity of their surroundings as the jaws snap shut…‘I tried to be anxious, but the earth and the grass and the evening breeze surrounded me, as if I had been set into a socket of the world for which I’d been designed.’Beyond the personal struggles of the teenage cast, there is a larger scope making this just as much a story about this secluded Queensland town and the long feuds, neighborly distrust and legends that linger through generations. Runagate is from a distric ‘somewhere between the Coral Sea and the Indian Ocean but on the way to nowhere, there was a district called – oh, let’s call it Inglewell’ and exist as if in a state of decomposition. The folklore is brought to life through brief tales threaded into the larger narrative, weaving magic and dread into daily reality until it becomes entirely engulfed in the fantastical as a surreal landscape shot through with sorrow. An entire school vanishes into the trees, a bottle might grant wishes, shapeshifters and other terrors with teeth might thrash in the underbrush. It is teeming with Australian folklore and there are some real creepy beasts such as the Megarrity, which I kept misreading in my head as Mega-Gritty though it would make sense if Gritty made his way to Philly after terrorizing the Australian forests for centuries.  [image]The town itself is framed as ferociously as the folklore with Jennings’ prose crafting the land as a sentient beast and the trees and creatures that crawl amongst them are characters on their own. ‘Trees like lanterns, like candles, ghosts and bones,’ trees bleeding resin, trees that cloy the decaying buildings and rot of Runagate and seem a testament to the permeating sadness of its atmosphere, trees as omnipresent lurking threats that separate the town from the rest of Australia like the mythical forests of fairytales.‘Trees towered hard as bronze in still sunlight, and stirred like a living hide in the rolling advent of a storm. If you were born to Runagate with all its fragile propriety, its tidy civilisation, its ring-fence of roads and paddocks, wires and blood, there was nothing else in the world beyond but tree.’The sense of isolation is thick, both literally and figuratively as divisions between neighbors run deep with the three principal characters coming together as if totems for the legacy of these families. Gary Damson is a particularly well-fixed character in this theme coming from a family of fence builders that for generations ‘keep up fences, walk boundaries.’ Bettina, on the other hand is a legacy of disaster juxtaposed to Trish and the Aberdeens who uphold social norms and status quo. As the story descends into dread and weirdness, they begin to realize the legacy of lore might be more than tall tales to chill you around a campfire.‘Memory bleed and frayed there, where ghosts stood silent by fenceposts.’Fable and fairytales often exists as warning or guidance through the dark forests of life. As Folklorist Jack Zipes writes ‘Fairy tales since the beginning of recorded time, and perhaps earlier, have been a means to conquer the terrors of mankind through metaphor.’ Here we find that the tales betray dark secrets and a legacy of betrayals and debts, violence and abuse that cannot remain silent in the past. ‘Truth was shifting the way the land had when we drove: trees sliding behind trees.’ writes Jennings and the reader begins to question if Bettina’s narration is confused because she has pushed aside painful memories, and is the truth transforming into terrors that haunt the countryside demanding confrontation. Under the stones of stories we find the violence of patriarchy and colonialism, the sins of greed and grief perpetuating themselves down through generations as trauma grips people's hearts and in turn they commit emotional and physical violence as a sense of control over others. This is a story with teeth and the wails of those who have been bitten.‘If all those stories mean anything, they mean sometimes people do just disappear. And maybe they can be found.’An incredible little novella that, while confusing at first, pays off in the end, Flyaway embodies the spirit of fairytales and has a few of its own to tell. There is a familiar story at the heart of this, though which one is a major reveal late in the novel I won’t spoil, and this works as a haunting Australian gothic tale that probes the darkness of the human heart.

One where ‘Birth lasts longer than death./ In Palestine death is sudden,/instant,/constant,/ happens in between breaths.’ This moving debut collection takes the long history of violence and displacement against the Palestinian people and transforms it into direct prose that rings out as gorgeous as it is sharp. The title, Rifqa is an Arabic word that roughly translates to mean compassion, kindness, or companionship, but it is also the name of his grandmother and many of these poems revolve around the lessons in activism he learned from his grandmother and serve as a moving tribute to her. While ‘poems won’t build a house,’ and poems can’t stop a bomb, poetry can also speak out against injustice or give voice to struggles and Rifqa is a bold and beautiful collection that does just that.‘In my brief twenty-two years of personhood, I have seen Palestine dwindle in size and spirit like a decaying loved one.I refuse to wait in the wreck’Mohammed el-Kurd and his sister, Muna el-Kurd, have become well known in recent years for their activism. While attending university in the US, Mohammed returned home in 2021 to protest the evictions of Palestinians in the occupied East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah. Both he and his sister were arrested and detained for several days by Isreali police. They began appearing on major news networks speaking out against oppression and ended up on the Time 100 Most Influential People list in 2021  [image]Photo: Muna and Mohammed el-Kurd being released from prison in 2021Much of his activism comes through in these poems and much of it pays homage to the life and legacy of his grandmother. ‘Despair without people tastes different than collective despair,’ he writes about the loss of his grandmother, and he discusses how much of his belief in speaking out and giving voice to a collective despair helps carry out her legacy. ‘Even in the face of eviction, monetary punishment, tens of trials, and threats of imprisonment, she persisted,’ he tells us, often returning to moments of his grandmother as a touchstone for strength and courage. It makes for a beautiful tribute. ‘What do you say to children for whom the Red Sea doesn’t part?’ The trouble with words, we are shown, is that under oppression and colonialism language is often manipulated against those who are oppressed and framed in ways that uphold the oppressor’s perspective. ‘If you’re not careful,’ he warns, ‘the newspapers will have you hating the people who are being oppressed and loving the people who aredoing the oppressing.’ Or, as he writes in the poem Context:Violence is not childrentaking on dragons.For me, it has always been apologies.Running to catastrophe with context, commissioningcompassion, turningheroes into humans. This is a refuted revolution.’The context here, he tells us ‘Context: they want cats / declawed, they want knocked doors / unanswered.’ The issue of words being twisted against oneself has even found el-Kurd being canceled from speaking events (the news of this was actually how I discovered this collection), when his line saying the armed forces of Israel ‘harvest organs of the martyred, feed their warriors our own,’ was accused to being a literal accusation of cannibalism and not a metaphor. It makes me think of a recent poem by Noah Mazer, where the metaphor ‘the guerrilla moves among the people / as a fish swims through water’ has people condemning both the fish and the water as an indictment against those who condemn without nuance. ‘At a certain point, the metaphor tires. At a certain point, I’ll grab a brick’ he writes, stressing how poetry is one way of speaking out but that we cannot just stay forever in words which will be used against us anyways and must also take action. Or, similarly:A woman tells him a pen is a sword. What’s a pento a rifle? Another fed him a sonnet. If Shakespearewas from here he wouldn’t be writing.’This is a really moving work on a very violent and upsetting situation and the poetry rises to the occasion of ensuring the reader is not shielded from the severity by pretty metaphors and twisted language. He also reminds us that this has been going on for a long time, such as in the poem 1998/1948 her writes:It’s the same killingeverywhere. Seventy-some years laterwe haven’t lived a day.Each poem culminates towards a feeling of frustration seeing the horrors that tear apart lives, families and even the landscape as Gaza has become the largest open air prison and continually shrinking as more and more displacements and violence occurs:Years passed and the vines of the roseswere vines of grapesvines of barbed wires,ripping open the veins of this city.Though these are not poems simply to bear witness—’I no longer feel the responsibility to give humans eyes for humanity’—but poems that demand action and accountability. He laughs off ideas like identity and tries to make the reader understand the trauma of the situation even down to details such as how if asked ‘where I’m from it’s not a one-word answer.’ It is a bold collection, but as his grandmother taught him: ‘if we don’t laugh, we cry.’ As he writes in This Is Why We Dance:We have wounded feet but the rhythm remains, no matter the adjectives on my shoulders. This is why we dance: Because screaming isn’t free.Haunting, harrowing, and deeply moving, this is a brief but powerful collection of poems. ⅘A soldier as old as a leaf born yesterdaypulls a trigger on a woman older than his heritage.Two martyrs fall.One martyr falls.Here, every footstep is a grave,every grandmother is a Jerusalem....more",Notes are private!,28,144,1,not set,not set,"Mar 20, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/57653182-rifqa

Her YA books like Better Than the Movies or The Do-Over are total delights. They felt genuine within their own context, which Happily Never After never manages to achieve. Admittedly, Painter comes swinging with a clever and cute premise of wedding objectors who are rescuing people from engagements they can’t get out of without further ruining their lives and it was off to a strong start. Unfortunately, the story never quite finds a groove and glides along feeling rather thinly built without adequate narrative tension to have much to grip onto, reading like it went direct from the draft folder to the publisher and print to fulfill contract duties and deadlines. And yes, as always I should have just listened to adira (you can read her incredible  here) but you play stupid games, you win stupid prizes and that prize is a disappointing read. But I do not object alone so meet the Goodreads Objectors (and read adira’s !)  [image]But first, a positive: I do like how Painter tends to pair people where their names form a name familiar to romance fans (Better than the Movies adds up to Elizabeth Bennet, The Do-Over adds up to Nick Hornby) here she would have been Sophie Lauren if Max didn’t object to their wedding, which makes for a fun joke that she would have to hear jokes about it not quite being Sophia Loren. A sign the marriage was a bad idea. Clever, Painter, I like it. Anyways…I don’t really see how people can enjoy “hate reading,” which I promise this wasn’t, because I just don’t enjoy being disappointed by a book. This was a shame because I initially really enjoyed these characters before character development got shoved aside for sex scenes and we see that tension and titillation aren’t as interchangeable as one would hope with the latter not amounting to much without enough of the former in the narrative. Painter introduces us to Max and says he ‘looked like Henry Cavill’s stunt double or something, but with darker hair and more intense eyes’ and I said OH I AM LISTENING NOW but the initially charming Max eventually descends into being the flag bearer for the Red Flag Parade. But I’m glad he likes Sophie because she is pretty charming and the whole beginning where they rant about being anti-love is pretty great. Painter is pretty funny, and I will say the banter and humor worked well for me, plus I can’t help but giggle at lines like this:‘but when I saw the bride pull her arm back and launch that snack cake off the balcony like a professional quarterback, I decided to stick around for another minute.’I liked Sophie but, get this all, shes not like other girls because shes…into her car and job and wears flannel shirts well (Max should maybe check out Michigan if that’s his thing). I did enjoy her being an objector at weddings which is a nice role-reversal from how its typically depicted as a man or Shrek running in yelling ‘I object,’ but that entire plotline more or less vanishes as a fake dating plot comes racing into the narrative wearing a more dramatic white dress and steals the entire show. Which is the issue here. Things just sort of wander around and banter with each other but nothing has much drive and even Max’s Ex-girlfriend plot is sort of hurriedly pushed through the narrative without there being much tension in the story. There’s so many different tropes and parts that, given the proper attention, could have made a sweet treat of a read but instead came all mashed together like when a child “helps” you bake. The rationalities for things were just too silly at times as well and none of the side characters are included enough to really pull much weight. Which makes the fake dating part feel rather flimsy and tacked on, with the reasoning being that Max wants his parents to think he is settled down so they will retire and leave him the company which is…just sort of shitty? Can Max not take care of himself and needs a woman to do it, is that the implication? Not awesome.The wedding objections were for people in need and Painter really wants you to know its not some shitty anti-love statement but the scenarios she constructs are kind of eye-rolling. Sophie not wanting to call off her wedding because her fiance’s dad is her dad’s boss and he’s “just a mean guy” was like…okay whatever, BUT the next wedding is so ham-fisted and weird where the poor kindergarten teacher groom who fosters pets with disabilities sees texts that his super redneck fiance mocks him as her sexting kink in her affairs and its just…turned cartoonish. What makes Paiters’s YAs work is there tends to be a heavier, more serious narrative subplot that gives enough weight to hold the sweetness from floating off into oblivion but that was lacking here. And the Objecting could have easily been used to make a statement on why it is hard for women to leave abusive relationships because of the danger in puts them in, or something else since i guess thats a bit heavy for a romcom, but it all just fell a bit flat and lacked any friction.Nothing felt genuine. I did love the surprise twist that Sophie’s roomates were bickering senior citizens so she could afford the apartment her ex-fiance lived in before she moved in. But also, why could he afford it on his own but she can’t when she’s his literal boss? Is this a statement on the gender pay gap? The narrative pushed each other out of the way, nothing really flowed and everyone felt a little cartoonishly immature. Her YAs work because she does teenagers well, but her adult novels just feel like teenagers with a lot of money and sex scenes.I’m sure a lot of people will enjoy this one, and Happily Never After is still pretty cute maybe I just have a bad attitude but I’m fine with my spite and my tears, and my beers and my candles. It just never quite came together for me and while I’m not opposed to sex scenes this one seemed like it tried to use friction in the sheets to compensate from the utter lack of friction in the plot and it just didn't work. But by all means, still give this a shot, the banter is cute, it is lighthearted fun and I’ll probably still read more Lynn Painter in the future.2.5/5...more",Notes are private!,96,155,1,"Mar 19, 2024","Mar 23, 2024","Mar 19, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/196700456-happily-never-after

As a fan of the books and films, this is quite the treat though the way I came to be in possession of this clothbound collectors volume is quite lovely to me as well. The whole project of this is a cool collaboration of art and artists with Brolin writing verse from the perspective of his character, Gurney Halleck, sometimes from his own perspective as Josh Brolin the actor, and occasionally somewhere inbetween. I’ve long loved Brolin and this further shows how cool he is as well as dedicated to his craft and acutely perceptive about it. These poems sparked some viral fan humour over his poems about Timothée Chalamet—particularly a line about his cheekbones—and while Brolin might not be Poet Laureate for this, these are still so delightful to read and have so much heart and wit behind them. It works wonderfully with the photos, and I do have to admit I’ve always found actors dressed in character but in the moments between shots where they are just themselves to be rather magical imagery. It’s like if you were to catch Mickey Mouse smoking a cigarette or something.  [image]Brolin addresses just that in a discussion with Variety:Brolin doesn’t have a favorite passage but says, “I love haikus.” He reads a passage from the book, “‘Lie down in the light, as fictional characters watch you from afar.’ I love that because it’s pointing out the fact that this is not real, but there’s nothing more real. The light is real, lying down is real, the sand is real, the experience is real, and yet, it’s this great contrasting thing.”I really enjoyed the mini essays Brolin and Fraser wrote about each other, or his poem addressed to Denis Villeneuve in character as Gurney asking if he can finally sing his song on his stupid little lute (the lack of lute in the first film was a bummer for me), or even Brolin describing Chalamet in a poem as looking like a Giocometti sculpture saying ‘I really like you / in The Goonies, man. / That was dope.’ There’s also some cool reflections about being on set in nicely poetic expressions. If you are a fan, this is worthwhile.Though perhaps more meaningful to me is the way I got it. Its been years since I moved away from my hometown but still keep in touch with one of my good high school friends. He’s the sort you can go months without talking to and pick up right where you left off or as if we were just teenagers playing video games in the basement the day before. We always try to send each other super nerdy gifts, the sort you would never actually buy yourself but like…would actually enjoy having. They’ve gotten pretty over the top in friendly gift giving competition at times, but after planning for 2 years to meet on the opposite side of the state to see Dune Pt 2 on opening night together (we read the books and watched the miniseries together years ago so we felt we should see it how we did movies in high school--go opening night, stay up way to late to watch the first at home, wake up and see the new one again) it was hilarious to discover we both gifted each other this same book. And I thought I was going to have the upper hand on obscure nerdy gifts… We have good taste, what can I say. So, Dune film fans, definitely flip through a copy of Dune: Exposures if you can. I’m that friend that has this, come find me, we’ll read some Gurney poetry.

Our current Laureate, I always really enjoy when the current US Poet Laureate gets to use their post to put out a poetry anthology of their choosing. Our current Laureate, Ada Limón, is an absolutely brilliant poet and I’ve loved that her initiative has been the You Are Here project, which includes Poetry In the Parks to place poetry installations in National Parks around the country. It’s such a lovely idea, and I have a massive and very personal love for public poetry so I was thrilled to see her release You Are Here: Poetry in the Natural World. This anthology collects 50 previously unpublished poems commissioned for this book from some of the most amazing contemporary writers in the US who share some of their poetic gifts with us on the subject of nature. ‘Nature is not a place to visit. Nature is who we are,’ Limón writes in the introduction and these poems remind us of our place in the natural world amongst all the wonders of plant and animal life and all the beauty of the Earth. Even with the central theme, it is a very versatile collection with a brilliant variety of approaches to the subject with words that will touch your heart as you ‘let the world / soften you with its touching,’ as Ruth Awad writes. A brief but powerful little anthology that captures the beauties of the natural world and the joys of our life amongst it.EAT—Joy HarjoGrasshoppers devour the sunflowersPetal by petal to raggedy yellow flags—Squash blossoms of small suns blessedBy dewdrops flare beauty in the morningUntil an army of squash bugs landAnd eat, then drag their belliesFrom the carnage—Field mice chew their wayInto the house.

And with the most extraordinary collection of poets, this collection is a powerhouse of talent. In her introduction here Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden writes that these poems ‘serve as a call for readers to take in the nature all around them,’ because, as author Robin Wall Kimmerer instructs, ‘the land is the real teacher.’ I have to admit this collection and Limon’s initiative speak directly to my heart though. Over the past several years a hobby of mine has been to create temporary public poetry installations. It started as a joke to post a poem in the center of our city’s park like a medieval decree but I began leaving favorite poems all over trees everywhere I went, teaching myself to paint so I could write poems on the painting and leave them for people to find.  [image][photo: a collage of some examples of Poe-a-tree] I like the idea of being surprised by art in the wild and having strangers stop and think about poetry for a brief moment while also having their attention called to the idea that nature itself is a sort of poetry. If you are curious, I have them all collected on instagram at @poe_a_tree where the project mostly lives now as I was shut down by the city. Though you can still occasionally find them on the local college campus who doesn’t seem to mind. I hope. ‘I hope you will consider making your own version of a “You Are Here” poem to grow alongside ours,’ Limon writes, and I definitely agree with spreading the love of public poetry and art.LETTERS—Ilya KaminskyRain has eaten ¼ of meYet I believeAgainst all evidenceThese raindropsAre my letters of recommendationHere is a man worth falling on.There is a wonderful variety of takes on the subject in this collection. We have poems on the beauty of nature but also the destruction of it through climate change or commoditization. ‘Every place i have loved has forced me to leave,’ write b Ferguson in Parkside & Ocean about the way nature is often commoditized and taken from indigenous peoples under colonization, old dream / will either of us return to what we once were?’ Patricia Smith uses nature symbolism to great effect to speak of bodies in To Little Black Girls, Risking Flower, with some wonderful metaphors on blossoming into oneself: ‘If your aim was / to unfurl, terrify, sparkle with damage, you’ll do that and more.’ torrin a. Greathouse also excels with symbolism on the body with an exploration on gender transition in No Ethical Transition Under Late Capitalism (you can read it here).

Class move, I love that.XOXO is adorable and sweet and as fluffy as…picture the biggest, fluffiest cinematically perfect cloud above a prairie on a sweetly warm summer’s day. Do not edit that first image, and that’s about as fluffy as this was. Cotton candy fluffy, the kind that sort of makes your teeth hurt when you bite it. Saccharine as shit. Having seen the movie Nope I should have known to not trust a cloud that big and fluffy but here we are (I also should have know to trust adira and also mitra). ANYWAYS, XOXO plunges us into the world of K-Pop idols and boarding schools for some romantic fun that has its charms and some really interesting cultural context but reads rather flat and flimsy with a plot seemingly in search of itself.‘I promise you can get the life you want now, if you just live in it.’An aspect that really worked for me here was the immersion in South Korean culture, particularly the lifestyles of K-Pop idols and the trainees who hope to one day become them. Which, it turns out, is full of restrictions that make you more or less property of your label. ‘As an idol, you agreed to share your whole life with your fans, so that they can love you without fear that you'll disappoint or hurt them,’ we learn, which sends the budding romance between Jenny and Jaewoo into a secret relationship trope as Jaewoo is not allowed to date. I’ve seen claims this began as BTS fan fiction (they do get a namedrop) so Jaewoo may have some inspiration in global hearthrob Jungkook, so that is pretty fun. But I can’t mention BTS without a shoutout to their memoir translator, Anton Hur, and how you should most definitely read any book they translate. ‘even after the scandal, even after the accusations and the heartbreak and the pain. he was my first love. I wouldn't give that up for the world.’The catch is, Jenny and Jaewoo are pretty flavorless as characters. Its all cutesy and they clearly are very into each other but the plot meanders through episodes that you assume will add up to something but just sort of don’t until finally you want to ask “do either of you have any convictions or just statements about them?” And sure there’s scandals but none that would last more than a mid-afternoon on twitter and then suddenly everyone makes up and yay. Also, its meant as endearing that they toss anything to the side in order to spend as much time together as possible but it gets red flag-y even to friends: ‘you're not his beck and call girl, you know? you don't have to drop everything just because he comes around,’ and Jaewoo’s contract restrictions sometimes just felt like carte blanche to be a dick. Sori was the character that actually shines in this story and she’s always sort of elbowed out to the peripheries (thankfully I hear the sequel, ASAP, is about her and Nathaniel). ‘People who live for tomorrow should fear the people who live for today. Because the people who live for tomorrow don't take risks. They're afraid of the consequences. While the people who live for today have nothing to lose, so they fight tooth and nail.’There are some positive messages, with ideas about following your dreams and doing it for you not others such as ‘you can’t be there for other people if you’re not first there for yourself,’ but overall the story was mostly just the fluffy romance. It doesn't help that the writing was really bland. Which surprised me as I quite enjoyed The Girl Who Fell Beneath the Sea and though that had some good gripping writing and plot, but here it so hyper focused on the main characters in a way that just talks at you instead of shows you.

Beleaguered by condemnations of bad behavior often worsens the feelings of isolation and shame, such as is the case for Max Porter’s titular character, Shy, who’s attempts at temporary relief have been been short on solace but lengthy on his criminal record, and the road to healing often seems impossible to find in the fog of frustration. Porter’s Shy is a very empathetic and experimental look at young men teetering off the edge—a leitmotif of Porter’s works—and brought to Last Chance House, ‘a shite old mansion converted into a school for badly behaved boys in the middle of bumblefuck nowhere,’ that is possibly also as haunted as the boys feel their own minds are. Using an impressive variety of form and playful poetic expression that structurally recreates the bewildering way Shy processes the ‘shattered flicker-drag of these sensejumbled memories,’ the experimentation occasionally seems to supercede the execution though the overall effect still lands. And like Shy’s own feelings, this novel ‘feels colossally sad. Blisteringly sad. Almost ecstatically sad,’ yet the healing power of music and and optimistic finish keep it afloat and send the message deep into the heart of the reader. Caustic yet heartfelt, Shy is a moving novella that interrogates masculinity and mental health while critiquing the ways society would sooner brush those in need out of sight and out of mind, all culminating in a unique and penetrating novel that reminds us everyone deserves a chance to heal.‘The night is huge and it hurts.’Max Porter has a knack for expressing emotional extremes and trauma, with his best-known work, Grief Is the Thing with Feathers, being a searing portrait of grief, especially when expressing the ways two young sons wrestle with it. Grief had the bemusing and darkly-comical Crow figure to soften the heartache which is an element missing from Shy which instead plunges the reader into the swirling pain of memories, shame and frustration. The only real relief comes from some great passages on music, taking on ethereal qualities through Porter’s prose, but even the aims at comedy through young men’s antics feels more bruising than bemusing. This is part of the attempt to show the struggles of boys in a society that pushes and models a masculinity on them that is detrimental to their emotional growth and expression. Slurs and insults abound even when ‘just having a laugh, and ‘the boys just rip and rip at each other, endless patterns of attack and response, like flirting’s grim twin.’ It makes boyhood seem a very unfriendly landscape, especially for those who are more sensitive. This is furthered by these boys often having a lack of positive role models, such as Shy’s step-father being aggressive and abusive as his response to confrontation or parenting in general.Shy struggles in this, and while Last Chance is a place for healing being in close proximity to a lot of rough personalities only makes him feel more on edge. The novella all takes place on a night he chooses to run away, though the story spirals back across the timeline to capture his experience of ‘sensejumbled memories.’ While it may take a moment to get one’s bearings in this abstract and chaotic narrative approach, it is where Porter really shines. It is written in a unique space between fiction and poetry, changing forms frequently and accommodating multiple voices (sometimes in multiple timelines at once) through text modifications like italics or bolded letters or simply placement on the page. The style shifts dramatically, from short, staccatoed lines to big dense passages without punctuation to reflect frenetic thoughts bubbling over in anxiety. Or there is the voice of the step-father, written in a poetic form that seems to cluster frequent phrases rather than reflect a single argument (the text appears center-justified in the novel): ‘Do you think that's an appropriate way to speak to me? / Do you want to break this family apart, is that what you want? / I can't believe you would choose to do this / Some people don't have the luxury of a nice mum to speak to like that / Wow, here we go again / Don't you dare walk away / Please don't do this again /Have you any idea of the hurt you've caused? / Are you trying to trying to destroy our lives? / What's the point of all this? / I am literally begging you to treat me like a human being / Come back here / Not again, please not again’It is apparent that Shy has a lot of guilt and feels powerless against his own actions, and has been treated with disdain for them. It is another critique of masculinity here, though the softer approach of those in Last Chance house still haven’t gotten through to him. It is also an interesting critique on the treatment of those deemed criminals or troubled youth, the way they are discarded from society, and how the already minimal resources for help are typically underfunded and staffed but overworked and underpaid professionals. The possible end of Last Chance house is brilliantly indicative of this. ‘If the owner of the building gets planning permission to convert it into luxury self-contained flats, then Last Chance will be a thing of the past.’ There is a documentary being filmed about Last Chance, though being used as a prop is another element that sets off Shy here.This is experimentally brilliant, though occasionally it feels that there isn’t enough beneath the experimentation. One benefit of abstraction in narration is the reader’s mind fills in a lot of space and you can imply a lot with only a few linguistic strokes, which might by why the middle of this book felt a bit overstuffed, repeatedly adding to Shy’s litany of crimes or sorrows that could have been understood just as strongly in implication instead of constantly bringing them back up. I really did like the music elements, however, with some playful passages about that really breaking up the harsher sections. ‘God is a bouncy bastard who wants his people together in the dance. Rolling. Technology and soul. Hallefuckinlujah he loves the drums. Rain them down on me.’This is definitely a “its not you its me” thing, but when I read Grief Is the Thing with Feathers I was reading it alongside Master of Reality by Mountain Goats singer John Darnielle which deals with many of the same things here: a boy in a mental health hospital using music as he way of processing his emotions. I think because I liked that one better and associate it with Porter I may have felt a little underwhelmed here. I like how this one launches into some pretty surreal moments (particularly with what might be the ghost of the place?) but it does kind of unravel. The ending makes up for it all, however.A short but powerful little book, Shy excels on experimentation and expression for a sharp look into mental health and the people fighting against their own minds. It is deeply empathetic and wonderfully poetic, and while it might go off the rails a bit and value experimenting over substance, it makes for a brilliant little read.2.5/5...more",Notes are private!,14,145,1,"Mar 11, 2024","Mar 11, 2024","Mar 11, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62039324-shy

Woodson experienced many losses and griefs of family and friends, though has accepted that ‘death tears away the skin of one life, exposing another.’ It is all another doorway to something new even if it means learning to live in the world without someone who had previously been a constant. ‘There were the friends whose deaths opened the doors to new friends I might not otherwise have ever known,’ she says, and it makes for a rather optimistic outlook where even grief can be a way to a fresh start.A lovely read with equal parts sadness and joy.

There are fWhen I die, feel free to use my body to fashion a front-page celebrity scandal and let not the drama of my death be the death of my drama. There are few better ways to examine the depths of drama than a novel about Hollywood and Taylor Jenkins Reid transports readers back into the glamor and glitz of Hollywood’s golden era in The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo for a story about scandals, successes, sexuality and a series of seven husbands. Told as an interview from Evelyn in her twilight days, the novel charts a course through her career and personal relationship, showing not only the woman behind the curtain but also the oppressive burdens of conforming to social demands and living behind the mask of a highly calculated identity. This book is as engaging as a blockbuster hit, moving through an episodic structure framed by each of her marriages that serve as a front to hide her true self and sexuality. Yet can her love for Celia flourish when it must be hidden in shadows? The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo has an excellent cast of characters and often functions as a character study in a way that respects how people are complex and full of contradiction. This is a rather empathetic and moving look at mid-century queer identities, making for a potent novel on ambition, authenticity and love caught in the maelstrom of fame and power dynamics of a society that can propel you to the top but tear you to shreds if you step outside the facades of self which become nothing more than gilded cages. ‘When you're given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world doesn't give things, you take things. If you learn one thing from me, it should probably be that.’Thank you to Luh for the recommendation because this was such a delightful and gripping read. I tore through this in a day, pulled along by Reid’s infectious way of unleashing surprising revelations while teasing a fuller understanding still hidden in the shadows. Which is exactly the experience of Monique, the journalist Evelyn contacts after reading her article on assisted suicide, being told these tales and wondering ‘is Evelyn Hugo going to tell me just enough to keep me on the edge of my seat but never enough to truly reveal anything?’ Little does Monique know that behind Evelyn’s spectacle of false self hide secrets that can change everything Monique knows about her own life forever. It all feels particularly vibrant in the historical setting—I love the inclusion of news articles that help ground it but also give an external view of Evelyn's image—which is all bolstered by Evelyn being inspired by the lives of real woman much in the way that I found Daisy Jones & the Six to be so engrossingly immersed in the people and period of its setting. In an interview with the Huffington Post, Reid says that Evelyn was most notably inspired by actress Elizabeth Taylor,who was married 8 times to 7 men.‘You can’t write about an iconic Hollywood star of the sixties without bumping up against Elizabeth Taylor. And, obviously, the many marriages is a very striking thing Evelyn and Liz have in common. I tried to craft a realistic portrayal of a deeply glamorous and scandalous woman. And when you do that, you’re bound to hit some of the same beats as the great Elizabeth Taylor.’Though Reid has also revealed that the story is inspired by Ava Gardner’s life confession being told to a journalist who would publish Ava Gardner: The Secret Conversations as well as Rita Hayworth and her multiple marriages. What works so wonderfully here is that Reid’s story tells a side of 1960s Hollywood that was often brushed under the rug, focusing the novel on queer relationships with a diverse cast of characters.‘If I want things to change, I have to change how I do things. And probably drastically.’The story unfolds split into segments titled after judgemental nicknames for the titular 7 husbands which are very quickly revealed to be marriages serving Evelyn’s overall facade. Every aspect of her public image is an acutely coordinated mask, from her dyed-blonde hair to hide her Cuban heritage in a society that rejects anything other than whiteness to marriages to co-stars that help drive ticket sales, help her reach her larger goals, or redirect attention away from her actual private life. That she is an actress by trade feels a natural extension to her abilities as a master manipulator, understanding that beauty and sex are keys that can unlock many doors. Though one should never mistake this as Evelyn holding power over others, as Reid is careful to point out that the industry is gatekept by men and society at large prioritizes patriarchy. Reid excels at historical fiction that reframes the narratives on glamorous lifestyles to show the mechanisms of misogyny and gatekeeping functioning behind the scenes in order to present patriarchy as if it were the natural order and not highly coordinated (like Evelyn’s own image), which was an aspect I greatly enjoyed in Daisy Jones & The Six as well. Even if one might accuse Evelyn as using beauty to get ahead, it is beauty gazed in service to men’s desires. As Tressie McMillan Cottom discusses in her book Thick: And Other Essays: 'Beauty is not good capital. It compounds the oppression of gender. It constrains those who identify as women against their will. It costs money and demands money. It colonizes. It hurts. It is painful. It can never be fully satisfied. It is not useful for human flourishing. Beauty is, like all capital, merely valuable.'Evelyn knows this and is able to harness it in order to survive, with warnings like ‘be wary of men with something to prove,’ while knowing these are also the sort of men that can be manipulated if them using Evelyn as an accessory for their image can be employed to also serve Evelyn’s needs. It also shows that the world will steamroll those who don’t stick up for themselves and that those who are trying to prove themselves and have an unearned sense of deserving (like, just being a man in a world that caters to you) sometimes put their morality on mute in order to throw people under the proverbial bus or into the fire to suit their needs.‘My mother raised me to be polite, to be demure. I have long operated under the idea that civility is subservience. But it hasn't gotten me very far, that type of kindness. The world respects people who think they should be running it.’The novel does frequently remind us that society puts white, cis, hetero men on a pedestal at the exclusion and often oppression of all others. This is message behind great jabs like ‘make them pay you what they would pay a white man,’ and the frustration fueling lines like ‘you wonder what it must be like to be a man, to be so confident that the final say is yours.’ Still it is well crafted how Evelyn learns to take control over her sexuality and orchestrate the press around it in ways that she decides but we see how this facade hides a lot of pain, most notably the attention to the make-up Evelyn wears to cover up the bruises and abuses of Don. Later in life Evelyn is frustrated that people such as Max only love her or regard her as a sex symbol rather than a person.'Did I want to make as much money as Don? Of course I did. I wanted to get the paycheck and mail a copy of it to him with a photo of my middle finger. But mostly I wanted the freedom to do whatever I wanted.'The truth behind Evelyn’s social mask is that she is in love with Celia, a truth that could destroy both of their careers in a time of rampant homophobia. Queer lives are centered in this book, with Harry being a major player as well, and his near inability to vocalize his sexuality to Evelyn is symbolic of how the harsh treatment of LGBTQ+ identities often leads to self-denial or other struggles from either fear or internalized homophobia. Outing a person is used as a weapon, which is evinced when Ruby outing Celia to Evelyn is meant to tarnish her reputation and crumble her career. A warning that the characters read loud and clear about what is at stake just for being themselves. Reid has plenty of clever symbolism in the novel and the literary references in these character's acting roles emphasize the many themes. There is Celia and Evelyn's role in an adaptation of Little Women, a novel that emphasizes the struggles of women's ambitions in a world that disregards women. Evelyn's role as Jo highlights that Evelyn prioritizes ambition over happiness (also, perhaps, that Jo is sometimes theorized to be a lesbian who must marry a man because *does air quotes while rolling eyes* society). Celia cast as Beth is also apt, as Connor points out Beth just wants everyone to be happy and Celia tends to prioritize Evelyn's happiness over her own. Later Evelyn stars in an adaptation of Anna Karenina which nudges the themes of unhappy marriage, affairs, and suicide. ‘People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.’Perhaps the most powerful imagery in the novel, however, comes when Evelyn chips her tooth kissing the television screen when Celia wins her Oscar. It is a potent moment about how her true desire would be a social blemish far greater than the now blemish on her perfect teeth and smile. Though I have to saw the twist at the ending was great. I mean aJawMeetFloorkind of good. I’ve seen people make the argument they say it coming so it wasn’t good but I think that is beside the point—it was so tragic and powerful because its indicative of all the ways the gatekeeping and homophobia of society means you aren’t safe even in death. Anyways, I dug it and really brings the whole book to a close in a way where the support beams of facades have been pulled and all theyve held up comes crumbling down. Nailed it, Reid.'And to be honest, I like how calculating and awful you kind of are.'Though another aspect I really enjoyed was the way Reid is careful to show people as dynamic individuals and how everyone has flaws and struggles and that is just what being human is about. People are complex, people contain multitudes. We see how it is sometimes difficult to even know what the right choices are, or how what needs to be done for a career or ambition can be harmful to one’s personal life or how a morally grey situation can have definitive moral repercussions.‘No one is just a victim or a victor. Everyone is somewhere in between. People who go around casting themselves as one or the other are not only kidding themselves, but they’re also painfully unoriginal.’I like this idea that looking at people in terms of black and white is scoffed at as just another form of posturing, or like another form of the masks people live behind in this novel. I like too how Reid uses this as a commentary on society wanting to fit people in boxes but these boxes can never contain all of a self. Even sexuality as Evelyn points out saying ‘I'm bisexual. Don't ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box.’ I also REALLY appreciated the bisexual representation, more of us please!‘And I didn’t say I was confessing any sins. To say that what I have to tell is a sin is misleading and hurtful. I don’t feel regret for the things I’ve done – at least, not the things you might expect – despite how hard they may have been or how repugnant they may seem in the cold light of day.’For those looking for a rip-roaring read of social criticisms or historical fiction that centers the human narrative over the historical features, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a great choice. I burned through this with an intensity as if I had to match the intensity with which Evelyn lived her life. The prose style helps, being pretty simple in the sort of way that lends itself to a cavalcade of quotable lines and while I didn’t think I needed another novel via interview style, it all made it more engaging. A quick but powerful novel that reminds us that people of color and LGBTQ+ people have always been a part of history even if they are brushed under the rug. A delightful book, I’ve come to quite enjoy Taylor Jenkins Reid.4.5/5‘ I have been married seven times, and never once has it felt half as right as this.

Moving through the horrors of the past across generations of violence, genocide and institutional or social erasures and on into a present day of lingering traumas and addictions, Wandering Stars works something like a Godfather Pt 2 to his 2018 novel, There There, being simultaneously a sequel and prequel to the events of that book. We last encountered Orvil Red Feather as yet another victim to gun violence in the final pages of There, There, though this story on the legacy that brought his bloodline to that moment of bloodshed as well as the volatile recovery in the aftermath could just as easily be read as a stand-alone. Still, it was delightful to revisit familiar characters as well as many new ones, each with an impressively distinct voice in a narrative propelled by Orange’s extraordinary acrobatic use of language. Wandering Stars is a sharp critique on a bloodsoaked American history, tracing trauma from colonization and forced assimilation into addictions and fractured histories, though there is still a light and a heavy hope ‘making this place more than its accumulated pain.’ ‘Surviving wasn't enough. To endure or pass through endurance test after endurance test only ever gave you endurance test passing abilities. Simply lasting was great for a wall, for a fortress, but not for a person.’Where There, There was caught in a breakneck inertia spiraling towards impending disaster, Wandering Stars does a lot of, well, wandering. We move across history through the many generations of the Red Feather family, taking us from the Sand Creek massacre and into the Carlisle Indian Industrial School forced assimilation programs or prisons. This is juxtaposed with a narrative set in the present following Orvil and several other familiar characters. It meanders but never flails, stepping in wide rings of time, sending its prose to swoop and soar, until finally you find a rhythm moving underneath it all and the narrative becomes a sort of dance. A celebration amidst the sadness, a tribute to the past and a plea for the future.‘Stories do more than comfort. They take you away and bring you back better made.’While this is a larger story made up of the amalgamation of multiple stories, this is also—in many ways—a story about stories and why they matter. Charles’ notes that his incomplete memories are nothing more than ‘a broken mirror, through which he only ever sees himself in pieces,’ which nudges a central theme on how we use histories or stories as ways to understand our pasts and ourselves. A boy asks ‘why there weren’t any Native American superheroes,’ or a woman in midcentury America is told by a librarian there doesn’t seem to be any books written by indigenous authors. Instead they must see the world through the narratives of people who look like the ‘very kind of men some of us had seen wipe our people out.’ It’s why publishers need to ensure inclusive collections, its why we should make space for more voices lest we choke off storytelling as another form of silencing. That the character Jude witness so many atrocities but is mute and unable to vocalize them is a powerful metaphor, especially juxtaposed with the personal memoirs Charles is able to leave behind. Language and writing become a haven, and it is in learning to read and copy the Bible that we find the titular wandering star of the novel:‘Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever.’That Orange is a superb storyteller makes it all the better. Orange has a dynamic range of voice, moving between characters as well as from fiction to nonfiction passages. Orange has often cited influences in authors like Roberto Bolaño, Clarice Lispector, Jorge Luis Borges, or Javier Marías because they are ‘ not afraid to be really cerebral but also somehow have excellent pacing at same time,’ though many of the passages in Stars feels closer to the mechanics of one of his other favorites: José Saramago. Such as this passage which meticulously weaves languages while winding its way through the halls of history: ‘When the Indian Wars began to go cold, the theft of land and tribal sovereignty bureaucratic, they came for Indian children, forcing them into boarding schools, where if they did not die of what they called consumption even while they regularly were starved; if they were not buried in duty, training for agricultural or industrial labor, or indentured servitude; were they not buried in children’s cemeteries, or in unmarked graves, not lost somewhere between the school and home having run away, unburied, unfound, lost to time, or lost between exile and refuge, between school, tribal homelands, reservation, and city; if they made it through routine beatings and rape, if they survived, made lives and families and homes, it was because of this and only this: Such Indian children were made to carry more than they were made to carry.’He is speaking of the horrors faced by thousands of indigenous children in boarding school programs that ran under the slogan ‘Kill the Indian, Save the Man’ in an attempt to push ‘the vanishing race off into final captivity before disappearing into history forever.’ This is why survival becomes so key in the novel, though merely surviving is often not enough. Often survival is its own trade off with destruction, such as how the granting of citizenship and assimilation was an effort to dissolve—'a kind of chemical word for a gradual death of tribes and Indians, a clinical killing, designed by psychopaths calling themselves politicians'—the tribes and erase tribal identity. The Termination policies enacted in 1953 forced full citizenship as a way to end federal recognition of tribes and transfer reservation legal jurisdiction over to the federal government, all despite indigenous peoples already being granted citizenship in 1924. As is often the case, language becomes a mask for cruelty.‘I think I needed to feel the bottom to know how to rise. Maybe we're all looking for our bottoms and tops in search of balance, where the loop feels just right, and like it's not just rote, not just repetition, but a beautiful echo, one so entrenching we lose ourselves in it.’The novel is wracked with scenes of addiction, poverty and heartbreak but also the dilemma of a disconnect with the past. A large theme of There, There touched on how indigenous identity was often difficult to pin down in the modern world, a theme that continues here. While there is the recognition that ‘no Indians from when they first named us Indians would recognize us as Indians now,’ even Orvil admits that in the present day many of the historical indigenous practices they keep alive ‘can feel corny, and fake, or like trying too hard for something that wasn’t really there.’ Times change, identity shifts, and how can one feel the pulse of the past when the nation spent so much effort and violence into erasing their stories. Though this is not necessarily a complete loss as the novel notes that change is natural and life flows into life, such as the family lineage going from Stars to Bear Shields and eventually Red Feathers. The family marches forward through time even when beleaguered by external aggressions or internal struggles.Ultimately, Wandering Stars captures ‘the kind of love that survives surviving.’ It is the thing that keeps us going, the heavy hope we are willing to carry. This is an ambitious novel, a bit quieter and looser than its predecessor, and it seeks to capture the truly expansive ideas and questions on identity and history. While perhaps it overreaches at times and can occasionally feel like checking as many boxes of themes as possible instead of thoroughly exploring a tighter few, Orange manages to carry his ideas into fruition and craft an engaging novel that achieves its goals. 4.5/5'Everything about your life will feel impossible. And you being or becoming an Indian will feel the same. Nevertheless you will be an Indian and an American and a woman and a human wanting to belong to what being human means.'...more",Notes are private!,51,208,1,"Mar 05, 2024","Mar 05, 2024","Mar 05, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/174147294-wandering-stars

Being on either end, to be clear. ‘Murder is always a mistake,’ wrote Oscar Wilde, ‘one should never do anything one cannot talk about after dinner.’ Yet for Ernest Cunningham, his entire family has each snuffed out a bloke or few so why not gather the family for a reunion where the topic makes for a great dinnertime conversation and a whole weekend merriment of murders, motives and mystery. And I gotta say, it makes for a snarkily charming read. The comical directness of the title, Everyone In My Family Has Killed Someone, is indicative of the jaunty jocularity that Benjamin Stevenson provides for the narrative, often winking at the reader through a rather metafictional narration that doesn’t just break the fourth wall but has already added it to the growing pile of corpses in the novel. Equipped with a headful of knowledge on the rules for murder mystery plots and their tropes, can Ernest navigate the increasing number of family fatalities or will Ern find his final resting place inside an urn in this playful romp that takes the vibes of Golden Age detective fiction out of the quaint English country home and implants them into our modern mania for a high-tension whodunit.‘Everyone in my family has killed someone. Some of us, the high achievers, have killed more than once.’Stevenson says this book came from a simple premise, but with a twist characteristic of his plot reveal techniques: ‘ what if I spoiled the entire book on the first page,’ he says in an interview, ‘can I build a crime novel out of it?’ It is an intriguing idea, and one that he executes wonderfully with some clever narrative slight of hand while also reviving a cozy and familiar detective style in a way that feels simultaneously fresh yet familiar. While this is the first in what appears to be an ongoing series of Ernest Cunningham stumbling upon killing sprees, I had previously read the second book—Everyone on This Train Is a Suspect—with my bookclub. I spent a good deal of time on the meta-elements in that , which you can read here and found them to be more of less the same here. Claiming to dislike the modern mystery tropes of unreliable narrators as a means to keep key details in the shadows, Ernest assures you his narration is all in earnest. The gag, however, is that secrets can also hide in the light of truth and much of the fun is discovering that we have been bamboozled by a bumbling of truthful statements. ‘But I promised to be reliable, not competent,’ he chides. This is made all the more engaging through Ern’s frequent references to Ronald Knox’s ten commandments of detective fiction.1.The criminal must be someone mentioned in the early part of the story, but must not be anyone whose thoughts the reader has been allowed to follow.2.All supernatural or preternatural agencies are ruled out as a matter of course.3.Not more than one secret room or passage is allowable.4.No hitherto undiscovered poisons may be used, nor any appliance which will need a long scientific explanation at the end.5.No racist Chinese laborer (okay he used another term...) must figure in the story.6.No accident must ever help the detective, nor must he ever have an unaccountable intuition which proves to be right.7.The detective must not himself commit the crime.8.The detective must not light on any clues which are not instantly produced for the inspection of the reader.9.The stupid friend of the detective, the Watson, must not conceal any thoughts which pass through his mind; his intelligence must be slightly, but very slightly, below that of the average reader. (It's me, the stupid friend)10.Twin brothers, and doubles generally, must not appear unless we have been duly prepared for them.As many of the Golden Age detective writers often broke these rules, its a humorous play on the idea that you need to know the rules to break them well. It makes for an impish twist on the unreliable narrator trope that, while fresh on a first read, felt a little stale on the second novel unfortunately (though this is the first, to be clear, I did it backwards but can also assure you that aside from like, obviously Ern is going to survive to star in a sequel, the two books could be read interchangeably or one without the other just fine). I’d also add that the twists work a bit better here, though this novel isn’t quite as tight.It is a crisp, fun little tale though. Ern has been invited to a family reunion at a ski resort to await his brother Michale’s release from prison. Except Ern was the informant who got him put away. Cue the *record scratch* The death toll begins to rise and the plot thickens as new insights and unraveled mysteries about all the murders in his family history begin to surface. It pays tribute to familiar stories and ideas, most notably the works of Agatha Christie, and puts a fresh new coat of paint on Golden Age detective fiction. Its like finding your old Clue board game in your grandmother’s basement but when you blow the dust off its a shiny new package and a rule book written with sardonic wit that tries to throw you off your game.  Everyone In My Family Has Killed Someone is a fun little detective thriller with plenty of twists but also suffers a bit by being too smart for its own good. I did enjoy the style, which seems ripe for a movie adaptation (I imagine it in my mind much like the fourth wall breaking and over caffeinated energy of the Enola Holmes films, but instead everyone is Australian and ripe with vice), though I see how it could be grating for some. I think I would have enjoyed it a tad more had I read it first as the gag wears a little thin on a revisit. Still, this is a lively tale that balances the lethal with the levity and I will be looking forward to another Ern adventure.3.5/5‘Family is not whose blood runs in your veins, it's who you'd spill it for.’...more",Notes are private!,31,183,1,Mar 2024,Mar 2024,"Mar 01, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/166998699-everyone-in-my-family-has-killed-someone

This is very much my sort of thing. Oh wait, I’m getting ahead of myself, we should do a Review right? Stefon, this is a GOODREADS. Okay, okay, you’re right, here goes:Memory is a butterfly flitting by in flashes and if we try to pin it down, to put our finger on the fluttering of the past, it often turns to powder upon our fingers. Memory fades or is altered by our act of trying to capture it, yet memory also has the ability to seemingly fold time. ‘Very early in my life, it was too late,’ French author Marguerite Duras writes in The Lover, a statement that directly addresses the method for which past and present become intertwined and timeless in her recollections much the way this novelistic memoir blends biography and fiction. The result is pure literary bliss. Winner of the 1984 Prix Goncourt and presented here in beautiful translation by Barbara Bray (for which she was awarded the Scott Moncrieff Prize in 1986) that captures the endlessly poetic potency of Duras’ prose, The Lover is a novel of memory, but it is also an examination of desire and navigating the self amidst family, death, social class and social taboos. This is also a novel of crossings such as the girl’s crossing of the Mekong river that often feels like the center of gravity to the narrative, the crossing of culture and age between the girl and the older Chinese man who becomes her lover, and even a crisscrossing of the timeline found in the fragmentary narrative style. A whirlwind of reflections and the ravages of desire, The Lover is as crisp as it is confident and completely shook up my heart.  [image]From the 1992 film adaptation by Jean-Jacques Annaud Duras constructs a portrait of a woman across her many ages, all spiraling into one, and opens on a pitch perfect look at the course of a life all within one face:‘One day, I was already old, in the entrance of a public place a man came up to me. He introduced himself and said, “I’ve known you for years. Everyone says you were beautiful when you were young, but I want to tell you I think you’re more beautiful now than then. Rather than your face as a young woman, I prefer your face as it is now. Ravaged.’This was a book that completely ravaged me as well. With Duras’ exquisite prose punctuated by bold assertions and harsh assessments, with the exhaustion of fragile love at the mercy to society yet burning with unquenchable passion, with the haunting looks at family and identity in the clutches of social order and colonialism, and with the rapid fire of memories that are practically flung into your face. The story is told in brief vignettes that ignore any linearity. The reflections come almost at random and almost all at once, as if Duras has dropped and shattered a jar of memories and is frantically gathering them up as they attempt to roll away underfoot. These memories are based in biography (though no previous knowledge of Duras is necessary) but take wings of fiction, almost as if to impress the theme that to touch memory or to try and understand or shape it is to rewrite it and overlay the elusive past. It’s as she writes herself:‘The story of my life doesn’t exist. Does not exist. There’s never any centre to it. No path, no line. There are great spaces where you pretend there used to be someone, but it’s not true, there was no one. The story of one small part of my youth I’ve already written, more or less — I mean, enough to give a glimpse of it. Of this part, I mean, the part about the crossing of the river. What I’m doing now is both different and the same.’You can feel this strong lifeforce in every sentence and word as Duras transforms herself into art upon the page. The story bears many similarities to the film Hiroshima mon amour, for which Duras’ wrote the screenplay, and plays with Duras’ own experience in Vietnam when it was still called French Indochina. It was her most popular novel, published when Duras was 70, though while working on the 1992 film adaptation she would lament over the popularity of the book. In her biography Marguerite Duras: A Life by Laure Adler, Duras is quoted as telling director Jean-Jacques Annaud ‘the Lover is a load of shit…it’s an airport novel. I wrote it when I was drunk.’ Personally I found it delightful but I do enjoy the admission of intoxication during the writing process as the cavalcade of observations strung across tenuous connections does indeed feel like the confident logic of a brilliant mind greased up and ready to rant after a few drinks.‘She wasn’t sure that she hadn’t loved him with a love she hadn’t seen because it had lost itself in the affair like water in sand and she rediscovered it only now, through this moment of music flung across the sea.’The novel is best remembered for the relationship between the teenage girl and the older, wealthy Chinese man she meets after crossing the Mekong River. Crossings are a large theme of the novel, and while the girl only crosses the river twice, the second time to leave the man behind and return to France, the narrator is now crossing for a third time—metaphorically—to reinvestigate the site of her memories. It is a taboo relationship, though the focus is less on the torrid love affair and more on the curious power dynamics between them. He is wealthy, experienced and much older (it is mentioned he would be arrested due to her being so young), yet, socially, she holds all the power. She is French and white and he is Chinese. She is the colonizer and he is the colonized. Even her poverty seems to not matter and she admits he is only able to obtain her because of his access to wealth.‘poverty had knocked down the walls of the family and we were all left outside, each one fending for himself. Shameless, that’s what we were. That’s how I came to be here with you.’A lot of this book takes a swift swipe at the house of cards that is patriarchy and masculinity. The girl (the unnamed characters make them fairly symbolic as a larger social critique, perchance?) has no masculine figure in her life (her father has been in the ground a minute) and often adopts elements of gender-role-reversal. It is in order to obtain a way away from this life as she understand that the goal in life is ‘not that you have to achieve anything, it’s that you have to get away from where you are.’ Her most distinguishing visual element frequently referenced in the text is a large, flat-brimmed hat usually worn by men. While being noted as a discounted hat to nudge the aspect of her poverty and resourcefulness, it also shows her taking on a masculine role almost as a costume and a symbol of her desire for independence. It works, as it does attract her lover and gives her access to his money, and we see how she frequently describes him in terms of weakness and subservience to her. Even his sense of dominance as sexually experienced is described in terms as a response to fear: ‘he’s a man who must make love a lot, a man who’s afraid, he must make love a lot to fight against fear.’This stems from another element of the strange power dynamic too. Even despite the inappropriateness , legally and socially, of him sleeping with a minor she is still in a position of dominance due to her status as a white, French family. There is a startling moment where he is trying to impress her family, showing them the sights and cuisine and they refuse to even acknowledge he exists. The man is in tears asking why they abuse him so as they ignore him, gorging themselves on food and insulting the city. It is a powerful moment that shows the rampant racism embedded in obdurate social hierarchies where even this millionaire is less than human to the poor, white family. ‘I am worn out with desire.’ More on the family in a moment but I can’t move away from the erotic aspects of the novel and the discussions on sex and the body as a sort of metaphor for land being colonized without also bringing up the queer desires in the novel. The narrator reflects on Hélène Lagonelle and her nude body, bold and unashamed as if oblivious to the desire and power her naked figure represents. It is through her that the narrator wishes to pass her sexual appetites for the man into her, almost as if conquering Hélène’s body by having his be the one to take it as he does her own. ‘I’d like to devour and be devoured by those flour-white breasts of hers,’ she thinks, ‘I am worn out with desire for Hélène Lagonelle.’‘We, her children, are heroic, dersperate.’Her family is another major theme of the novel, such as her disdain for her older brother, her passion and awareness of mortality found in her younger brother and most notable, the struggles to keep a family and her own mental state together found in the mother. The Lover is as much a portrait of the mother as it is the daughter. It is a family held together by shame, disgraced by their fall from financial security yet still higher on the social hierarchy in French Indochina. But also this passage completely slayed me:‘We're united in a fundamental shame at having to live. It's here we are at the heart of our common fate, the fact that all three of us are our mother's children, the children of a candid creature murdered by society. We're on the side of the society which has reduced her to despair. Because of what's been done to our mother, so amiable, so trusting, we hate life, we hate ourselves.’While society is constantly seen as the oppressor—more so for the lover, who is even threatened to be cut off from his family fortune if he continues with the girl—they also, shamefully, cling to society in the ways it gives them a leg up. It becomes rather self-effacing. Though the brother, who is a real shithead, also further represents colonialism, refusing to find work and spending his days engaged in theft and perversion to uphold himself. The younger brother, however, becomes the doorway through which the narrator learns ‘immortality is mortal.’ His death shakes her and makes her realize life is fleeting and death is inevitable.‘its while its being lived that life is immortal, while its still alive. Immortality is not a matter of more or less time, its not really a question of immortality but of something else that remains unknown’All this culminates into her turning both inward and backward on her life in reflection. It is notable that her reflections tend to focus on photographs and images of herself, as a primary theme of the novel is the idea that the self shown to the world, ones image, is what society values. There is a strong juxtaposition of interior self versus exterior self, and her reflections attempt to bridge the gaps.‘It's as if they were happy, and as if it came from outside themselves. And I have nothing like that.’In her novel Shame, French Nobel Prize winner Annie Ernaux contrasts her ideas of memory with that of Marcel Proust, for whom memory is exterior to the self. She explains his perspective of memory found in ‘things linked to the earth that recur periodically, confirming the permanence of mankind.’ For Ernaux, however, she finds ‘ the act of remembering can do nothing to reaffirm my sense of identity or continuity. It can only confirm the fragmented nature of my life and the belief that I belong to history.’ Duras’ The Lover seems to align more with Ernaux, particularly in the fragmented nature of the self as reflected by the narrative style, but also that the external self is a false self that does not serve as a reliable compass towards identity. It is more fit for social hierarchy and posturing, though she also finds this serves a purpose that the interior self cannot achieve. It is only late in life with a ‘ravaged face’ that she feels her external and internal self align more authentically. A moving and often devastating read, The Lover contains multitudes in its succinct space. It is no wonder this has become a classic work and Duras certainly demonstrates her exemplary prowess of prose and thought.4.5/5‘And it really was unto death.

This is certainly the case with Ai Weiwei who one cannot mention in terms of his art—be it his sculptures, photographs, documentaries or other installation pieces—without also discussing his activism, as if the two were simply dual appendages of the same body. His arrest in 2011 became a flashpoint for human rights and other activist organizations and as he was held for 81 days without a charge he quickly became a world renown symbol of artistic resistance and the importance of freedoms of speech and expression. Here Ai Weiwei along with Elettra Stamboulis tells his life story in graphic format with illustrations by Gianluca Costantini being both a memoir and a profound and philosophical musing on art, resistance and the importance of making your voice heard despite the powers that would rather have it be silent. This makes a great companion piece to his previous memoir, 1000 Years of Joys and Sorrows: A Memoir from 2021. Told in a conversational style between Ai and his son or with interviewers and other artists, interspersed with mythological tales and framed around reflections on the zodiac signs in relation to activism, this is a fascinating and thought provoking look into the life and mind of this great artist.  [image]‘Art is just the beginning’I was lucky enough to see an exhibit of Ai Weiwei’s work when several pieces of his collection came to Grand Rapids, Mi in 2017. I’ve long been fascinated with him both as an artist but also as a symbol for the possibilities of art as activism and bold statements of freedom so this was a really engaging and enjoyable look at his life as well as his reflections on his own works. ‘Power is so afraid of art and poets,’ Ai tells us, ‘art has the possibility to defend very essential rights’ and he examines how many pieces of his own work set out to do just that. There are some great commentaries on works like his fairytale project at Documenta 12, the message behind his sunflower seeds, his work on the Birds Nest olympic stadium, or his collection of names of students killed in the Sichuan earthquake about which he says ‘All the silence from the State apparatus cannot erase the persistent memories of the survivors. We have to remember at least their names.’ He reflects upon his imprisonment, the demolition of his studio by the government, his inability to leave China after he was released and more. I also enjoyed that the book was structured around ideas of the zodiac, reflecting his own sculpture piece Circle of Animals/Zodiac Heads.  [image]Photo from when I saw the Ai Weiwei exhibit in Grand Rapids‘Art is against repetition. It’s about leading us toward more dangerous ways of experiencing ourselves.’Beyond his own life, Ai Weiwei also discusses the works of other important activists such as Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiabo or Ai Weiwei’s own father, Ai Qing who faced imprisonment and exile as well. Through it all he discusses how art is always a fight for freedom.  [image]I really enjoyed this book and learned a lot reading it. It is really well paced and covers a lot of ground, both historically and philosophically. I love his love of poetry and belief in the power of art, it is truly inspiring. The artwork in this collection is wonderful too, often representing famous photographs of Ai Weiwei and his works while also moving into really surreal imagery. This is a great format for this work as it, too, is a work of art but is also very accessible to get the message across to a wide range of readers across a wide age range (this would work great in a high school classroom, for instance).  [image]Perhaps my favorite moment of the book comes early on, however, in his discussion on why cats are left out of the Chinese zodiac. He explains to his son that he loves cats because they are ‘n animal that cat open doors, but they are different from human beings because they don’t close the doors behind them.’ He sees this as a symbol of great art: ‘The key is to keep the doors open…like the cats, we have to keep the door that we call freedom of speech and thought open.’ So perhaps we should all be more like the cat and keep the door open for art and freedom of expression. Zodiac is a lovely graphic novel.4/5  [image]What would a book on Ai Weiwei be without his iconic middle finger?...more",Notes are private!,12,111,1,"Feb 28, 2024","Feb 28, 2024","Feb 28, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/139400708-zodiac

It has come to our attention that while we are out on walks, our roommates—the cats—have been writing s (Exhibit A). Which is fine we guess, but that famous Emily Dickinson poem doesn’t begin with ‘started early, took my cat’ does it? Certainly not, she took her dog. And you wouldn’t want poetry recommendations without taking a dog would you? Certainly not. That is why we, Frida and Zelda, s.penkevich’s dogs, have found it in our hearts to tell you about this fetching piece of literature: Dog Songs by the late, great poet Mary Oliver. The poetry in this collection is as delicious as a mailman’s ass new squeaky toy with plenty to chew on and savor. Oliver explores the endearing bond between dogs and the people we keep as pets across touching prose that will have you howling with joy and wiping away tears in remembrance of our fellow dogs now gone to the big dog park in the sky as Oliver reflects on the past dogs in her life. I hope she’s up there throwing them a great big bone right now. It is also illustrated with some lovely artwork by John Burgoyne, in case you humans needed to be reminded how adorable us dogs are.

Howl you all doing? Mary Oliver was such a blessing to poetry and I truly appreciate that she devoted an entire collection to discussing how much a blessing dogs. Devoted. Let’s just paws on that word a moment. We are always there to love you. ‘Steadfastness, it seems,’ Oliver writes, ‘Is more about dogs than about us / One of the reasons we love them so much.’That’s right. Steadfast devotion. Who is always there for you? Dogs. Who snuggles you at night even breaking the no dogs on the bed rule to make sure you get a snuggle?. We do. Who helps you finish your delicious meals? We do. Who makes sure you get plenty of exercise and practice your ball throwing? We do. Who makes sure you know there is someone biking down the sidewalk right now, hey hey HEY there is someone on the sidewalk there is also a SQUIRREL, HEY HEY HEY!!! Hold on, read this in my absence:‘Because of the dog’s joyfulness, our own is increased. It is no small gift. It is the reason why we should honor as well as love the dog of our own life, and the dog down the street, and all the dogs yet not born. What would the world be like without music or rivers or the green and tender grass? What would this world be like without dogs?’Ahem, anyway… What would the world be like without dogs indeed? Oliver excels at capturing the beauty of life in her works and really channels all her talents into the joy of companionship with us fine dogs. I love the way she captures how good and special we make you humans feel, such as in this passage about her own dog, Percy:‘thinking how grateful I am for the moon’sperfect beauty and also, oh! how richit is to love the world. Percy, meanwhile,leans against me and gazes up intomy face. As though I were just as wonderfulas the perfect moon.’But Oliver also examines the joy felt by dogs, such as a poem of dogs befriending each other playing on the beach or running free in the wilderness. Oliver takes a firm stance that she loves ‘dogs without leashes’ the best and that a dog on a leash ‘is a possession only, the ornament of a human life,’ which we understand because we do love to be able to roam free, but we also think of our fellow city dogs and that a leash can be a way to keep us and others safe. We suspect humans will have a lot of Big thoughts on this to argue about, just make sure whatever you decide you still take us on our walks and runs.‘For there was nothing sweeter than hisPeaceWhen at rest.For there was nothing brisker than his lifewhenIn motion’For all the happiness in this collection, there is a lot of heartbreak too. We may be superheroes, but we do not live forever. Oliver reflects on her past dogs and how much we can touch lives in such a short span of time. It may bring a few tears to your eyes. Don’t worry we will be here to lick your face clean after. Just remember to always hold us in your hearts.‘And now you’ll be telling storiesof my coming backand they won’t be false, and they won’t be true,but they’ll be real.’So there it is, the dog recommendation for your reading pleasure.

You’ve all been probably wondering “what do cats think of poetry?” You’ve probably lost sleep over this important mystery, so we are here to assure you that cats do indeed love poetry. ESPECIALLY poetry about cats, such as you’ll find here in Cat Poems, a cute little pocket sized book edited by Tynan Kogane. It’s a quaint and rather eclectic cat-alogue of poems with many familiar names (and a few rather well known poems like The Owl and the Pussycat) like Emily Dickinson, William Carlos Williams, W.B. Yeats or Rainer Maria Rilke, but New Direction publishing pulled out some more niche poets that we were really thrilled to see like Nicanor Parra, Fernando Pessoa, and we were certainly thrilled that one of s.’ favorite writers, Roberto Bolaño, was included. ‘My ideal cat has always had a huge rat in it’s mouth, just going out of sight’ wrote Emily Dickinson and we’d like to say YES, let us have rats. Let us have our fun, Emily gets it. There’s some wonderful poems in here about how cute and cuddly we are, bestowing the love we damned well deserve in some lovely poetic wrappings. We also appreciate the poems that acknowledge that cats are superior and do what we want. ‘I control the mice with a cat,’ Franz Kafka writes, ‘but how shall I control the cat?’ You can’t, fool. We rule, you’ll have to get used to it. Muriel Spark gets it, she even wrote that had she not been christian ‘I would worship the cat.’ Bow down, mortal humans. Gavin Ewart even provides a sonnet on such matters, the first stanza goes as follows:Cat sentimentality is a human thing. Catsare indifferent, their minds can't comprehendthe concept 'I shall die', they just go on living.Death is more foreign to their thought thanto us the idea of a lime-green lobster. That'swhy holding these warm containers of purring furis poignant, that they just don't know.Life is in them, like the brandy in the bottle.Like brandy in the bottle, baby. And not to complain but we do comprehend death. We just don’t care. THAT SAID, there are a few poets here who don’t seem to appreciate our superiority and pure lovability. William Carlos Williams even writes ‘I wish you had not come here.’ Okay, rude. And take this little scrawling by Kenneth Rexroth for instance:There are too many poemsAbout cats. Beware of catLovers, they have a hiddenFrustration somewhere and willstick you with it if they can.Okay, Kenneth, first of all fuck you. Secondly…no actually that sums it up. Go back to James Laughlin talking about leaving poets at his beloved’s feet like a cat leaves the thoughtful gift of a dead mouse. He gets it. Or Ezra Pound saying our purring is ‘both stimulating and delightful.’ Thanks, buddy.

Accidental author Ernest Cunningham is trainbound, riding high on the success of his memoir and dodging the due-dates of his follow-up novel on his way to a crime-writing festival when he finds himself yet again amidst a nightmare of bloodshed. Hijinks ensue. But a train full of people who plot out killing sprees and clues is bound to solve this locked-door mystery, right? This snarky, self-aware novel, a follow-up to his bestselling Everyone in My Family Has Killed Someone, is witty and waggish though the ending does remind me of those moments in Project Runway when Christian Siriano admits an idea is good but the execution is “overworking the fabric.” Still this is a charming whodunnit with some good twists where even goodreads s show up as a clue that is ultimately an investigation into murder tropes and narrative reveals as much as it is the crime at hand. But what is a desperate crime-writer to do in such circumstances?‘If one of the six of us was to die right now, you'd have five suspects who all know how to get away with murder.’This was the recent read for my book club and I wasn’t sure how jumping into the second novel of a series would go, but Ernest—the fictional author of the book written by Stevenson—insists this can be a starting point as long as it gives enough context to make you still want to read the first novel later (his in-world publisher only seems to give advice ‘via the marketing department’). You can certainly enjoy this without having read the first and the marketing dept apparently did well because now I do want to read the previous book. There’s a charming coyness here with the narrator addressing the reader rather directly, telling the story while also commenting on his own approach to constructing the mystery of it for maximum “mystery novel” vibes. ‘That’s why I’m talking to you like this. I am, you may have realized, a bit chattier than your usual detectives in these books. I’m not going to hide anything from you. This is a fair-play mystery, after all.’Ernest tells us he will be entirely in earnest in his delivery. There’s a rather amusing set-up here that the previous book was Ernest’s memoir and recounting fact where he was a rather unreliable narrator but he has promised his publisher a second book which is to be a fiction novel, this novel, and insisting on being ‘a reliable narrator.’ As is often the case, the people who are loudest about being truthful tend to do so in order to deceive and the playfulness of this story comes from the ways Ernest tells the truth, but framed in a way that misdirects you from putting together the ultimate reveal at the end. Which is fun with clues such as mentioning he will say the killers name ‘exactly 106 times,’ and long discourses on the “rules” of telling a detective novel.While reading this, I spent a lot of time thinking about the aspect of this novel as a self referential examination-by-way-of-narrative. Not that this is anything new and the postmodernists have long written novels about the act of the novel in order to explore the clockwork of narrative or act of reading a book, but I’ve noticed this meta-narrative style has been recently popular when setting its sights on the mechanisms of genre. Books like How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe or, more recently, Emily Henry’s satirical look at romance tropes in Book Lovers have highlighted the thematic blueprints of their respective genres in order to look more deeply into the elements that define each genre. This is the narrative heart to Everyone On This Train Is A Suspect, with Ernest discussing the book in progress as just that: a book to be examined and each sentence picked apart to understand its function in the overall story. The book is self-aware of itself and its tropes and it makes for a rather interesting discussion on how a story like this is set up and why.We all expect twists in a detective story and Stevenson certainly delivers here. The plot performs these surprise acrobatics through a reframing of what we already know, though some of it does feel a bit contrived at the end with the twists more focused on subverting tropes or winking at the reader with a bit of a “gotcha” on technicalities. It is rather fun and I enjoyed how it is aimed as a gag on narratives, and we see how the real detective investigation here is into the mysteries in mystery novels more so than a standard detective solving a murder. Its less a whodunnit and more a “howdunnit” on mystery writing.This was quite the fun little ride. Fast paced yet very conversational (and snarky) in tone, its a novel that teases expectations and invites the reader to theorize and pour over all the narrator’s little hints and elbow nudges to see if they can get to the solution before the big reveal. Is our narrator as honest as he tells us, who wants these mystery writers dead, and did McTavish even need that face to begin with? Everyone On This Train Is a Suspect indeed, including you, dear reader.

It is believed that visual storytelling is the oldest form of storytelling, with the first evidence of it found in the Chauvet cave in France dating back 36,000 years ago telling the story of a volcanic eruption. I’m glad we have graphic novels that still attempt to tell a story full of nuance and emotion without the use of words, such as we find in Natalie Warner’s Rose Wolves, a beautiful little fable about a girl who befriends a wolf that grows out of a flower. It is a touching tale with empowering disability representation that is perfect for both children and adults and deals with themes of friendship but also of letting go. A quick read that manages to convey a lot and fill your heart in such a short space.  [image]I really like the simple and loose art style that only uses red and black (in the notes at the end Warner says the color was inspired by licorice candy) and manages to say a lot without any use of words. It is very fairy tale-esque with a girl finding a den of roses and taking one home, only to discover it grows into a wolf. The wolf mirrors the girl, both missing a limb, and instantly bond though as time passes the wolf’s floral tale begins to wilt and shed petals making the girl realize she must return the wolf to their world in order for them to flourish. It is a beautiful miniature fable about loving and letting go but never fear, it does have a happy ending.  [image]This is a perfect little bedtime story for all ages to enjoy and would make excellent classroom material to discuss how narrative can be conveyed without the use of words and picking up on visual cues. It’s also just very touching and lovely to look at. Plus it is short so it is nice to revisit more than once, just like the girl returning to the woods to visit the wolf. A bit slight yet still a fulfilling and heartwarming read.⅘  [image]...more",Notes are private!,13,96,1,not set,not set,"Feb 21, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/55017184-rose-wolves

After inheriting his late Uncle’s bookshop following his return from the war, Will Darling was expecting a quiet life amongst the pages of novels but instead discovered he has also inherited a slippery little secret document men would kill for. Now he’s caught between tattooed henchmen, the British War Office and the dreamy yet possibly dangerous Kim Secretan. Moving at breakneck speed through a plot just as full of snarky humor and snappy dialogue as it is knife-fights, betrayal, shadowy intrigue, and a slow-burn romance, KJ Charles delivers an incredible period-piece spy drama that is nearly impossible to put down. Slippery Creatures is certainly a book you’ll want to get your hands on.“You’re a bit of a mess, aren’t you?”“My friend, you have no idea.”First, a hearty thank you to Annaka and her  for not only getting me to read KJ Charles but pretty much half our library staff. I’m in my romance read era and Charles is certainly one of the best, being quite an effective period drama with a high-energy plot full of effective tension and twists while also delivering a romance story that is easy to root for and with as much action as the spy parts. I listened to this one on audio and Cornell Collins does an exceptional job as the reader, with plenty of excellent variations of British accents and a good growly voice that makes the spicy scenes extra spicy. I mean, I listened to this walking my dogs and this was spicy enough to melt the snow along the sidewalk, so thanks for looking out for us, Charles!‘My dear chap, this is a bookshop. There’s never anywhere better to be.’Slippery Creatures truly is a great deal of fun. It felt like an excellent BBC murder mystery series, being able to be just slightly over-the-top for maximum fun but never feeling foolish. The characters are outstanding. We have the endlessly lovable Will Darling who feels a bit like a John Watson character returned home from the war to discover there were no jobs and the people being thanked as heroes are begging for change on streetcorners. Luckily he was able to inherit the bookshop because ‘all he was good at now was killing people, which was discouraged,’ though these skills certainly come in handy when some tough guys and the government come demanding “The Information.” Unfortunately Will doesn’t know what The Information is (it is not, alas, an early copy of Beck’s 2006 album The Information) but he’s determined to find it first and take matters into his own hands. Enter Kim—full name Arthur Aloysius Kimberley de Brabazon Secretan—a complex character who’s assistance and eagerness in bed might be hiding his own set of secrets… ‘Calling it honour is putting ribbons on a pile of shit. It might look good, but it still stinks.’I love that the characters are able to be flawed yet fully lovable. I love Will and even despite it all, it’s easy to love Kim. I mean, Will does so how can you not. ‘Suffice to say I love Kim dearly, but ‘love’ means an awful lot of things,’ he tells us. I also love how completely 1920’s British this is, with Charles really leaning into a lot of great lines and humor with that. ‘He had no idea what civilians, or civilised people, would say in these circumstances. Thanks for that, old chap, much obliged, perhaps? Ought he apologise for coming in his mouth? Would this be a good moment to restart the conversation about where Kim had learned to use a knife? Thank God they were British. He took a deep breath. “Cup of tea?”’This was just a pure joy of a book that keeps you guessing and holding your breath as the walls are closing in for Will and keeps you rooting for our heroes. It is all so delightfully gay and riotously fun. And very Sherlock Holmes adjacent (did I occasionally imagine it in the world of The Great Mouse Detective? Perhaps.) Charles really has some great writing chops and Slippery Creatures is a lovely little read. I’m so glad this is the start of a trilogy because I will certainly be back for more and suspect I’ll be reading many more KJ Charles in the future.4.5/5‘Sorry, I’ve no time for a knife fight in the street on Thursday, could you make it Friday?’...more",Notes are private!,39,157,1,"Feb 19, 2024","Feb 19, 2024","Feb 19, 2024",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/52237989-slippery-creatures

Carmen Maria Machado sinks sharp claws into these thoughts and mauls you with them in Bloody Summer. Diving into the eerie lore and unsolved violent history of a small Pennsylvanian town, what begins as a fictional academic article into the youthful hand-game rhymes that spread from the area abruptly turns into a horror show of dismembered bodies and missing children. Sharp and sinister, this short story shows how darkness can hide under playful veneers. The framing as an academic piece of writing really works narrative magic in Bloody Summer. There’s a sense of grounding that adds weight to it and a sense of realism that allows the story to bypass needing to make the town feel believable since it is just presented as a real place, while also feeling like reading the history of an urban legend where we learn the trajectory of the past into the present through highlighted rumors mixed with life stories of key figures. There’s a fun sense of analysis, such as of the two hand-game songs and the latter in particular with its echos of William Blake’s The Tyger (should we question their ‘fearful symmetry?’), and Machado even mixes actual facts—like there being more tigers in captivity in the US than free in the wild around the world—with the fictional town lore.Added to this is the sense of disconnect from the events, told decades after the titular Bloody Summer through an article and interview, that spotlights some primary themes. Being “academic” in nature, nothing is presented as conclusive and instead as speculation and theory adding an extra layer of mystery to the already mysterious events. It also glosses over the really horrific details (such as the particulars about the abuse faced by the children) in a way that emphasizes the idea that horrible things lurk just beneath the surface of words, people, and towns.I really enjoyed this one, even if it is almost too brief and ends rather suddenly. It leaves you with a lot of unanswered questions, though that really plays into the overall mysteriousness of it and the idea that science and reasoning still fails to grasp at the horror hiding here. There is also an interesting look at ideas of captivity (the brief mention of colonialism is a nice touch that expands the idea) and abuse and how under a society that hides the abuse under false niceties and backs those abused into a corner with no way out, they will feel the only path left to freedom is by force. Bloody Summer is a quick dose of eerie fun with a really enjoyable narrative framing that will have you overthinking the history behind unsettling nursery rhymes.4/5‘Even if it meant being wild on soil never meant to bear me.’...more",Notes are private!,10,107,1,not set,not set,"Feb 16, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60486693-bloody-summer

When a perfectly planned Valentine’s Day descends into a heartbreaking mess of car wrecks, crushed dreams and cheating boyfriends, Emilie Hornby just wants to go to sleep and start the next day fresh. But when she awakens she discovers that it is Valentine’s Day…over and over and over again like death by a thousand cuts with her dreams repeatedly dashed despite her daily attempts to avoid disaster. Filled with a lot of charm, Taylor Swift references and perhaps an overabundance of cuteness, The Do-Over is a delightful time-loop story that manages to mostly balance out the over-caffeinated plot and underdeveloped supporting cast with its exploration into heavier themes of fractured families, and the pressures of expectations from society one’s own self. It gleefully charges into chaos but it polishes up real nice in this touching story about confronting your own life and living for yourself as well as a romantic collision with love where you least expect it. ‘This wasn't about boys and girls and love and attraction, this was about a human soul needing to feel seen.’I have a soft spot for rom coms and while I think I still preferred Painter’s Better Than the Movies which still lingers like a tattoo kiss, this made for a perfectly cute Valentine’s Day read. Its cozy like a warm embrace of like an old cardigan under someone’s bed. The Do-Over reads like an adorable time-loop blend of Groundhog’s Day meets Ferris Bueller’s Day Off with the casting budget of a teenage after-school special so don’t expect too much from the side characters. I did enjoy the brief subplot about her friend trying to get with the boy from his cross country team but most of the cast is fairly ornamental since you can’t have too much character development in a time-loop story. Even the main cast is a bit flat, though we do see some growth with Emilie as she goes from the rather stereotypical follow-the-rules teen to embracing her own destiny. Emilie has seen this story before and she didn’t like the ending, but each day she keeps trying to avert the inevitable to no avail, yet her morning car-wreck with Nick each day seems to point towards another path her life could take, even if he is a bit of a prick (but a prick with a devilish smile, that James Dean, daydream look in his eye and scent of..*checks notes* clean soap). I found Nick frustrating but I did enjoy that he has only been pretending to not know Em out of a shyness and his fear of vulnerability makes him rather thorny, something my former teenage self can certainly empathize with. ‘Josh was the perfect boyfriend for me on paper…but I didn’t realize until I watched him kiss Macy that the paper didn’t always translate.’I enjoy that, like Better Than the Movies, this story explores how life can’t be perfectly packaged and planned because life will always throw the unexpected. And while these surprises can bring heartache—her parents divorce, the recinded program, Nick’s grief over his brother—they can also open doors to greater joys than we ever imagined. Em lives by checklists and checking boxes but the road not taken looks real good now that she’s caught in an endless loop of downfall. ‘No matter how it turns out—good or bad—I’m going to start living for me and what I want, instead of for other people and what I think they want me to do.’This is a story about accepting the unexpected and living for you. I do have to admit the Day of No Concequenses being referred to as DONC in the text and speech (do they say the letters or pronounce it “donk”?) was irritating, but I liked the idea that Em decided to rip the Band-Aid off and skip town school like an asshole outlaw. Her and Nick embracing the chaos and living free for themselves was cute as they have a marvelous time ruining everything. And they come together when her reputations never been worse so he must like her for her.But also. Painter does something with names in her book. Em Hornby + Nick seems a reference to rom-com writer Nick Hornby much like how in Better than the Movies the couple adds up to a reference to Elizabeth Bennet from Pride and Prejudice.While a bit more a great romantic concept than actual execution, The Do-Over is a heartwarming, cuddly good time with lots of laughs. I felt the relationship was well orchestrated even with the aspect that Nick never remembered the previous runs through the recurring day and they remain to each other a stranger whose laugh they could recognize anywhere. I also really loved the insertion of confessions at the start of each chapter that gave hints into the loneliness Em tries to swallow down. But i suppose if this story is over why am i still writing pages, so in conclusion, this is a cute book full of fun.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,42,186,1,"Feb 14, 2024","Feb 14, 2024","Feb 14, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51035594-the-do-over

Named after the day and annually visited by an adorable cupid only she can see, Valentina spent her childhood bringing love to everyone on Valentine’s Day until one year the day brings nothing but stressful surprises that completely upends her life. Now she has one year to prove she can find true love or she must give her heart away to never feel either the joys or pains of love in a faustian deal not with the devil but the ghost of St. Valentine himself. So begins Lunar New Year Love Story, the sweepingly gorgeous and emotional graphic novel from Gene Luen Yang (of American Born Chinese fame) and brought to life through eye-popping illustrations from LeUyen Pham. This is a beautiful, multi-faceted story that explores much more than romantic love as Valentina confronts family and cultural identity in a story rife with symbolism and dualities. With mesmerizing artwork and a story that is as heartbreaking as it can be heartwarming, Lunar New Year Love Story is an incredible YA coming-of-age graphic novel that will steal your heart (they let me have mine back, don’t worry).  [image]I didn’t always hate Valentine’s DayOne thing I really appreciate in a good graphic novel is when the story is given the room to breathe. This is on the longer side for a YA but it really lets all the nuances and textures of the story have space to flourish and the slower pace lets each frame squeeze out every drop of emotional intensity. There is a large set-up that completely grabbed me and I enjoyed the way it shows how the things we love in childhood start to fade or become a source of embarrassment in teenage years. The shift from loving Valentine’s Day is really heartbreaking here as it descends into a bleakness about the realization opening oneself to love also means being vulnerable to heartbreak and betrayal, perfectly rendered in the eerie moment when her cute cherubic companion melts into a ghastly ghoul of St. Valentine. There is a really extraordinary blend of various cultural spiritualities and customs here showing the way an immigrant family, for instance, may contain multitudes and Val spends much of the story sifting through the interplay of her Vietnamese heritage and grandmother’s christianity. All of this in an attempt to understand herself through her history and hope to break the family curse of being unlucky in love.  [image]Caption: “Our family is unlucky in love”The dualities here are wonderful, such as how Val’s involvement in the Korean Bukcheong lion dance juxtaposes with the story of christian martyrs facing down the lions, the way life is juxtaposed with death, or the way the two potential love interests—cousins Leslie and Jae—are all placed in proximity to examine the idea of yin and yang.  [image]There is also a really adorable romance going on amidst all the self-discovery of her culture and (view spoiler)[the surprise that her mother never died but simply left (hide spoiler)]. We see how Les may make her happy but is not a source of stability or loyalty, a rather heartbreaking lesson to learn. And with Jae we see how grief can cast a long shadow over our lives, but that love can be a light in the darkness. It is a moving story full of both sadness and laughs while the deal over her heart is always haunting her every move.  [image]‘Lions roam the world…majesty and misery…there is no hiding. How good it is, then to find someone with whom you can become the lion.’This was such an extraordinary graphic novel with a really lovely story, a lot of excellent exploration of culture and heritage, and a art style that was an absolute joy to get lost within. The colors are incredible, movement is wonderfully captured and the art beautifully and seamlessly flows between reality and the metaphysical aspects.

What do we keep in the shadows to cling to when there seems to be nothing else? ‘No one should use another person to get over their own loneliness,’ college student Mallory is warned in Michelle Hart’s searingly beautiful and bittersweet debut We Do What We Do in the Dark, yet the desire to be consumed by another draws Mallory and a woman twice her age together into a moving portrait of queer relations, power imbalances and a search for the self in the maelstrom of emotions. It is a push and pull of loneliness and shame, though Hart examines how the burden of shame—‘ an untouchable intensity, or an intense untouchability, to keeping a secret, to having a continuous crush, that Mallory wanted never to lose’— can also become a sort of consuming desire. A crisp novel with direct prose that feels simplistic on the outset but weaves a gorgeous poetic sensibility packed with powerful symbolism, We Do What We Do in the Dark delicately and dynamically unpacks struggles with grief, loneliness and shame in a heartbreaking story about how the things we hold in the shadows can cast their own shadows over the course of our lives. It is a novel that will burn you and you’ll be better for it.‘No one is lovable at your age.’The novel zeroes in on people at their most vulnerable, wracked with either grief, loneliness, a bit of youthful naivete or a cocktail of all three. 18 years old, just started college and still reeling from the death of her mother, Mallory is ‘s a sad girl, a lonely girl, and, after a lifetime of practice, she had become so good at this that it had become the most appealing thing about her.’ In many ways this book read like the lesbian cousin to Conversations With Friends from Sally Rooney in the way that Mallory lacks a sense of self and seeks to find herself as she is reflected back by others. Particularly a much older, married lover in an authoritative position over her (she is a professor of children’s literature, but not Mallory’s professor). We see both in the present and in a flashback, how Mallory tends to fill the void of a mother with mother figures like the always unnamed woman or her childhood friend’s mother and tries to mold herself through her assumptions of their gaze upon her. She absorbs the woman’s personality in many ways, such as reading all the books she teaches and even her husband’s finance books. ‘i'm afraid of being alone and afraid that is the only way i know how to be.’There is a great line about Mallory absorbing both the woman and her books early in the novel. ‘Mallory’s affair with the woman had reminded her of why she loved reading books,’ Hart writes, ‘to have her own life and innermost feelings reflected back to her.’I love this quote because it really gets into why people love reading but also how Mallory contextualizes herself by what is reflected back by the woman. Which is getting into Jean-Paul Sartre’s idea of “bad faith” when we allow the gaze of others to define us (or, perhaps, even that in her grief and desire for a mother figure, Mallory has regressed into a sort of “mirror stage” as discussed by Jacques Lacan) and we see how through the next 10 years of Mallory’s life this relationship has shaped and continues to shape her life even in subtle ways. Mallory’s existentialism class points towards a lot of these themes as well, though she often doesn’t recognize it at the time. Though more importantly, Mallory’s desire to be seen and understood also align with her sexual desires and her affair with the woman places her now in an incredibly vulnerable position as her whole sense of self hinges on her obsession for the woman and wanting to please her. This is later hinted at as well in flashbacks with her neighbor’s mother, where even if their shared loneliness doesn’t develop into a sexual relationship their scenes together are teeming with sexual tension.Hart’s reading metaphor permeates the novel in other ways too. The book is written in a fairly direct prose and for how much emotion is boiling beneath the surface the prose doesn’t feel particularly passionate. Which is a rather brilliant framing that hits a few key ideas. Sure, the affair is less passion and more obsession but the prose style seems to reflect the ways Mallory—and the novel itself—internalizes a lot of the woman’s lessons on children’s books:‘Picture books are lessons in how to tell stories without exposition or flashbacks; how a sentence written for children only does a single thing, and how the verb “to feel,” which gets short shrift in literature, is the most effective way to convey raw emotion.’The direct, unadorned prose is a representation of a sentence that does one single thing and all the feelings are distilled into rather impersonal, almost basic terms. The novel does contain a large flashback sequence, but it isn’t until after the affair when Mallory perhaps now feels free to have her own exposition and flashbacks instead of self-confining to the woman’s idea of story. I find it interesting that the novel is third person narration though we only ever know what is inside of Mallory’s head. Its as if she cannot center herself to be the “I” in a story where she can only read herself in the context of the woman. It is also interesting that the woman does not get a name. In an interview in Shondaland, Hart discusses this choice: ‘ for Mallory, she would always be “the woman.” She’s almost the ideal that Mallory is aspiring to, the platonic ideal of womanhood. At least how Mallory sort of conceives it.’There is also a sense that by not naming her, she shows Mallory does not have power over her, something very obvious as the power imbalance of the relationship tips heavily towards the woman. Though Mallory also does not name her as an act of privacy, as Mallory later realizes the damage she could have done to the woman’s private and professional lives had she revealed their affair. ‘That’s how I know you won’t tell anyone about us. If you did, whatever this is would no longer be just yours,’ the woman tells Mallory. This hits the heart of the novel, the idea of how ‘ the feeling of wanting in and of itself became desirable’ and even if Mallory (and the woman) and are often wracked with a sense of guilt and shame for the affair, it is something to hold on to. Something ‘we do in the dark and then we deal with it all alone,’ because to share it would remove the one private thing they have. It makes shame a rather complex emotion.‘Shame and pride often feel like the same thing. You begin to want to protect even the most embarrassing parts of your life.’This wisdom from the woman becomes something Mallory grapples with through the whole novel but we also see it as a larger cultural conundrum. Mallory’s story is briefly juxtaposed with the woman’s discussion on Germany’s relationship to their own historical past in WWII and then later Mallory is at first appalled by Salem, Massachusetts being so open and blithe with their own history of the witch trials. It becomes symbolic in learning to unburden oneself of the secrets you hold onto, and towards the end a girlfriend of Mallory’s discusses how letting out a secret is a way to feel free.Something I think this novel did particularly well was address issues of shame and allow for a portrayal of a messy, queer relationship without dwelling on the idea of sexuality as shameful. The forbidden love here is the power imbalance and that the woman is married, not that they are both women. Hart speaks on this in an interview with BOMB magazine:‘Mallory wrestling with who she is was not as interesting to me as Mallory wrestling with what that means. As a Literary Gay, and as a Lesbian Who Has Seen Every Lesbian Movie, it often feels that our stories begin and end when we come out. I think the popularity of coming out stories, especially among heterosexual audiences, is a backhanded way of othering us. If we have to “come out” as gay, that means we have to announce our diversion from the norm.I also wanted to explore the other facets of Mallory’s identity: her penchant for solitude, her thoughts about art, her aspirations, her relationship with her mom. These things, of course, are not separate from her queerness. Sexuality is a significant part of a person’s life, but it is just a part.’I appreciate the framing here that queerness is not a deviation of the norm and that the novel can have these in-depth examinations of identity without having to wade through moments of homophobia, both external and internalized. Not that these aren’t important or interesting discussions, but we have authors like James Baldwin or Jeanette Winterson among others who have dealt with this exceptionally well and Hart has her own story to tell. Especially as she mentions the book is inspired by her own life in ways. The symbolism in this novel is fantastic though. Moments such as watching a rabbit free itself from a hole in a fence with Mallory both glad it got free but also missing the rabbit make for incredible commentary on the novel. Or another favorite moment was the discussion on the house from The House of the Seven Gables by Nathaniel Hawthorne being ‘two disparate things rolled into one: the residence of actual, historical families, and a re-creation of the setting from the fiction book,’ because ‘after the novel’s publication, the house became more famous for having been written about than having been lived in.’ It serves as a great metaphor for the way Mallory herself has become both her own history but also a self that was rewritten by her relationship with the woman. And, to a greater extent, it shows how much of this book is about the ways we look back and recontextualize our relationships. Though most beautiful is the symbolism of light and dark, the dark places we hold our secrets and then the light in which we release them and feel free.‘It was a lot of light. everywhere she looked, even if she closed her eyes, there it was. she felt there was nothing between her and the overwhelming brightness of the world.’This was a rather devastating yet gorgeous novel that moves through the grittiness of obsession and shame in a way that shook me deeply. It feels authentic, it feels like the shames we all keep inside somewhere. But it also unburdens us, makes us recognize we are not alone in these feelings and that we can come to an understanding of ourselves for ourselves. Not that these moments in our pasts don’t matter, and will likely cast a shadow across our lives, but we need not hide in those shadows and can come out into the light accepting the past and looking towards the future. While the structure of the novel becomes a bit messy in the second half and the flashback sequences fell a bit flat compared to the present, this was a wonderfully written novel that used the prose to lean into its own themes. What We Do in the Dark is a moving portrait of queer desire, messy relationships, obsession and a yearning to push aside our loneliness and it was a haunting little read.⅘‘Loneliness always seems so luxurious…all the time I want to be by myself but then when I am, I desperately want someone else around.’...more",Notes are private!,40,166,1,"Feb 12, 2024","Feb 12, 2024","Feb 12, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58735038-we-do-what-we-do-in-the-dark

There’s something for everyone to have a good time. The guests all mingle in ways that enhances the atmosphere, emphasizing their uniqueness in ways that collaborate towards larger, nuanced conversations that enthrall you through the night, or move together in their own rhythms that bring a collective joy. This is the Honey is such an anthology, edited by the Kwame Alexander and bringing a wide variety of contemporary Black poets together in a space to celebrate the Black experience in all its possibilities. Referencing Langston Hughes in his intro—‘birthing is hard / and dying is mean / so get yourself / a little loving / in between’—Alexander says this is a book to explore that space in between. ‘It’s a gathering space for Black poets to honor and celebrate. To be romantic and provocative. To be unburdened and bodacious.’ Drawing from many amazing poets, with familiar names such as Rita Dove, Jericho Brown, Nikki Giovanni, Tracy K. Smith, Kevin Powell, Natasha Trethewey, Ross Gay, Warsan Shire and many others amongst a wealth of poets that might be new to you and perfect for discovering, This is the Honey is an extraordinary anthology that covers a lot of territory and is supremely well edited where every page is another shining light of poetic brilliance. ‘Is it strange to say love is a languageFew practice, but all, or near all speak?’--Tracy K. SmithLove is what burns brightest in this collection. A love for life, a love for each other, a love for poetry. Divided into thematic sections, these poems are a celebration of the Black experience moving from joy, through powerful statements of resilience against racism, and into a final section of celebration and praise for figures like Gwendolyn Brooks, Duke Ellington, Chadwick Boseman, Mahalia Jackson, Black women, the working class, Black poets and many others. Alexander writes about how Black authors are ‘expected to write about the woe,’ and he offers this collection to ensure that the world understand that there is much joy to be found. It is a collection that looks hardships in the eye and loves anyways, a collection that celebrates our fleeting moments of life and reminds us of the joy that comes when we love ourselves.‘sometimes the things we love, will kill us, but weren’t we dying anyways? I forgive you for being something that will eventually die. Perishable goods, fading out slowly, little human, I wouldn’t want to be in a world where you don’t exist.’--Warsan ShireThis anthology was published at a perfect time to commemorate Black History Month in the US, though it is a collection that should be read all year long and celebrated for all the amazing voices within.

Drawing from Degas’ many notebooks and a wealth of art biographies on the primary subjects, Degas & Cassatt A Solitary Dance is a fascinating and gorgeous graphic novel from Salva Rubio and artist Efa, translated from the French by Edward Gauvin. Following the life of Degas told through the reflections of Degas’ friend and fellow artist Mary Cassatt, it examines the many facets of his personality—found to be rather off-putting by those who knew him—and his artistic efforts in an attempt to understand his inner life and lifelong bachelorhood. Gorgeously illustrated, this is a wonderful graphic novel and an interesting look at the art movement during his time as well as heartfelt portraits of the artists around him that will appeal to both fans of Degas regardless of prior knowledge about him or anyone with an interest in art history.  [image]Degas is often best remembered for his paintings of ballerinasFirst, a big thank you to Edelweiss and NBM Publishing for a  copy in exchange for an honest . This book goes on sale 24 March, 2024.I really enjoyed this graphic novel and found the choice to present the story in visual format to really enhance the telling. The art is quite lovely and is designed to reflect Degas’ own style and chalk pastel medium that tells his story as if through his own form of expression. It fictionalizes his spark of creativity in painting ballerinas and his theories of artistic output that lets us understand Degas through Degas. We also learn a great deal about those with whom he associated, such as Édouard Manet who is a recurring presence in the book and is often used to detail Degas’ rejection of the Salons through their arguments. His belief in toppling the art world and creating a new one for artists to create and be regarded without needing the approval of the Salon is a major focus here, as is his involvement in the Impressionist Exhibitions between 1874 and 1886. The book frames Degas as a highly influential creator of the movement despite his disdain for bohemians, painting outdoors, academics, and pretty much anyone who isn’t himself (he is also highly critical of Cassatt despite also encouraging her and respecting her) and explores how they launched him into fame.   [image]The Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer sculpture from 1881What I appreciated most was how Degas shares this story with that of Mary Cassatt and we see how their relationship influenced, comforted, yet also often frustrated them both. It portrays Cassatt and other women’s struggles in an art world dominated by men and how patriarchal gatekeeping was just as oppressive as Degas saw the gatekeeping of the Salon. Despite the belittling fro Degas, it was lovely to read this as a success story for Cassatt. ‘I’d found my place in a world of men,’ she says, ‘and made my voice as a woman heard. And that was good.’   [image]Portrait of Cassatt by Degas (left) and Casatt’s self-portrait (right)This framing also makes much of the book an exploration into the mysteries around Degas’ sexuality and leaves us with questions if he ever achieved inner peace, which Rubio poses along with quotes from Degas own letters to kickstart our thinking. The graphic novel takes the stance that Degas’ disinterest in women was part of his desire to make painting his entire life, something that is advised of him at a young age by French painter Jean Auguste Dominique Ingresin the opening of the book:‘Devote yourself body and soul to painting. Live for painting! Make it your mistress, your bride, and your wife.’We see how Degas rejects Manet’s constant affairs with women and believes it to be rotting his ability as an artist, though this belief still does not justify his misogyny in general. It did remind me, too, of something I recently read in Annie Jeng’s wonderful recent  of the book You Must Change Your Life: The Story of Rainer Maria Rilke and Auguste Rodin about Rodin telling Rilke he must change his entire life and bend it towards art to be successful.I really enjoyed this book and learned quite a lot. It is well paced and beautiful to look at, and while some of the frames can get very wordy at times it never really bogs it down. Degas is a complicated individual and this goes well to show why he was so well regarded despite his many flaws and the frustrations of those who knew him and I enjoyed learning so much about Cassett as well. A must have for art lovers!⅘  [image]...more",Notes are private!,26,121,1,"Feb 09, 2024","Feb 09, 2024","Feb 09, 2024",,,view (with text),/book/show/60135692-degas-and-cassatt

Tananarive Due delivers an unnerving slow burn in her story The Lake, one where monsters may lurk just beneath a calm surface of a body of water. Or the calm demeanor of a human body… It’s a slow-burn of a story that creeps through the heat of a Florida summer as Florida newcomer Abbie LaFleur makes the quiet town her new home taking up a teaching job unaware of the whispered rumors about the lake. Though as the story progresses we see how whispered rumors of Abbie could begin to swirl like sharks as she employs a teenage boy for services around her home. Due teases dread and danger in a way that really propels the story, which you can read HERE. ‘Am I truly awake, or is this a dream?’This is a monster story but often in unexpected ways. There is the slow reveal of the lake and its effects on Abbie, but Due also hints at other possible indiscretions that keep you guessing what the monstrous act will be. ‘Young adults had to make decisions for themselves, especially boys, or how would they learn to be men?’ she thinks at one point adding, ‘that was what she and Mary Kay had always believed. Anyone who thought differently was just being politically correct.’ It is then we can assume the Mary Kay of the story—and the briefly alluded to “trial” that is likely more literal than the metaphorical trial against public opinion Abbie references—is none other than Mary Kay Letourneau who had a sexual relationship with her 12 year old student when she was 34 and later married him after prison. I would have likely missed this but the new film May December about her has been all over the media lately. Yet with the creeping unease over the focus on this sort of predator, the changes of Abbie’s body and obsession with the lake almost seem secondary.

While her attempts at discovering ‘how to live an authentic, fulfilling life’ collide against cultural and expectations of gender and responsibility, our narrator still feels she must find a sense of self beyond following in her mother’s footsteps ‘trying not to pass my pain along’ and break the cycle of trauma. A gorgeously written story, Mother Country is a stirring look at family and gendered expectations that reaches out a comforting embrace to both an understanding of the past and emboldening of the future.‘I would do important work, create something meaningful. I would make a difference in this dark, lonely world.How? I wasn’t sure.Why? Because I wanted the pain to mean something.’First off, thank you to Liv ❁ and her wonderful  for recommending this one to me. Etaf Rum’s stories often focus on the experience of diaspora while centering the struggles of women and Mother Country is a swift yet devastating statement that the lingering traditional gender role and expectations in the present make women feel they must remain subdued and live their life as in sacrifice everyone else in their families. Our unnamed narrator spends the duration of the story trying to grapple with the pain of her past and a disdain for a mother that allowed it to happen. ‘You make it sound like you were tortured, like I was some sort of monster,’ her mother counters, showing that from her perspective she ‘gave you everything I had, sacrificed my life for you.’ Written in retrospect, we trace the course of the narrator’s deeper understanding into the suffering of her mother in an attempt to make peace with her memory but also to ‘unlearn all the shame’ and break the mold towards a brighter future for her own daughter.‘My plan was to be the best mother I could be. That meant being the opposite of you. I was going to be present and tender and not sad all the time. I was going to set a good example of what it meant to be a woman. Less powerless, more hope. More fuck off. The problem was, I didn’t know how.’Rejecting tradition, she wishes to chart her own path and in the solitude she feels confined into the role of mother and homemaker. Having departed from tradition, she has no role model herself in her life and finds her actions raise alarm in others. Even her success is met with a coldness from her mother for being outside expectations and she sees no map to self-actualization in her elders around her, ‘no example of what it would look like for a woman to be free.’ We see how not only can tradition be stifling, but that only looking towards the past means ideas of the future will be dominated by those of the past.‘Growing up, the path of my future was already mapped out for me. All I had to do was look around…domesticated lives governed by marriage and motherhood. No one I knew dared defy tradition; I had no example of what it would look like for a woman to be free.’Without guidance in her own life, I appreciate how she looks to the words of writers for guidance. As someone who also finds ‘books had become my closest friends,’ in times of great uncertainty or loneliness, this hit hard. In her quest to discover a way of living that honors the words ‘to thine own self be true’ from William Shakespeare, the narrator dives into the revelations she discovers in writers like Rainer Maria Rilke, Brené Brown, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Christopher Ryan or René Descartes among others. I really felt for her, however, when she was told 'those books have gone to your head' and her frustrations at understanding how harmful the world can feel are dismissed.‘What do you think and feel?’That we are doing this all wrong.While we see her plight to escape from a life where her worth is entirely made up of serving family—’you’re useless to them unless you provide a son’ he own mother tells her—Rum also touches on how traditional gender roles can be harmful to men as well. Her husband, for instance, holds a lot of resentment towards his father who only offered him one path in life to take over running the family gas station and a life of education or outside the station was not permitted. The idea of a future without oppressive boundaries of expectations, however, also causes her to reassess her hatred for her mother and better understand the forces that cornered her into the life she led.‘Why am I writing to you now. To tell you that I understand. To say I'm sorry, to finally forgive you, to ask if you can forgive me.'This has been my first foray into the work of Etaf Rum but certainly won’t be my last. Rum writes with such grace and poise, examining difficult and painful subjects in ways that unpack a lot of emotion and trauma but orchestrates the telling in a way that offers hope, understanding, and a will to break the cycle. Mother Country also reminds us that, though the past was difficult and even the narrator’s mother expresses that her hard life still seemed better than the refugee camps they fled in Palestine, that hardships of the past do not mean they should be perpetuated into the future. That we should look forward to find ways to unlearn the shame, to do better for the next generation, to find ways to offer a better freedom and brighter future. A lovely little read that delivers an incredible emotional blow.4.5/5‘I wish I had understood what you endured back then, how much you sacrificed. I wish I had learned to reserve judgement.

Tapping into‘To save the world, people had to think differently.’What will our planet look like 100 years from now, or maybe 1000 or a million years? Tapping into the anxieties of climate crisis, economic collapse, wars and societies structure around endless profit chasing instead of equitable and sustainable systems, N.K. Jemisin’s Hugo Award winning story Emergency Skin offers a startling and subversive look at the distant future. Here we discover earth has long been abandoned and left for dead by those deemed the best, brightest and strongest of humans when they set out to form a new planet deep into space. ‘We left because it would’ve cost too much to fix the world,’ they tell us believing in the principal that it was ‘cheaper to build a new one.’ But on a secret mission to return to the abandoned planet there is a startling discovery that earth might not have collapsed into a tragic wasteland as once thought, and perhaps the “perfect” society that has abandoned bodies and embraced eugenics might be lying about a lot more. A short and sharp story from a master storyteller of speculative fiction, Emergency Skin is a hopeful look towards the future imagining a society that values cooperation and survival for all.‘Six billion people working toward a goal together is much more effective than a few dozen scrabbling for themselves.’Jemisin excels at fascinating framing to her stories, taking what would otherwise feel like an overly philosophical look at community organizing and equitable structures but crafting it into a riveting sci-fi tale that teases out big reveals and tension. There is a certain kinship to the stories of Ursula K. Le Guin here in the way it is sociology by way of sci-fi, almost like a reversal of The Dispossessed if the people from the extreme neoliberal planet instead arrived at the anarchist society and had to make sense of it from their context. This would need a lot more nuance to expand as a novel but as a short story its pretty fun. The framing here—the constant chatter of someone from the traveller’s society speaking to him through his suit—allows us to experience the shock and disgust of their society when faced with the workings of a world they left behind assuming it would perish. It doesn't tell you what the focal character says, but Jemisin gives enough context that you can assume without confusion. The great fun of the story is that, without those who opted for profit over people and didn’t value anyone beyond the strongest and wealthiest, there was actually an opportunity to save the planet when they realized they had to get along or perish.‘The problem wasn’t technological…people just decided to take care of each other.’Jemisin hits a lot of big themes in social justice ideas, particularly ideas of mutual aid, inclusivity and accommodations for all. There is the pushback from the narrator who scoffs at their social choices because they ‘find such chaos ugly and inefficient,’ and we see the contrast between theories of efficiency being one that actually upholds a sustainable society or one that only values a select few at the expense of others. They realize that what divided them most were the things also threatening survival and the abolition of these social structures allowed them to thrive and cooperate. ‘We realized it was impossible to protect any one place if the place next door was drowning or on fire. We realized the old boundaries weren’t meant to keep the undesirables out, but to hoard resources within, And the hoarders were the core of the problem.’I love the irony that the people who abandoned them were the problems all along. I love that Jemisin can create stories like this that hit on so many ideas while still making an engaging story that manages to not feel jumbled and I especially love how effortlessly her world building works. Sure it is all a bit heavy handed and idealistic without nuance, but it’s also pretty fun to read and the frustrated reactions of the ""narrator"" are rather enjoyable. Emergency Skin is a satisfying little romp through the stars and into brighter futures and well worth the quick read.3.5/5‘Some will fight for this, if they must. Sometimes that’s all it takes to save a world, you see. A new vision. A new way of thinking, appearing at just the right time.’...more",Notes are private!,23,111,1,not set,not set,"Feb 05, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/49669410-emergency-skin

Don’t @ me, love haters, I’m not ashamed, this isn’t a guilty pleasure read this was just delightful fun and I’ll shout it out and swear to be overdramatic and true! On goodreads mostly but still, it’s almost Valentine’s Day and Better That the Movies by Lynn Painter is an adorable little rom-com that celebrates the love of love. Leaning into all the tropes, Painter creates a rather witty commentary on the popular aesthetics of love stories, managing to both subvert them while falling right into them in a way that feels like a YA companion to Book Lovers by Emily Henry for its cute self-awareness. It is the story of a hopeless romantic teen plotting a perfect rom-com prom but when she finds her romantic chemistry reacting off-script it becomes an endearing lesson in finding a happy ending can come where you least expect it. Better Than the Movies hits maximum adorability with its mix of romantic tension and charming characters that will steal your heart away.‘Sometimes we get so tied up in our idea of what we think we want that we miss out on the amazingness of what we could actually have.’This is one for the helpless romantics. If you can name the film where this quote comes from, ‘But mostly I hate the way I don’t hate you. Not even close, not even a little bit, not even at all,’ this book is not only for you but you might just be Elizabeth Buxbaum about whom this story is written. Liz has an encyclopedic knowledge of rom-coms, something that her mother helped instill in her. ‘My mother bequeathed to me her unwavering belief in happily ever after,’ she tells us, ‘my inheritance was the knowledge that love is always in the air, always a possibility, and always worth it.’ Now that her mother has passed, this shared love of romance helps keep her memory close and a belief in happy endings is all the more important. Her grief is palpable throughout the novel and as much as this is a story of hearts adorably aligning this is also a story about processing loss and moving forward. It gives it just enough weight to keep the book from completely floating away or becoming overly saccharine. ‘you look best when you’re you’But for real, this book is so cute. Like almost unbearably so. It hits as many tropes as possible but in a way that feels rather tongue-in-cheek, as both a joke and a tribute to all the rom-coms that came before and will continue to warm our hearts. The character dynamics really pop off and you’ll find yourself loving Wes even before Liz realizes she does because ‘for someone super into love and shit, you’re kind of clueless.’ Sure its almost too perfect of characters where the disputes almost feel forced because everyone is just too cute and fluffy and therefor Liz seems to carry the burden of having to be the one with flaws, but its all just pretty fun. And who doesn’t love an enemies to lovers romance. ‘It’s our trope, Buxbaum.’ Plus it is a girl named Elizabeth who realizes her pairing might be the neighbor she has always hated, Wes Bennet, but Austen fan’s will surely appreciate that with their powers (and names) combined….Get it!?Better Than the Movies is simply sweet and happy and it makes you feel sweet and happy too. And that is what counts. Sure its pretty corny and almost too much, but thats also what you do into a book like this for. And a big thanks to adira and her  for recommending trying this one. Its a story of love, of being ‘brave enough to go big,’ but also learning to cope with grief and still believe in happy endings. So hurrah for love.

You’ve likely heard the story of Max Brod betraying Franz Kafka’s wishes to have his works burned after his death, an act that has been forgiven by the literary world indebted to such works. But we also have Harper Lee’s manuscript published under dubious circumstances that was considered by many to mar the legacy of To Kill a Mockingbird. Two very different circumstances, sure, though both authors became the subject of public opinion over works they never intended to be widely read all the same. Which brings us to Until August, a book for which Gabriel García Marquez’s judgment over his manuscript was ‘This book doesn’t work. It must be destroyed.’ Originally intended as a larger novel, though set aside after five drafts so Marquez could work on Memories of My Melancholy Whores, Until Autumn is ‘not, of course, as polished as his greatest books,’ though it is “completed” in the sense that the novella reaches it’s conclusion. The first chapter had appeared, in translation by Edith Grossman, in an issue of the New Yorker in 1999 and was being read by Marquez at literary events before, frustrated with it, he found it better discarded. As his sons write in the introduction, Marquez worked on the novella in ‘a race between his artistic perfectionism and his vanishing mental faculties,’ but question if Marquez’s dementia was not hindering the writing but instead hindering his own assessment of it. ‘In an act of betrayal, we decided to put his readers’ pleasure ahead of all other considerations,’ they write, and so here we have Until Autumn, in translation by Anne McLean, released in hope that if readers ‘ are delighted, it’s possible Gabo might forgive us.’ Truthfully, it could have remained in the draft folder.Ultimately, I'm glad I read this and feel it is valuable to have available, even if just for the academic value and insight into an icon of literature. It should be approached in good faith; if you are expecting a fully realized novella you aren't going to get that but it is still worthwhile as a draft for a much larger work that never was. This isn’t to say it is reputation damning or anything either, though one might question ulterior motives for publishing against his wishes similarly to the son’s selling Netflix the rights for One Hundred Years of Solitude despite Marquez’s wishes for it to never be adapted. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't, I'll leave that to be decided by others who might find more value in having an opinion. For me however, at the end of the day, Until Autumn reads like a draft that never rises above mediocrity but still shows promise, telling the story of Ana Magdalena Bach and her pursuit for yearly infidelities as familiar places become pushed aside for a tourist economy. Every August 16th she travels to an unnamed island where her mother has been buried to leave behind flowers—gladioli to be precise though I did have a laugh about one of the men mistaking them for tulips and asking if they only came from Holland seeing as I live in Holland, Mi known for our annual Tulip Time festival and thereby enjoy having a disdain for tulips—and, after an initial sexual encounter with a stranger, becomes bent on repeating the act each year. ‘It would take several days before Ana Magdalena became aware that the changes were not to the world but to herself. She had always gone through life without looking at it, and only that year upon her return from the island did she begin to see it with chastened eyes.’In the son’s assessment of Marquez, they write that love is ‘possibly the main subject of his entire oeuvre,’ though there is little love to be found in this brief novella. There are fingerprints of Marquez to be found in its better moments, and even a brief moment that pushes towards magical realism towards the end, though it feels a bit dated and dry. Still there is a lot going on thematically in the novella, though there are some aspects about a man writing about a woman having a mid-life crisis of sorts through the ‘delicious terror’ of a string of affairs and constant anxieties about her aging body (she ‘appraises’ her breasts in a way that reminds me why Haruki Murakami gets similar criticisms) that felt a bit eye-rolling. The spark for the story comes when, after her first encounter which had given her a sense of power and control, she finds the man has left a $20 bill in her book and this insult begins to consume her.‘She did not know why she’d changed, but it had something to do with the twenty-dollar bill she carried around at page 116 of her book. She had suffered unbearable humiliation, without a moment’s serenity. She had wept with rage from the frustration of not knowing the identity of the man she would have to kill for debasing the memory of a happy adventure.’It shatters her perception of life and family. ‘Her marriage,’ Marquez writes, ‘sustained thus far by a conventional happiness that avoided disagreements in order not to stumble over them, the way people hide dirt under the rug,’ begins to show signs of stress as she becomes distant and distracted, increasingly so as she notices the growing ‘extent to which she was starting to feel like a stranger in her own family.’ There is a certain charm, however, to the musical grounding of this family, all musicians, though the litany of artists and novels she reads (Dracula, The Day of the Triffids, A Journal of the Plague Year and The Ministry of Fear, all more fantastical stories of people controlled by external threats) are doing a lot of heavy lifting for character development where Marquez would likely have polished and inserted more had he continued work.While Ana Magdalena finds her yearnings for a yearly night of passion to be a search for a sense of empowerment, she sees it as debasing in others (likely as a reaction against herself), such as her disdain for her daughter’s sexual activity and desire to become a nun for the Catholic order, the Discalced Carmelites, which Ana Magdalena believes is just a cover to use nuns as sex workers. It’s a sort of sexual scolding that feels very dated, though perhaps this is also in line with the secondary theme of modernization occurring in the novella. Each year Ana Madgalena finds the island more and more overrun with tourists and increasingly modernized to fit a tourist economy. ‘More towering cliffs of glass go up every year while the village grew more and more impoverished,’ Marquez writes, criticizing the gentrification of island communities that push out the poor in order to accommodate wealthy foreigners. Ana Magdalena’s fears about her own aging are only amplified by her feelings of the world passing her by, with a few comical moments in a high-tech hotel of ‘repressive modernity that ended up in medieval moralism.’ But still this is why old men’s thoughts on women having affairs to feel better about aging should be left in the draft folder. I have warm memories of Marquez. I think back fondly to the time I first read One Hundred Years of Solitude laid out in the spring grass alongside the river that cut through my university campus, only stopping when the light became to dim. This won't reinstill those feelings, but it was nice to be in his words again. Until August is not a bad novella but it also isn't much of a testament to the lasting power of Marquez’s works either. While it is interesting to see what he was working on I’m also not sure it needed to be published as a standalone hardcover. Perhaps a reprint of Marquez’s collected stories or novellas might have been a better place to include this posthumous publication to drum up interest instead of being received on its own, though completists and long-time fans of the author will certainly be pleased to receive this meager offering.3/5  [image]Marquez’s original manuscript complete with notes, as printed as the endpapers in this publication.’...more",Notes are private!,41,198,1,"Mar 18, 2024","Mar 18, 2024","Feb 02, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/199928404-until-august

Charmaine Wilkerson’s Deluge is a succinct storm of revelations and shattered emotions when a woman discovers that the family narrative she has always been told concealed a shocking lie about her parentage. Gorgeously written in a way that reflects the assemblage of truth revealed from the lies like a puzzle’s image slowly becoming clear with each new piece, Deluge is about ‘what it felt like to discover yourself to be missing from the world,’ and the strength it takes to accept a new reality midlife and rise from the ashes of the old.‘Because a person can fail another person and still do right by them. It happens all the time. This is the way of relationships. This is the way of family.’Wilkerson excels at the experience of a life rocked by the discovery of a twist in family history. Her novel, Black Cake, navigated this with grace and here Wilkerson has managed to pack such an emotional punch by focusing on the immediacy of emotions during such a discovery, sharpening it down to a brief tale that cut but also heals. It is about the wound but, like a salamander that ‘can grow back its own limbs and organs, after a trauma,’ it is a powerful statement on the ability to ‘ become whole again.’ First the narrator must learn to sort out the truth from the lies and recognize that even under false pretenses, there was always love in a home that was never her own. ‘Sometimes people do the wrong things for the right reasons,’ she accepts, though the hurt is still real.‘So often in life, there is no either-or. That as much as the mind might fight the idea, the heart makes room for opposing truths.’I really enjoyed this story and was blown away by the impact resonating from these brief pages. Deluge makes stylistic choices that really enhance the experience, feeling the truth sliding into place with each new memory uncovered feeling like a slap of betrayal to the narrator.

Its a story I think about quite often and find very moving amidst the tragedy of it all. To begin, Desnos was starting off a career in journalism and publishing poems right around the height of the dada movement. In 1919, fellow poet Benjamin Péret introduced Desnos to the Paris Dadaists, most notably André Breton who would become the founder and chief theorist of the Paris surrealists. Desnos and Breton would have a falling out over Desnos’ distaste for Breton’s appeal to communism in surrealism, but would continue to be a principal literary figure in the movement working on concepts like automatic writing and a career in radio beginning in 1932 while publishing articles on jazz, politics and many poems, novels and screenplays. He became close with writers such as John Dos Passos and Ernest Hemingway.When France fell under Nazi occupation during World War II, Desnos would become an active member of the Resistance espionage network Réseau AGIR, collecting vital information and obtaining false papers for those trying to flee. He was arrested on February 22nd, 1944 by the Gestapo and sent to Auschwitz, later transferred to Buchenwald and ending up in a camp for political prisoners in Terezín in occupied Czechoslovakia. There are several eyewitnesses with variation on the story, but the basis is that Desnos was loaded onto a truck with many other prisoners and taken to the gas chambers. As they waited in line, Desnos began going up and down the line doing palm readings, becoming increasingly animated as he did so. “A long lifeline with many grandchildren,” he would tell people standing minutes from execution, “a successful business after the war,” to another, “a long lifeline with good health,” and so on. Desnos’ high-spirited antics began to take hold of the other prisoners, who began cheering with each palm-read prophecy and becoming more and more boisterous. Breton once described Desnos as always having “wild eyes” when worked up, and the sight of these people condemned to death and moments from the gas chambers so disturbed the guards that they couldn’t take it anymore, loaded the prisoners up and took them back to the camps. The allies weren’t far from their position and they needed to flee anyways. Desnos antics saved their lives and they would soon be liberated, headed into a future that was almost denied as if fulfilling the prophecies he found etched in the lines of their palms.All of them except for Desnos that is. A month after the camp was liberated, Desnos passed from typhoid. He spent his final days under the watch of a Czech medical student named Josef Stuna who recognized Desnos due to having been a fan of Breton’s novel Nadja in which two photos of Desnos appears. It is even said that during his time in the concentration camp he filled several notebooks with poetry, though those notebooks were lost and likely destroyed during the liberation. Yet his legacy lives on, his poems have been widely translated and his spirit continued with all the lives he saved on that fateful day when he stalled the execution. I love this story though the end is rather sad. It is a true testament to the power of artistic expression, that even starring death in the face Desnos put on a performance that would quite literally save their lives.

La Beauté Sans Vertu by Genevieve Valentine dives into the already murky morality of the fashion industry and elevates the unease in a dystopian setting where we find abuse and horror silently shivering the cracks of perfection. Centered around a high-profile fashion show, Valentine infuses her tale with a chilling coldness and a fairy tale aura from frequent references to Charles Perrault’s tale Diamonds and Toads, sending us down the runway with models who have their arms replaced with the limbs of teenage cadavers in a quest for perfect beauty from body modifications, into the maelstrom of a press ready to mythologize anything to redirect our gaze from the abuse out in the open, and into the struggles of a model who rejects it all. A quick and unsettling read with the beauty of a rose but thorns poised to puncture the false realities constructed by the beauty industry.‘it’s a precision business,’ we are told, a marketing pitch that seems to turn our attention away from the terrible abuse of models, the underpaid, grueling labor of seamstresses and crew, as if being ground out by your labor is the price you should pay. Valentine focuses on the dehumanization when people become objects for an artist, the models are no longer young girls they are ‘investments’ and anyone is disposable in order to achieve the right effect. I enjoyed the way the press perpetuates it all, choosing to believe any error is a brilliant artistic expression to write essays about and proudly upholding the corporate world as a bastion of democracy with phrases like ‘this collection is going to be such an amazing statement about the cultural position of the industry.’This becomes a great dig at marketing—I tend to refer to my marketing degree as the marketable way to say “propaganda”—creating narratives to give the illusion of ethics/social positioning/accountability/etc without actually doing so. A company can generate excessive waste but if offer “green” options and nobody bats an eye, the oil industry can invent the “carbon footprint” to make people look at their own environmental choices instead of the oil industry’s, companies profit off Pride merch to posture as “allies” while still donating money to anti-lgbtq groups and politicians, and this fashion show can “celebrate” democracy and young women while exploiting and being psychologically traumatic to them. We see the fairy tale threaded through the story as a cautionary tale, though inverse of the socially implied message. Rhea, who is a sort of evil Queen figure here, has recognized the truth, but it is Maria who lives it. In the tale (a take on Perrault), the girl who is kind is rewarded with royalty and creates wealth, the girl who rejects a princess is made to vomit poisonous vipers and toads, but we can see it as a message: uphold the system and the marketing and be rewarded, reject it and be a pariah. But when the system itself is corrupt…I enjoyed the element of the well-intentioned but ultimately directionless protest group that isn’t entirely sure what it is exactly they are protesting. They opportunistically change slogans and core beliefs being foggy about what they are against but knowing that there is indeed something wrong to protest against. ‘There should always be more to look at than anyone can catch, that sense of being doomed to miss something wonderful; that’s how a presentation becomes a show.’Part of their confusion is likely that the message of the fashion show is relatively abstruse, which nudges at a larger idea that our social systems are so labyrinthine and systemic that it is hard to pinpoint a direct social ill. It eludes isolation. The above passage is also fairly informative of the story itself which seems to not entirely work at first glance but gives the impression of being too complex to fully process. It is then up to the audience to decide it is perfect in spite of its imperfections, we the reader are the press in this case.A bit clunky but successfully haunting and ambiguously intriguing, Valentine’s La beauté sans vertu is a fun little read with a lot of big ideas in small packages.

Central to the story is a mysterious stranger who arrives with the wind, an archtypal holy fool that frequently feels like a prototype for Mary Poppins, character that feels like whimsicality personified as he breaks all conventions in pursuit of joy and bringing others along with him. A comedic work marred by a bit of a clunky style that feels a bit overwritten—but then suddenly shines with some rather spectacular quotes—and an unfortunate dose of misogyny and racism as casual norms throughout the text, Chesterton’s tale is often considered his closest text to a treaties on how to live life by embracing joy despite a perception of mental instability.‘I am going to hold a pistol to the head of the Modern Man. But I shall not use it to kill him–only to bring him to life.’This was our recent read for my book club and I was excited to finally see what Chesterton was all about, though I can’t say that I’m all too eager to try another anytime soon. It is rather inspiring and lighthearted—I can’t help but enjoy the idea that giving in to whimsy and joy to live a more fulfilling life even at the expense of being a social outcast. I love the idea that just breaking from convention can unlock a vaster, richer life, and idea that has been used frequently in shows and films (I kept thinking of the Seinfeld episode where George becomes successful by doing the exact opposite of what he would normally do). It does hit with very blunt religious overtones—which aren’t always my favorite thing but I’m also reading Chesterton so it is to be expected—and Chesterton sees this more free life of joy as one better fit to serve God. ‘If Innocent is happy, it is because he IS innocent. If he can defy the conventions, it is just because he can keep the commandments.’The story begins Innocent Smith blowing into town dressed loudly, performing flips and general tomfoolery that is a sharp juxtaposition to the drab life of those staying in the boarding house Beacon House. There is almost a dark millennial humor of the tenants asking each other things such as ‘do you have any friends’ in a comical caricature of drab, depressing life to which Smith serves as a foil. And while Smith’s path of whimsy is one against social norms, many of which are oppressive, it is also positioned as antithetical to “worldly” logic and science, which Chesterton shows as mortal weights holding people down from the glory of God’s kingdom. In his autobiography, Chesteron writes that ‘the object of the artistic and spiritual life was to dig for this submerged sunrise of wonder; so that a man sitting in a chair might suddenly understand that he was actually alive, and be happy’ and Manalive is his expression of that. Smith’s antics are intended to wake people up to this, though firing a gun at people to make them embrace life still seems a bit uncool. Though maybe I’m just a curmudgeon for not having properly enjoyed having a gun pulled on me before, and that whole scene reminded me so much of a similar moment and dialog in Fight Club that I’m curious if it was an inspiration for it. It is all very silly and I enjoyed the second half where the trial for all of Smith’s crimes turns out to be a misunderstanding where Smith has robbed his own home and had an affair with his own wife as part of their romantic role-playing. Sure its all fun and games that the guy can be viewed as breaking social rules and celebrated for it but at the same time women were being tossed into asylums on claims of ""hysteria"" simply for having an opinion without so much as a trial like Smith receives. Chesterton's idea of ""insanity as freedom and joy"" by disregarding social conventions seems a bit exclusive to white men at the time. The causal racism is there to remind you of that, though even white folks like the Irish or people with albinism get rather disparaging depictions and comments as well. ‘there should be priests to remind men that they will one day die. I only say that at certain strange epochs it is necessary to have another kind of priests, called poets, actually to remind men that they are not dead yet.’Overall, not a bad read and one that does make you feel good at the end, though perhaps not one I necessarily enjoyed. I think I enjoyed discussing it with the book club more than actually reading it and we had quite the array of opinions on this one from people who really loved it (so perhaps you will to) to one reader who really hated it. I will say the rather verbose prose (he loves adjectives and stringing them together) makes this one a bit of a slog despite the short length but I also suspect there is a lot to digest on a second or third reading as this feels intended for multiple reads. It won’t be from me though.3.5/5‘Grass and garden trees seemed glittering with something at once good and unnatural like a fire from fairyland.

Did I stayed up far beyond a reasonable hour to finish it in one day? Yes. But is struggling through the day today worth it? Also yes. Psychological thriller and crime fiction collide in this unsettling story about a murder that became a media sensation due to the peculiarities of the crime: young, wealthy, highly educated magazine entrepreneur Anna Oglivy has stabbed two friends to death in her sleep and has not awoken in 4 years. Dubbed “Sleeping Beauty” in the press, her prince has come to awaken her: a sleep psychologist named—’irony of ironies—Dr Benedict Prince.’ Structured for maximum tension and infectious pacing and moving perspectives from Dr Prince, others involved in the case and even Anna’s own notebooks, Anna O is a satisfying thrill-ride that successfully pulls off some incredible twists that had me exclaiming aloud. Though beneath the exciting drama is an interesting psychological meditation on sleep and storytelling itself, examining the ways the media, true crime and social media storms sensationalize crimes into their own mythologies as well as the way myth archetypes perpetuate in the present and help frame our way of assessing reality into a narrative. Fast, fun, and impossible to put down, Anna O is a thriller full of surprises.‘The mind is its own place and can make a heaven of hell and a hell of heaven.’—John MiltonTo be honest, thrillers aren’t my usual read but wow this one blew me away. I recalled seeing Jaidee’s wonderful  so when a friend was really trying to sell us on this book at book club, I figured I’d give it a shot. I’m glad I did, and now I finally have a thriller I can recommend at the bookstore or library that I’ve actually read. I enjoyed the way this leans heavily into psychological aspects of sleep and, in an author interview, Blake said he wanted to approach something ordinary like sleeping in a way that will reshape how we think about it. ‘People sometimes say that after reading or watching Jaws they never went in the water again,’ he says, ‘I wanted to write a thriller where after reading it you’ll never sleep in the same way again’ It’s true, this made sleep eerie. The story moves at an incredible pace with very brief chapters that tend to leave you wanting more making this easy to fly through, and the twists are pretty incredible. There is a lot going on here, with many betrayals in both past and present and a lot of chess maneuvering of power struggles that sometimes catch you by surprise. Blake litters the tale with great clues while also allowing your own assumptions to distract you and even if you may have guessed some of the twists, they hit so sudden and successfully it really rocks you. It’s just a ton of fun and you’ll keep reading because you simple have to know the answers. Which you will eventually get.Sure, the psychology of this has some artistic liberties and I’m guessing someone with a strong background in it might find a lot to criticize, but Blake does well by framing the book around how the way we sensationalize and mythologize things often ends up overriding the truth in the court of public opinion. In this way the book is fairly geared towards looking at the storytelling of a crime and understanding it and rationalizing it through our own storytelling, which is what interested me most. I think this is a book where, plot wise, it is best to know as little as possible so I’ll avoid much talk about the plot and want to briefly think about the mechanics of the themes.‘That’s what this entire case comes down to, isn’t it? It’s been like an illusion, diverting the audience while the real sleight-of-hand is performed.'While fictional, the story takes a lot of inspiration from real cases, such as the 68 cases of homicides involving sleepwalking have gone to trial, and the mysterious cases of Uppgivenhetssyndrom or “resignation syndrome”. The psychological aspects, while still fairly fictional in many ways, do add an interesting layer to the story similar to the way hard sci-fi uses scientific explanations to help ground stories.‘Psychology is the one thing true crime rarely does well. Everyone focuses on the who and the how rather than the why. A dry history of the case misses the essence of it. Only drama, art—fiction, if you like—gets to the emotional truth of things.’Dr Prince is described at one point as looking similar to Robin Williams from Dead Poets Society, though this seems a bit of a slight of hand to distract you from how much his character and methods of trying to wake up Anna are reminiscent of Williams playing the doctor in Awakenings, a film based on Oliver Sacks’s memoir about trying to “wake” patients with “sleep sickness” (encephalitis lethargica) which also involved using familiar songs. We also have the Anna O’s namesake as a real-life reference, Frauline Anna O, a case involving sleepwalking that Freud centered in a lot of his work on “hysteria”—a rather unfortunate diagnosis that was often a simple excuse to silence women or remove their agency that I discussed more at length here. All of this adds together to give a cool grounding for the story.‘But one person’s obsession is another’s cure.’The whole procedural aspect of the novel is bathed in a rather fascinating look at the more abstract sides of crime and the psychology involved in it all. Blake sets up a really fascinating scenario that makes you question ideas of morality and how much motivation and intent is involved in that. If Anna did indeed stab them, yes she is a killer, but is she morally a murderer if she wasn’t aware? If Prince does wake her up and she goes to trial, is he morally complicit in harming Anna by helping the State (who has ordered him to do this) return her to a media storm of a trial. But also where does the boundary of help cross into harm in general, and how much does the treatment of a patient during a past case that becomes highly relevant to the present case reveal a history of medical abuse in the name of “helping”?’Is evil something that must be exterminated from the body, a psychological cancer, rebuilding the patient from scratch? Or is it inherited, biological? What does evil even mean?’I enjoy the way this bridges the idea of crime procedure into a more literary type of thinking, through which Blake brings in a lot of references from In Cold Blood to Greek myths and Anna’s obsession with Euripides’ play Medea. Especially as Anna was an aspiring writer herself, how much of our ideas of myths and archetypes inform our decisions on right and wrong or direct our thinking in ways that cause us to miss glaring red flags (or crumbs of clues laid out by the author). But this also leads into ideas of psychosomatic illness and the ways that something that could be imagined can also affect us in very real ways. ‘Can the mythic become fully material? If we answer that, we begin to answer the mysteries of life itself,’ Prince states about his theoretical ideas on brain behavior. When truth and fiction become indecipherable, we often create stories to better understand stories. Psychologist Carl Jung, who studied under Freud, was also highly interested in fairy tales, which he called ‘the purest and simplest expression of the collective unconscious psychic process.’ He was interested in how archetypes shaped our understanding of reality, and Blake does well by demonstrating that very notion through this narrative here.‘You wanted to turn me into a tabloid villain. A first-name criminal. A myth, an archetype.’The novel Anna O is at its best during the big twists, but also the investigation into how society loves to create a villain and how this can be detrimental to uncovering the actual truth. How much do we as a society want so badly for a sensational story like the myth of old that we go creating one where there isn’t? ‘The media pumped out sensationalist nonsense until Anna became a myth rather than a human being,’ and the efforts of doctors, lawyers, and police are under constant media attention and social media fandoms looking to paint anyone as a culprit of conspiracy. Dr Prince’s own family is in the line of fire with journalists harassing his daughter at school and some of the fandoms like to use threats of violence. How much does a court trial using tax dollars become at the will of mass outrage that wants to build a myth over find the truth? Does the obsession with true crime turn everyone into armchair detectives each trying to control the narrative? 'This case has become a parlour game. Endless coverage mutes the real effect.' Furthermore, we see how much the conspiracy theories and ideas of Anna are often horrifically soaked in misogyny. Anna O grapples with these questions in often surprising ways, such as an ending that—without giving anything away—begins to nudge ideas of storytelling that might threaten to reframe everything we knew so far. ‘My job is to play miracle worker, coaxing the dead back to life.’Overall, this was a blast. The writing can get a bit clunky or over-dramatic at times but it really pushes the story forward and even the slower middle section never feels like it sags under the weight of lengthier discussions on psychology. Sure, theres some cliches like Prince’s divorce and trying to connect with his kid feeling very standard detective fair, but it works well into the story and even the whole event that occurs in the Forest (view spoiler)[the paintball game (hide spoiler)] is kind of stupid but pulls together in exciting ways. I did like how much this story shifted just when you thought you knew what was going on and the Anna diaries add a cool texture to this making you follow multiple plotlines of shadowy figures and betrayals while scrambling to see how it might all connect. A rip-roaring thriller and a pop-psychological playhouse, Anna O was great.4/5‘The perfect murder is a postmodern enterprise.

I like how this book pays tribute to women Lighthouse keepers and does so in a fun way with a ghost cat to appeal to young readers. Perhaps having the cat be a girl would have been better to highlight that it was women doing work that men were often credited for but whatever.   [image]I like the art in this one too.

What are we to one another, if we cannot be this?”What, me crying at the end of a Homer retelling? Couldn’t be…Fine, you caught me, but Calypso’s Guest, a short tale by Pulitzer Prize winning author Andrew Sean Greer, has a soft, forlorn beauty that sent a ripple of emotion through me like a stone dropped in a calm, moonlit pond. It is subtle, small, yet oh so sweet as Greer takes the tale of Calypso and Odysseus from Homer’s Odyseey from the islands of ancient Greece into the solitude of the stars in this queer love tale. It manages to capture an essence of an epic in the space of a few short pages and reads with a quiet, bittersweet melancholy, a lovesick tale baked under bloated suns now softly adrift through the ‘wine-dark void of space’.‘You must come to think of it as home’This was a creative and rather whimsical work that manages to do a lot of really exciting world building in a short space. It is the story of Calypso, though instead of being banished by Zeus for her support of Atlas and the Titans, here it is a man sent into exile for having aided The Others—god-like creatures bent on destroying his people—and, after countless years of solitude, finds a man crash landed on his planet. It follows the familiar tale with a few fun deviations as their bond grows despite the new companions desire to return to his palace off in space. And I really enjoyed the story of the prison world, a place where there ‘were no predators except one’s nightmares.’‘For he had come, my weary traveler, to his journey’s end. He had crash landed in my prison…’The story excels at capturing a sense of loneliness but also love and contrasting the narrator’s numbed sense of existence when stretched out by immortality to the passionate and adventurous personality of the visitor. It is all delivered as if in a gorgeous minor key and even knowing where it was headed it still enchanted with surprises in it’s fresh, sci-fi wrappings. ‘ The moons looked in the window at us, a pair of mismatched eyes, and what did they see? A room littered with pillows and books and quietly blinking lights, lit by a single bronze lamp; a room made of much living, and in it, the ones who had lived it: a man in love, standing in the doorway with a dog on its leash. And another, seated at a table, planning his escape. ’Admittedly, Calypso’s Guest is a bit slight, though there’s little more one could as for it anyways. It is a queer yearning to outshine the stars, yet a tale of inevitable separation, two hearts beating out a limitless distance in the endlessness of space.

It is the concept of martyrdom, that sacrifices must be made—the laying down of one’s life for a cause—but in exchange is eternal glory. It is also the existential question at the heart of Martyr!, Akbar’s debut novel, as the young Cyrus’ journey towards sobriety is also an internal quest to consider how one’s own death might serve to better illuminate a life now given in sacrifice. For a book about death, depression and an aching for understanding, it never feels downbeat as Akbar uplifts the wandering narrative with wry humor and whimsicality and a sense that, in the grand scheme of things, grace outshines the bleakness of rage. It is an ambitious and multifaceted work where not every element quite sticks the landing, though in keeping with the sense of grace, these aspects are easily overlooked by the power and beauty of the whole. As intricate and layered as his poetry, Akbar’s Martyr! and Cyrus’ searing self-journey is an excellent existential investigation into addiction in the face of mental health, identity in the face of history, and life and legacy in the face of death. ‘I just want to write an epic. A book. Something about secular, pacifist martyrs. People who gave their lives to something larger than themselves. No swords in their hands.’Kaveh Akbar has emerged as an icon of modern poetry in recent years. His first full-length collection, Calling a Wolf a Wolf (a book that, like Martyr! deals heavily into addiction and the struggles towards sobriety), completely floored me when it came out and I ended up rebuying it twice after being so insistent someone read it that I’d give them my copy. Beyond his own poetry, Akbar has been such a shining light of advocacy for modern poetry, founding Divedapper as a home for modern poets to interview each other and share their voices, writing the weekly column Poetry RX for The Paris Review, and publishing his recent anthology The Penguin Book of Spiritual Verse: 110 Poets on the Divine. Here we have Cyrus also compiling an anthology of sorts, spending the duration of the novel on his “The Book of Martyrs” of ‘people who at least tried to make their deaths mean something.’ He too, hopes to become a martyr for art and complete the work with his own suicide. Akbar’s grounding in poetry shines even in this first long-form fictional release with a narrative that isn’t directionless, persay, but wanders into various narratives, mingles with history to crack it open and extract ‘the hidden voice’ inside, or occasionally diverts into abstraction. It reads as less confined as a typical novel and more in the boundless freedom of a poetry, though the habit of often remaining in metaphorical language and cashing in on frequent references works better in his poetry than prose. Still, I enjoy the frequent insertions of Cyrus’ documents or poems and quotes from real news articles to better fold the historical elements into the work.This was a deeply moving work. Akbar taps into dark territory to present it with a lightness of humor and grace that bears the fingerprints of having been there themselves. The way something dark can be spoken of with a laugh that isn’t barbed with offense to those who experience it but instead a laugh in the face of it, because you’ve confronted it, locked eyes, and survived. For the sake of sensitivity, readers should know that this deals heavily in themes of depression and suicide, but I found it to be profoundly moving. It also felt familiar. Cyrus reads like a lot of people I’ve known, the sad art types, the sort of people I’ve often been especially when I was 19 of 20 and grappling with darkness myself. The sort of darkness that pushes a lot of people into drink, drugs and poetry like Cyrus. It can be difficult to read at times.‘ What formed in Cyrus's mind was a blunt and inarticulable plea to be done, for a reprieve from navigating what had become to him an unnavigable world, to not have to spend the next decade or decades unraveling what it all meant, had meant, would mean. The anger he felt at his mother. The vanished. The abandoner. But, also, the pride he felt for her, now. The great artist. It was too much. He prayed for an end to the tyranny of all symbols, beginning with language…He understood, with a clarity that had until that moment in his life eluded him, that he was not at all made for the world in which he lived, that art and writing had gotten him only trivially closer to compensating for that fundamental detectiveness, the way standing on a roof gets one only trivially closer to grabbing the moon than standing in the dirt.’It’s the sort of introspective work that reminds you of hard times, the ones you might try to make art out of. The kind that finds you pleading with yourself internally, ‘ forming a prayer not exactly in language.’ What really works is that, for having a lot of universiality, it is also highly specific and culturally informed. It’s something many can relate to, but also respect as not their own and an opportunity to listen and learn. I really appreciate Akbar for sharing it with us all.‘To say no to a new day would be unthinkable. So each morning you said yes, then stepped into the consequence.’Family and identity play a large role here and are often looked at in context of the history of conflict. Cyrus’ mother was killed in the real-life murder of Iranian Flight 655 when the US navy launched missels at the passanger aircraft in 1988. All aboard were killed yet Cyrus escaped the disaster as he was left behind for being deemed too young for the flight. Quite a heavy burden to bear while watching one’s father sink into alcoholism and dead-end labor in the aftermath, all but inevitably leading to Cyrus’ own struggles with addiction. Elements such as this and the martyrs of Cyrus’ book help situate the novel in the now and help give a historical stage for his family martyrdom such as his uncle dressed as the Angel of Death in battle as a martyr for a national cause.Though some of the more surreal, imagined moments in history felt a bit awkward, I was charmed by the ambitiousness of them.‘Grace, that dictionary. A place where everything was attached to a meaning.’Through Cyrus we also get an interesting exploration into identity, not being between both Persian and American identities but both at once. This sort of duality is thematic to the novel with Cyrus feeling both grace and rage at once. ‘But that's a misunderstanding of grace, which doesn't ask to be paid back. Even when you ve been given the gift twice, emerged from your own death to run away from your husband. Leaving him to grieve you, to raise your child by himself.’Grace and forgiveness are key to the novel, grace that Cyrus was able to live, ‘grace that the man—the boy, reall—at the border accepted my bribe,’ or even grace in language, the medium through which Cyrus works now that his job as a hospital actor is over.‘When I learned how to say ""cigarette,"" I walked around saying it to myself like a prayer, like an incantation. see-GARR-ett. It was my favorite word. If I walked up to someone and said it, one time in every five they'd hand me one. Language could make a meal like that.’The novel moves to New York City when Cyrus discovers Iranian-American artist Orkideh who also plans to use death as an artistic medium. Martyr!, at its heart, is an exploration of ‘the big pathological sad,’ or the ways that we all are ‘just a long emptiness, waiting to be filled,’ as Cyrus recounts from an old Muslim tale. This book is less about the emptiness, however, than it is about how we fill it. Cyrus had filled it with alcohol and found himself still empty. Now his life has shaped into a quest to understand that which, as Orkideh quips, has led him to grapple with all the Persian checkboxes of death, of poetry and an awe of mysticism. Like the form of the novel Martyr! itself, this is a journey with no defined shape and this often makes the soul-searching feel directionless, subjective, and highly existential.‘This idea for the book, for his own dying going into the museum he'd had a grasp of its shape, why it mattered. It was a tidy, gallant idea about leaving life for something larger than mere living. Becoming an earth martyr. It made sense, and then suddenly it didn't. It held a shape and then suddenly it didn't.’I suspect the term navel-gazing will appear in the criticisms of this book, but I happen to like that sort of thing in a novel. I also enjoy the way this felt like an expression of poetry but as a novel. Akbar plays with familiar territory for those who have read his poetry but takes it in bold and exciting directions and Martyr! makes for a darkly humorous read that asks a lot of big questions that, though they may not always arrive at conclusive answers, reminds us that the quest for knowledge is fulfilling in its own right. May we all find something to fill that emptiness.3.5/5'A photograph can say 'this is what it was.'

I recall being a kid and, compared to a hobby like reading, video games being something treated like candy—silly and fun but not a healthy habit to over indulge in. Yet I’ve always truly believed there is literary value to be had in video games and they are an artistic medium that, not unlike graphic novels, can tell a story in fascinating and unique ways. I’ve always been sort of on the outside of video game culture, but I really appreciate the genre and all the efforts that go into bringing a story to life. There have been moments that really shook me, the way Life Is Strange makes you consider the consequences of small choices and be so emotionally invested into extremely heavy moments, the devastating first and final sequences to The Last of Us. or just playing horror games like Dead Space in the dark with my old roommate, swapping who was playing when the anxiety became too great. Memories of scenes both of friends around the tv as much as the events on the screen that are as vivid as some favorite novels and films. Video games can be a community activity to bond with friends, an escape, a challenge to overcome, and, as we see in the essays collected here in Critical Hits: Writers Playing Video Games, a source for deep introspection on psychology and ethics in society and the self. Edited by Carmen Maria Machado and J. Robert Lennon, this lovely little anthology brings together a wonderful variety of critical theory, essays and memoir creating a discourse around video games as an art and social indicator. Featuring pieces from folks like Hanif Abdurraqib (who’s piece brought tears to my eyes), Charlie Jane Anders, Larissa Pham, Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah, Alexander Chee, Vanessa Angélica Villarreal and more, this is an insightful collection for both casual and avid gamers, yet equally enjoyable for those who just like a great, thoughtful piece on how technology shapes our ideas of society and the self.‘I feel like the ideal game does for me what an ideal novel does,’ writes editor J. Robert Lennon, ‘You feel yourself completely subsumed in the imagination of the writer or the world that the game developers have created.’ I will never forget waking up one January in middle school to discover we had a snow day. Instead of going back to bed I eagerly switched on my playstation to keep playing Final Fantasy VII, a game that would forever stick with me and change how I thought about stories. Because that morning was when I would finish the first act and witness the villain kill off a major character. Reader, I cried. But it struck me how a game could tell such an intricate story and pull of some incredible twists like nothing I’d previously experienced, and it all hit so much more deeply because of the emotional investment of active participation. In the essay Narnia Made of Pixels, Charlie Jane Anders discusses how this is sort of a portal fantasy the way we are pulled into the world and can participate (though there is also discussion on ideas of free will too), and even has an incredible discussion on ideas of embodiment and ties that into discussions on trans identity. Adding to that, in her essay Status Effect, Larissa Pham writes:‘Here’s the beautiful separation games promise: You can become someone, even grow to love someone, a character that’s both the result of your efforts and not yourself.’This attachment keeps us coming back for more. It is cathartic, it can make us feel like we are a hero, it can make us whoever we want to be, and sometimes it can be a much more complex emotional experience. In We’re More Ghosts Than People, Hanif Abdurraqib looks at ideas of redemption in his playthrough of Red Dead Redemption 2. Knowing that the character will succumb to tuberculosis no matter what, he still attempts to have the character always do the just and honorable thing as if maybe, just maybe he can offer him a redemption and realizes it might be related to an inner desire to redeem oneself for a past he’s still trying to make peace with. It’s a beautiful essay, one that ends with a description of having his cowboy always watch the sunset, hoping he’s giving what he knows deep down is a lifeless video game animation some sort of peace and hope before he dies while ‘trying to wrestle with my own goodness or badness.’ You can read the essay HERE and I highly recommend it.It makes me think of how interactive storylines have become. How our choices matter. It breaks your heart when you realize, as I recently did playing Detroit Become Human, that I caused a character to die. No game has ever been a greater emotional rollercoaster for me though than Life Is Strange facing some truly dark and devastating moments, or frantically mashing buttons to try and reverse time as you watch a friend throw themselves to their death…a death you might be able to stop if you’ve made the right choices. I guess sometimes you can’t. That’s a lot to take in. Several writers here talk about the ethics of it all. How the deaths of nonplayable characters we let die in mass might erode our empathy. It makes me think of Ted Chiang’s novella The Lifecycle of Software Objects where digital pets develop their own personality and it is wondered if they truly do feel love, sadness, pain, and more. Though the violence can also reveal much more about who society deems worth living. In a particularly moving piece by Jamil Jan Kochai ‘the virtual dream of the game collapses onto me’ while playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 when he, an Afghan American, realized the violence of the game everyone was taking glee in was directed at people just like himself. ‘If I am to exist within the narrative dreams of America, I, as a subject, must destroy myself, as an object, forever. It is not a choice; it is a duty. I must wait for me in the killing fields of the American imagination.’He notes that ‘cathartic violence envisioned is always directed toward a colonized figure,’ and the horror of realizing the game was propaganda upholding the mass movement of troops into Afghanistan. Vanessa Angélica Villarreal approaches an excellent look at race in storytelling, such as looking at how in fantasy stories such as The Lord of the Rings, a particular race can be coded as pure evil. ‘Done poorly, fantasy races merely replicate the racial logics of our world, entrenching stereotypes through the reenactment of oppressive narratives.’This sort of racist entrenchment plays out in awful ways, such as in anti-immigration political sentiments around the world. Villarreal looks at the use of Norse mythology in many games, like Assassins Creed Valhalla, and branches into a discussion on the darker side of video games found in online communities, such as the alt-right groups that rally around viking imagery in the US (she references several shooters who’s manifestos were steeped in Norse mythology references or idolized white supremacist Ragnar Redbeard). The New Zealand Christchurch shooter even live-streamed his assault in a style to mimic first-person shooter games. It is still in recent memory gross online harassment campaigns such as Gamergate that flooded online gaming with horrific misogyny, racism and mockery towards anyone who spoke against it, and worse still is the way this became a prototype for a lot of bad-faith actors and alt-right movements to this day. On the subject of misogyny, MariNaomi provides a comic discussing their career through the videogame industry and the extra difficulties faced by female-presenting individuals in a field dominated by men and where even the joy of a woman boss quickly evaporated under the weight of her internalized misogyny. For as much fun as video games can be, this collection does take a lot of really heavy looks into social issues and how they permeate the industry.What makes this collection so wonderful, however, is the variety of stories. The COVID era is frequently mentioned—a time when many were able to be home and playing games more—and I appreciated pieces such as Elissa Washuta discussing the eeriness of playing The Last of Us during a pandemic. There is something for everyone here and I found a lot of these more memoir-esque pieces to be extremely moving (I can’t believe I got teary in an essay about playstation cowboys). A great little anthology for avid and casual gamers alike.4/5'When it was all over, I found myself laughing, alone on my couch.

This book hits that same vibe.‘Music can dig, you know? It can take a shovel to your chest and just start digging until it hits something.’Music is an art you experience with your whole body. A good rhythm can surge through you and get you dancing, the four right chords can make you cry, lyrics can inspire and become a lifelong favorite quote, shared love of a song can become a great bonding experience especially when you sing along together. It is such a powerful form of expression and experience it is no wonder Friedrich Nietzsche once wrote ‘without music, life would be a mistake.’ Behind our favorite songs is a whole industry or artists on instruments or behind mixing boards working with business men and personality handlers to make these albums happen and bring them to our ears and often the stories of a band can be as fascinating as the stories that they sing. Daisy Jones & the Six is such a story of people coming together to create art and coming apart over addictions and betrayals, a 70s band that reads as so plausible you’d swear you heard their music if you didn’t know it was a fictional story from Taylor Jenkins Reid. Told as a series of interviews getting perspectives from not only the band members and their families but also the producers, sound engineers, and various staffers they met along their road to rock’n’roll, the novel brilliantly recreates the experience of watching on of those VH1 Behind the Music episodes. The story itself may be a fiction, but the way it is told becomes a rather fascinating investigation and criticism on the culture around the music scene at the time, highlighting toxic elements such as the misogyny, addictions and other bad behaviors but also the social conditions that lead to—and encouraged—such behaviors, as well as an insightful dive into the way we mythologize fame and the music industry itself. Through the story of a band and the interpersonal frictions and romances that propelled and inevitably derailed them, Daisy Jones & The Six is a fun and fascinating look at the music industry and the American culture that danced to its beat.‘We love broken, beautiful people. And it doesn't get much more obviously broken and more classically beautiful than Daisy Jones.’I was highly recommended by goodreads friend and expert book recommender, Luh, to check this out as an audiobook and I would certainly encourage anyone else to do the same. Having a full cast really helps lean into the interview format with the cast sounding like some washed up rock stars but also the way they laugh at their own jokes and instill emotion into their narrations elevates this in such a way that I wonder if this is the ideal format.According to Taylor Jenkins Reid, the story of Daisy Jones and her eventual collaboration with The Six was inspired by a clip of Lindsey Buckingham watching Stevie Nicks sing “Landslide” and readers will certainly see influence from Fleetwood Mac in this book. So much so, in fact, that upon watching the tv adaptation, Stevie Nicks herself commented that it made her feel ‘like a ghost watching my own story.’ Here we have the stories of Daisy and Billy who came into stardom in their own ways that led to their paths uniting for the sake of music. Offstage they have a lot of personal issues but onstage they have an incredible chemistry that only enhances their music. ‘I sounded like a cool new pair of jeans wand Billy sounded like a pair you’ve worn for years,’ Daisy comments. It is a tumultuous relationship, one that threatens to shatter the already frail relationship Billy is trying to have with his wife and sobriety and from the moment they meet we can tell Daisy will be a catalyst for chaos in his life when she sings his lyrical statements of certainty as questions instead. ‘The truth often lies, unclaimed, in the middle.’Though this isn’t just a story of two big personalities who become tidal waves that rock each other’s lives but a story about a whole band that is trying to pull together and weather the storms of their iconic figures misbehaviors. The way it recreates rock biographies and interviews is expertly crafted, with variations on the stories revealing disagreements or misunderstandings (or often used as dramatic irony for some good jokes), and the various personalities are well written. I particularly enjoyed how well this was able to balance an ensemble cast with each member getting a pretty adequate amount of attention and voice.Having heard a lot about this book and seen how often it appears on lists like “romance” or “beach reads,” I was happy to see that the romance is actually a narrative element upheld by a larger plot that reacts to their storylines and it made me think about how often people infantilize the idea of “womens fiction” to be mere love stories and not a larger commentary on culture. Because what really stands out here, to me at least, are the ways Reid addresses the culture of rock and roll and what that said about American culture in general. I wondered at times if this exact story had been written by a man and not a woman associated with popular novels often read by younger women, we likely would have heard it discussed as a contender for the Pulitzer Prize, because it truly is a pretty cutting investigation into Americana and the culture of entertainment industries. But this commonly happens when a woman has a big book and people will rally to say it “actually isn’t that good,” or that if a woman writes a well-regarded literary novel that it is a sign of the “death of the novel” itself. This seems especially prevalent when it is a woman author of color, such as the awkward backlash against the popularity of Zadie Smith. Or, as Florence Welch sings in the song Choreomania (a favorite for sure) ‘you can that rock and roll is dead, but is that just because it has not been resurrected in your image?’ Industries that had been allowed to be dominated by men tend to resist allowing women the same stardom afforded to men, and how much of claims of less talent are just an excuse to deny women space?‘I was just supposed to be the inspiration for some man’s great idea. Well fuck that.’Which is interesting because that infantilization of women artists is rather present in the novel itself. Daisy finds her early efforts either taken by men with no credit or completely dismissed in order to have her sing what the men in the industry want. Even when she has a decent enough record on her own, it isn’t until she has the already-established men of The Six (and Karen!) behind her that she really propels into stardom. Sure, the duet with Billy helps but fuck Billy. And for the most part people only want her on stage for her looks to accompany the “serious” artists and she has no interest in being an accessory. ‘I am not going to sit around sweating my ass off just so men can feel more comfortable. It’s not my responsibility to not turn them on. It’s their responsibility to not be an asshole.’Though this theme does bleed into another that the music industry is itself a business. Sure Daisy has raw talent, but as Teddy points out, none of her songs are actually finished. Yes there is the element that a woman isn’t given the same opportunities or trust to get a record that men are, but there is also the hard truth that music is an art and a business that takes a lot of work to perfect. More on that in a moment because even when Daisy proves herself it seems that she is only appreciated in context with Billy. And as wonderful and actually really intense the scene of Billy getting Daisy to record his song is, its also a reminder that Billy had to more or less break Daisy down emotionally to make her his muse for his art. And honestly, muse culture is gross and history is full of artists abusing their muses and then everyone overlooking the abuse because of the art it inspired. Take Picasso for instance. But also the gatekeeping around women in the arts is something that we still struggle with today and Daisy’s story helps illuminate that.‘I had absolutely no interest in being somebody else's muse.I am not a muse.I am the somebody.End of fucking story.’We do a lot of mythologizing about artistic industries and music is one of those that stands out the most. Musicians are storytellers themselves and there is always that question if the speaker of the song is truly the singer, a fictionalized version of an experience of the singer, or complete fiction. Fanbases love to dig into this, look at the online culture around Taylor Swift looking for deeper meanings and secret messages in her songs and constructing entire theories about her life from them. There is a great line from Graham however:‘Back then I thought music was just about music. But music is never about music. If it was, we’d be writing songs about guitars. But we don’t, we write songs about women.’The music industry is not just about music, its about the personality, its about the sexuality, its about the romance, its about the things that make you feel, its about storytelling. And this is all behind a large layer of mythologizing and storytelling itself that are orchestrated by an industry taking all the raw talent and molding it into something that will sell. In the film Inside Llewyn Davis—a personal favorite of mine—Oscar Issac’s folksinger says ‘you're not supposed to let your practice shit out. It ruins the mystique.’ We love the image of art being this raw talent and untainted beauty as if your favorite song is a rose that grew from the concrete. But in actuality it is a highly calculated look that a LOT of people orchestrate to give that impression. Any art really, even the best raw talented writers have editors. Books are edited, publishers make changes, often the author has little say in some aspects. At the end of the day we have to remember books and albums are a product. And this book does a good job of showing that.This isn’t to say that I’m into the fact that art industries are a business (I’m not a very yay profit person to be honest, I mean, I work at a library), just that it becomes its own sort of storytelling in the guise of marketing and I think this book does a good job at looking at this sort of storytelling beneath the storytelling. We see how truth gets subverted and stylized to shape an image, such as Billy killing the story about his stint in rehab to have an article focus on the supposed hatred of him and Daisy off-stage, which only heightens people’s interest in seeing them. Ultimately, we can look at the product of a band and all the mythologizing around it as a sort of art itself. As Frank Zappa on said, ‘Music, in performance, is a type of sculpture. The air in the performance is sculpted into something.’ A band is a sculpture in a way too. ‘ It’s an album about the push and full of stability and instability. It’s about the struggle that I live almost every day to not do something stupid. Is it about love? Yeah, of course it is. But that’s because it’s easy to disguise almost anything as a love song.’In his book How Fiction Works, critic James Wood (the book critic from The New Yorker not the guy who voiced Hades) writes ‘Good fiction is not just a mirror of reality, but a lens through which we can see reality more clearly.’ FIction can unpack reality, take out all the things hiding underneath the mythologizing or expose the toxic elements we are often coached by society to overlook. What Reid chooses to leave in or what to leave out in the constructing of a band narrative says a lot and a major theme is the way the culture around music leads to a lot of abuse. Right off the bat someone mentions that, while they don’t agree with it, a lot of rockstars slept with underaged girls and thats ‘just the way it was’ (the fact that the book is told in retrospect allows for some subtle moments of people distancing themselves from events in the past at a few points). People knew it was happening and nobody did anything, it was just normalized. The rampant drug abuse is not only normalized but encouraged with Daisy commenting that she was able to have ‘any narcotic anytime I needed and no one was stopping me.’ Drugs kept the musicians awake, kept them partying, kept them fun, but it ruined a lot of lives. ‘Well this is how dark the world can be,’ one of the Dunn brothers mentions upon seeing their own estranged father with a barely legal girl, but its all a toxic masculinity people just accepted.We see how these elements and ideas around rock culture encouraged members to fall down dark holes. Billy especially. Though understanding does not mean condoning and Billy is sort of a shit, but we also see how easily it was to get pulled in that direction. Daisy too and the way people clung to her fame. When the #MeToo movement started up and a lot of musicians began to be accused, people (mostly men) were taken aback and often offended—it was such a cultural norm that to be confronted with the truth that it was abuse shattered not only an image of the music icon but the idea of rock and roll itself and how that harbored horrific abuse (and the gatekeeping talked about earlier).‘I think you have to have faith in people before they earn it. Otherwise it's not faith, right?’At its heart, this is a story about love as well as music. There are a lot of types of love represented here, love for your bandmates, for your family, for yourself, as well as romantic love. While I didn’t particularly enjoy the Billy/Daisy love plot beyond the tension and that they were both sort of just awful, it also felt very true to life and how people are pushed by the image of themselves and struggle with how to hold that in their personal lives.‘All I will say is that you show up for your friends on their hardest days. And you hold their hand through the roughest parts. Life is about who is holding your hand and, I think, whose hand you commit to holding.’Dick Clark once said that ‘music is the soundtrack of your life.’ And what Daisy Jones & the Six does well is show the life behind the music and through a really well orchestrated reenactment of the sort of behind-the-music “rockumentaries” that have always captivated fans. It all ends up with a pretty nice twist on the “why” this interview series is taking place and I feel a big takeaway is that the truth is often hiding in all the variations of memory, or framing of truth, that those who experienced it will tell you. It’s well crafted and speaks to a larger insight into the culture of 70s rock in a way that reminds us that artists are like everyone else, susceptible to bad behavior, struggles, poor decision making, laughter, love, and heartbreak. I really appreciated the addition of song lyrics at the end. This was a fun read, well, fun listen as I highly recommend doing the audiobook, and reminded me how much I love music. So, what would be the songs that make up the soundtrack of your life?4/5‘When you think of me, I hope it ruins rock 'n' roll.’...more",Notes are private!,65,255,1,"Jan 21, 2024","Jan 27, 2024","Jan 21, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40597810-daisy-jones-the-six

The awkwardness of a reunion vacation with a high school best friend after beginning to grow apart down separate paths in college is brought to life in Roaming, a gorgeous and somber YA graphic novel from cousin-duo Jillian Tamaki and Mariko Tamaki. Capturing the spirit of a vacation gone wrong as friendships erode, Roaming quietly sneaks into your heart and pulls all the heartstrings in its bittersweet slice-of-life story.  [image]As they so brilliantly did in This One Summer), Roaming handles a lot of heavy themes through quotidian and understated narratives and presents them through art that uses a limited color palette but really explores the possibilities of visual storytelling with shifts into surrealism or full page spreads that create a montage effect. We follow friends Zoe and Dani’s reunion for a trip to Manhattan, but Fiona—a “friend” of Dani’s who has tagged along—and her strong personality starts to come between the two as she sways the trip to center herself. All the uncomfortable feelings of being out of place—both in physical space such as lost amidst the big city but also in time feeling the close friendship of the past slipping away—are captured so well.  [image]What works best here is the subtleties of the story. While Fiona is overtly a jerk and we can all feel for Dani being left out and distanced from her own best friend by Fiona and Zoe’s budding romance, its the small quips themselves that seem to speak the loudest. Fiona making Dani ashamed for what she enjoys, for instance, such as undercutting her enjoyment of the museum for being privileged Western propaganda, starts to reveal not only her narcissism but also the lengths she’ll go to appear cool, confident with unblemished tastes because inside she is just as lost and directionless as everyone else (her insistance on not looking at maps to not “look like tourists” is, in a way, a metaphor of how she lives her life). But I also enjoyed the slowburn arc of Zoe, who is also clearly sifting through a sense of self to understand her own queer identity and direction, being drawn to Fiona (and casting aside Dani in the process who now seems a bit embarrassing) but then realizing that sort of “cool” is not as desirable when she sees the consequences.  [image]Ultimately, this story just felt real. It feels awkward, it feels embarrassing, it feels like trying to grow up and make mistakes and trying to connect your past to your present in hopes it will be an arrow to a future. Its a story that makes you feel the growing pains. The ending, or rather the abrupt finish to the story, is really impressively orchestrated. There is no resolution because, especially during the early college years, we have no resolution of self and only a continuous, amorphous process. Nothing here really comes to a quotable resolve, but we can feel the shift in each character. And that’s life. And I love that the Tamaki cousins can capture it so beautifully.  [image]The art is gorgeous here too. I particularly like the experimentation it uses, capturing montage moments that reflect a slow and ponderous passage of time, or city views that really emphasize how small they feel in their own lives. But most impressive was a late scene where a conversation between Dani and Zoe over a shared joint transports the imagery back a few years to their high school selves during a house party while the dialogue remains in the present. We really get a better insight into who they were not so long ago and the sudden return to the present really puts in sharp contrast the selves they were with the selves they are trying to be.It’s a really moving moment and shows they can take visual media to exciting places that show more than they tell.Roaming was a bit hit for me. I love how quiet and understated it was yet still able to really move me to the core. I think a lot of this one really hit home though, and while I felt a strong empathetic familiarity with Zoe there have been moments in life where I was the Dani in a situation. I’ve never been cool enough to be the Fiona but I’ve definitely been an asshole so maybe? Either way, this is a great slice-of-life that tackles a lot of themes around growing pains and I’ll probably be thinking about this one for awhile.4/5  [image]...more",Notes are private!,8,125,1,"Jan 20, 2024","Jan 20, 2024","Jan 20, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/62207006-roaming

Destiny of the Republic from historian Candice Miller is a riveting read that has so much going on in it (except for medical hygiene), threading multiple historical figures and narratives to tell the tale of lesser known President Garfield’s rather heartwarming rise to office and his very brief time there. Miller crafts a rather cinematic read out of what is surely an impressive scope of research which makes this quite engaging, though at times the rather ambitious structure feels like the aim for a novel-like narrative steamrolls over the smaller details. I appreciate the effort to make this rather brisk and brief as far as historical non-fiction goes, though there were many times I wished it would have lingered a bit more over certain aspects. Still, this is quite fascinating and this is coming from someone that tends to not have much interest in non-fiction and especially not about American presidents but I found this to be a rather enjoyable, informative and fascinating read.‘If wrinkles must be written upon our brows, let them not be written upon the heart. The spirit should not grow old.’-James Garfield This book first and foremost made me really like Garfield. He has so many great quotes—beyond ‘I hate mondays’—and Miller creates a really flattering historical portrait of him. I loved the story of him showing up to the Convention intending to cast a vote and leaving as candidate, with people cheering him on and Chester Arthur having a little anxiety cry over concerns of possibly having to be president. Garfield just comes across as a genuinely decent person committed to his country, against slavery, and apparently a real chatterbox. Miller juxtaposes him with a lot of villainous characters, particularly the framing of Dr. Bliss as being the real cause-of-death from not just leaving Garfield alone and constantly poking around inside him without following basic cleanliness as laid out by Joseph Lister (and looking on the wrong side of the body) and Garfieldn’s assassin, Charles Guiteau.   [image]Engraving of Garfield having been shot by Guiteau from Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper, 1881Guiteau’s story is fascinating, from being unwanted in a sex cult and nicknamed Charles “Guit-out” (this same sex cult is best known for creating the silverware brand Oneida) to shooting a president over concerns he would end the spoil system and that he deserved consulship. Guiteau had come to believe he had been instrumental in Garfield's rise to power and was ordered by God to carry out the killing. A detail that really stuck with me was his imprisonment and his belief the guards were there to protect him and on his side, only to discover they were there to ensure nobody else killed him after one guard took a shot at him (and was sentenced to 8 years in prison for it). The Bell narrative, however, while fascinating for his attempts to create a device to detect the bullet in Garfield, sort of kills the momentum and often feels inflated at the expense of other aspects that I’d rather have gone into with greater detail.  [image]1881 political cartoon of Guiteau holding a gun and a sign reading ""an office or your life.""A fun bookclub read and a fascinating look at history, Destiny of the Republic is a great little non-fiction on a period I knew next to nothing about. Its not something I would normally pick up, which is something I really appreciate about belonging to a bookclub and finding new reads that I end up enjoying. I enjoyed that it was quick and read much like a novel, though sometimes it felt a bit overambitious and might have been better (and I can't believe this is something I'd ever say) if it was longer and a bit more dry. I definitely have spent time looking up a lot of the events that were covered though. For a fun, fascinating and engaging historical read, Destiny of the Republic is a worthwhile choice.Also, wash your hands.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,16,102,1,"Jan 18, 2024","Jan 18, 2024","Jan 18, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10335318-destiny-of-the-republic

Both will conspire against you eventually.’Literature is filled with stories where the desire for power corrupts even the best of intentions and the worlds of science fiction often serve as a warning that great advances in technology can quickly become great evil when put to the wrong use or in the wrong hands. Hello, Moto, the short story by the incredible afrofuturist writer Nnedi Okorafor, tells such a story when Rain blends ‘juju and technology’ in a hope to control corruption in Nigeria and bring hope to the people. However, her invention, a complex wig of power, becomes such an overwhelming feeling of empowerment to the two friends Rain entrusts with wearing them that instead of assuaging misery they become harbingers of destruction. A brief tale with an unfortunately abrupt ending that sort of derails it all, Hello, Moto, is still a fun and fascinating read brought to life by Okorafor’s rather infectious use of voice in her works and the African settings and influence that are weaved into her science fiction.  [image]The three characters as represented in the short film adaptation, Hello, Rain by C.J. Obasi‘My name is Rain and if I didn’t get this right, the corruption already rife in this country would be nothing compared to what was to come. And it would all be my fault.’The short story (which you can read in its entirety HERE) takes its title from a familiar Motorola ringtone (listen to it here) which also features into the story. The intrusive ring is a reminder of the way technology has intruded into our lives, becoming as natural to the soundscapes of our existence as bird chirps or blowing wind. This is signature to many of Okorafor’s works, showing how the influence and technology of the Western world has embedded itself into Africa and is often a source of corruption and colonialism and Okorafor often represents technology as being able to inflict horrific and abrupt violence. Even with the best intentions.‘Stealing from people is not what I made these for! I made them to help us give! To cure the deep-seated culture of corruption by giving people hope and a sense of patriotism. Remember?’The wigs created by rain were made to help ‘but all it sparked in the North was death and mayhem,’ and the two other wig users are stealing the life forces of those around them. I enjoy the way Okorafor can imply a lot in her stories without ever really letting you know exactly what is happening or how it works, but the hints of ideas instill enough horror that those details are beside the point. It is evil is all we really need to know. I would, however, like to know more about what comes next because the non-ending is a bit of a vibe killer. ‘This is the story of How the Smart Woman Tried to Right Her Great Wrong.’This is an engaging and exciting little read, though right as things start to get truly wild it ends abruptly so reader be warned. I love non-endings usually but this felt egregious. Non-endings are a bit like disposing of a balloon after a party—you can do it with a bang or just slowly deflate it with a sigh. This was the later, but in the balloon scenario the party is still in full swing and everyone turns in dismay that, apparently, the party is over without warning and it’s not even midnight. Still, the point is made loud and clear I guess and the blend of sci-fi, fantasy and political commentary is sharp. I suppose speculation and uncertainty is part of the point? But c’mon. Airing of grievances aside, Okorafor is amazing, and even these little nuggets of stories manage to imply a vast world with minimal world building, I only wish there was a bit more to this tale.2.5/5...more",Notes are private!,14,65,1,not set,not set,"Jan 17, 2024",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/12802078-hello-moto

While browsing the basement of After-Words, I discovered a copy of Baldwin’s first published novel, Go Tell It On the Mountain stickered with Chicago’s One City, One Book initiative and figured no better time than to finally read this beloved classic by an author I’ve recently come to love. It was a perfect choice and companion as I read it traveling over the hills and everywhere for my harrowing journey home on various trains and buses that kept breaking down. To read the works of James Baldwin is to encounter prose that lingers like a prayer on your lips, prose that you’d suspect could be picked up on a seismograph for the way it shakes you deeply within, prose that could feasibly crack open the world. And to read Go Tell It On the Mountain is to bask in the bitter beauty of an undeniable classic of religious trauma, queer desires, and grappling with family legacy.Published in 1953 and introducing the literary world to a writer who would go down in history as an essential author, Go Tell It On the Mountain is a semi-autobiographical work that truly comes out swinging. Baldwin confronts issues of racism, sexuality, sin and the hypocrisy of religion being harnessed to uphold oppressive patriarchy and other abuses while flooding his pages with gorgeous passages on desire and struggles for selfhood. Brilliantly condensing decades of lives struggling to survive society and themselves all within the span of a narrative set over 24 hours, Mountain also condenses a vast American experience into the corridors of Harlem and the blocks around the aptly named Temple of the Fire Baptized. Here we experience 14 year old John’s internal tribulations to either accept the endless struggle up the mountain of holiness—‘ It’s a hard way. It’s uphill all the way’—or a rejection of the church altogether. Yet the scope of the novel rests beyond the boundaries of John and, through flashbacks and visions, the novel becomes one about the legacy of John’s family and the struggles of Black Americans everywhere in the 20th century.‘There are people in the world for whom ""coming along"" is a perpetual process, people who are destined never to arrive.’Taking its title from the popular spiritual tune, Baldwin immerses us in a family and community for whom the church encompasses the whole of their daily existence. In many ways this felt like a good companion read to Jeanette Winterson’s Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit in its depiction of an insular community that uses religious devotion and fervor to justify incredible amounts of abuse and castigate not only queer desires but any sexuality outside of marriage. At the heart of the story is John who is expected to walk in the footsteps of his father—or so he thinks Gabriel is his father—and become a preacher. Gabriel is the personification of Christianity in the novel with Baldwin representing his criticisms of the organized religion through his portrayal of Gabriel as hypocritical, misogynistic and abusive. He is also very imaged-based, with his coming to God informed by the opportunities of social positioning as is his first marriage to Deborah—once she is considered the holiest of the community—a calculated move to be seen as holy himself. Baldwin represents religiosity as a false front, one that uses piety to mask abuse.‘salvation was finished, damnation was real’Baldwin demonstrates how religion is used for purposes of control within the community, or for Gabriel over his family. The fear of sin is pervasive, such as the novel opening with John feeling he will ‘be bound in hell a thousand years’ for his act of masturbation, and used to control behavior. Especially of women or young people, as we see in the early pages when Elisha and Ellie May are publicly shamed for ‘walking disorderly’ as evidence they ‘were in danger of straying from the truth.’ Gabriel sees it as his duty to uphold moral standings in his congregation, though not in himself, and John worries it may already be too late to be saved so he feels the need for salvation all the more intensely. However, he recognizes Gabriel as a gatekeeper to salvation and that he cannot ‘bow before the throne of grace without first kneeling to his father,’ which is something he feels he cannot do having recognized Gabriel as a cruel abuser who beats his children and “fondles” his own daughter.‘ The menfolk, they die, and it's over for them, but we women, we have to keep on living and try to forget what they done to us.’Baldwin also represents how Christianity upholds patriarchy through the rather misogynistic double standards against women. Sexuality is a taboo and while sex outside marriage is considered unthinkable, Gabriel had a child out of wedlock, Royal, who he discards feeling he is unholy and not worth his life, and thinks of the mother, Esther, as a ‘harlot’ for having accepted sex outside marriage and entered into ‘a forbidden darkness.’ Similarly, Deborah was shamed after having been the victim of sexual assault by a group of men—like the story of Medusa, the victim is the one who bears the punishment—and was only acceptable to society if she devote her entire being to holiness ‘like a terrible example of humility, or like a holy fool.’ She comes to hate all men and sees ‘they live only to gratify on the bodies of women their brutal and humiliating needs.’ The men hide behind claims of religious superiority, chastizing women for the things they do themselves, and thus religion only becomes another pillar reinforcing patriarchal abuse.For John there is the issue of ‘a sudden yearning tenderness for Elisha... desire, sharp and awful,’ a desire he has been taught is filthy and thus internalizes it to believe himself filthy and unworthy of salvation.‘Dust was in his nostrils, sharp and terrible, and the feet of saints, shaking the floor beneath him, raised small clouds of dust that filmed his mouth. He heard their cries, so far, so high above him—he could never rise that far. He was like a rock, a dead man's body, a dying bird, fallen from an awful height; something that had no power of itself, any more, to turn.’ Baldwin probes at the long history of homophobia in religious communities, an issue that continues to this day and studies have shown a greater risk for internalized homophobia, rejection from family, mental health risks and suicide for LGBTQ+ youth in religious households. This theme of struggling to accept a gay sexuality as natural was explored in depth in Baldwin’s later novel, Giovanni's Room, where David’s internalized shame leads to self-destructive tendencies and outwards abuse to others.‘The rebirth of the soul is perpetual; only rebirth every hour could stay the hand of Satan.’Still further we see how religion is used to justify greater atrocities, such as John’s vision of the biblical story of Ham was used to justify slavery. The novel also explores how the legacy of slavery still casts a vile shadow over the country and racism runs rampant. There is the unjust treatment of Richard arrested for theft despite being innocent and simply a Black man at the wrong place and the wrong time (not unlike the Dylan song) which leads to his tragic end. There is even internalized racism, with Deborah seeing Gabriel’s dark skin as a sin which nudges the long, racist legacy of associating Blackness with evil. This is all tied in with Gabriel being born from a former slave, showing how the cruelties and abuses of slavery continue to manifest themselves for generations to come.‘You in the Word or you ain’t - ain’t no halfway with God.’These experiences are the ones John considers in opposition to his need for salvation. His rejection of the church becomes, ultimately, a rejection of society at large and all the racism, homophobia, misogyny and abuse. Yet it is hard to imagine beyond the bubble of the church, which thinks of itself as a safe haven from all the sinners and “undesirables” they pass on their way. He feels trapped and helpless, and his frustrations with the futility of cleaning the rug—a never ending task—is symbolic of the path up the “mountain” to holiness. This is also symbolized in his climb to the cliff in Central Park:‘He did not know why, but there arose in him an exultation and a sense of power, and he ran up the hill like an engine, or a madman, willing to throw himself headlong into the city that glowed before him. But when he reached the summit he paused; he stood on the crest of the hill, hands clasped beneath his chin, looking down. Then he, John, felt like a giant who might crumble this city with his anger.’He comes to see life as an endless struggle beleaguered by sin, yet runs down the “mountain” anyways. ‘If it’s wrong, I can always climb back up,’ he thinks. Yet still he must go to the threshing-floor to be judged, and hopes he can be found righteous.‘It was his hatred and his intelligence that he cherished, the one feeding the other.’This is a powerful novel, one that devastates in theme, exhausts you in its moral burdens, yet utterly enchants you in pitch perfect prose. Go Tell It On the Mountain is a marvelous microcosm of society at large in the day-long drama of a mass and generational struggles of a family that put Baldwin on the map. He would fulfill this early promise time and time again. Personally I felt rather outside the novel, not having much experience with being immersed in a religious community, but I know many who’s stories of their own upbringing rang in harmony with the book. This is a harrowing tale that takes dead aim at society, hypocrisy and abuse and delivers heavy blows.4.5/5‘Men spoke of how the heart broke up, but never spoke of how the soul hung speechless in the pause, the void, the terror between the living and the dead; how, all garments rent and cast aside, the naked soul passed over the very mouth of Hell. Once there, there was no turning back; once there, the soul remembered, though the heart sometimes forgot. For the world called to the heart, which stammered to reply; life, and love, and revelry, and, most falsely, hope, called the forgetful, the human heart.

This book was selected for my bookclub by my friend who’s son made him read it after it blew his mind. A few years ago, the son read a goodreads  about it where the er’s friend had their bookclub read the novel and everyone really enjoyed it. And oddly enough, though I only just read this book, goodreads is showing I wrote this  back in 2012 so who knows…Jokes aside, this was quite fun and goes some surprisingly dark places. While Hautman is now known for his YA novels—he won a National Book Award for Young People’s Literature in 2004 for Godless—he had previously written novels for adults and had intended Mr Was to be so as well. After struggling to make the plot work he changed his 30 year old narrator to a teen and the success of Mr Was kickstarted his career as a YA novelist. It works quite well, moving between the perspective of teenage Jack Lund and the enigmatic Mr Was and all framed as being strange and mysterious journal entries found by the author himself. This is much darker than expected, in a good way, and the story kicks off when Jack travels far back in the past after his alcoholic father murders his mother. His plan is to live out the many years and then stop his father, but life gets in the way and Jack finds himself caught in the violence of WWII and, later, the confines of a mental hospital and much of the tension surrounds concerns he will ever remember his mission in the first place. I enjoy how the story nudges the grandfather paradox, and not only as an exploration of the theory but rather directly as Jack quite literally becomes his own grandfathers rival…for the affections of his grandmother (unbeknownst to Jack). This was fun and rather mind blowing. It leans into a lot of familiar time travel tropes but also has a lot of freshness to it as well, such as the two timelines of Jack do cross paths but they are unable to see one another. There is a great moment of Jack watching a riderless bike navigate it’s way down a street and Hautman does well by having the book read with a lot of horror aesthetics. It’s fun to remember this is a YA that was intended as an unsettling adult novel, so it’s much edgier than one would expect. In fact it felt a lot like a Twilight Zone episode. It was also a perfect bookclub read because there’s just SO many different aspects to talk about and works well for readers of any age. A quick but mind bending read.

[image]The humans have been chased out and the animals are left to form their own perfect government…but there’s a reason for the saying “absolute power corrupts absolutely” and George Orwell’s 1945 classic is a searing look at how great and noble ideas can be hijacked by those hungry for power. Brazilian artist Odyr has adapted Orwell’s Animal Farm into this gorgeous graphic novel that upholds the integrity of the original story while delivering eye-catching visuals. It is a great story (I’ve ed it here for those looking for an analysis of Orwell’s work), though many previous adaptations have, not unlike the pigs in this tale, hijacked the message for their own purposes and propaganda. Orwell’s widow was eventually swayed to give film rights after being promised she could meet her favorite movie star, Clark Gable. The project, however, was secretly headed up by the CIA and they altered Orwell’s message to be a sweeping anti-socialist film. Later in 1999, a Hallmark adaptation completely took the teeth out of the story, having the farmer be even outcast from other farmers for being a bad animal owner and ending with a hip new farmer putting everything back to how it was. But here we see Odyr stick closely to the story, moving at a quick and exciting pace that really lets the visual medium shine.  [image]I really love the art. The thick brushstrokes and acrylic artwork has a lovely classic vibe to it, but the lettering and the tattoo-style font for the chapter numbers makes it feel modern and edgy. Which enhances the message that this is an old tale that is still pertinent to the modern day, a parable about abuse of power and propaganda that I’m glad to see continues to fascinate minds nearly a century after it was written.   [image]I’m always wary of reading adaptations of a book I just completed because the differences stand out in high contrast, but this really upheld the story and was a satisfying read. Some pages are a bit text heavy while other seem a bit too sparse (one of those illustrated full texts like they do with the Percy Jackson or Harry Potter series would be an ideal middle ground) but its just a delightful read that lets you see some of the best moments in the book.

Edith Wharton transforms this bleak atmosphere into her own icy novella, the trepidatious tragedy Ethan Frome, in which we find a man trapped by his own circumstances in a melancholic Massachusetts countryside under ‘pale skies’ from which ‘sheets of snow perpetually renewed.’ It is a tale of morals and duty conflicted by desire. A landscape of loneliness. A story where one is shook by the silence of internal screaming further muffled out by the falling snow. Yet, for all the heavy themes and dread, Wharton’s prose proves rather sprightly and gives the story a welcomed lightness that makes it a quick and engaging read. Sharply addressing the social suffocation from traditional gender roles and the temptations of desire, Ethan Frome is a chilling little book where a man’s dreams to escape his circumstances must run up against the beleaguering external forces of life and duty. It's a disaster we see coming, yet you won't want to look away.‘He lived in a depth of moral isolation too remote for casual access.’A big thank you to emma and her  for recommending this one to me. Ethan Frome novel serves as a sort of character study of the titular character, Ethan Frome, one that is slowly sussed out by a narrator who has taken an interest in the slow, sullen man. It is an engaging framing that invites a sense of mystery as we wonder how the hard-working Ethan came to be such a ‘ruin of a man.’ They hear whispers and half-stories but ‘I had the sense that the deeper meaning of the story was in the gaps,’ and it isn’t until being forced by a snowstorm to spend the night on Ethan’s farm that they learn his history and how falling in love with his ailing wife’s cousin led to tragedy. ‘I began to see what life there—or rather its negation—must have been in Ethan Frome’s young manhood.’There is a sense of Ethan as the literary “everyman,” being a stand-in for a humanity in his quest to break out of the harsh hand life dealt him, to assert a sense of free will against determinism. Ethan ‘with something bleak and unapproachable in his face’ is practically a mirror of the harsh world he lives in. ‘He seemed a part of the mute melancholy landscape, an incarnation of it's frozen woe,’ Wharton writes, ‘with all that was warm and sentient in him fast bound below the surface.’ Ethan’s father died young, his mother grew ill from loneliness and before she died had a young girl (Zeena) serve as her nurse, to whom Ethan would marry out of a sense of duty to keep the farm and family legacy going. But with Zeena—a city girl who resents their farm&now ill, bitter and aloof like his mother, Ethan’s desires turn to 21 year old Mattie, his wife’s cousin brought on as a live-in nurse. In Mattie and her vivaciousness, Ethan sees an escape from the cold farm and cold marriage, but Zeena may have taken notice and drops subtle hints of his burning desires for infidelity.The color red is highly symbolic in the novel. A bright fiery color against a pale, grey landscape to symbolize life and passion. We see it in Mattie’s scarf, which signals to Ethan she is different from the rest, or in her red ribbons, and these flashes of red mark their growing intimacy. Though Zeena’s prized dish is also red, and Mattie’s accidental destruction of it is a nod to her presence shattering the long untouched and faded marriage between Zeena and Ethan. And Ethan’s attempts to glue it together don’t pass Zeena’s inspection, a rather clear metaphor of his attempts at subverting their marriage in secret being less discrete than he thought.‘They stood together in the gloom of the spruces, an empty world glimmering about them wide and gray under the stars.’Wharton explores how Ethan is pulled in two directions, one in his desires for Mattie but also towards his duty to his wife, the farm, and social expectations. Leaving an ill wife is not going to look good, and not just because they are in a religious community but because it's a pretty shit thing to do. Wharton does attempt to soften the reader to this moral conundrum by making Zeena rather harsh, though it should be remembered that mentions like ‘she had taken everything else from him’ is from a narrator, presumably male, that is empathetic to Ethan. And it is fairly ironic that Ethan tells Mattie ‘I want to do for you and care for you. I want to be there when you're sick and when you're lonesome,’ when this is exactly what he will be denying his wife (though the sense of duty feels less begrudging when given to someone one chooses for themselves instead of by social needs). Still, Zeena serves as a personification of all the external forces that have worked against Ethan his whole life.‘All the long misery of his baffled past, of his youth of failure, hardship and vain effort, rose up in his soul in bitterness and seemed to take shape before him in the woman who at every turn had barred his way.’We see a sense of determinism winning out, that ambition leads to folly, that one is confined by their circumstances and all attempts to escape lead to further disaster, though we also can detect a message that this need not be the only way. That society has set us up for this failure and society is itself a creation of ours. This is most prominent in the way we see traditional gender roles as stifling here. Women are set up to fail and have no choice but the drudgery of household chores and servitude to a man. Mattie has no education beyond the ability to be a servant and women at the time were still not encouraged to seek higher education. And so, like her cousin before her, she had to serve a family and hope to be married into a reasonably liveable situation. Women were made to rely on a man, essentially. But also the traditional views of marriage, one made for “smart matchmaking” of being able to keep a farm and have a support instead of for love, also was often a path to resentment and loneliness. And divorce was still a huge social taboo. There is also some slight social class criticism, with Ethan bound to his low-income feeling resentment towards Denis Eady, a rich young man who positively invited a horse-whipping.’ Wharton shows how our lack of access to freedom and free will was largely at the mercy of a society that we can and should criticize to push public opinion towards progress.Ethan Frome is a chilly little novel, but one that captures an incredible sense of icy atmosphere and dread in order to better juxtapose the burning desires of Ethan at the heart of this tale. Much different than Wharton’s usual, more comedic novels, this is still a sharp story gorgeously written that delivers quite the punch. A great little winter read.3.5/5‘They seemed to come suddenly upon happiness as if they had surprised a butterfly in the winter woods.’...more",Notes are private!,38,164,1,"Jan 11, 2024","Jan 11, 2024","Jan 11, 2024",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5973996-ethan-frome

Examining the blurred boundary between human and animal, Hoke’s heartfelt and often hilarious novella follows the stream-of-consciousness of a queer mountain lion based on P-22, a real-life mountain lion who crossed the 405 and the 101 freeways to live in Griffith Park. This is a novel that seems like it shouldn’t work, yet it does. And marvelously so, making elements that could quickly trip into cloyingly quirky instead rise up in emotional and satirical glory. Hoke’s sharp yet playful prose comes at us in double-spaced, single lines, reading almost like poetry as the lion navigates complex emotions from hunger and shame to repressed desires and concerns around identity, but their perspective (the lion tells us they are they/them) also gives us a fascinating gaze at human society from the perspective of an outsider on our gross inequalities, narcissisms and ecological terrors. A quick but powerful read, Hoke’s offbeat Open Throat makes the familiar seem strange and the strange so utterly satisfying through the eyes of an unforgettable and tender narrator that, while an animal themselves, explores what it means to be human, themes of domestication, and removal from the wild.  [image]P-22, the “Hollywood Cat”This is a wild ride. A quick book that could feasibly be finished in a single evening, Open Throat’s unconventionality manages to pull a wide range of emotions and insights through the narrative while keeping the reader in rapt attention. While we never learn the name of our feline narrator because ‘it’s not made of noises a person can make,’ we are treated to a deep investigation into their emotional state and concerns for society. I was delighted to learn how much of this story comes from real events about P-22, to whom this book is dedicated and inspired by (Hoke says the story was also inspired by the song Hollywood from Nick Cave, which reminded him of P-22). Its a similar feeling to when I’m reading Ali Smith and think ‘that is an oddly specific detail’ only to find it is entirely true, and the true events on the life of this lion are just as thrilling as the novel such as P-22 taking up residence under someone’s porch or having been the likely culprit in the devouring of a beloved LA zoo koala. In her eulogy for P-22, California director for the National Wildlife Foundation Beth Pratt said:‘He changed us…He made us more human, made us connect more to that wild place in ourselves. We are part of nature and he reminded us of that.’This keys into a major theme of the novella, though as much as the lion makes us think about our humanity, the lion, in turn, feels they are becoming more human. A therapist is ‘something I want,’ for instance, though they also find annoyance in human behaviors. ‘I don’t trust screens to tell me who I am,’ they think upon seeing their reflection in a mirror.‘I want to devour their sound / I have so much language in my brain / and nowhere to put it.’The narration is made possible by the lion having picked up on human speech, either from the encampment of unhoused people for whom the lion feels an affinity for their shared outsider status or from the people hiking the trails.Sure, this may be a stretch for some but Hoke handles it in such a delightful way with situational irony and malapropisms that defamiliarizes the ordinary into an uncanny landscape where the abstractions of reality are more pronounced for analysis. Learning the language draws them closer to humans and I giggled at aspects such as picking up the word for helicopter but always as ‘fucking helicopter’ due to learning it from a man in tent city, or mistaking the term ‘scarcity mentality’ for ‘scare city’ which becomes an all-too-accurate name for LA. ‘I traded old fear for new fear.’Becoming more human also means processing internal struggles (a theme I’ve quite enjoyed in the Murderbot series). In many ways this story is symbolic of repressed identities and the ways society commodifies everything to take the bite out of it. Watching two men have sex in a cave dredges up bittersweet memories of a “relationship” the lion had with another lion, ‘the kill sharer,’ but also the traumatic memories of being cast out from their lion society by a violent father. ‘A father to a kitten is an absence,’ they reflect, ‘a grown cat to a father is a threat.’ This vague tale of violence and abusive fathers is a familiar queer trope, and Hoke juxtaposes the history of violence with the violence present in human society. And not just the threat of death to cross the freeway—‘the long death’—but also violence humans display against their own outsiders such as an act of horrific cruelty towards the unhoused people the lion clings near. ‘I know what their hands can do and what their hands would do and the violence waiting behind every motion.’I’ve never eaten a person / but today I might.’The story also looks at the ways society will take anything raw, wild, or unfamiliar and commoditize (think of how capitalism will often co-opt activism in order to render it as nothing but slogans on t-shirts) or domesticate it, such as the imagery of a wild mountain lion becoming a half-starved, tame and timid creature slinking through the streets of scare city. A lion is a perfect symbol for a book set in hollywood, which is full of icons like the MGM lion or Simba that take a wild beast and turn it into family friendly marketing. Disney in particular is called out in a surreal scene late in the novel that briefly envisions the lion in full anthropomorphic adaptation walking on two legs and enjoying the rides of Disneyland. There is a bit of irony that in the most notable moments of domestication when a teenage girl takes in the lion, she also pays homage to their wildness, calling them ‘heckit’ (the mythological Hecate associated with ideas of transition) and refers to them as a goddess.‘If you feel alone in the world / find someone to worship you’Though for all the ways the lion sees humans as perpetuating many of the world’s ills, there is also that affinity and tenderness many of them. Particularly the outcasts. Though, as we see in the shocking ending, the world of humans and animals are always separate. Open Throat is a reminder of the violence that gets swept under the rug or the other sacrifices made in order for the masses to pretend we live in a polite society and is an excellent edition to the genre of animal perspectives showing us what being human really looks like. I also can’t wrap this up without mentioning that I will forever read novels about pumas in honor of Mike Puma, some of you here may remember him, a best friend that I miss every single day. Love you buddy. Anyways. Offbeat, humorous and often surreal, Open Throat is an endlessly readable tale that reminds us to embrace the wilderness and wild because society can never truly cage it.4.5/5Cause they say there is a cougar that roams these parts, With a terrible engine of wrath for a heart That she is white and rare and full of all kinds of harmAnd stalks the perimeter all day longBut at night lays trembling in my arms.-Nick Cave, Hollywood...more",Notes are private!,24,216,1,"Jan 10, 2024","Jan 10, 2024","Jan 10, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62039259-open-throat

Since the dawn of time, they had been the victims of decisions that were taken without their consent.’Long through history we find the tragedy of women facing disbelief and dismissal over medical complaints while also being accused of hysteria as further reason for dismissal. Hysteria was one of the most commonly diagnosed conditions of the 18th and 19th centuries, though it originates in Ancient Greece where Hippocrates said a woman's uterus could travel around the body wreaking havoc on mental and physical health. Hence the term hysteria coming from the Greek word for uterus: hystera. French author Victoria Mas’s novel The Man Women’s Ball captures a specific period in the history of hysteria diagnosis as Mas crafts a riveting novel based on the true details of Salpêtrière hospital and the work done there in the 19th century by Jean-Martin Charcot. Building towards a Lenten Ball where patients would mix with the aristocracy as one of the many rather exploitive performances these women were subjected to, Mas’ gripping historical novel—translated by Frank Wynne—examines the way hysteria was often an excuse to lock women away for any reason as a larger exploration of the repression against women and the sisterhoods that form in defiance of patriarchy.   [image]Depiction of Charcot’s hysteria performances to eager doctors‘My book is a fiction,’ Mas explained in a conversation with The Independent,’but it is based on events that really happened in 19th-century Paris. Terrible things that really happened to many women in the Salpêtrière 200 years ago, when the very thin line between medical treatment and voyeurism was blurred.’ The novel draws from a great depths of research and depicts real figures from history, such as Charcot himself, though he is more a looming figure casting his shadow over the story, and Louise Augustine Gleizes who was Charcot’s most public and photographed patient and who’s story forms the framework of the novel. Along with Louise we have Geneviève, a nurse at the hospital who finds her convictions tested, and Eugénie, the daughter of an aristocrat who finds herself discarded into Salpêtrière on claims of hysteria. Though is it more her claims of visitations from beyond the grave or her outspoken nature (and her “scandelous” behavoir of openly reading authors like Victor Hugo) that leads to her internment, because, as we learn, hysteria seems less a diagnosis than a rationalization for sending a woman away.‘The Salpêtriére is a dumping ground for women who disturb the peace. An asylum for those whose sensitivities do not tally what is expected of them. A prison for women guilty of possessing an opinion.’Hysteria is the common charge as a blanket enforcement of misogyny, ‘the system that operates within a patriarchal social order to police and enforce women’s subordination and to uphold male dominance,’ as Kate Manne puts it. Charges of being over-emotional or simply having an outspoken opinion were enough to be labeled hysterical and be shut away, and men eagerly took the opportunity to rid themselves of wives and daughters in this way. One might be reminded of author Anna Kavan, who’s husband had his mistress move into their home and moved his wife into the basement. When they found her a nuisance, they had her committed to an asylum for being hysterical (further sending a message that a women's understandable frustration is not deemed valid), which she fictionalized in her book Asylum Piece. And this still happens today, look at the conservatorship over Britney Spears after she exhibited mental health issues from being pushed to the brink. It all became an excuse to remove her agency over herself and her finances. ‘As long as men have pricks, all the evil in this world will go on existing,’ Mas writes, and as long as women show agency in a patriarchal society, men will find ways to self-justify abusing them. Which is why stories like this are important in understanding how to detangle the web of misogyny.‘Somewhere between an asylum and a prison, the Salpetriere took in those that Paris did not know how to cope with: invalids and women.’Known as the ‘father of modern neurology,’—though nicknamed ‘Napoleon of neuroses’—Charcot opened a clinic in Salpêtrière in 1882 where he examined women with cases of hysteria. His work with patients included hypnosis and cauterisation of the cervix and compression of the ovaries, which was done with a vice. He would hold public performances of his hypnosis, which were a massive spectacle at the time despite the obvious ethical issues here. This sort of exploitation and experimental treatment make up a lot of the novel, but so does the ways in which the women find to support one another and challenge their ways of thinking. ‘What is important is not to have beliefs, but to be able to doubt, to question anything, everything, even oneself,’ Mas writes, and much of the book involves realizing one must look beneath the surface of what is socially accepted and enforced in a patriarchal society in order to break free from its shackles.   [image]One of the patients as photographed by Dr. Charcot.This is a rather short novel, with events happening at a pretty rhythmical click and while I tend to prefer more succinct books, this one almost feels a bit constrained. The focus remains on the major themes of oppression and resistance, but as a historical novel it seems to dip in and out of historical set pieces instead of really immersing you in them. Which is a minor complaint as the story kept me riveted as the tension builds towards the titular ball. The Man Women’s Ball is a fascinating read that explores a frustrating period of history yet casts its message into the present to remind us these lessons are still just as important as ever.3.5/5‘They are no longer wives or mothers or adolescent girls, they are no longer women to be considered or contemplated, they will never be women who are desired or loved; they are patients.

After moving to a new town amidst her parent’s marital struggles, Liv is determined to not let anyone get close to her after being outed as bisexual ruined her social life at her former school. At least she has the mall to escape to, though her classmates she is reluctant to befriend are also always there to sweep her up in their angsty drama. ‘'Cause we were like the mall before the Internet, it was the one place to be,’ as Taylor Swift sings.

I also quite enjoyed the early 2000s setting of mall goth fashion (this book screams Hot Topic) and that they all hang out at the mall arcade for some Dance Dance Revolution. I had a friend in high school that would make us all hang out at the arcade because he was determined to get the high score on DDR (I think he eventually did?) but I was more of a pinball person.  [image]This book gets to some heavy issues, particularly with an English teacher who seems like a good listener and support person but starts to cross some lines when they begin an online chat friendship. Beware any older guy that encourages you to write a paper about Lolita! I think the book handles the topic very well while keeping it accessible and appropriate for the younger end of the teen audience spectrum that this seems aimed at.Quick, quirky and cute, Mall Goth is a wonderful little graphic novel that brings the early 2000s back and handles emotional drama in a great way.

Mexican Gothic from Silvia Moreno-Garcia is the latter, engulfing the reader in the dark, twisted corridors of plot amidst an almost choking atmosphere of dread and decay. It is a slow-burn of a narrative, not unlike the way one shuffles forward in trepidation through a haunted house, the burning glow of a candle our only light. But beyond that, Mexican Gothic is a horror of history, weaving a bloody legacy of colonialism and the repression of women through this ghastly tale of a house that might be consuming minds and bodies. Drawing on a long history of the gothic tradition but with a fresh and fierce twist, Moreno-Garcia creates a postcolonialist horror that delivers as many social criticisms as it does scares and shrieks.‘ She wasn't one for believing in things that go bump in the night either, but right that second she firmly felt every spook and demon and evil thing might be crawling about the earth…’Call me late to the party, but I finally understand all the hype. Having recently been impressed by Moreno-Garcia’s The Lover I was recommended this by emma griffioen! and her wonderful  and found this to be a dark delight. The story moves slowly, picking up dread all along the way and is just a feast of atmosphere and tone. It is also highly cinematic and I’m shocked this isn’t already a film. There are a lot of similarities between this and What Moves the Dead by T. Kingfisher, something Kingfisher acknowledges in the intro to that book, though they both stand apart quite well and make a very different use of their shared evil.‘The walls speak to me. They tell me secrets. Don’t listen to them, press your hands against your ears, Noemí. There are ghosts. They’re real.’I enjoy the way Mexican Gothic superimposes a traditional English gothic narrative trope over a Mexican landscape which, thematically, already implies an aspect of colonialism in the narrative. This is a tale of how the Doyle family legacy is one of violence and power, where even their self-mythologizing about providing the town with jobs and money—at the expense of strapping the town forever in their debt and service—can’t erase the real bodies buried in their wake. Moreno-Garcia touches on the aspects of relying on the aid of indigenous peoples before massacring them to steal their resources and land. One should not be surprised history would return to haunt, though Moreno-Garcia offers an unexpected twist where it isn’t their sins returning to haunt them but instead the sins growing hungrier for more…‘Loyalty to the family is rewarded, and impertinence is punished.’The patriarchal legacy is also a source of evil casting a long shadow across the novel as well as a threat of immediate danger in the way it has found to perpetuate itself from generation to generation. It is one shown to rule through violence and repression (and some sci-fi help too), and Noemí—who is an excellent character both capable and feisty—is an excellent counterpoint to it all. ‘Noemí's father said she cared too much about her looks and parties to take school seriously, as if a woman could not do two things at once,’ we are told, and we see how she aims to be able to be the best of both worlds. Though her struggles for education and independence are always beset by the patriarchal forces and we see the clear double standards held against women.‘She thought that men such as her father could be stern and men could be cold like Virgil, but women needed to be liked or they’d be in trouble. A woman who is not liked is a bitch, and a bitch can hardly do anything: all avenues are closed to her.’This all plays into a sense of gaslighting that occurs in the novel, with Catalina and Ruth being a sort of play on the “madwoman in the attic” trope of gothic fiction, or, most notably, the way it was addressed as a post-colonial work in Jean Rhys’ Wide Sargasso Sea. Though the yellow mold in Noemí room also seems to hint at another work of feminist fiction: The Yellow Wallpaper by Charlotte Perkins Gilman.‘In a sense all dreams foretell events, but some more clearly than others.’This book was impossible to put down and offers a lot of legit chills and thrills. It does use dreams fairly heavily as narrative trope which I often don’t particularly enjoy, though it does integrate itself quite well into the story and horror elements and also functions as a vessel to see the way the past and present are haunted by each other.‘The truth was she was afraid of going to bed, of what nightmares might uncoil in the dark. What did people do after witnessing the horrors they had seen? Was it possible to slip back into normality, to play pretend and go on? She wanted to think this was exactly the case, but she was afraid sleep would prove her wrong.’This all moves towards a rather incredible ending and the slowburn of the narrative almost feels like foreshadowing for the rather amazing climatic scene. And, in the face of colonialism and violent patriarchy, who hasn’t wanted it all to burn? The novel does turn a bit from the gothic to a more modern style horror in the later sections, though it flows pretty smoothly and the twist is an excellent symbol of the ways patriarchal legacies are parasitical on the communities they repress. This was quite the ride. The homage to the history of the gothic but in a way that represents a reaction to colonialism and a path to the future—the progressive woman of color valuing education and independence rising over the legacy of a white patriarchy repressing the working class. Mexican Gothic is a haunted house of history where every page lures you deeper into its catacombs and it is a journey I would definitely recommend.4.5/5‘The world might indeed be a cursed circle; the snake swallowed its tail and there could be no end, only an eternal ruination and endless devouring.’...more",Notes are private!,43,265,1,"Jan 03, 2024","Jan 03, 2024","Jan 03, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53152636-mexican-gothic

The winter ‘invites a turning in, a quieting, an upped interiority,’ writes Nina MacLaughlin in her essays on winter, and it is in this introspective spirit of the season that Oscar Wilde asserts ‘wisdom comes with winter.’ But there is a duality to winter, for there is also the harshness, the chilling reminder of our frailty and mortality, and often we withdraw indoors and into ourselves. The political metaphor is right there for the grasping and Ali Smith manages to take and transcend it brilliantly in Winter, the second book of her seasonally thematic tetraology. The prose of Winter drifts down through puns and politics (there’s enough wordplay here to make Nabokov and Pynchon envious) as the novel becomes a kaleidoscopic expression of the essence of winter. Yet it is so much more than that, functioning as an investigation into the interplay of art, identity, truth, beauty and culture on social levels both political and personal as well as an effective publishing experiment to capture a current moment of social discordance as it unfolds in real time. It is a tale of British politics and British artists, yet it also feels a universal exploration of truth and beauty in a time of great anxieties. Set during the days surrounding Christmas and matching the intimacy and interiority of the season, Winter is as sharp and insightful as it is comical and redemptive and makes for the perfect cozy winter read.‘That’s what winter is: an exercise in remembering how to still yourself then how to come pliantly back to life again.’While this is the second of a four-set seasonal trilogy, Winter could still serve as a standalone. That said, there is a thematic unity with the previous book, Autumn, beyond capturing a literary expression of it’s titular season. Smith deftly knots past and present on both personal and political levels and garnishes the political landscapes in narratives of under-recognized women artists (the inclusion of Barbara Hepworth here isn’t as pronounced as that of Pauline Boty in Autumn yet her artistic story is still deeply integral to the themes) and fraught family dynamics. The fallout of the Brexit vote is less a backdrop and more the landscape upon which the narrative plays out, and Smith manages to position the reader in almost real-time of the events taking place. The story is set Christmas 2016 though by the end we have references to the Grenfell Tower fire and Donald Trump telling a crowd he will make retail employees say “merry christmas” at an October 2017 event with Winter being published just a month later in November.   [image]Barbara HepworthThis is particularly impressive as this event leads to a perfect closing statement in the novel, one that is a play on the final lines of Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol to mirror the playful opening reference. I had read Smith’s God is dead, to begin with as a great punchy opening only to watch later that day, Christmas Eve no less, a favorite Muppets adaption of the book and when the banter over the line ‘The Marleys were dead, to begin with’ came I had a eureka moment. I enjoyed how this was in keeping with the opening line of Autumn being a play on the opening to A Tale of Two Cities. The novel works within the framework of Dickens’ holiday classic as the story slips seamlessly into hauntings of Christmas past and visions of the future—‘That's one of the things stories and books can do, they can make more than one time possible at once’—complete with a seasonal spectre of a floating child’s head. ‘Spring, summer, and fall fill us with hope; winter alone reminds us of the human condition.’- Mignon McLaughlinThe plot, as far as there is a “plot” in an Ali Smith, is a bit of a riff on a whole slew of familiar christmas narratives. Arthur, or Art—a name that’s usage in the book would seem heavy handed in lesser hands but the consistency of Smith’s witty and whimsical wordplay miraculously makes it work—hires Lux to be play the role of his recently ex-girlfriend, Charlotte, for a holiday trip to his mother’s in Cornwall. The Hallmark rom-com vibes are especially enhanced when Lux insists they phone mother Sophia’s estranged activist sister, Iris, to join them. And so the family drama and false personas all descend upon Cornwall (which was particularly charming to me because it nudges my absolute favorite rom-com film, About Time) and the family friction is bound to spark fire. ‘It isn’t a good enough answer, that one group of people can be in charge of the destinies of another group of people and choose whether to exclude them or include them. Human beings have to be more ingenious than this, and more generous. We’ve got to come up with a better answer.’But this is a Christmas story at heart, and Dickens and all his holiday hoopla is not the only classic work integral to the Winter. William Shakespeare’s Cymbeline becomes a redemptive touchstone as fake-Charlotte/Lux, a Croatian woman with an uncertain future in the mindfield of Brexit laws shows a greater love of English literature than those of birthright citizenship, elucidates the plot almost as a metaphor for present day politics.‘[Characters] living in the same world but separately from each other, like their worlds have somehow become disjointed or broken off each other's worlds. But if they could just step out of themselves, or just hear and see what’s happening right next to their ears and eyes, they’d see it’s the same play they’re all in, the same world, that they’re all part of the same story.’The telling of the story is an emotional turning point in the novel, especially juxtaposed with Sophia’s defense of her vote to leave the EU, with the reader clearly recognizing the importance of ‘a play about a kingdom subsumed in chaos, lies, powermongering, division and a great deal of poisoning and self-poisoning,’ but also Lux’s admission she came to the UK because of the way Shakespeare could take that and end it with balance and grace where ‘lies are revealed and all the losses are compensated.’ Smith ingeniously uses literary and art criticism as expressions of her own works, such as Sophia’s impressions of Hepworth’s sculptures:‘It makes you walk round it, it makes you look through it from different sides, see different things from different positions,. It’s also like seeing inside and outside something at once.’The way her structure weaves in and out of perspectives, memories, visions, etc. lets us move about the story from a variety of vantage points. It isn’t just a family narrative, or a Brexit narrative, but a narrative of individual struggles, of political activism of the now and Iris’ history protesting nuclear stockpiling, of single-motherhood after giving up the love of one’s life for ones own life (view spoiler)[and having a child with who is plausibly Daniel Gluck from the novel Autumn, though he is only referenced briefly as Danny here (hide spoiler)], and of all the hopes, dreams, fears, flaws, and possible futures a human life can have.I just need to interrupt the flow of this  because I need to scream that this book is just so unbelievably good. Honestly, thinking about it makes me want to weep it’s just so good. There’s so much I can’t fit into this  but like, the way a remembered story is an amalgamation of two different storytellers and the implications in that, of the history of the anti-nuclear protests, or the ways Smith puts you in the minds of the two characters who are indifferent to the Brexit vote so a lot of the story is tongue-in-cheek but in a way that really slaps…this book is miraculously good. Okay I just needed to say that because this book is just intensely beautiful in a way that makes all the shit that life can be seem worthwhile to know a human can make something like this. ‘We all mine and undermine and landmine ourselves, in our own ways, in our own time.’Truth, lie and beauty are central to the story. People living as characters of themselves are rampant in the novel and Smith nudges the way internet culture and personalities are more marketing than authentic selves. We see how truth has fallen second fiddle (Charlotte is a violin virtuoso, supposedly) to stories that satisfy, how we trade facts for useful details, and posturing for clicks replaces authenticity. ‘It is the dregs, really, to be living in a time when even your dreams have to be post-postmodern consciouser-than-thou.’‘There was furious inteolderace at work in the world no matter when or where in history’And so we asked ‘into who’s myth do we choose to buy?’ There is a literal sense, such as buying Sophia’s products that are new but made to look vintage, or the duality of present day Boris Johnson versus Samuel Johnson’s fight for reality, ‘A man interested in the meaning of words, not one whose interests leave words meaningless.’ Sophia calls Iris a “mythologizer,” though under Smith this seems more a compliment than anything else, Smith who is in turn mythologizing the Brexit era. Do we believe the government, or do we believe Iris and her friends trying to expose political and corporate corruption and pollution harming people. And this is why we have art. ‘I said, Art is seeing things. And your aunt said, that’s a great description of what art is,’ Smith playfully writes about Art’s hallucination, though it also hits home the idea that art mythologizes reality in order to see, process, and understand it better. And such is the purpose of Winter. And why artists are valued over politicians, because artists represent the human at the cost of power.‘He thinks about how, whatever being alive is, with all its pasts and presents and futures, it is most itself in the moments when you surface from a depth of numbness or forgetfulness that you didn't even know you were at, and break the surface.’The French writer and philosopher Albert Camus once wrote ‘in the depth of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer.’ Such is the lesson here, that in this season of cold, of withdrawing, or introspection, we can choose to release ourselves from the shackles of the characters we choose to present ourselves as and find the beautiful summer of truth and hope within us. This is a gorgeous novel, one that moves slowly yet surely through both the heart and mind and balances both the personal and political in a way that transcends them both. Winter, like Autumn before it, is an impressive expression of its season and a story that warmed my heart like a yule log during the holidays. I only hope winter passes quickly so I can read the next seasonal installment.4.5/5‘Mind and matter are mysterious and, when they come together, bounteous.’...more",Notes are private!,46,235,1,"Dec 31, 2023",Jan 2024,"Dec 31, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34516974-winter

Truthfully, I’ve never been a big non-fiction reader unless it’s in service of an essay so when I landed on non-fiction for my book club choice (we made a giant wheel of categories to spice things up) I wasn’t sure what to pick. But I’ve long been fascinated by the IRA without much working knowledge and I’d been impressed by Patrick Radden Keefe for basically telling the Sackler family to eat shit and then writing a massive book, Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty, showing us all why we should also tell them to eat shit, so I figured this would be interesting. Reader, I loved it.Say Nothing by Patrick Radden Keefe is an in-depth and infectiously written account of The Troubles that threads the story of a specific murder through a long history of the Irish Republican Army. Political violence claimed the lives of 4000 people from the late 1960s to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, though 17 others were “disappeared” during this time. One such disappearance was Jean McConville in Belfast, and Say Nothing uses the investigation of her murder as the focal point to branch into key figures such as Dolours Price and her sister Marian,Gerry Adams, Bobby Sands, and others as well as the key events of The Troubles to craft a very dynamic look at the uneasy history. Through an impressive breadth of research that took four years and effective journalist skills to get the stories out of people who lived their lives around the principal of keeping silent, Say Nothing is a wealth of fascinating stories and such a well-structured and well told book that is impossible to set down.  [image]Now-famous photo of a woman volunteer of the IRA with a rifleOh, you should probably read this  with some accompaniment of IRA folk songsPatrick Radden Keefe had previously written about McConville’s murder in an article for The New Yorker and was briefly granted access to to the Belfast Project records—a secret oral history of The Troubles that were stored under seal at Boston College—when the tapes were subpoenaed by Northern Ireland for the McConville case. What Keefe found in them were personal narratives on the complex history of the IRA, stories of pride, of betrayal, of frustration with the Good Friday Agreement or Gerry Adams distancing himself from his IRA past, and conflicting accounts of events. Say Nothing manages to navigate the complexities (wall graffiti in Belfast reading ‘If you’re not confused you don’t know what’s going on’ is used as a good quip on how complicated the politics sometimes got) in a really accessible and organized way and becomes a rather chilling presentation on the ethics of political violence. It is a reminder how nationalism or even well-founded frustrations can be steered towards violence, and how when the dust settles many people are left feeling that the extreme measures they took—be it violence or having spent a large portion of their lives in prison for a cause—feels like a wasted effort.   [image]President of Sinn Féin, Gerry AdamsThis book is absolutely fascinating and I couldn’t put it down. The stories are wild. There is a great detective-style narrative that recurs through the book but honestly the best parts are the detours into IRA history and all the interesting people involved. Central to the book is Dolours Price who had joined the IRA with her sister and became part of “The Unknown”, an elite taskforce of the IRA. Price spent time in prison for carbombings in England, held a hunger strike, and admitted to many acts of violence. But was she behind the killing of Jean McConville? Readers will have to find out!  [image]Dolours and Marian PriceThe sections on Price’s activism are quite intense and engaging. The British police come across like the Keystone Cops here, and it is rather amusing to see, for instance, Price getting cops to look the other way by showing her leg so they don’t notice the car full of explosives behind her. Also this covers one of my other favorite things: art heists! There are some great stories of art heists being used to draw attention to the cause or ransom the paintings for the release of Dolours Price. I was also fascinated to learn she was married to Stephen Rea, who you may recognize from films such as The Crying Game, Michael Collins, or V for Vendetta. And I learned that there was a ban on the voices of Sinn Féin members on British television, which explains the joke in the show Derry Girls (if you have not watched Derry Girls drop all plans for your weekend to do so) where the grandfather claims Adams voice was dubbed on tv because the British thought it was too sexy and would seduce all their women.  [image]Dolours Price with husband Stephen ReaEven if you aren’t normally a non-fiction history reader like me, Say Nothing is sure to blow you away. I mean like as in impress you, not IRA explosives. It is a fascinating history and often a very tragic story. We experience McConville’s children, for instance, who recognized her captures and would see them around town for years after knowing the people likely killed their mother. We experience all the anger, frustrations and feelings of resentment, and we experience a rather well-told and dynamic history of The Troubles. Plus everyone in my book club loved it, so that was nice.

To read Alix E. Harrow’s The Six Death‘I would rather love a coward than mourn a legend.’This is pure perfection in a tiny package of pristine prose. To read Alix E. Harrow’s The Six Deaths of the Saint is like being hunted by wolves—you think you see the kill coming as you are locked in it’s eyes but then, suddenly, you are struck again and again and again from all sides. Harrow delivers so many surprises in this short tale, each as an eloquent emotional blow that by the end you’ll feel as battered and bruised as the narrator, wanting to scream your own battle cry in the climactic crescendo of swords spilling blood as destinies and empires are on the verge of being reduced to forgotten rubble. Even the subtle shift from second to first person perspective has a shocking implication enfolded inside in this story of a child who repays her debt of life by becoming a legendary warrior in service to a prince, aided by recurring visits from the Saint of War who guides her through danger and towards violent victory. A fantasy, a fairy tale, a warning against violence in the service of power, and a story of doomed love that brought tears to my eyes, The Six Deaths of the Saint cuts like a blade and completely knocked me out.‘I have made my life a work of blood alchemy transforming a child into a devil into a saint, a kingdom into an empire, a prince into a god.’Alix E. Harrow has such a gift of prose that manages to be comforting and devastating all at once. The story relies on a lot of looping and retelling, though it continuously feels fresh while also feeling like a story that has been polished by the waves of centuries of retellings until it shines without a hint of impurities. I was gripped the entire way through, feeling the sorrow of the girl-become-warrior so ‘wanted so badly to be beloved’ that she would sacrifice all for a prince who’s desire for her as a weapon she mistakes for love. ‘your squire watched you carefully. his eyes landed on every pink scar, every old injury that still ached. “is this love?” he asked softly…’ It helped that this story made me recall a favorite novel, Jeanette Winterson’s The Passion which similarly explores the misguided service out of love for a political icon who can only love their own power (and also contains an additional narrative of doomed love). There is a shocking twist about halfway through, but the way the narrative then coils around itself and delivers a cavalcade of emotions blows after that makes the twist feel tame in comparison. It is a fantasy that feels like it could be right at home in a Doctor Who episode but ultimately it will make your heart a home.‘You saw yourself as an unholy triptych, three into one, one into three: she the girl, you the Devil, and I the Saint. And you understood, finally, that there had never truly been a she or a you but only a terrible, lonely I.’There is an element in this which, without spoiling the twist, made me think about how sometimes we realize we are the only one truly looking out for ourselves. It is bittersweet and lonely here, as it is in life, but I found something rather empowering in it as well. To imagine ones past self (or future) watching you in the present and wanting you to succeed, to want to make a choice of actions that wouldn’t let the tender 8 year old you once were disappointed in who they would become, thats something I think we would all benefit to keep in mind. This story goes some wild places and manages to do so in such a short space while still feeling earned and properly built-up. The subtle differences in each cycle of the story, particularly the development of the relationship between the girl and her squire, gave me chills and really drove this story home.‘You found you did not mind being a devil, so long as you were his.’A huge thank you to Liv for recommending this. It is a quick little story, one that took less than an hour to enjoy yet I’ve spent the entire day still consumed by it. A dark tale, but one that will keep the light on inside your heart.5/5‘When you die, little Devil, a kingdom will fall to its knees and crawl to your bier.

Okay, if that's not your thing, this is still worth the su‘Does this look like paradise or what?’If you love bodily fluids, do I have a book for you! Okay, if that's not your thing, this is still worth the surreal journey...I distinctly remember a moment as a kid when we took snow and put it under a microscope. Suddenly the snow, something often associated with blankness, purity, silence and prettiness, was revealed to be teeming with tiny, moving life. It was shocking, repulsive to some, and not just a reminder to not eat snow but that life is…well, pretty gross. The stickiness and secretions of existence froth upon the pages of Norwegian writer and musician Jenny Hval’s Paradise Rot, a sort of bleak bildungsroman where Djåoanna—or Jo as she comes to be called—has left Norway to study biology in England and finds her identity fermenting amidst the rot of her new life. The brief novel, brilliantly translated by Marjam Idriss, comes alive through blunt sensory descriptions, symbolism of damnation, a mycological lexicon and is awash in bodily fluids and the sludge of decay, creating a rather unsettlingly moist and grungy atmosphere. While not for the feint of heart, or to be read on a lunch break, Hval infuses her story with a sickly surrealism that makes Paradise Rot a rather unforgettable and enigmatic narrative of queer transformation.‘But my dreams are full of apples, and in the dark my body slowly transforms into fruit: tonsils shrinking to seeds and lungs to cores.’If you’ve heard of Paradise Rot, you’ve likely been warned of the amount of human piss that floods the pages. While there was less urine than I expected going into this, the book is practically dripping in decay and grime and full of unsentimental depictions of the human body at our most animalistic. It read similarly to Andrea Abreu López’s Dog’s Of Summer in that regard, though more of a linear narrative. Though once one is fully covered in the slime of story it is hard to deny the rather poetic sensibilities and narratorial strengths. Hval is also a notable Norwegian musician with songs that tend towards many of themes in Paradise Rot, such as her 2016 concept album Blood Bitch that is inspired by vampires, menstruation and 70s horror films. Her lyricism really sings here and functions on multiple layers simultaneous, and I was vaguely reminded of Julia Armfield’s prose, which I really enjoy as well.‘And that is how we are bound together…Carral and Jo together. A black, dead and rotten fruit.’This is a coming-of-age story where identity is less formed than it is fermented, and fermentation is a dominant theme through much of the text. We see Jo’s former self begin to break down almost immediately, dissolving in the wet English climate and language. ‘I suddenly knew nothing about myself, nothing seemed right in English, nothing was true,’ though she finds a foothold in this strange new world in Carral, a much more dominant personality who happens to have space to share in her apartment inside an old brewery. Through a lack of privacy, the two begin to become quite close to the point that their friendship often appears as a more intimate relationship to others. ‘It felt like the brewery had been transformed into a big wet tank that was waiting for Carral and I to decompose within it: a rotten, reeking Garden of Eden.’There is a sense of a convergence here. Jo is told by a classmate she has taken on many of Carral’s mannerisms, not limited to her speech patterns of taking tea the English way, and Carral tells Jo’s childhood stories as if they are her own. One might sense a sort of Fight Club-esque set of alter-egos—which is certainly there for the analysis—though I’d argue Hval engages more symbolically and surrealistically than the literalness of Palahniuk’s novel. Then again there is also the rumor of a girl who fell into a batch of beer and died, a fermented ghost haunting the old place and Carral does seem to bloat up like yeast rising when sick…We can also see Carral as a sort of catalyst for Jo’s dissolving boundaries, moving from separate individuals towards a closeness and complete lack of privacy in the brewery and, ultimately, a sexual unity like dissolving into each other entirely. Jo’s sexual awakenings through the book they both read, Moon Lips, comes from Carral, as is her being set up with their neighbor (who we are told looks like Julian McMahon as Carral continuously watches Charmed), and it is Carral who seems to dissolve the social barriers around queer desires. Though in the fermentation of the selves, we see the two women in a state of rot:‘Her skin was soft, softer than I remembered, as if she was rotten too, a fallen Eve. Under us I could hear the apples rumble. Not a real sound, but a sort of internal buzzing, like how you can imagine hearing nails and hair growing or buds opening.’Hot, right? Kidding. But actually that is something I really appreciated about this book is that it is so unabashed about how gross life is and shows human bodies in all our puss and piss and stench as something that is truly beautiful. Even if Jo looks at her own body as ‘a rotten apple core’ or the intimate embraces with Carral being together ‘Slumped…like gouged snakes digesting their prey.’ Jo’s studies of mushrooms and fungus start to overlay her understanding of interpersonal relationships and her little microcosm community starts to feel like a sort of mycelium with her and Carral feeding off each other. The blending is most complete in the rather surreal scenes around the neighbor’s rather unsettling short story about Jo, where the two women become one body in order to sexually please men, resulting in Carral writing her own ending: ‘The women feast on the poor man’s flesh, And chew each bone whilst it is fresh, So the two women can become one with a kiss.’Not only is it some awesome lesbian punk stuff, but it also shows Pym the neighbor as an impurity in the fermentation process, something that must be removed and destroyed. His lusts register as repulsive, such as his tongue in her mouth described as a slug, and he is more food the two women to share than someone to satisfy. Like I said, this book goes some wild places. And is, ultimately, a fairy tale of identity about damnation and rot but rising to something better from it all.‘I’ll finish your fairy tale. You forgot to mention the snake. In the story the apple poisons the snake, and Eve packs her books and moves out of paradise. The End.’For those who can handle it, Paradise Rot is quite the surreal descent into decay in order to think of the self at our basest and most unsightly elements. It is a story where you feel like each page must be sticky, that you must be drenched in grime, that your body is rotting and dripping off your bones right there in front of you, yet also one where that suddenly feels like a sort of freedom and opportunity for resurrection into a new and better self. ‘There are two versions of myself and only one managed to get out,’ Jo thinks, lets hope the version of ourselves that manages to survive this novel are better for it.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,45,209,1,not set,not set,"Dec 27, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/39216527-paradise-rot

A forced wedding between a vampire and werewolf (a big, beefy, beast of a man-beast) in order to uphold an uneasy truce kick off this story of paranormal politicking and high-energy action paired with a slow-burn romance of an enemies-to-lovers plot (okay it’s not really EtL, it’s more like vaguely-distrustful to lovers) that puts a new meaning to the term “heavy petting” (pawing?). I tend to prefer romance stories that have a larger plot to hold them up, which is what we have here, though admittedly the plot is a bit lackluster and kind of conflates complicating the reveal of the politics and mysteries with actual complexity. Still this is a pretty fun read that highlights a lot of what Hazelwood does best in a very different scenario for her while also making it feel like a natural next step for her stories and I think this is one that if decide to bite in for some fun, you’ll get just that.Oh, have I mentioned the werewolf is huge yet? Big shocker in a Hazelwood book, right? I mean, when I saw werewolf man we all knew this was coming (and so is he…) but guess what? Misery (oh yea, she named her Misery lol) is tall, so I’d like to applaud Hazelwood for some character growth. Oh, wait, sorry, Werewolf Lowe is actually so huge he can’t even fit in their single king-sized bed (if you are playing Romance Tropes drinking game, take a shot for single bed) so you be the judge if its still her big man little woman trope (if yes, take another shot). But it is sort of fun to see a lot of Hazelwood’s signature elements here and I suppose this is the paranormal offshoot of her STEM stories as Misery happens to be a computer genius and that comes in handy (paw-y?) here. There’s a lot going on here and without spoiling much, due to some long feud and a lot of weird truces that tend to involve hostages and interspecies erotica pairings, humans, werewolves and vampires are all poised and ready for bloodshed and this marriage is another stop-gap in that all. Misery now has to live amongst werewolves (they go by Weres which…okay I’ll get to the world building soon but its not the best) who definitely want to kill her but shes so used to ‘feeling alone among people who were never supposed to be my own’ after living with humans all life that she’s gonna give it the old college try! Good for her even if ‘the whole rival-species-bound-by-centuries-of-hostility-until-the-bloody-demise-of-the-weakest-will-put-an-end-to-the-senseless-suffering thing might seem discouraging.’ Theres a slow moving romance as they move from utter distrust to relying on each other and Lowe being pretty damn into her while refusing to admit it and Misery refusing to notice that he’s pretty damn obvious because we need to stretch this already thin plot out with some romantic tension (drink). This is actually fairly light on the romance and the spicier stuff comes later and while this book does lean towards some omegaverse vibes it feels more a nod to all that than actually embracing it. Except knotting (take a shot). Hazelwood fans will enjoy this and they should, though I’m curious if those who might come to this from a deep love or paranormal romance might find it to read like a pop song cover of a deep-cut song they enjoy.This felt fairly undercooked though to me. In part because the world building is mostly done through conversation between Misery and Lowe, which is something I love in theory and found books like The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet to brilliantly execute world building through picking up context in casual conversations between characters, but here the two are distrustful and all coy about revealing things. Its like pulling teeth because thats basically what they are doing to get answers out of each other and I found myself shaking the book screaming just fucking tell me already (take another shot, not for tropes but in solidarity). Actually, Lowe is kind of annoying at times to be honest, even with his whole “tough alpha” schtick masking that he’s really a sweet sensitive boy packing a donkey sized dick (drink), and his whole “want better than me” thing was eye rolling. But anyways, the bigger catch is…none of the elements feel particularly fresh? And nobody wants a stale body if you are going to suck it’s blood, am i right vampires? A lot of it felt rather cut-and-paste or “spot what this is inspired by” which sometimes made me realize I liked the techniques better in the other books. Theres definitely a BIG Underworld film vibe here, and the whole sucking blood being orgasmic has been done before. I didn’t dislike this book but it made me actually realize I might like Butler’s Fledgling more than I did before. It all works though, I just don’t think fantasy world building is Hazelwood’s greatest strength and a lot of the ambiguities work to ignore that a lot of it feels fairly flimsy.So will these two ‘live bitingly ever after’ or will the politics of their world crush them? It’s worth a read, and I did like the characters quite a bit. I do like Misery asserting herself against and “alpha” and him recognizing her as a strong woman with agency. The plot is pretty fun too with some good twists, and really I have nothing to complain about other than it just didn’t land as well for me as her YA book. It does seem to be both chasing a romantasy trend while also broadening and popularizing it so its sort of a publishing slam dunk and I think a lot of people will rightfully enjoy it. It’s left pretty open for a sequel, I’ll look forward to finding out from your s because I think one was more than enough for me.2.5/5...more",Notes are private!,68,380,1,"Feb 07, 2024","Feb 09, 2024","Dec 26, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/181350327-bride

It was the year I finally learned to read book series, the year I discovered audiobooks and my dogs were thrilled our nightly walks grew much longer, and the year I finally read a lot of books I’d set aside for a certain time of year and then never got to. It was also a year I was interviewed twice about being on goodreads, one for a really lovely profile about myself you can READ HERE and then another that turned out to be a pretty negative take on goodreads but spelled my name incorrectly anyways (which you can read HERE) . Can’t win them all and personally I don't find goodreads to be stressful or negative but actually a really positive place I look forward to checking (when asked if I thought goodreads was stressful I said ""no...why?"" and was genuinely confused that would be a take on goodreads). I think this place is so full of creative people and I always love to see the ways people find to engage with and share their love of reading. If you've known me on here you can probably tell I'm here way too much. But all in all, a lovely year and I really appreciate all my friends here, long term and new, and the chats we have had. Seems hard to believe I’ve been doing this for over a decade now, but I always look forward to chatting with you all and seeing your s. Thanks for putting up with me.SeriesOkay fine, you are all correct, book series are cool. I used to avoid them like the plague (a novel I finally actually read this year too) and would say “oh I simply cannot start another until I finish all of Proust” because A. I’m a dick and B. I’m never finishing Proust lets face it. And I even like Proust. BUT, I cracked and now I’m obsessed with both Murderbot (I’m wearing a Rise and Fall of Sanctuary Moon tshirt right now, nerd alert) and the Wayfarers series and I’ve also begun Ferrante’s Neapolitan Quartet and Ali Smith’s Seasons Quartet and loving them both.Favorites So in 2023 I read 162 books. I think that’s the most I’ve ever done? I’ve never kept track before, I’m actually a terrible goodreads user. Anyways here are some favs:It is a toss-up between Yellowface by R.F. Kuang and The Last Tale of the Flower Bride by Roshani Chokshi for favorite novels published in 2023.However, my favorites I read in 2023 wereMy Brilliant Friend by Elena FerranteThe Plague by Albert CamusLittle Women by L.M. AlcottGiovanni’s Room by James BaldwinMost of these were books I’ve long put off reading and am so glad I finally got to. Thanks to people like Adira’s  of Little Women to finally convince me. Reading Watership Down was another big event for me, I’m still talking about it at all times (sorry everyone who knows me).Also, I finally read The Only Good Indians by Stephen Graham Jones which I’ve said I’d read for Halloween for years now. It ruled. And I remembered to start Autumn by Ali Smith in the proper season and am currently reading the next. Completing goals is fun, turns out! Oh and I’m a big graphic novel fan so my favorite of 2023 is definitely The Princess in the Grilled Cheese SandwichNew ThingsThis year I really tried to branch out and read things I hadn’t before. I found I really enjoyed that and love taking recommendations. I tried an Emily Henry, a Colleen Hoover and an Ali Hazelwood because that seems to be the trifecta of romance writers (gotta say, Emily Henry wins for me). I also finally read The Summer I Turned Pretty during summer but, alas, I did not turn pretty. But part of branching out was due to finally discovering audiobooks (shoutout to libraries for free audiobooks through Hoopla and Libby). Anything I really want to read especially on a sentence level I still prefer books, but I like to try stuff I normally wouldn’t have picked up by listening on audio. It’s been really lovely. I always enjoy when authors advise to read widely as the best way to learn how to write. Not that I’m planning on writing a book but I truly see the value, especially as I tend to enjoy books that can blend genres so effectively (fold in some noir and I am yours).Simone de BeauvoirI realized this year that I really just love Simone de Beauvoir. I did a really cool reading of Camus books with a friend of mine which then brought me into reading some Sartre, but I have to say Simone tops them all for me. For those looking to get a good intro to existentialism The Ethics of Ambiguity really rocked my world and I talk about it all the time. But also this year I just really realized I love literature from French women. I plan on reading more in 2024. So here’s to 2023, thanks for a great year, and I can’t wait to see what the future brings.

There are parties for In the song It’s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year, Andy Williams lists plenty of well-loved holiday feelings and activities. There are parties for hosting, mistletoe, caroling, and my personal favorite: scary ghost stories. Sure, the autumn season seems to get all the credit for spooky stories, but I’d love to see the tradition of ghost stories for Christmas make a strong return and Christmas and other Horrors edited by Ellen Datlow is a perfect way to join in. Ghosts and other menacing spirits have long been part of yuletide folklore—one of the best known being celebrations of Krampus going all the way back to the 6th or 7th century and one of my favorites being Jólakötturinn the Yule Cat of Iceland that would devour children if they didn’t wear their new holiday outfits—and they come alive in this collection to lace some dread in with your cheer. These pages are haunted by sinister Santas, the Celtic Mari Lwyd, an absolutely terrifying story of the Schnabelperchten, the Lord of Misrule, wood demons, witches, scary dog walks on the Solstice and more. So enter, if you dare, because this is a great (if a bit hit or miss at times) collection of Holiday cheer if by cheer you mean screaming in terror.I love all the old holiday lore and the eerie stories that go with them. Pre-Christian traditions around the world had many beliefs of spirits emerging during the winter solstice and these tales were passed down for centuries. Stories like Ukrainian author Nikolai Gogol’s The Night Before Christmas blended pagan and Christian traditions, becoming a popular tale that is reread in the region every year. ‘But the ghost story as a phenomenon is a 19th century phenomenon,’ Jeanette Winterson writes in her introduction to Christmas Days: 12 Stories and 12 Feasts for 12 Days, a book filled with holiday stories ranging from cute and cheery to full-on hauntings. Ghost stories from Christmas, she explains, hit peak popularity during the Victorian Era. While one theory of this rise in popularity is attributed to the printing press and the transfer from oral tradition to printed stories in every home. Authors like Elizabeth Gaskell and Arthur Conan Doyle were quick to move the supernatural stories from small towns and villages into printed works to be read in cities, and in 1819, Washington Irving published one of the first Christmas ghost stories. Winterson explains that another theory ‘is that the spectres and apparitions claimed in so many sightings were a result of low-level carbon-monoxide poisoning from gas lamps (it does cause fuzzy, drowsy hallucinations). Add in the thick fogs and plenty of gin, and it starts to make sense.’ And what goes better with some Christmas cheer than some holiday chills?‘But there’s a psychological side to this too,’ Winterson explains, ‘the 19th century was haunted by itself,’ and the gothic tradition began to blend with the new struggles around industrialization. This is most notable in one of the best-loved Christmas ghost stories, Charles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol, where three ghosts visit a cantankerous old man on Christmas Eve to instill in him a feeling of charity and goodwill and showing the tragic outcomes that would befall himself and his workers if he continues to be ruled by greed. But while this story has persisted and even been adapted by the Muppets, the Christmas ghost story never quite caught on across the ocean in the United States. In a follow-up to her christmas tales, Winterson addresses this in Night Side of the River and how in the United States, the gothic shifted from the European style such as how Nathaniel Hawthorne ‘built into his sgtories the psychic fractures and guilty disturbances peculiar to the pioneering spirit,’ or, namely, atoning for the sins of ‘bloodstained colonization,’ or the mass executions of witch hunts.So let’s bring back holiday horror reading. I couldn’t resist this collection in order to read new stories from Stephen Graham Jones and Cassandra Khaw, but there are many, many other great authors here such as Tananarive Due, Richard Kadrey, Benjamin Percy, Jeffrey Ford, Alma Katsu, Josh Malerman and more. Each author provides a small blurb about the inspiration, which makes for a really lovely holiday treat and I am always wanting to hear authors talk about their stories or what frightens and fascinates them.So why stop with spooky season when Halloween is over,keep on shivering your way through the holidays with me and read some ghost stories by the fire.⅘...more",Notes are private!,16,125,1,not set,not set,"Dec 24, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/93481619-christmas-and-other-horrors

The colors are gorgeous and the art reminds me a lot of Cartoon Saloon’s beautiful style. The hunter in particular looks as if he could be from Song of the Sea and all of the designs in this whole book are so intricate and jaw-droppingly lovely.  [image]I particularly enjoyed how the art style shifts to match the narration, such as a more basic style when a story within the story is being told:  [image]If I haven’t gotten it across yet let me reiterate: THE ART IS SO GOOD.

While you may already have been scarred for lifes seeing the animated adaptation too young as a kid, this classic tale has once again been given a new visual life in an incredible graphic novel format, adapted by James Strum and gorgeously illustrated by Joe Sutphin. So now you too can be haunted by this scene:  [image]The artwork here is simply divine and the adaptation successfully maintains the integrity of the original story without having to sacrifice much while also complimenting the uneasy vibes with its visual medium. I love the way the pastoral scenes and rather breezy landscapes and scenery contrasts with the moments of violence and trauma and the pacing of the frames and excellent balancing of dialog makes this completely impossible to put down. You feel all the dread building and the sudden moments of violence strike so well. This truly is a marvelous adaptation.

After having set myself up for disappointment reading a graphic adaptation of a book I super loved earlier this month, I was going to wait to read this so as not to nitpick every difference but then noticed that one of my favorite graphic novelists, Tillie Walden, said this sets a new bar for graphic adaptations. Okay FINE, I will trust Walden and was right too do so because this really does hold up. Of course I’d encourage anyone to read the actual novel and this will make a great companion piece, but this would also read just as well for those experiencing the story for the first time. Of course there are things cut out or condensed but for the most part you won’t feel lacking. A lot of the lore had to be cut but the key tales are retained during storyteller scenes—especially the Black Rabbit going and committing some mass murder after being impressed by how hardcore El-ahrairah was trying to spread pestilence with nary an ear or tail left on him—and the cool rabbit language, Lapine, is still there with a glossary of key terms.  [image]The Black Rabbit of Inle is as scary as you assumed he would beThis is great from start to finish and I was so impressed by the art. It manages to get a lot across emotionally despite a very limited expression range on the rabbits due to trying to maintain a more realistic style. Eyes wide in fear work quite well hear and Cowlip looks as outright creepy as that little shit should be:  [image]So whether you be a fan, familiar with the story, or a complete newcomer, this graphic adaptation is a great choice. Great art, great adaptation, and just a great story all around. Instead of noticing all the differences with this from the novel, I just kept realizing I loved this story even more than I thought I had. Tillie Walden was correct, this does set a high standard for adaptations.

It’s a temporary death⁠—an end to the limits of the self⁠—and an emergence from it in the form of rebirth, a waking up.’The winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, the symbolic death and rebirth of the sun that has inspired festivals around the world all throughout history. I’ve often said that I appreciate winter because it is a reminder that nature wants me dead, and as much as I dislike being cold and the steady decline of daylight into darkness can dredge up the doldrums I also appreciate how winter is a good time to make friends with yourself spending cozy evenings indoors. This collection of brief essays, Winter Solstice, makes for a perfect read on just such a night and certainly instilled a much brighter and hopeful feeling about the winter. Which I definitely needed because winter here in Holland, Michigan is pretty brutal with a lot of lake effect snowfall and near totality of gray overcast skies all winter long. In each essay, Nina MacLaughlin’s gorgeous prose illuminates the seasonal celebration like the fires of a yule log, contrasting the darkness of winter with the warmth and drive to survive that we keep smoldering in our hearts. ‘Winter invites a turning in, a quieting, an upped interiority,’ she writes and follows suite through essays that probe the depths of ourselves as much as winter itself. ‘It's dark in there. How deep in the well will you go?’ Succinct and smart, Winter Solstice is a gorgeous meditation on the melancholy of winter and a poetic celebration of the solstice that makes for a perfect December treat.‘What’s death in a world of stories?’Something I truly appreciated about this collection about when ‘dark makes its annual inhale of light,’ was the incredible and intimate amount of storytelling that went into each examination, approaching insights in ways that resonated deeply with personal experiences that opened them up to a feeling of universality. It made the winter feel less bleak when presented as a shared narrative, especially as winter is symbolic of death and in winter we are much more fragile, the world more harsh, the stakes higher, yet we must press on. ‘In a world of stories, maybe a door exists that opens to the possibility that the ending’s not always the same. In a world of stories, maybe death is all potential, another means of moving on. And on we go, absorbed into the wet warm belly of eternity, or the roaring big black void, back here as a robin or a wren, in dusted orbit around another planet’s moon, riding on the light.’The importance of the solstice to various cultures is touched upon briefly, reminding us that it is a shared experience as well, and one of the most fascinating to me was the prehistoric Newgrange tomb in Ireland, which is aligned on the winter solstice sunrise and opens up a great discussion on winter being like entering down into the depths of an idea ‘The boundaries begin to dissolve,’ she tells us in these moments of going under, ‘and yet: Here you are. Here you are, the winter tells us. An offer and a fact.'  [image]NewgrangeMacLaughlin also brings in a lot of voices to weigh in as well, gathering quotes from familiar names such as Han Kang, Cicero, Herman Melville, poets such as Basho (‘Fireplace / On the wall / A shadow of the guest’) and Kobayashi Issa (‘Here, / I’m here– / the snow falling.’), and more. A favorite moment in the essays was when she positions Mary Ruefle’s poem Snow (read it HERE) and it’s lovely line ‘when it snows like this I feel the whole world has joined me in isolation and silence,’ in conversation with the song Then the Letting Go from Bonnie “Prince” Billy and Dawn McCarthy (I’ve long loved some Bonnie “Prince” Billy). All these different vantage points help widen the perspective and insights.‘In his fevered novel Malicroix, Henri Bosco describes this almost-winter moment of the year, “when the world was poised on a pure ridge,” balanced between two seasons, casting “a glance back at the aging autumn, still misty with its wild moods, to contemplate deadly winter from afar.” The misty mood is behind us. We’re looking now at something dark and wilder.’ I love this passage on the misty autumn plunging into the dark depths of wild winter. MacLaughlin reminds us how in winter we return to the darkness but also our more inner, animalistic states. ‘It is the animal in us that knows the dark,’ she writes, drawing all of humanity out of our skins and into a more ancient, mythical experience of self ‘this season stirs that animal in us, and stirs the memories, ones that live in all of us, submerged so deep, of the ancient dark, of a time before gods, before form and words and light. Memories of helplessness. Somewhere, deep in, we remember. The animal in us remembers.’ Memories come up often here, and I quite enjoyed the discussion on how summer memories are filled with a feeling of expansive time whereas winter memories are a reminder of our mortal and finite existence. ‘We’re pulled back to childhood and, with the dark and cold, we experience our distance from it, and with that comes the knowing, too, that time is running out. Time gone and time left—winter delivers us this knowledge and with it comes the ache. The knowing rises from these shadows, from the layers of memory and understanding, from the tiny private fire out into the burning core of the stars. The memory of the ancient dark, the memory of your small self on a snow day, the lights in the neighborhood, the scent of pine needle or cinnamon, the wishes and disappointment,the loneliness of childhood. Winter holds it all in its cupped hands. And with it, the understanding, frank and cold, that you and the ones you love, all, at some point, end. The dark makes us see it.’There are some great moments in here, such as discussion on Krampus and other winter lore where putting a form on our fears helps us cope, as well as a look at different plant life associated with the season and the stories behind them.‘Winter reminds us: the dark was first.’So celebrate the solstice with this lovely little collection. Curl up by the fire, face the fear of darkness and death and the hostilities of winter and keep a light always in your heart. The solstice is a time of rebirth and soon the world will awaken once again, she reminds us. A lovely little read and a perfect seasonal treat.4.5/5‘Winter tells the secrets of the longer, longest, endless dark and cold that was, and the longer, longest, endless dark to come.

Alcott’s classic Little Women and much of their lasting legacy is due to how relatable the characters are even centuries removed from their setting. Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy takes the familiar characters and reimagines them in the 2010s in this modern adaptation from Rey Terciero and adorably illustrated by Bre Indigo. For the most part this is quite a success, feeling both fresh and familiar, finally leaning into the long-held fan theory that Jo is indeed queer, casting the March family as a multiracial family. Aimed for older middle-grade or the younger end of the YA spectrum, this is a fun story that doesn’t quite carry the same depth of character, complexities of plot or emotion but does hit the key notes and has some emotional exploration unique to itself and was quite an enjoyable read.  [image]Meet the March sistersThis was quite fun and the modern setting allows for a lot of creativity to play with familiar elements (Beth is an acoustic guitarist instead of a pianist, for example). I liked having a diverse cast of characters, though with the way the entire story seems simplified down to focus on Jo and her being the only white character did feel a bit like presenting the entire story from a white gaze. That said, I really enjoyed the character dynamics and while its more a caricature of their personalities and stories from the original, it really works in this format. It’s all just pretty lovely and I enjoyed how it touched on a lot of modern social issues (the sister’s are at the Womens March for instance) in keeping with the way the March family was very social justice oriented. Having the father be fighting in the Middle East instead of the Civil War makes sense for a time period transfer though doesn’t really work to transfer the context of the father from the original. Though, as with adaptations, you can always nitpick it to death and ruin the fun, or just embrace it and there is a lot to enjoy here.  [image]What I really did love about this, however, was the aspect of Jo’s coming out working quite well with the story and feeling like a natural update to the original. I also quite liked the big reveal of another character coming out, which worked as a discussion on the progress of queer visibility and inclusion while also looking at how having to suppress one’s identity is very harmful and tragic.Overall Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy was a lot of fun and a fun twist on a classic.

Luckily Alice Oseman’s Heartstopper universe is a perfect spark to light your heart and we can head into the holidays with her charming novella This Winter. It captures the Christmas season in all its messy glory: being tired and annoyed while family ‘seem determined to be friendly and fun all the time,’ spending quality time with loved ones, mental health struggles, and what holiday would be complete without one shouting match with a parent. Oseman excels at balancing the sad with the adorable and This Winter is a delightful treat that gives us the perspective of all three siblings, Tori, Charlie, and Oliver, to help make the season bright.   [image]This is an older little novella, originally marketed as a Solitaire novella but now repackaged with new art on the cover and in the pages. Taking place around the time of the 4th volume of Heartstopper following Charlie’s eating disorder, This Winter takes a look at mental health and the emotional road to recovery. This is extra hard during the holidays when emotions and excitements are high.‘When people know you're mentally ill, most people either wanna ignore it completely or they treat you like you're strange, scary, or fascinating. Very few people are actually good at the middle ground.’We see both Tori and Charlie trying to cope and I’m always reminded that Oseman does an excellent job at presenting mental health in productive ways and addressing the anxieties over self-doubt and being unsure how to act around others just as much as they are unsure how to act around you. As Nick puts it, the issue of being ‘so scared of being a burden that it makes you terrified to ask for help.’ I enjoyed the frustrations of the siblings with cousins that are a bit too nosey and bubbly, I enjoyed Nick being a stand-up boyfriend as always, but the loveliest part of all is we get a bit of Oliver’s perspective.‘Charlie and I have discussed at length how it's possible for Oliver to be related to us, since he's the literal embodiment of joy and we're both miserable fucks. We concluded that he must have got all the happy genes.’This is a perfect little seasonal read that will hit all the feels and keep you warm inside on a cold December day. A bit short and light compared to other works, but Oseman always knows how to make me happy and I hope this book can make you happy too.

Drawing ‘It’s only a story…’A howling darkness blows through this sensual and sinister fairy tale of illicit affairs and beasts that stalk the night. Drawing from tales like Little Red Riding Hood and lit ablaze in an American Gothic agonizing over lust and sin, Silvia Moreno-Garcia’s brief tale, The Lover, is a delicious little snack. Her succinct prose works like sharpened teeth biting into the tale to feast on the visceral emotions of desire and shame that drip like blood from the wound, and each page portends dread in a claustrophobic atmosphere of wicked wilderness and mysterious strangers. While its embodiment of dark fairy tales and doomed, forbidden love follows a rather predictable course of events, there is a certain dreary thrill in the familiarity of it all making us feel fated into the oncoming destruction and still makes for a chillingly fun read.‘I have no silks or gold, but I’d promise to eat your enemy’s heart and tear their lungs out with my claws in exchange for your kiss, dear Judith, which is more than a prince could say.’Shamefully, I’ve not read Silvia Moreno-Garcia before despite all the accolades and recommendations so I felt like The Lover would be an excellent entryway into her dark worlds that are always infused with folklore and other fantastical elements. Consider me impressed as I can’t wait to dive into one of her novels after this. Moreno-Garcia does an excellent job at gathering familiar elements from various literary traditions and making them feel both a loving homage and a story all of her own. Here we have Judith, the younger sister of Alice who has been raised to see Judith as second class to herself, who finds herself despondent when the handsome hunter she thought fated to take her hand in marriage weds her sister instead. But after a book of ‘bawdy little volumes for men’ awakens a sexual appetite in both her and the hunter, the embers of passion begin to consume Judith while the anxieties of damnation throw her into a maelstrom of emotion.‘From the first moment he’d spoken to her, she’d loved him, then had to endure the agony of his loss. Now she knew a new agony, both the pleasure of his embrace and the weight of sin.’ Yet, who is the vagabond stranger who sold her the book for the price of the kiss, and what of the rumors of a giant wolf slinking towards the village at night? ‘Go, chase the moon, tell it your lies.’Moreno-Garcia imbues each turn of the page with dread as both sensual and sinister symbolism appear in Judith’s life (the stranger offering the red apple, a common trope of fairy tales and Biblical lore, for instance) as well as tales of monsters that seduce women to their destruction. But what is more menacing, to face the flames of damnation from her forbidden passions or a literal beast that would also tear her to pieces? Both ‘a curse of hunger, where one can never be satisfied.’ The imagery and overall vibes really carry this story and while it is rather predictable it almost feels more disquieting because we can see the dark path to doom but cannot help but head towards it anyways. The Lover is a quick but exciting dark story that had me under its spell from the very start. It isn’t anything particularly astonishing, but it is well constructed and hits all the right thrills and chills. I can’t wait to read more from her.3.5/5‘Heed the warning and let this song ward you away from evil and wrongdoing.’...more",Notes are private!,14,133,1,not set,not set,"Dec 16, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/181478167-the-lover

As always, Oseman does a great job at representing these issues in an age-authentic way and the character’s emotions practically jump right off the page. There’s some other interesting dynamics to this story too, from discussions on asexuality and also a peek into Charlie’s mom’s childhood. While some of the side characters are a bit more in the background, I’ve always found the series does a good job of making them all rather dynamic and interesting instead of all just extensions of the main characters.

Drawing off his own personal‘continue to make me a house for your gaze, use me to stay alive in memory.’Sometimes sorrow can shock us back into life. Drawing off his own personal experiences, Italian poet and writer Daniele Mencarelli’s debut novel The House of Gazes is an incredibly vulnerable portrait of a life slowly drowning itself out only to find a will to survive where he least expected: a janitorial job at a children’s hospital. Mencarelli’s gorgeous prose—translated here by Octavian MacEwan—does well in navigating an unsettling dive into alcoholism, depression and the heartbreak of working in a place where the death of children is a daily occurrence, keeping the reader pressing on and engaged despite how emotionally taxing of a read this can be. This emotional exhaustion, however, reveals itself to be thematic as Mencarelli shows the often overlooked everyday heroism of those who push on through sorrow and exhaustion, be it in grief or in order to fulfill a job that keeps society going. House of Gazes becomes a harrowing tribute to those who have passed far too soon as well as those who survive them through a tale of a volatile path towards recovery and rebirth that, ultimately, reminds us there is hope even when the world seems senseless and unbearably cruel.

If anything, it opens, unstitches, uncovers.’He captures not only the sadness within the hospital, but the actions of those who work around the clock to assuage the suffering and, as are the duties of his janitorial crew, keep the place livable. ‘You only have to observe carefully to be drawn into other people’s lives,’ he says, and through his observations we are not only brought into the lives of those in the hospital, but are instilled with their memory to carry them with us through a world they otherwise no longer exist in.‘Swallow the medicine that makes you forget, that kills fear. And I’ve tried every medicine, right down to this last one.’Daniele, however, is suffering himself. A lifetime of drug and alcohol abuse has stripped him of friendships and his frequent mishaps have driven his own parents to their limits. ‘I go out to drink, and I drink to go out,’ he tells us, and we are front seat to the daily debauchery he plunges himself into with no desire to continue living. A poetry friend’s connection gives him once last chance to keep afloat, a janitorial job, and the shock from what he witnesses within the hospital,’the full spectrum of the pain that takes root in children,’ and the loss of innocent life, makes him reconsider his own blithe attitude towards his own. It is a journey from a lifestyle hellbend on blacking out and forgetting, to one of lucid awareness and remembering. ‘I will remember,’ he says, if only to be a living tribute to those who are slipping away from memory. Though it is not an easy journey, and frequent relapses occur (especially when something tragic happens), which tests the patience of even those closest to him. It is difficult to witness, though he does seem to crash his car while drunk so often it begins to seem like a plot hole that no legal action is ever taken against him for his many drunken episodes.‘If it’s you, God, behind everything, what you’re doing here isn’t right. You—not us—should ask for forgiveness.’A major thematic quandary is the problem of suffering and how one could continue to believe in a loving God or even believe in any goodness in the world. He struggles with ‘understanding what design dictates the choice: one child in place of another; happy normality on the one hand, abnormal despair wrought by disease on the other,’ and the guilt of having lived so long without valuing his life while so many children lose theirs. It is telling that early on Daniele reflects on how ‘childhood is a land we can treasure in later years. It’s that little bit of joy we humans get to experience,’ only to be confronted with lives that will never have that luxury. It shakes his whole perspective on life.‘what loving design can this death possibly be attributed to? What lofty path, invisible to us humans, justifies this life taken from the world? There’s no possible reason for that innocent’s death,not one that I can comprehend.’Yet still he clings to a belief in a purpose, and wants to find a purpose of his own in the face of so much sorrow. And now only the suffering of children, but the parents who must leave their childless, and the workers who face dangerous situations on a daily basis yet are looked down on by the rest of society.‘Bambino Gesù has done nothing but confirm the insane futility of everything…In fact, the mere existence of that “Baby Jesus” hospital, of the little Christs who spend their lives in it, should be enough for the entire human race to scrupulously annihilate itself. A nice toast right in god’s face.’His time spent with the janitor team, and the friendships he forms and fumbles, also awakens his drive to live. Even if only to support those who support him at work. We do get a sense of trauma bonding occurring between the staff, but it makes them kind and understanding to one another. There is a rather unfortunate anti-union vibe to the novel, but we also see how these workers are pushed to exhaustion to keep the hospital functioning yet are still looked down upon by others. ‘In these months, I’ve learnt that there’s no role, birth, or affiliation that can represent a human being in their entirety,’ he begins to realize, ‘You only have to spend a day exploring it to witness the annihilation of the social classes.’ Death is the great equalizer and all the social hierarchies begin to seem not only meaningless but practically absurd in the face of death.An aspect I really appreciated was how Daniele’s suffering and his ability to write were never tied together in the way people will often romanticize mental health struggles of artists as some sort of creative doorway. Daniele resents the idea of being seen as “sensitive” instead of “suffering” and pushes back against the belief that depression or other mental health struggles are just something one can embrace for artistic purposes and get over.‘I’d ask for a total ban—from the year 2000 onwards—on the concept of “sensitivity,” at least when used to fantasize about the human spirit. A single concept for thousands upon thousands of inaccuracies, dangerous do-goodisms, and delayed or never completed realizations’I am reminded of a line from Jeanette Winterson in Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal?, ‘Creativity is on the side of health – it isn’t the thing that drives us mad; it is the capacity in us that tries to save us from madness.’ Daniele recognizes that his path back to art and poetry must also be a path back to health and self-care. His alcoholism doesn’t allow him to create better, it distracts from it. His suffering doesn’t inspire, but his desire to be better does.‘A blanket of unspeakable sorrows enclosed in a single sound. “Horror.”’As emotionally taxing and painful as House of Gazes can be, it is ultimately a rather redemptive and tragically beautiful story. A story of redemption, rebirth and of remembering. It is only when seeing the world around him that Daniele himself feels seen, being caught in the gaze of children that come to mean the world to them despite being on their way out of this world. Heartbreaking yet healing, House of Gazes really shook me up and shattered me but built me back better for it, a sorrowful journey you must take along with the narrator. And above all, we understand why we must remember those who have gone before us and how literature is a powerful way to bear witness.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,4,106,1,"Dec 14, 2023","Dec 14, 2023","Dec 14, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/123444069-the-house-of-gazes

Very episodic and bouncing back and forth along the coming-of-age timeline, the Eisner Award winning artist invites us along to experience the ups and downs of life, from first loves and losses, embarrassing experiences, hardships and successes, looking back to discover the tiny narrative arcs we can spot in our lives in hindsight. While this is a bit wandering it is also funny and often rather moving, and Bagieu shows stunning vulnerability and self-awareness here, making this an amusing reflection on the moments that amalgamate into the people we are as adults.Layers is a quick read that manages to hit a wide variety of emotions along the way. Composed of rather short, episodic narratives, Bagieu’s rather reflective narration arranges the events into a sort of learning lesson for herself, though often one she didn’t realize at the time and can only see now. I really enjoyed the story about learning to ski and how much the bear pin she was given upon completing the class gave her incredible confidence to want to tackle other skills and be the best. She would later learn that it was a consolation pin given to the worst student in the class (everyone else got snowflake pins) but by then it was already a great lesson about believing in yourself: ‘It gave me permission to dare to do stuff.’ A lot of these stories have a similar tone, making the best out of bad situations or realizing later how much something meant that, at the time, hardly seemed significant (such as bad boyfriends showing major red flags). Though not all the stories are funny, even the saddest of them are heartwarming. The story about the life of her first cat, which opens the book and is easily a highlight, for instance, or the death of her grandmother, are both handled in rather touching ways. On the flipside, some of the most uncomfortable ones like awkward relationships or going solo to a concert because she has a crush on the musician only to have to end up hanging out with his girlfriend, will have you laughing along. Bagieu can laugh at herself and it just makes you like her all the more, and this becomes a great little collection of stories on girlhood.While I was reading this, I was told a patron complained and asked us to move this to the Adult collection instead of the Teen collection (the intended audience of the book). Interestingly enough, the complaint about a scene with nudity (very not-detailed cartoon boobs appearing on a tv screen) appears in a fairly funny bit about hypocrisy: the grandfather find the Bagieu and her sister looking at tampon instructions to be inappropriate but then watches a topless woman dance on tv (to which it is noted this was just…a normal thing on the French National News in the 80s). So in a way, the patron complaint just felt like an extension of this scene and also reminds me that the US is still very uptight about bodies in ways that just seem laughable.Anyways, Layers is a rather delightful little graphic memoir. A quick read, with a loose art style that isn’t anything special but gets the story across quite efficiently, and one that I enjoyed quite a bit.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,4,63,1,not set,not set,"Dec 13, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/125768756-layers

The title, a CHamoru word that means “medicine” signals a sort of healing to be found within these poems that break convention and refuse to be conquered by traditional use of a blank page, a healing of memory, a healing from colonialism, a healing of history, narratives, people, land and ‘the intertexual / sacredness / of all things.’ Drawing from the history of the CHamoru people and the indigenous poet’s home of Guåhan (Guam), [åmot] is the fifth installment in his ‘from unincorporated territory’ series and is a stunning and rather visual collection of experimental poetry rejecting the ‘latitudes & longitudes / of empire’ and a sharp, intelligent voice calling out that ‘no one can take our stories away from us.’mapmakersnamedour part of the ocean “micronesia”because they viewedour islands & culturesas small & insignificantsmall enough to be colonized byspain britain germany japan australia new zealand & usasmall enough to becomeplantations church missions military basesnuclear testing grounds detention centers scientific laboratories& tourist destinationssmall enough to be extracted forsouls phosphate tuna sugar copra laborsoldiers lands & waterssmall enough to be invaded occupied diseasedterritorialized divided bombed annexed & militarizedsmall enoughto disappearunder risingseasThis is a really unique collection that seems almost like a poetic puzzle to decode as the poems subvert traditional form every chance they get . Its as much visual arts as it is a linguistic one, with lines appearing upside down or sideways amidst other lines, often feeling like multiple voices combining or colliding or, as in the opening poem, an example of a medicine healers chant with a sort of call and response.The text is occasionally printed in a very light font as if the words are vanishing, being erased, forgotten or covered up. Additionally, the collection is very playful with language—using brackets around words, writing in multiple languages and being filled with puns—so much so that readers may feel initially feel outside the text and looking for a way in. Though I find this is part of the desired effect of the work that it refuses to adapt to a colonial gaze and refuses to give up the language and words of his people and showing how these poems are for others like him who have ‘never seen / our culture / in a book before.’ The collection represents a healing from empires that divide up the world into maps and territories, centering the language of CHamoru in order for their stories to be told in their own language.‘remember we are all relatives’Central to this collection are ideas about maps and the formatting of the poems often scatters words around the page as representation of a topographical map or shattered glass upon the page. Pezer quotes Jacques Derrida ‘There is no world, there are only islands’ and through the collection shows how the colonized islands of the region all may individually be small—’small enough / to hide / the crimes / of empire’—their impact on the world is great. The word “maps” never appears, however, instead always being subverted and written backwards as “spam,” which leads to a lot of rather humorous wordplay, puns on meats and great lines like ‘Spam is the absence of striving for spam.’ Though it is not only the land that Perez focuses in on but the plants and animals there too, with poems addressing deforestation and climate change, or native animals like the kingfisher. ‘Tell our stories’Memory is a key theme in [åmot], and to heal the past is to ensure the stories are told into the future. [åmot] addresses family histories, tales of the people instead of the empires that colonized them. There are poems addressing what it is like ‘to feel foreign / in your own homeland,’ such as stories of school where US students were unaware Guam was a US territory:‘my classmates laugh & even though i descend fromoceanic navigators i feel so lostshipwrecked on the coastof a strange continent’Perez also covers the horrors of colonialism and the ways it reshaped the culture as well as the land. Colonialism ‘turn places of abundance / into bases for destruction’ he writes. ‘Give [us] back our boys / our silenced boys,’ he writes in a series of poems on the abuse from the church. It can be a harrowing collection at times, though always Perez returns to themes of family and healing, making this not an investigation into wrongdoings and harms but rather healing from them, into ideas of rewriting, returning, reuniting, refreshing and rejuvenating. It is a lovely collection, one that rewards spending a lot of time with it. I love how reading it is like reading a map itself, turning the page to read the lines moving sideways or upside down.

Since I wa‘Public libraries allow us to explore the self or the desired self in many forms.’There are few things I love more than the public library. Since I was a child libraries have always been special to me, instilling in me a love of reading but also shaping the course of my life. In middle school I took a class, “Librarian Aide” and spent my first hour of the day working in the school library. I loved it so much the librarian kept me on for a second semester but apparently one hour a day in the library was not enough for me because now, years later, I spend 40 hours a week in one. I’m here right now typing this between reference questions. Libraries are such an essential part of society, archiving knowledge and putting our efforts towards reducing barriers to information access for all (everyone should go fines-free, for the record), but there’s something else that is incredible about libraries that make it a nearly sacrosanct space. Libraries are a communal place you can be without having to spend money and are some of the only spaces where people from every social class all mix together. And these spaces are always evolving, finding new ways to provide for and serve their communities to help everyone learn and grow in ever expanding ways.‘Browse, borrow, request, renew–lovely words to me.A library card in your hand is your democracy.’Jackie Kay, from Dear LibraryLibraries are important to Ali Smith as well, and Public Library and Other Stories becomes a plea to pay attention to, appreciate, and fight for public libraries. The project came together in response to the UK slashing library budgets which saw around 1000 libraries disappearing from 2010-2015, and these book serves as an excellent reminder of the importance of libraries and the power books and learning have in our lives. Smith’s signature charm and wit comes through each of the twelve stories and while libraries are never mentioned or depicted in them, the love of words, learning and impact of communication and community flood every page. The connecting thread here, however, are the interludes between tales where Smith has gathered reflections from her friends on what libraries mean to them. It becomes a gorgeous and moving tribute to the essential institution with stirring passages from authors like Miriam Toews, Kamila Shamsie, or Helen Oyeyemi describing the interlibrary loan system as making libraries a ‘live and benevolent organism’ (I put three years of my life towards ILL services, so I was pleased to see it get a specific mention). We see the power of libraries, such as when Sophie Mayer notes that a library card was once used as a weapon against evil in an episide of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Libraries give us strength.‘Libraries save the world. A lot, but outside the narrative mode of heroism: through contemplative action, anonymously and collectively. For me, the public library is the ideal model of society, the best possible shared space, a community of consent—an anarcho-cyndicalist collective where each person is pursuing their own aim….through the best possible medium of the transmission of ideas, feelings and knowledge: the book.’Many speak of warm memories around books and how librarians touched their hearts, many speak of the ways libraries are democracy in action, such as Kate Atkinson who tells us libraries are ‘a free space, a democratic space,’ while Kate’s daughter, Helen remarks that public library means ‘communal.’ These short testimonies help demonstrate what translator Anton Hur meant when he was recently quoted as saying ‘libraries are not just archives of books and digital media, they are the archives of our very communities, of our civilization.’ This is important to bear in mind in times such as these where, especially in the United States, there is a small but dangerous push against the right to read showing up as book bannings and attacks on libraries and other public institutions (I wrote about it extensively HERE), and while Public Library is a few years old and UK focused, it is just as relevant to hear today.‘Words were stories in themselves.’Ali Smith is always quite the wordsmith and the language here is as playful as it is a theme unto itself amongst the stories. While the stories aren’t library focused, it feels like they form their own personal lending library of stories and recommendations with many writers being crucial to the narratives. The poems of Wilfred Owen become a talking point for a woman and her deceased father, reading Katherine Mansfield allows one character to better appreciate their spouse and the author herself, and D.H. Lawrence figures in multiple stories, one involving a potential switch-up of his ashes that gets sidelined by a story of credit card fraud (I love a good paperwork drama and what would a book on libraries be without discussion of identification). A key moment in the stories is when a narrator finds themselves in a park where Mary and Percy Shelley once stood and where the narrator once visited with a former love showing how ‘endless stories, all crossing across each other,’ come alive in the lives of readers. Though perhaps a favorite theme was all the references to, and frustrations with the faceless and joyless bureaucracy of AI or other computer-based services showing how the flesh-and-blood expertise of library staff can never be replaced by an algorithm.‘Fiction…is impossible but enables us to reach what is relatively truth.’A brief but lovely collection, Public Library and Other Stories is a moving and playful read to warm any book lovers heart. Smith mixes activism with whimsical narratives quite effectively in all her works and these brief tales and testimonies are a delight.4.5/5...more",Notes are private!,60,193,1,"Dec 09, 2023","Dec 10, 2023","Dec 09, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25902919-public-library-and-other-stories

H‘How much will they give us for a doll’s name?’Dolls and disappearances are a recurring theme throughout the works of Italian author Elena Ferrante. Her Neapolitan quartet opens with one of the central characters, Lila, having disappeared and then the narrator transports us back in time to an early memory playing dolls with Lila. Her novella, The Lost Daughter, centers around the disappearance of a doll, stolen by Leda who has spent her own life disappearing. In The Beach at Night, Ferrante crafts a brief fable of a doll accidentally left behind to face an ‘endless night on the beach’ surviving not only the natural elements like waves, storms and fire, but a dreadful beach attendant who steals the words from dolls and sells them for profit. Written as a children’s story this is easily just as enjoyable for adults, and the rather dark and surreal artwork by Mara Cerri is an excellent addition. This dark and gritty little tale is an abstract look at many of Ferrante’s key themes with a doll once again having a highly symbolic function around motherhood and the subjugation of women her characters are often attempting to escape.  [image]While the names don’t match, The Beach at Night and the harrowing evening of Celina, the doll, seems akin to the separation of child and doll in Ferrante’s The Lost Daughter. Celina views Mati, the child who owns her, as a mother and when the Mean Beach Attendant tries to steal all her words to sell at the doll market, we learn that ‘mamma’ is the most valuable of her words. In The Lost Daughter, Leda observes how the care Nina and her child, Elena, give her doll is ‘the shining testimony of perfect motherhood,’ and just as The Beach at Night uses the doll to examine motherhood, the family’s relations to the doll incites Leda to reflect on her own flaws as a mother.The extraction of her words is interesting, with the Beach Attendant asking ‘how many did your momma put inside you, eh?’ I was reminded of My Brilliant Friend where Lenu and Lila’s dolls act as a way for them to vocalize their inner fears and feelings by putting their own words in the “mouth” of their dolls, which is why dolls are often a way for children to practice social and emotional skills. However, by stealing the doll’s words, the Beach Attendant is essentially robbing not only the doll but Mati’s emotional outlet, by taking the doll’s name he is symbolically taking Mati’s identity. It is similar to the way Leda stealing Elena’s doll is her way of trying to symbolically steal Nina’s connection with her daughter that Leda lacks with her own. Though this idea of men trying to steal the life, creativity and livelihoods of women arcs through all her works.  [image]As a side note, Elena Ferrante is a pseudonym through which the author passes her words to the world—is “Elena Ferrante” perhaps, a sort of doll as well?The Beach at Night is a strange little book but hits some excellent themes that makes one think about Ferrante’s works as a whole.

Adapted by Chiara Lagani, using translations from Ann Goldstein, the story is brought to life in the rather gritty yet lovely artwork of Mara Cerri (who has previously worked with Ferrante for her picture book The Beach at Night). While it is rather gorgeous to look at, this graphic adaptation feels more like a companion piece to the novel than a work that can stand on its own. Though, through reading this and noticing what seems to be lacking, I found a deeper appreciation for the source material and a new perspective on why it works so well.  [image]When engaging with an adaptation, it tends to be the differences—especially the omissions—that we notice the most. I absolutely loved My Brilliant Friend (I have ed it here) and an aspect that endeared me to it was the sense of intimacy created around the characters. Not just Lenù and Lila but the characters around them as well, which makes you realize it is a story about an entire community and the ugliness of violence, patriarchy and poverty framed withing the examination of a complex friendship. This adaptation is rather short and while we see some of the side characters there is never much sense of familiarity with them, reducing the overall experience to a sort of spark-notes runthrough of Lila and Lenù’s journey from childhood to adolescence. I’m curious, too, if those who have not read the original novel would follow much of the latter half of this book, or if they would feel rather disconnected from it. There are still expressions on the major themes—we see the poverty, we are aware of the violence, but its all so fleeting.  [image]With such short space, it is interesting to see which details get emphasized and which, such as the killing of Don Achille, get completely cut out. While the childhood section is 1/3rd of the novel, it gets about 2/3rds of the space in this version, really diving into the childhood moments that connected the two girls to begin with. But so much of what makes the novel so good are scenes that can’t exactly translate into a graphic novel without really slowing the pace or being overly wordy for the medium I suppose, as it is Lenu’s emotional introspective insights that really brought the story to my heart. Still, I found the artwork was able to bring out a lot of great emotional insights that were enjoyable. ‘When the written words were broken down into faces, expressions and dialogue, the narrative revealed itself in a new light,’ artist Mara Cerri writes in a Washington Post article about her artistic choices:‘that’s simply because the language of comics, born from the collision and interplay of text and images, generates new emotional connections and insights for the reader.’There are a few panels that are incredibly gorgeous here, like the rather abstract moments that tie the fireworks scene with Lila’s feeling of “dissolving boundaries” and I found that the grittiness of the art style captures the overall feeling of the novel pretty well.  [image]A pretty book, but much more a companion piece for those who already enjoyed the novel, My Brilliant Friend: The Graphic Novel was worth checking out but overall rather lackluster. I wish this was like those big illustrated Harry Potter collectors editions where it was the full text of the novel with large artwork every few pages instead, now that would have been amazing. I do think it is cool that Europa released a graphic novel though, I'd love to see them do others.2.5/5  [image]...more",Notes are private!,14,75,1,not set,not set,"Dec 08, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/123444101-my-brilliant-friend

It is a brilliant novel, easily one of my favorites I read this year and one that consumed my thoughts and emotions in its epic of adolescence. Here we find life in a changing world as ‘a sticky, jumbled reality’ and watch the ways various ambitions play out to survive it. Across the pages of My Brilliant Friend, we experience a vastness of a community through a portrait of friendship, with Ferrante’s prose perfectly expressing naked honesty and heartfelt struggles to achieve in a violent, patriarchal community and comprehend oneself as an individual instead of merely in the context of a close companion.‘There was something unbearable in the things, in the people, in the buildings, in the streets that, only if you reinvented it all, as in a game, became acceptable. The essential, however, was to know how to play, and she and I, only she and I, knew how to do it.’Ferrante’s My Brilliant Friend moves at the slow yet steady pace of life through the days of childhood into adolescence. The pace and introspective narration—which sets Lenù’s sharp mind like a scalpel upon all she encounters—lulls the reader into an intimacy with the characters as if you, too, have grown up alongside them and each moment of anger or betrayal hits all the harder. While the novel contains multitudes in its thematic scope—community amidst violence and class disparity, the struggles of girlhood in an atmosphere of oppressive masculinity, education, language, and more—the heart beating boldly at the core of this impressive work is an exploration of friendship. A very complex friendship at that, so much so that Ferrante has admitted ‘ in its first rough draft, the story of Lila and Lenù fit very easily into a single, substantial volume,’ but upon writing realized how much nuance needed to be investigated until it became a four novel epic.‘I had grown up with those boys, I considered their behavoir normal, their violent language was mine.’Ferrante’s use of language is so direct, gritty and raw, often launching into a series of astute observations that leave you breathless. She has an unmistakable skill for crafting dynamic characters, their actions reading as so intimate and honest and the relationships so emotionally charged and complex. I enjoy how through the novel we see the side-characters also grow from children to young adults, not with a straight trajectory of unified personality but more a messy and amorphous growth that, in hindsight we can detect the a linearity but in the present can often be surprising much like how growing up with someone really is.The novel Little Women figures prominently into the story and multiple themes, and I felt there was an kinship of emotional resonance between Alcott’s work and Ferrante’s in the way we are privy to the complexities of interpersonal relationships as they navigate towards adulthood.‘I feel no nostalgia for our childhood: it was full of violence.’The story takes us into a neighborhood on the outskirts of Naples in the 1950s and into the violence of abuse, power and poverty. It is also the childhood home of the author, and while she doesn’t see the violence there as unique, it does register more strongly in contrast to the beauty of the region: Since it is a city by nature of astonishing beauty, the ugly — criminality, violence, corruption, connivance, the aggressive fear in which we live defenseless, the deterioration of democracy — stands out more clearly.’-Ferrante, in conversation with LA TimesWe witness violence as rather commonplace, even amongst the children (a key early bonding moment between Lila and Lenù involves throwing rocks at boys), and toxic masculinity runs rampant. Told through the perspective of a child, we see how all the ugliness feels a natural part of their world, inseparable from daily life. Though early on we see a key realization when Lenù is shocked to find that Don Achille, the ‘ogre of fables’ is actually ‘a little out of proportion, but ordinary.’ Violence is everywhere and commonplace reality is far more menacing than any mythical creature.‘I would have liked the nice manners that the teacher and the priest preached, but I felt that those ways were not suited to our neighborhood, even if you were a girl.’Class divide is also inextricably linked here. Frequently we see resentments over class, or feelings of inadequacy, manifest into anger and violence. Or how those in power protect themselves through violence and intimidation. There are also deep resentments over the past and several characters have an awakening of the former sins in their community wrapped up in national politics and abuse against their own neighbors. It is not far out from the downfall of Mussolini and the fascists, which still casts a dark shadow over everything.Though in hard times, one often finds a companion to bear the burden and what better companion for the perceptive Lenù than Lila, a girl seemingly misunderstood but in whom Lenù find ‘the characteristic of absolute determination.’ Their dynamic across the years is something that will forever shake inside me and I found it such a powerful expression of the ways we tend to perceive ourselves through the fragments reflected back by others. Their bond is both companionship and competition, at least how Lenù perceives it, and she spends her life in constant self-comparison to Lila. It is powerfully portrayed how she always feels second best to her friend, and while she also find strength through Lila she also seems to be creating a sense of identity that can only be understood in the context of Lila. In this way, she is fearful of anything that separates them, finding that if Lila has a life without her she will lose sight of her own self as well.‘ She stopped to wait for me, and when I reached her she gave me her hand. This gesture changed everything between us forever.’It is a novel teeming with comparisons and her entire coming-of-age is always measured against her friend. Lenù’s constant self-assesment of her body is contrasted to Lila—she develops earlier but feels slighted that Lila is uninterested in this only to later feel less attractive once Lila matures—as well as her academic success, feeling Lila’s studies of language despite not attending school surpass her own abilities and, essentially, Lenù’s sense of self-worth is that no matter how good she is, Lila is always better. I particularly enjoyed how language is so central to the book, but also an aspect that is both connection and competition. This is most notable when her pride in her own writing is shattered by a single letter from Lila she perceives as superior. It is suspected later that Lila reading Lenù’s article causes her to realize Lenù has indeed surpassed her, but we only understand Lila through Lenù’s gaze. Ferrante has said the original draft intended to give Lila a voice, but she realized it is more effective to be confined to Lenù’s impressions and anxieties so Lila remains as mysterious to us as she is to Lenù.‘She was struggling to find, from inside the cage in which she was enclosed, a way of being all her own, that was still obscure to her.’Returning to Little Women, I find it telling that it was this book that set them off on their goals to create—to write novels for both but later Lila changes towards wanting to create her own style of shoe—and how, like the sister’s in Alcott’s work, they take different paths to try and overcome a society that has little room for the ambitions of women. The theme of trying to break outside the socioeconomic or gender barriers seems metaphored in Lila's condition where she sees the world as 'dissolving barriers.' For Lenù it is a path of academics, pursuing and achieving far beyond the usual room given to girls. Yet, by the end, we see it has alienated her from the life of her neighborhood. Lila abandons school but chases a dream to create and rise out of poverty through marriage (also to escape a worse relationship). They both discover that they are judged for these paths and Lenù’s fear that she is never good enough suddenly opens into a different anxiety that she is too good for her own contemporaries that 'I had also been following daily a path that they were completely ignorant of,' and now 'I had to suppress myself.' Which is altogether a tragic thought as, now that she finally has something to be proud of as an achievement of her own not in the shadow of Lila, it is something beyond comprehension of her peers and makes her feel alienated. Her own teacher had long warned her away from Lila, seeing Lila as just another person who will be wasted in the whirlwind of poverty and violence that seems inescapable.‘At that moment I knew what the plebs were, much more clearly than when, years earlier, she had asked me. The plebs were us. The plebs were that fight for food and wine, that quarrel over who should be served first and better, that dirty floor on which the waiters clattered back and forth, those increasingly vulgar toasts. The plebs were my mother, who had drunk wine and now was leaning against my father’s shoulder, while he, serious, laughed, his mouth gaping, at the sexual allusions of the metal dealer. They were all laughing, even Lila, with the expression of one who has a role and will play it to the utmost.’The threat of violence and masculinity is constantly thwarting them. Lenu’s own struggles with her feelings for Nino are complicated by the sexual advances of his father, for instance. Lila is stuck in a bad situation because the wealthy and abusive Marcello holds his power over the fate of her family if she does not marry him. The shoes, which are a symbol of hope and ambition throughout the novel, are later transformed into a symbol of betrayal and a warning that all ambition and advancement is gatekept by men and at the mercy of larger powers of wealth.‘She gave off a glow that seemed a violent slap in the face of the poverty of the neighborhood.’I adored this novel. I've had quite the run of great books at the end of this year and this is another headed straight to my ""favorites"" list. It is gritty, it is shocking, it is emotionally introspective, it is a stunning look at a whole community and most strikingly, everything about it feels so true and honest and intimate. I felt for Lenu every step of the way, I felt her hopes and Lila’s frustrations as if they were my own Ferrante drew me in so deeply into her work. There are some absolutely breathtaking moments of writing here, the whole final sequence especially had me shivering in literary glee and tension, particularly the moment where we get an unexpected insight on the ‘brilliant friend’ of the title. For me, My Brilliant Friend was just that: brilliant. I’m already diving into the second volume and Lenu, Lila and the cast of character’s around Naples have completely stolen my heart.5/5‘We were little animals frightened of our own mediocrity.’...more",Notes are private!,79,346,1,"Dec 07, 2023","Dec 07, 2023","Dec 07, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35036409-my-brilliant-friend

This has become my recommendation for those looking for a first read at my jobs, though I would encourage any readers to continue to find additional sources. The overview is great and provides a lot of concise details that manages to still convey how very nuanced the situation is as well as examining how people are divided over the issues, though there is still a lot to be learned and Scott-Baumann does provide an extensive bibliography that can be a great resource for that. As for concerns of bias, I feel this does an excellent job at trying to simply present the historical context and provide a variety of personal testimonies but I also feel that, due to language being an imperfect and inherently biased medium, there can truly never be such a thing as unbiased or completely objective. It’s just human nature. That said, this is an insightful look at key events across the centuries to give an accessibly detailed overview of the early role of the British and the establishment of Israel in 1948, the Nakba, the Six-Days War, the PLO, Netenyahu, and more recent events like the Nation-State Law, Trump’s 2020 plan all the way to the present.I’ve previously read The Palestinian-Israeli Conflict: A Very Short Introduction a few years back and found this to be a bit more engaging to a general audience while also covering events of the recent decade (Bunton’s was published in 2013, this one, was 2021 and has been recently updated to bring us up to mid October 2023 where an estimated 2,600 have been murdered in Gaza and another million displaced). For that I’d say both can be a good resource, but for a general audience looking for an introductory work, I’d recommend this one.A lot of history is covered here, beginning in the 1800s with only a few slight references to life pre-Ottoman and such. It touches briefly on topics such as diverse peoples living side-by-side there throughout history and that the Biblical connections to a nation state are a very recent idea. It stays primarily focused on Israel, Gaza and the West Bank but does provide a bit of context on larger political issues in the Middle East and how that plays into the events here. It also dives into the role of the US in funding Israel and gives an overview of how much changed in just the last few years with influences of Trump as well as the Netanyahu being replaced by Naftali Bennett, then returning to power again in 2022 after the Israeli government collapsed after one year.

Little Women by L.Some books read like a lifelong friendship, each page a warm or comforting embrace as you laugh and weep along with the characters. Little Women by L.M. Alcott is an enduring and endearing classic that will nestle its way so deep into your heart that you’ll wonder if the sound of turning pages has become your new heartbeat in your chest. To read the novel is a magical experience, and we are all like Laurie peering in through the March’s window and relishing in the warmth within. I have long loved the film adaptations and make it a holiday tradition to ensure I at least watch it every December (it has Christmas in it, it counts), so it was fascinating to finally read the actual novel and return to character I feel I’ve always known yet still find it fresh and even more lovely than ever before. Semi-autobiographical, Alcott traces the lives of the four March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, and their struggles to make their own way in a society that offers little use for women beyond the household. An emotional epic and moving family saga full of strong characters, sharp criticisms on society and gender roles, and a beautiful plea to dispense with the worship of wealth and find true purpose and value in simplicity, nature and generosity.‘I've got the key to my castle in the air, but whether I can unlock the door remains to be seen.’Little Women will leave your heart full and your pen dry from underlining the seemingly endless lovely passages. I’d like to thank Adira and her wonderful  for convincing me to finally actually read this and not just watch the movie again (I did last night though, because who doesn’t want to relive the joy of yelling “Bob Odenkirk?!” in a theater and later sobbing) because, just when I thought I couldn’t love this story more, now I’m fully engulfed by it. Surely enough has been written about this book already, but i like to ramble about things I love so here’s a more I guess (I’ll try to keep it shorter than usual [having finished writing it now, I failed]). But how can you not be with such incredible characters? Jo is of course the favorite, but I think part of loving this book is wanting to be Jo and realizing you are Amy, but each character touches your heart in their own way. Mr. Laurence and Beth’s connection with the piano and lost daughters makes me teary just writing this. Alcott based the story on her real family and one can read a genuine love for the characters pouring from every page.‘Wealth is certainly a most desirable thing, but poverty has its sunny side, and one of the sweet uses of adversity is the genuine satisfaction which comes from hearty work of head or hand, and to the inspiration of necessity, we owe half the wise, beautiful, and useful blessings of the world.’Alcott was a transcendentalist and many of her beliefs shine through in the novel. Much of this came from her father and one will be pleased to learn that the real Mr. March—Amos Bronson Alcott—was as radical in his time as his fictional counterpart. An abolitionist who also advocated for women’s rights, Amos became a major transcendentalist figure along with his friend, Ralph Waldo Emerson. Alcott’s mother was equally radical for her time too, and many of their teachings arrive here through Mrs. March to her children. There is, of course, the belief in nature as the ideal, such as when the March girls, having little jewelry, adorn themselves in flowers instead. Even Laurie states ‘I don’t like fuss and feathers,’ another instance of a return to simplicity over flashy status symbols. There is also the belief in generosity, which is seen throughout with the March family always involved in helping others, and the belief that hard work is important, but not for profit reasons but because it leads to spiritual and emotional happiness and freedom.‘Then let me advise you to take up your little burdens again; for though they seem heavy sometimes, they are good for us, and lighten as we learn to carry them. Work is wholesome, and there is plenty for every one; it keeps us from ennui and mischief; is good for health and spirits, and gives us a sense of power and independence better than money or fashion.’Towards the start of the novel, the mother advises the children to be like Christian from John Bunyan’s allegorical novel The Pilgrim's Progress and we can see how Little Women follows a similar fashion of Pilgrim’s being knowledge gained through the travel of a life lived, and each daughter is shown to face certain trials and must learn to bear their burdens, like Jo’s anger, Amy’s desire to be liked, Meg’s desire for vanity, Beth’s passivity. But the largest burdens here are those of love and labor.‘Women, they have minds, and they have souls, as well as just hearts. And they’ve got ambition, and they’ve got talent, as well as just beauty. I’m so sick of people saying that love is all a woman is fit for.’The relationship to work is threaded through the entire novel. We have Jo and Amy who wish to be great and break from the traditional mold for women in society. Jo wants to be a writer, though she only publishes scandalous stories under a false name, and Amy desires to be a painter. And neither will settle for anything less than greatness ‘because talent isn't genius, Amy states, ‘and no amount of energy can make it so. I want to be great, or nothing.’ Meg and Beth, on the other hand, show different routes a woman can take. The novel questions if women can find happiness outside marriage and caring for a household, and these struggles bash against social expectations along the way.‘ I'll try and be what he loves to call me, 'a little woman,' and not be rough and wild; but do my duty here instead of wanting to be somewhere else.’‘ I can't get over my disappointment in not being a boy,’ Jo quips, and a major part of Little Women is a critique of gender roles and how they stifle people in society. Laurie is an excellent foil to Jo, in many ways, but is also a way that Alcott addresses and subverts gender expectations. Jo and Laurie both use shortened versions of their name that seem to cross gender expectations (even though Laurie didn’t like being called Dora) and in many ways Jo tends to represent more masculine behavior while Laurie often a more feminine role. While Meg dresses in finery and tries to fill the traditional role of a woman, Jo prefers to romp in nature in simple or dirty garments and behave, by her own admission, like a boy.Recently there has been a lot of discussion on the author’s gender and sexuality, with even the New York Times writing an opinion piece wondering if Alcott or Jo was a trans man. I know that frustrates some people but personally I find it interesting to think about, even if a bit anachronistic, but it seems to be a genuine question people investigate about authors who subvert gender expectations (think how often it was avoided to discuss Virginia Woolf’s sexuality in the past and now we have letters and look at scenes in Mrs Dalloway and think “oh yea, that makes total sense”). Honestly, I say Jo is whatever you want Jo to be. Trans, lesbian, ace, or just a girl pushing back on gender norms. I think the key detail is that Jo was breaking out of the mold, so let that empower you as you best see fit. Personally I thought the marriage to Friedrich felt tacked on anyways (I enjoy the way the Gerwig adaptation addresses this) but, side note, I do see how Alcott weaves in the transcendentalist notion of the “universal family” and belief in learning about and supporting other cultures here. Friedrich is German, Meg marries the English John, and Laurie is said to be half-Italian, which all comes as a rebuttal to the anti-immigration sentiments of the times.‘I like good strong words that mean something,’ Jo says and that appeals to my love of language as well. This book deals with love in many ways, but feels like a romance between book and reader as you enjoy every page. Little Women was ahead of its time and still stands proudly today as an endearing work that dares challenge social convention. But most importantly, it feels like a friend. Finishing is hard as now I’ll miss the days with the March sisters, and I find books that take you from childhood to adulthood often hit the hardest because you feel as if you’ve grown up together. An emotional read, also a genius one, Little Women is a favorite now forever.5/5‘ Watch and pray, dear, never get tired of trying, and never think it is impossible to conquer your fault.’...more",Notes are private!,81,397,1,not set,not set,"Dec 04, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/20893528-little-women

Drawing from her diaries, Bischoff chronicles key moments from the early 1930s in the artistic awakening of the writer who would shock and captivate the literary world with her bold, erotic works and honest depictions of her interior life. Through colorful artwork that adapts to further portray the way Nin felt she was composed of many different women all at once, Bischoff threads the events into an emotionally charged journey of self-discovery, desires, problematic affairs and more in an engaging union of biography and highly expressive visual arts.‘For beauty. For love. For creation. I will never write like a man. I will write like a woman. I will express the inexpressible. Intuitions. Quivering. I will make of my life a masterpiece and invent a language to tell it. I will believe in my magic.’First of all, shoutout to libraries. I have a regular patron who has been researching Anaïs Nin and we got to chatting about her book Henry and June because of the film of the same name while I was sifting through our statewide loan program to track down the entirety of Nin’s published works. Imagine my excitement to discover this existed and I practically shouted across the library “I found the coolest thing for you!” when the patron came in the next day. So of course I had to read it to, despite not really having much prior knowledge of Nin beyond knowing her erotica fame and that she had numerous affairs such as with Henry Miller and psychoanalyst Otto Rank. I’m glad I did, even if just for the art which is absolutely gorgeous:  [image]Each page is dazzling, done in what appears to be colored pencil, capturing a lot of expressions in the more basic frames of line-art face designs and also overwhelming you with beauty in the more detailed frames that seem to be bursting with color and life. Okay though, nobody would say Henry Miller was a great beauty or anything but Bischoff totally does him dirty and I think that is hilarious. Anyways. The narrative often dips into surrealism, which is in keeping with Nin’s own fiction, and the art reaches to match. It is delightful:  [image]Nin is a complex figure, and one should be aware that this graphic novel does get into a lot of sexuality, manipulation and includes the incestuous affair Nin had with her own father (there are prominent visual nods to the surrealist imagery in her novel House of Incest, which is primarily about Henry and June but does contain veiled allusions to her father). We watch Nin go from a rather reserved sexuality—feeling restricted by her husband’s career in banking instead of art—to embracing her sexual desires and harnessing her affairs for artistic purposes. Most notable is her relationship with Miller, which begins over the pair working on each other’s writing following Nin’s work on D. H. Lawrence: An Unprofessional Study.   [image]Henry, Anaïs, and June‘I am a mirror for the desires of men,’ Nin considers, ‘and the roles that I play for them ignite the fires of their creativity.’ As her desires fuel her works, she finds it also inspires her lovers, though her financial support of Miller and desires for his wife do cause some emotional turmoil. As she begins to seek sexual inspiration with many around her, she increasingly finds herself as multiple people living in one being and navigating a ‘sea of lies.’ According to Nin’s biographer, Deidre Bair, Nin once said ‘I tell so many lies I have to write them down and keep them in the lie box so I can keep them straight.’ The key here, which we see all throughout the graphic novel, is that writing was, for her, a way to expand life, to live multiple lives, to live life more deeply in the linguistic investigations into events. Nin finds that men feel threatened by her writing, snapping once at Miller ‘You don’t understand that there can be other truths. Every man who reads my writing tries to “fix” it.’ For better or for worse, this graphic novel centers her journey to embrace her voice and her truth, not for others but for herself.  [image]This was an interesting read, and often rather uncomfortable, especially not having much knowledge on Nin’s life prior to the reading. While I’m sure much is embellished or distorted to fit—its like a biopic where its still kind of fiction even if it isn’t?—Bischoff blends it all into a forward progressing story that pulls a lot of emotion and introspection along with it. This is a scandalous story, but it is so wonderfully told and presented in outstanding artwork.4/5  [image]...more",Notes are private!,29,116,1,"Dec 02, 2023","Dec 02, 2023","Dec 02, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/63051131-ana-s-nin

If Annie Ernaux is an author who you would—hell, I probably have—say this sort of thing about then you are in luck because Look at the Lights, My Love is Ernaux’s diary-like reflections on supermarkets and does, in fact, contain some shopping lists (coffee and cat food, if you were curious). Ernaux reflects back on the emergence of supermarkets—her first being in the London suburbs in the 1960s—and considers the social implications that come with such behemoths of consumerism over the course of two years that she keeps records of her thoughts while shipping in an Auchan. While it is always a delight to read the way she decodes the world, much of this feels a bit dated having been published in 2014 and only now translated into English by Alison L. Strayer, though this also goes to show how much the world has changed even in a decade and how normalized the concept of a superstore is. Anything Ernaux is always worth a read, and at 96 pages this is a fun little jaunt through her mind.Growing up, superstores were just a normal part of American consumerism and never really seemed to stand out much for me. In Michigan we have Meijer which got its start here, as well as the usual Targets and Walmarts, so it was interesting to see Ernaux address them as something unique and worth dissecting. She begins her book, however, discussing that she feels superstores (okay, I also feel like nobody here ever uses the term superstore and just says the corporate name which is likely an indication on the US being so completely saturated by corporations capitalisming their way into every single nook and cranny of society) never get literary representation, which she theorizes is actually an erasure of women’s livelihoods. ‘the supermarket is linked to subsistence, the business of women, who have long been its main users. And that which falls within the domain of activities more or less specific to women is traditionally invisible, does not count-like the domestic work they perform, moreover. That which has no value in life has none in literature.’This was interesting to consider as I feel supermarkets have become backdrops for a lot of literature in the US, most notably Don DeLillo’s White Noise, where a character claims a supermarket ‘recharges us spiritually, it prepares us, it's a gateway or pathway. Look how bright. It's full of psychic data,’ that supermarkets are full of ceremonial behavior, ‘code words and ceremonial phrases.’ Supermarkets can serve an excellent vantage point into the undercurrent of society and these moments of reflection in Look at the Lights… is when the book is at its best. Over the two years, Ernaux has a few interesting points to consider. She writes about the value judgements, such as warnings about shoplifting in the alcohol section but not the vegetables. Or she writes about how consumerism gets tangled up in ideas of showing affection: ‘In the world of the superstore and the free-market economy, loving children means buying them as many things as possible’Basic reflections on class: ‘The humiliation inflicted by commercial goods: they are too expensive, so I'm worth nothing.’Or her ongoing disdain for the self-checkout and being yelled at by a robotic voice over any errors she makes: ‘On the internet I read that the scanning device is called a gun, and that consumers claim to be satisfied with the system, with the weapon that eliminates cashiers while at the same time turning us over to the discretionary authority of the superstore.A simple political act: refuse to use it.’She does not engage much with the staff or customers though, saying ‘I am unable to step outside my status of customer.’ I do enjoy the line she had about how if you accidentally steal something by error at a self-checkout it doesn’t feel as bad because it’s just a machine. During college my roommate and I read Les Miserables at the same time and started a running inside-joke where we’d steal a single baguette through the self-checkout and declare on our way out of the store “tonight we eat like Jean Valjean”. Ultimately, there isn’t much here for this to really need to be published as a standalone book beyond Yale University Press just wanting to put out anything Ernaux they had rights to following her winning the Nobel Prize in 2022, but it was still a plesant read.

Because seeing in order to write is to see in a different way. It means to distinguish objects, individuals, and mechanisms, and give their existence value.’This was a fun little read, and I certainly thought about it today while grocery shopping, passing through all the different sections of the superstore and reflecting more about them than I had before.

[image]The artwork here is really lovely, and I like the simplicity and whimsicality of it, harnessing the subject matter in metaphor. The Seasons Within Me is a story of a young girl who often feels like it is raining just on her, like the seasons are changing inside just like they are outside, and her moods are represented with weather imagery.  [image]Nothing she does seems to change how she feels, though when she finds a lost, injured puppy and nurses the animal back to health, she finds they can wait out the stormy weather inside them both and make the most of it together. I loved the imagery of using the puddles from their personal rainclouds to sail paper boats upon. I appreciate that the message was not something about just finding ways to be happy or optimistic but instead shows that sad feelings happen and sometimes we just can’t shake them, that’s life, but you can weather out the gloomy days.

Spanning the tumultuous decades from post-WWII to the 1980s in German, Karl struggles with being a gay man in a society where homosexuality is criminalized while also finding his clandestine relationships repeatedly causing harm to his life as a family man —a life he so desperately wishes he could live authentically while also realizing he cannot ever dismiss his true desires. In keeping with the title, the story is told in parallel timelines of Karl as a lonely, retired man worried he can never make amends with his estranged, adult daughter with the timeline of Karl’s adulthood leading through broken marriages and relationships, finding secret solace in queer communities and living in fear of being found out. This is a heavy book—both emotionally and literally as in comes in around 450pgs of striking black and white artwork—with Parallel capturing the struggles of queer people in history along with the history of post-war Germany and becoming a heartbreaking investigation into repression and isolation.  [image]Occasionally this feels overly long, but the artwork is breathtaking. Particularly the many architectural frames, showing bombed out cities wearily getting back on their feet or somber landscapes that match the emotional vibes of the story (the winter artwork is particularly lovely). While I sometimes felt the use of shadows on faces wasn’t my favorite stylization, I did enjoy how well Lehmann shows his characters age. This is a somber artistic feast and for how sad the story is, the artwork is something you’ll want to pause and bask in.  [image]The story is quite painful at times. It shows the way criminalization of sexualities forced people to hide (heres an article on the legal history, and that homosexuality was decriminalized in East Germany in 1968 and in West Germany in 1969, though the legislation was not discarded completely until 1994) which only heaps shame on top of an already difficult situation. We see Karl wrestle with his feelings, falling into secret affairs and even brining a lover to live at home with his wife and kid, and how the life he tries to keep hidden keeps coming back to haunt him. It can be a lot, and I was reminded a bit of Giovanni's Room where you see how the stresses and oppressions corners people into behaviors that end up hurting loved ones. It moves rather slowly through much of Karl’s past—slow as in detailed and letting the story breathe but never feeling like a slog as this book is really quite engaging—though I wish it would have addressed the issues between him and his daughter more. We never see her past childhood and only hear about vague arguments that lead to her cutting him out of her life for over a decade. One can surmise what occurred, but so much of the story is building around the break-up of that family bond and Karl’s hopes to repair it without any of that really making it onto the page in a rather long book.Still, Parallel is quite moving and difficult to look away from. It covers a lot of ground, balances a lot of side characters, and is just gorgeous to look at. The side-characters are just as engaging as the main story, particularly the woman he can identify with in East Germany, and you feel every setback and heartbreak along with the characters on the page. I’m glad this was made available in the US in translation by Ivanka Hahnenberger as the insight into post-war Germany is also rather fascinating to read. Based on event’s of Lehmann’s own relative, this is a sad but powerful look at life struggling to keep moving forward, to find community and, most importantly, to find self-acceptance. 4/5  [image]...more",Notes are private!,10,120,1,"Nov 29, 2023","Nov 29, 2023","Nov 29, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/62918974-parallel

And that can make the worThe world is rarely kind to those who are different, those who stand out from what society has deemed “acceptable” behavoir. And that can make the world a lonely place. This is Amiko, Do You Copy? by Natsuko Imamura, author of The Woman in the Purple Skirt, positions the reader into this sort of isolated existence as the story follows Amiko, a girl who seems to float through life as equally unaware of the bullying she receives as she is to how her own actions set her apart from others. Tender yet ultimately tragic, this is a story of the spreading consequences from misconceptions all seen through the eyes of a girl who can’t quite follow the thread of emotions and events. The story is best emphasized in a pivotal scene where Amiko speaks into her walkie-talkie, calling out to the world and receiving no response beyond, at one point when she hears ‘what sounded like a faint voice amid all the grating noise.’ Addressing neurodivergence and the ways people are misunderstood even by those closest to them, This is Amiko, Do You Copy? is a moving and rather heartbreaking story beautifully presented in a simplistic style (translated here by Hitomi Yoshio) that subtly implies far more than its own words.I had enjoyed the way Imamura’s The Woman in the Purple Skirt left a lot unsaid but managed to make those omissions speak the loudest and found that this is a talent she carries over into This Amiko, Do You Copy?. The whole novella is overflowing in dramatic irony where the reader is far more aware of the interpersonal dynamics and emotional currents than Amiko herself, through whom the story is told. It is written in third person, though only offers Amiko’s perspective, and the prose is rather simplistic in order to capture the impressions of the world the way a child would (Amiko goes from being a young child to a teenager over the course of the story). Being third person instead of first gives us a sense that Amiko’s own life feels at a remove from herself.‘She wanted to be kind. But the more she wanted to be kind, the sadder she got. She couldn’t find the words. She couldn’t say a word.’Many of the events of the story simply pass by without much special emphasis or investigation in order to embody the way that, for Amiko, even the most dramatic of moments don’t seem to register as such to her. Aside from her brief moments with Nori, a classmate for whom she has developed a strong affection despite not reading his social cues of utter annoyance at her presence, Amiko is rather unaffected by everything around her. And, initially, rather blissfully so. ‘It’s like you’re free,’ a classmate admits before adding, ‘well, it’s also why you get bullied…’ The tragedy of the novella is that, because Amiko doesn’t pick up on social cues or socially acceptable behavior, some of her actions cause great offense and sadness to her own family. There are some deeply uncomfortable scenes, though we also recognize how Amiko meant no offense and doesn't even realize that she has offended.While a revelation about her family comes quite late in the novella, it is almost brushed aside in the text which can feel a bit frustrating as it feels underexplored. And this feeling of frustration the reader may feel should hopefully be eye opening as to why the people around Amiko act so cruelly towards her instead of stopping to think about how that is just the way she is. They misunderstand her and are cold to her instead of accommodating, they mock her behavior, and even her extremely protective brother eventually finds her to be too much for him. I also found the presentation of the narrative, winding around itself and weaving back and forth across the timeline, to not only be a great way to tease out the story but also represent the way Amiko processes her experience in roundabout ways.This is Amiko, Do You Copy? is a heartfelt yet heartbreaking story that serves as an expression on neurodivergence in a society that is not equipped to be accommodating. I'd be curious to read how those with more experience on the subject matter find the representation, and I'm also curious how the conversation around neurodivergence has changed since this was originally published in 2011. The book has been compared to Convenience Store Woman, though the two novels take fairly different approaches but both still become rather tragic social criticisms. Short, moving, and rather powerful, this book is a good reminder to have patience and understanding with others, and to show kindness instead of the cruelty Amiko finds here.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,18,143,1,not set,not set,"Nov 28, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/102214610-this-is-amiko-do-you-copy

Utown, the gritty yet heart‘You gotta admit, this is the best place in the world.’  [image]How can one live when the cost of living drives you out? Utown, the gritty yet heartfelt graphic novel from Cab (Caroline Breault of Nuclear Winter), captures the struggles of an artist, Sam, down on his luck and bank account as his beloved city district is becoming gentrified and the run-down building where he lives is set to be bulldozed. Told through really gorgeous, black and white artwork, Utown is emotionally charged yet never over-sentimental as is explores themes of addiction, patterns of self-sabotage, gentrification and community as we see Sam’s convictions to his neighborhood confronted by larger legal and economic forces as he spirals deeper into alcohol, drugs and despair instead of committing to the art project that could be his only life-line out of a place he never wanted to leave. Cab delivers a raucous, rebellious but ultimately tender story that is an ode to those living on the margins of society and finding that space is rapidly shrinking and threatening to push them off the edge.  [image]I really felt for Sam even in all his frustrating flaws, stubbornness and self-destruction. An art school drop-out living in a studio space in a building full of a ragtag group of others like him (his ex girlfriend has just returned to live there, adding to his emotional instability), Sam is more concerned about having a good time than anything else. He’s a great artist but can’t commit, he’s a caring person but is usually blown out, he has the best intentions, but rarely follows through. But he has great weed. He shows up to interviews hungover in dirty clothes. He resents his best friend for moving into a lower-middle class lifestyle. He especially hates the fancy new bar run by Etienne that replaced the dive-bar he spent his childhood at waiting on his alcoholic father. And it’s hard to get motivated for work and the mundane needs of adulthood when there is a party happening every night with people you like. Sam’s choices start to not only hurt himself but others around him, including the sweet teen boy Sam takes under his wing and provides shelter to. Ed looks up to him, but is beginning to realize he is being exploited for his company and cooking, and its hard to watch the people you look up to fall so low.  [image]Sam is someone I’ve definitely known. Admittedly, Sam is someone I’ve definitely been at times. The imagery of his filthy space full of art, art supplies, and empty bottles brought to mind many places I’ve been or even briefly lived in places like Detroit or Ypsilanti. Sam is 24 and being 24 is HARD, especially when you have no clear path forward, and I enjoyed that Cab includes a character in the mix that is a college graduate (Literature major, like myself in my lowest of times) to show how being on the verge of debt and homelessness is something that can happen to anyone. I work in a library, trust me, we are all a few events of bad luck away from that reality. This is especially difficult in areas where affordable housing is becoming scarce and so quickly batted down in city planning by the financially comfortable who stigmatize the lower classes while also being more interested in property values and economic growth than ensuring everyone is provided for. Society will focus on perceived dangers from those living on the margins instead of focusing on how living that way is a constant state of anxiety, agitation and desperation and the trauma exacerbates mental health struggles and can develop into PTSD. As Peter Moskowitz writes in his book, How to Kill a City: Gentrification, Inequality, and the Fight for the Neighborhood:‘Gentrification, at its deepest level, is really about reorienting the purpose of cities away from being spaces that provide for the poor and middle classes and toward being spaces that generate capital for the rich.’For a book about a inner-city community facing displacement, the cast of characters is rather white which does sort of gloss over that displacement and hardships due to gentrification disproportionately affects people of color and contributes to already troubling financial inequalities. Though that said, I really enjoyed the characters here. Cab does an excellent job at making you empathize with flawed characters. It is a really tragic story but also very human and heartfelt.I also love the art here. The character designs were great (you can really watch Sam grow more disheveled and looking increasingly unhinged as the story progresses) and I loved the architectural art. Artists that put a big emphasis on architecture in graphic novels tend to be some of my favorite art and it is truly lovely here. Also it is a story about art and creating art, and I love that. As a former street artist myself, I really enjoyed this. Utown really captures the feeling of the city district but seeing it through Sam’s eyes, you can’t help but love it too.4/5  [image]...more",Notes are private!,10,80,1,not set,not set,"Nov 26, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/61094346-utown

Set after the events of Exit Strategy, this little chapter (its not really a standalone story, for the record) is fascinating as it is the first time we’ve got to experience the world of Murderbot detached from Murderbot’s perspective. This third person narration swings into the mind of Dr. Mensah, capturing the trauma she has recently experienced and her subsequent PTSD (‘hard not to be paranoid when you remember all the times your paranoia was justified.’). But we also get to perceive Murderbot externally here, see how Murderbot’s self-perception comes across differently than how it feel to be in the room with it. Namely, Murderbot is nowhere near as awkward as it thinks it is, and is quite intimidating nonetheless. While not much ground is covered here, there is some rather insightful banter of the problem ‘that SecUnits aren’t bots and aren’t human; they fall between the cracks of the existing protections even in the Preservation Alliance,’ and people will fear Murderbot is just a corporate SecUnit not to be trusted. But more importantly that so much of this galaxy is a corporate slave state where human and robotic life will never outweigh even the smallest of profit margins. ‘The Corporation Rim has always been a slave state, though it calls its institutionalized slavery “contract labor.” The production of human/bot constructs is just a more horrific twist, a mental slavery as well as a physical one. At least victims of contract labor are free to think their own thoughts. But we tell ourselves that constructs aren’t aware of their predicament. What SecUnit makes us realize is that this is not true; they are all aware of what they are and what’s been done to them. But the only choice they are ever offered is obedience or pain and death.’This is a fun but very short little dip back into the Wells’ amazing sci-fi world and the big takeaway is how heartwarming it is to see how much Mensah and Murderbot care about and support each other. When Murderbot says ‘You can hug me if you need to,’ I felt all the feels.

It is a haunting collection, one that delves into the Palestine-Israel conflict and the lives of Palestinians in ‘the world's largest open-air prison’ as they are displaced, detained and killed, but these poems also seek to capture the hope they will not let be snuffed out. The titular journalist, who’s work documenting the abuse and violence in Gaze and the West Bank is captured here in heart-wrenching poetic form, is none other than Janna Jihad Ayyad, to whom this collection is dedicated along with her cousin, Palestinian activist Ahed Tamimi, and ‘all young people devoted to justice and sharing their voice.’ At age 7, after two members of her family were killed, Janna began capturing the struggles of life in Gaza through her phone camera and sharing it with the world via Facebook, earning herself the distinction of the world’s youngest journalist (she continues to do so, now at the age of 17 in 2023). ‘Janna says the camera is stronger than the gun,’ Nye writes ‘”I can send my message to small people / and they sent it to others.”’ With this collection, Nye has passed her message along again, now in the form of poetry, and it makes for a deeply moving read bearing witness to horrific suffering,UnforgettableIn the water is a poemunwritten by grass.No. In the land is a poemunwritten by water.Everything unwritten.Not on your forehead,not on the sky.The fathers sailed awayplanning to return,not easily will they forgeta place that let us allsorrow this much.Naomi Shihab Nye has quite a legacy of work with over 30 volumes of poetry as well as many picture books and novels and from 2019-2022 she served as the Young People’s Poet Laureate. I’ve long been moved by her work, and many of you may be familiar with her much loved poem, Kindness (you can read it here). Though in recent years a poem from this collection has frequented social media, particularly around holidays rife with fireworks:No ExplosionsTo enjoyfireworksyou would haveto have liveda different kindof lifeI’ve always questioned the act of setting off explosives on Memorial Day, though Nye is more specifically addressing the lives of those who have grown up and lived under constant bombardments. Growing up between Jerusalem and Ramallah, Nye writes that she has ‘witnessed many of the struggles firsthand, which have unfortunately only heightened and intensified in the succeeding years.’ Considering the recent events this autumn, Tiny Journalist is all the more critical of a perspective, particularly as it aims to boost the message of Janna Jihad who decided to use her voice when she say that the mass media of the world tended to ignore or rhetorically cover up the things she witnesses on a daily basis (‘I am mad about language / covering pain / big bandage’ Nye writes in a poem criticizing the passive language of newspapers). “Not a lot of journalists are sending our message from Palestine to the world, so I thought, ‘why not send my message … and show them what is happening in my village’,” Janna said in an interview with Aljazeera when she was 10 years old. Janna has faced death threats and intimidation for her work and there is always the threat of arrest looming over her (Amnesty International reports that 500 to 700 Palestinian children are detained and prosecuted by Israeli military courts every year) but she continues to use her voice to draw attention. Which is the goal of poetry as well so it is wonderful to see Nye take her perspective and turn it into poetry.Her voice a library of kindness.I hear pages rustling, hungry fingersmoving through stories. If you very alone,you would want this voice to find you.Grief is central to this collection. The poems chronicle life under occupation, such as arrests—many of which are done without a stated crime where even higher profile Palestinians are detained (earlier this week poet Mosab Abu Toha was detained but later released)—violence and death. Writing from the United States, Nye confronts US readers with their complicity, such as poems titled ‘America Gives Israel Ten Million Dollars A Day’ or when she writes ‘sometimes I wonder what / 38 billion dollars could buy, instead of weapons aimed / against us.’ Nye pulls us into the perspective of those who feel cast aside or demonized simply for where they are born, further displaced from the world when the media ignores their perspectives (‘why don’t they write about us more?’) or launches readymade retorts at criticisms for such a thing. ‘Calling us anti-Semitic / when we are Semites too,’ she addresses multiple times in the collection, ‘no joke, no one is laughing.’ She asks us not to look away, and ‘Why can’t they see / how beautiful we are?’‘This was our superpower, retaining imagination in our worst days.’There is still hope burning brightly even in all the sorrows of this collection. ‘Our magic is that we are / still here and we're always here,’ she writes. And she champions those who do speak up and speak out, like Janna, and ensure their voices will not be silenced or discarded into oblivion. This is a powerful and rather painful collection, mostly told through a fictionalized perspective of Janna as she holds her camera up for the world or addresses people via social media, and one that asks for your attention and understanding. I would highly recommend checking out Tiny Journalist, it may not be an easy read but it is an important one.⅘People think of us differently.We may be in prison, but we still love beauty.We may be oppressed, but we are smart.We may think we don't need glasses, but the big Efor equality has been lying on its backfor a long time nowkicking its legs in the air like an animalthat needs help to get up....more",Notes are private!,8,95,1,not set,not set,"Nov 24, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41745817-the-tiny-journalist

It is, perhaps, one of those picture books that I find are more keepsake treasures for the parent’s enjoyment more than necessarily a fun book for children, but I do like that it is a great way for kids to discover the beautiful words of Joy Harjo and the artwork is really delightful.  [image]I love the full-color full page art here and I really love this poem and this book is a perfect way to better appreciate it. Here is the full text of the poem:Remember the sky that you were born under,know each of the star’s stories.Remember the moon, know who she is.Remember the sun’s birth at dawn, that is thestrongest point of time.

Such is the case in Sarah Gailey’s graphic novel, Know Your Station, wonderfully illustrated by Liana Kangas in boisterous colors are brutal violence to depict a society aboard a spacecraft to comfortably house the world’s billionaires. Though their space station becomes a locked-room mystery setting when someone begins murdering the billionaires in such visceral and dramatically crafted ways that it could be taken as artistic expression. To complicate matters, the woman tasked with finding the killer is currently experiencing extreme nausea and hallucinations from detoxing off the space-age designer drug, Blue, and hiding evidence because it all points to her. Though, truthfully, the working class on the ship doesn’t seem to mind a few billionaires getting axed and all feel oppressed by them so the list of potential suspects is vast. This is a fun read, and while it is a bit over the top and on-the-nose that is part of Gailey’s charm as the story confronts ideas of economic disparity and AI ethics in art and surveillance in this futuristic whodunnit.  [image]Sarah Gailey is no stranger to the graphic novel world with works like their Eat the Rich or comics set in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer universe. That said, there are times where I felt this might have read better as a novel. It can get a bit wordy in the frames and while I tend to enjoy speculative fiction that drops you in the middle and makes you figure it out through context, that seems to work less successfully here as the first issue (this work is comprised of five issues) is a bit cumbersome to follow just trying to figure out all the whos, whats, and whys. However, art is a key element to the story so I see why making this a graphic novel felt truer to the heart of things and it does lean into the medium for some really eye-popping colors and gore.The story is pretty fun and occasionally confusing as a way to embody the confusion of the main character, Elise, and while it is a tad heavy handed at the end it is also all really interesting socio-economic and ethical questions. I enjoy how this looks at the issues of AI art essentially copying the work of others or how people who fund ideas but do very little in actually making the ideas function often get all the credit instead of the people who did the actual work. There’s some great quips about the working class being oppressed and nods to a whole slew of issues around privatization of essential services. It’s very on-the-nose in its delivery, but it works.I had a lot of time to kill today sitting in a hospital waiting room and Know Your Station was an engaging way to pass the time. In short: I think it would have been better explored in novel form, especially to give the exciting but under-explored anti-capitalist themes more nuance beyond surface mentions, but I was glad for the art as well.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,4,51,1,not set,not set,"Nov 21, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/101147457-know-your-station

You sink your readerly teeth into it only to find it biting you back, mashing you up in its prose, digesting you in its pages as your own mind digests the narratives in return. Salt Slow from Julia Armfield is such a book. These nine stories are as mesmerizing as they are menacing, couched in quotidian realities that are familiar yet, crouched in the shadows, we find horrors that open new realms of imagination to tear the flesh off the ordinary and explore the muscles and bones beneath society. These stories stalk around social issues, employing body-horror to invigorate discussions on women’s bodies, social agency, femininity under patriarchy, or dredging monsters up from the depths to interrogate interpersonal relationships and queerness in a heteronormative society. A woman’s dead girlfriend returns home after six months in the grave, a all-woman rock band that makes ‘music about yearning, about hunger,’ inspires fans to unleash their emotions in a feral frenzy, a wolf becomes a devoted sister, people lose the ability to sleep, bodies become something far greater than human and more. For a collection that presses into viscera and violence, Salt Slow feels rather serene, with Armfield’s prose washing over the reader as nearly hypnotic. Armfield blends the mundane with the monstrous and makes us feel always on the verge of tumbling into a vaster, wilder world making Salt Slow an eerie feast of the imagination that carves out a space for women’s desires, rage, and bodies to be celebrated.‘We are frenetic with hunger, with wanting, with the repentance of the season. We laugh like hyenas, our heads thrusting forward from our bodies.’I first discovered Julia Armfield upon recommendation from Florence Welsh. Since she is king, I instantly sought out her novel and now have finally read the short stories. In keeping with my habit of matching Florence + The Machine songs with books that I feel embody them (see all of my Jeanette Winterson s), for your listening pleasure to accompany this piece I recommend putting on Dream Girl Evil. Carry on.This is a haunting collection and you, dear reader, are about to become the haunted house for it to inhabit. The tone of this collection really seduces your forward, much like that of a fairy tale. It often feels quite familiar but plays with tropes in ways that are rendered fresh and surprising. Her prose is dazzling, luring you into sinister landscapes with ‘waves drawing back like lips revealing teeth,’ or a sky that is ‘gory with stars like the inside of a gutted night,’ engulfing you in her imagination and then striking. Included in this collection is Armfield’s story The Great Awake, which was the winner of the 2018 White Review Short Story Prize, though the rest of the collection stands vibrantly on its own instead of like padding as an excuse to release the winning story in book form. It is an imaginative story (you can read it in full HERE, and I highly recommend it) that functions like a thought experiment about how society would be affected if our ability to sleep left us and became a separate, shadowy entity that follows us around. Armfield explores the social implications and ethical questions—of course someone will question “can we fuck it?” or “what if we murder it?”—but threads it through a somber and touching budding romance. This is rather consistent throughout the collection with stories injecting something fantastical in an otherwise mundane reality, asking how the change would affect relationships, society or our coping mechanism in general. ‘I choose Greek myths and ghost stories, tales that come in under fourteen pages and culminate in violent lessons. I read aloud and let her stop me when she wants to – stories of swans and spiders, bay trees, narcissi, girls transformed into monsters by rivals playing dirty.’ I’ve greatly enjoyed how horror has been embraced as a literary avenue for exploring ideas of identity in recent years (though the tradition is as old as the genre itself), with many queer and or BIPOC writers brilliantly crafting chilling stories by way of social critiques and Salt Slow successfully moves through horror to illustrate the underlying themes. In a conversation with The Guardian, Armfield discusses how ‘the entire point of so much good horror is the overcoming of patriarchal monsters, essentially,’ and we can see that alive and well in her stories. Especially through the ways her stories confront what it means to be a woman—or a queer woman—in modern society.‘“The queer character has been so traditionally coded and designated as the monstrous…and I think I was trying to reclaim that monster. There’s freedom in the monster being the norm and not the other.’Salt Slow makes excellent use of body horror as a way to celebrate women’s bodies. The characters frequently mention ‘I had a bad body around that time,’ or reference ‘problem skin,’ and Armfield urges us to embrace all bodies as beautiful and allow them to be as such even when society would call them flawed or monstrous. We find this in the opening story, Manti, which takes a sharp look at the journey through puberty into womanhood. The story juxtaposes the narrator’s peers, girls who are blossoming into bodies that inspire a hunger to be devoured by sexual appetites, with her own that is shedding skin and being instilled with a rather different hunger to devour male bodies. ‘They have witnessed the way things have stretched and mutated. There are things down there, growing. She had briefly been one of those things herself…’Armfield plunges into the depths of womanhood to embrace the life beneath the surface that society tries to keep submerged. The ocean is a frequent motif in her works—particularly the mysteries that come floating up out of it—and her characters often identify with the murkiness beneath the waves. In Smack, a woman refuses to leave her husbands unused lakeside cottage during their divorce, feeling kindred to the jellyfish that have beached themselves in such numbers it has shocked the country, emboldened and defiant in her affinity for their masses that are ‘split open and unbodied, a mess of tentacles and bells and polyps that the men running clean-up operations have failed to sweep away.’ The ocean, which is often a symbol for women or motherhood in the myths and folklore tracing back through history, is also significant in the titular story about a pregnant woman and her partner adrift in the post-apocalypse where heavy rains have flooded the planet like a blend of Cormac McCarthy’s The Road and Noah of the Bible where women have reclaimed the focus. Though it is not the pregnancy or giving birth where the horror awakens in this story, but rather the legacy this act leaves behind.It is no surprise, reading these, that Armfield would follow this collection with her debut novel, the deeply moving Our Wives Under the Sea. The makings of the novel are all on display here, not just in the focus on the mysteries under the surface but Armfield’s tendency to juggle the moment of horror with the arc of a relationship caught in the crossfire. This is most notable in Cassandra After, one of my favorite tales which features the decomposing body of a dead girlfriend coming to call months after her burial. The story is a tender yet tragic remembrance of a relationship, like a coming-of-age narrative of accepting one’s own queerness under an unwelcoming society that positions Cassandra’s catholicism as a barrier to the narrator’s ability to properly mourn. The story feels like a precursor to the novel—not a draft, per say, as it is fully realized and perfect in its own devastating way—and one of the highlights for the multiple queer relationships that populate this collection. Though there are straight relationships in this collection as well. ‘There is no way to love a man,’ begins the story Granite which focuses on trying to find a fitting partner under the criticisms of friends, ‘not well, or rather, not correctly.’ Society always seems to butt in on interpersonal relationship and the characters feel less able to embrace themselves for themselves and more pressured to conform to the wishes of the masses (which, essentially, is a queer narrative as well). Though not every story is somber. The Collectibles is a rather humorous tale of a group of women roomates who, tired of the failures of relationships, dream up the idea of a perfect man. Which is all fine and dandy until one decides to create one Frankenstein-style. ‘“I don’t think [Salt Slow] will be unpalatable to men,’ Armfield jokes in interview, ‘it’s just that a lot of men die in it.’ ‘As catholic girls, we are all a little awkward, the kind of girls grown slack and strange from too much inactivity and not enough contact with boys.’This is a collection that celebrates women, but also one that ensures we remember that women have a place. In literature, in society, in their own agency and emotions. Formally Feral follows a girl who has experienced her parents divorce and then father’s remarriage to a woman who keeps a wolf as a daughter, the wolf becoming her protector and teaching her that she, too, has teeth to keep the monsters (abusive boys) at bay. But one of the biggest highlights of this book is Stop Your Women’s Ears with Wax, a story with a fresh narrative style that chronicles the tour of an all-woman band that serves as not only a rebuttal to patriarchal norms but a force that can shatter all expectations. Fans latch onto their songs about desire and it awakens the wildness that has been made dormant within them. ‘The call, the drag, the ache, the yearn, the need, whatever you want to call it.’ And things get intense.‘On the news later, a brief video package. Girls bursting from the venue and howling across the street. The velvet rage of their small mouths, hair torn from their temples. A swollen werewolf moon…one can just make out the boy in the chip shop window, the way he moves his hands up at the breaking of the frontage glass. In a thick swathe, the girls reach out for him grabbing at his legs and neck and elbows pulling him out through the window. The clip ends shortly after that. Before the screaming and the rending. The camera swinging away to capture the mass of a thousand girls all racing forward down the street, a crooked note of music in the air.’This tale of feral teenage girls devouring men in the streets is the Eras Tour we deserve (I was at the Detroit show and I will never stop talking about it, sorry not sorry, I’m actually wearing the t-shirt right now). Is it a cruel summer tour or the inevitable breaking to the surface of repressed emotion finally finding a voice? It reminds me of the book Rage Becomes Her: The Power of Women's Anger, where author Soraya Chemaly discusses how when women are taught that exhibiting strong emotions, like those they find in the band's music, 'is undesirable, selfish, powerless, and ugly, we learn that we are undesirable, selfish, powerless, and ugly.' These repressed feelings turn inward, but Chemaly asserts that 'anger...invokes the possibility of change and of fighting back' and can be a useful tool in releasing the socially-coached shame.'Anger is an assertion of rights and worth...It is intimacy, acceptance, fearlessness, embodiment, revolt, and reconciliation. Anger is memory and rage. It is rational thought and irrational pain. Anger is freedom...Anger is the expression of hope...Anger is usually about saying ""no"" in a world where women are conditioned to say almost anything but ""no.”'Armfield has stated her work attempts to reclaim the monster, to show the monstrous as a symbol of resistance against repression, and the image of all the bottled rage of a generation of girls exploding out from concert-hall doors is one hell of a way to capture that.‘Cities could not be lived in but only haunted, that we would simply become two more ghosts in a place where ghosts already abound.’Salt Slow is a gorgeous collection of stories and Julia Armfield wonderfully harnesses elements of horror to open up discussions on society ‘the way you crack a chest cavity.’ It is a quieter collection than you’d expect from the accolades and descriptions it brings, but I found that the quietness and rather soft delivery only added to my enjoyment as the stories seem to nestle deep within your mind, curled up like a cat that will bat at your thoughts for days to come. These stories are weird, yet wonderful and tease the imagination in ways that recall being a small child, watching shadows move across your walls and fearing they are more than light thrown against a pile of clothes on your chair—these stories are the realization that they are, in fact, something more.4.5/5‘I pressed my face to her chest in the too-soft place where the skin was still intact and felt I understood the way the surface of the world is thinner in certain places. that these places are where the strange, true things escape.’...more",Notes are private!,25,214,1,"Nov 20, 2023","Nov 23, 2023","Nov 20, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42870948-salt-slow

It is a season that enfolds multitudes of contradictions inside itself, all tumbling about like the fallen leaves in the breeze yet somehow harmonizing the discordance into a bittersweet emotional symphony. It is the season of decay with the days eroding towards dark and cold yet the seasons proclaims a defiant death throe of comforting weather and vibrant colors like ‘a second spring when every leaf is a flower,’ as Albert Camus once wrote. Warm days with a crisp underbite. Personally, autumn has always felt like the ideal catalyst for the moments we synthesize as key details in our personal bildungsromans: the start of new school years bringing change and the excitement of new things or, in college years, the season coincides with that first taste of campus freedom and the intense early scenes of a university romance. ‘Autumns seem that season of beginning,’ Truman Capote wrote, and these beginnings conflicting with the symbolic endings of the season are a gorgeous contradiction that has always captured not only my heart, but many of the great writers and poets throughout the ages. Jane Austen tells us this in Persuasion, touching upon autumn as:‘that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness — that season which has drawn from every poet worthy of being read some attempt at description, or some lines of feeling.’There is a high bar for autumnal expression and Ali Smith not only meets the challenge but creates something that combines the calendar season with a specific sort of political autumn in 2016. Above all, Smith captures the contradictory nature of autumn into a heartrending exploration of what it means to be a person and one person among many. While being rather melancholy in tone, Autumn reads rather playfully as it saunters through prose composed of puns, paintings and political polarization. To speak of a plot seems beside the point as Smith extracts meaning from quotidian moments, creating a collage of images that amalgamate towards an otherwise ineffable impression. Elisabeth,the central character in Autumn writes of of underrecognized British pop artist Pauline Boty’s collage work that ‘an image of an image means the image can be seen with new objectivity, with liberation from the original,’ and Smith’s narrative can be viewed as representing autumn in a similar regard. In this way, Autumn catalyzes past and present as well as the personal and political in a deeply moving work where each beautiful sentence fell into my heart like leaves cascading off the trees.‘ The trees are revealing their structures. There’s the catch of fire in the air. All the souls are out marauding. But there are roses, there are still roses. ’Ali Smith wrote in The Guardian that her Seasons Quartet—a series of books that could plausibly be read as stand-alones or in any order (of which Autumn is the first) though do travel in a thematic movement forward like the passage of time they represent—‘would be about not just their own times, but the place where time and the novel meet.’ Time is central to everything here, even in its invisibility, and all the aspects of “past” and “present” presented here as the narrative sashays across the timeline seem to find the Brexit referendum as the major hinge between them. It represents not just the dividing line between “before” and “after” Brexit, which is something deeply felt in times of historical change just like how the Covid pandemic in 2020 often becomes a reference for “before” and “after” (Smith writes about this later in Companion Piece), but also a political dividing line between people. Smith spends several lengthy passages emphasizing this:‘All across the country, people felt bereaved and shocked. All across the country, people felt righteous. All across the country, people felt sick. All across the country, people felt history at their shoulder. All across the country, people felt history meant nothing. All across the country, people felt like they counted for nothing. All across the country, people had pinned their hopes on it. All across the country, people waved flags in the rain. All across the country, people drew swastika graffiti. All across the country, people threatened other people. All across the country, people told people to leave. All across the country, the media was insane. All across the country, politicians lied. All across the country, politicians fell apart…’This collective contradictory feeling, this sort of metaphorical autumn or “fall,” creates an uneasy backdrop to the novel. Smith excels at threading small details as subplots through the story that quietly emphasize this. There is the back-and-forth of graffiti on a wall spitefully telling people to go home and being reminded the UK is their home or the idea of being divided getting a physical manifestation as an electrified fence across the town at which Elisabeth’s mother eventually assaults with trinkets she finds at an antiques shop ‘bombarding that fence with people’s histories.’ Though my favorite is the rather humorous paperwork drama that unfolds with Elisabeth assailed by bureaucratic barriers in an attempt to renew her passport. As someone who often has to ask for multiple forms of ID in order to register people for a library card, Elisabeth being unable to provide ID without being able to renew her ID because of specifications that come across as comically absurd was rather darkly delightful to read. But all these details—Smith is extraordinary at writing about nothing, the quiet moments are so cathartically perfect—really add up to dynamically portray the specifics of the moment in time.‘That's the thing about things. They fall apart, always have, always will, it's in their nature.’Within the larger political is a rather intimate tale of the personal: the friendship between Elisabeth and Daniel which begins when she is a young girl and he, the aging neighbor, becomes a sort of caregiver so Elisabeth’s mother can dodge responsibilities and head out to town. This friendship becomes her sort of coming-of-age narrative, making a home in her heart that will inform the rest of her life. ‘The lifelong friends,’ Daniel, already an old man, says to her in her youth, ‘sometimes wait a lifetime for them.’ And sometimes it is the absences that speak loudest, with the past of their times together—experiencing art and playing thought and language games that excite and exercise the imagination and often tend to bend towards the political—juxtaposed with the present as she reads to him in a elderly care facility while he remains asleep at the ripe old age of 101. It is a really moving story and as Smith places each piece of their time together into the collective portrait of life the story only becomes sadder yet more beautiful.‘A great many men don’t understand a woman full of joy, even more don’t understand paintings full of joy by a woman.’The artist Pauline Boty is first introduced to her by Daniel and becomes a symbol within the novel not only for a feminist resistance against a patriarchy that would always try to delegitimize or sweep aside women’s efforts, but also an expression of art forged from political unrest. In this way, Smith ties the story of Boty with that of Christine Keeler and the Profumo Affair, from which her painting, Scandal 63, became a political statement (the painting has notably been lost).  [image]Pauline Boty with her painting of Christine Keeler, ‘Scandal 63’Smith continues this legacy of forming art from the political. It is in the nature of art it seems, adapting and creating as if in refusal to be legislated into silence. Take the word “Brexit” for instance, a word that didn’t exist until the UK moved to break from the EU but now is a commonly known term: language creates and adapts to meet the times.‘Language is like poppies. It just takes something to churn the earth round them up, and when it does up come the sleeping words, bright red, fresh, blowing about.’I loved the moments with Daniel and Elisabeth where their word games became political expressions even without her realizing it, such as the incredible scene where Daniel takes Elisabeth’s image of a man with a gun and his with a man dressed as a tree and creates a story representing political oppression and violence against those who deviate from the socially-enforced “norms”. In a way a novel is a rebuttal against the news, particularly in times when people no longer trust the media. ‘I’m tired of the news. I’m tired of the way it makes things spectacular that aren’t, and deals so simplistically with what’s truly appalling,’ we are told, and a novel is a way to take those same details and organize them in ways that emphasize the emotional undercurrents that are often left out. A way to create a fiction that can do battle with the fictions told by those in power to obtain or retain power. ‘Always be reading something,’ Daniel advises, ‘even when we're not physically reading. How else will we read the world?’ This is why I find literature to be so important, it helps us read the world.‘I'm tired of the vitriol. I'm tired of anger. I'm tired of the meanness. I'm tired of selfishness. I'm tired of how we're doing nothing to stop it. I'm tired of how we're encourageing it. I'm tired of the violence that's on it's way, that's coming, that hasn't happened yet. I'm tired of liars. I'm tired of sanctified liars. I'm tired of how those liars have let this happen. I'm tired of having to wonder whether they did it out of stupidity or did it on purpose. I'm tired of lying governments. I'm tired of people not caring whether they're being lied to anymore. I'm tired of being made to feel this fearful.’In times of unrest, a beautiful story can really help us sort out our feelings. It remind me of the lines by Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish: ‘ A poem in a difficult time / is beautiful flowers in a cemetery.’ It is in art we can find hope, and hope is important to hold onto. ‘Hope is exactly that, that’s all it is, a matter of how we deal with the negative acts towards human beings by other human beings in the world, remembering that they and we are all human, that nothing human is alien to us, the foul and the fair, and that most important of all we’re here for a mere blink of the eyes, that’s all.’And that is what the season of autumn reminds me of most: hope. It is a season of both endings and beginnings, it is a season of death and decay but it also bursts with color and reminds us to hold on. Winter is coming and we need to hold our inner warmth to get through and, as Smith shows us here, the connections we have with others is the greatest of warmths.‘We have to hope that the people who love us and who know us a little bit will in the end have seen us truly. In the end, not much else matters.’ Autumn is a powerful little book, so alive in prose that often feels like it is riffing, so deep in emotions that creep across the page so quietly, and so full of hope and heartfelt joy even in moments of bleakness. I’ve been meaning to read this for a few years and am glad I did it during the titular season, reading it while on a trip through Atlanta all alive in colorful leaves and the warm yet crisp weather of early November. This was an experience of a novel that dug deep in me and Ali Smith is an incredible writer. Once the season turns, I am eager to read the next book.5/5‘There's always, there'll always be, more story.

On‘Someday they’ll talk about this as a time when poems were written.’When everything seems to be falling apart, art is often made from the wreckage. One would wish that these times were not so, that the important prose, poems or songs hadn’t needed to vibrate through the hearts and souls of those in strife to calm the fears, rage, or grief. But, as German playwright and poet Bertolt Brecht once wrote, ‘In the dark times / will there also be singing? / Yes, there will also be singing. / About the dark times’ and part of survival is making the most of it all. And so we have Serhiy Zhadan’s How Fire Descends, bringing both new and selected poems from 2016 to the present to show how Zhadan has become—in the words of poet Ilya Kaminsky in the introduction—’one of the most beloved Ukrainian poets of his generation’. A popular musician in Ukraine as well as a poet (you can hear and watch his band Zhadan I Sobaky by clicking here), Zhadan has been a public symbol of searching for language to communicate and unite, as well as one of resistance under the Russian invasion. This volume selects poems all written during periods of conflict and honors the lives lost but also the spirit of survival while focusing his representation on the ordinary citizens and their lives in the streets during times of quiet as much as the mutilated landscape of wartime. With poetic attention to language, memory, and connection, Zhadan’s How Fire Descends is a powerful and defiant work but also an achingly beautiful one.""OF ALL LITERATURE""Of all literature and all languageI'm most interested in words used to address the dead.What if someone spoke a sentence that could stir the sonic field of death?Listen to me,you-deprived of the sweet receptors of song.Listen to me now, hear my whisper,distorted by the acoustics of nonexistence.Listen to me,you--marked by dialects, like scars throughout your lives, you-whose throats were scratched since childhood by the burningneedles of the alphabet,you-singers who could imitate bird calls.I know-it is unfair you cannot answerthe voices calling out to you from the mist today, you cannot say anything to defend yourself, you cannot protect the vacant land of night between memory and expectation.But language is important even after death, like the deepening of a riverbed,like the rise of heat for the first time in autumn in a great home.The only rule-grow roots, break through.The only chance-reach out for a branch, grab hold of a voice.There is nothing else.No one will remember you for your silence.No one but you can name the rivers nearby.You who are only echoes, you who are filled with silence, speak, speak now, speak as grass, speak as frost,speak as conductors of music.I was really taken by the way the concept of language becomes a predominant theme threaded throughout this collection. Words are Zhadan’s tools, both as a poet and frontman of a ska-punk band, and these poems frequently pay homage to them. This collection was born out of a period of war and grief, ‘so what does this man do?’ Zhadan asks before answering ‘he writes poems.’ I first discovered Zhadan in the anthology Words for War: New Poems from Ukraine and have been eager to find a collection of his work, so I was thrilled to discover this had come out in translation by Virlana Tkacz and Wanda Phipps. I was also thrilled that Ukrainian poet Ilya Kaminsky provided the lovely introduction (if you have not read his collection Deaf Republic I would highly recommend checking it out), and he gives an insightful overview of Zhadan’s life and works. He tells us how, under the newly independent Ukraine in the 1990’s ‘it was poets, not fiction writers or painters or musicians, who led public discourse in the arts.’ Zhadan, being an exceptional wordsmith already, quickly became a beloved public icon with his goal of ‘giving a voice to the forgotten people of the borderland region’ and harmonizing his language with the public consciousness in times of great change in their post-Soviet world. What I love best about this collection is the way language is seen as a way of connection for better understanding one another, for uniting, for bearing witness to the tragedies of war, and also holding hope for better days.It’s not voices that make up timebut punctuation,which creates an outline, gives usmoments to inhale and exhale,mapping outour connections,our differences,our similarities.’The harshness of war permeates these poems. Zhadan pays homage to what has been lost, asks to ‘remember every building and every street,’ and especially to honor those who have now gone.But he also says ‘let’s not be afraid,’ and to ‘speak now’ and these poems are a rebuttal to the cruelness of war and invasion and the depths of grief. ‘Let the cities that out out be with us,’ he writes, and reminds us that ‘when so much is taken away / something is always given in return.’ Yes, there is a great amount of pain and everyone has been tragically forced to learn ‘how suddenly the thread can break / how suddenly the confused heart can stop,’ but also that ‘pain and hope can return your lost sense of this world. / Give life to your essential being, give it meaning.’ Which is why language is so important here, it is memory, it is sharing, it is purpose and if we can hold on to it, all is never lost. ‘A language disappears when no one speaks of love,’ he warns, and with that there is still so much love and hope to be found in these poems.‘winter appears like a book of poemsNo one will ever publish.’ But the hardships here are not those of war, though we see how war is hardest on the people who are already suffering. Zhadan focuses on those living on the margins and shows how just being alive can be a struggle. The landscape is often shown as threatening here, with crumbling apartment blocks and winter where ‘we must battle the snow like we battle despair.’ Loneliness appears throughout and Zhadan ensures that nobody is left out of our field of attention. It’s a call to love all. If not, why write in the first place. But also it is a reminder that there is no peace without justice, and those who hurt the worst are often forgotten.The value of a poem grows in the wintertime,especially if the winter is hardespecially if the language is soft,especially if the times areMad.This is a really powerful collection. It’s a bit short and I wish it had a larger scope beyond his poems written under war in order to get a larger impression of his themes and stye, but I see why this is paired down for a singular message and effect. Zhadan has a lovely way with words, words that can really rally empathy and hope, and How Fire Descends is a beautiful book even in all the hardships represented within. It is often bleak, but it is also inspiring.4.5/5And summer will comeWith trains that return to the cityLike fishermen,Let them return with their catch,Let them carry into the cities our hope,Bitter as smoke,Bitter aswriting…...more",Notes are private!,13,100,1,not set,not set,"Nov 17, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/124933079-how-fire-descends

The stories are sort of a perfect balance, full of equal measures snark and heart that gives readers all the feels wrapped in a narrative exploding with action. But at the center is our rather reluctant hero—Murderbot themselves—who is so easy to empathize and often identify with but also tells us that even if we, too, would rather hide from the world and watch our favorite tv series, or hate everyone and don’t want to talk about our feelings, or even want to get up and face the world, we too could channel Murderbot and still be the incredible hero when the chips are down. I’ve followed this series with nothing but utter bliss and joy so when System Collapse released this week I knew it was one to drop everything and dive into. And I gotta say…OHMYGODA direct sequel to Network Effect, this volume is the second full-length in the series and the least stand-alone of them all (be advised if you were thinking of jumping in fresh here: don’t). Murderbot has faced a lot, and not just the violence of battles and betrayals but also a lot of emotional hardships as well as witnessing filthy-rich corporations commit filthy crimes with no regard for human life. And while Murderbot is slowly becoming more “human-like” and exploring the emotions it does not particularly enjoy admitting to, Murderbot is about to experience one of the most human feelings of them all: trauma. ‘since the thing that happened I don’t think I’ve had an emotion that wasn’t the visual equivalent of a wet blanket crumpled on a floor.’Martha Wells excels at exploring emotions and interpersonal(or non-‘people’) relationships through unique and intense storylines and this might be one of the deepest and most heart wrenching of them yet. I say “yet” because WE NEED MORE, KEEP THEM COMING PLEASE. I really enjoyed exploring Murderbot dealing with really heightened moments of vulnerability, with the text often reading ‘[redacted]’ to represent Murderbot repressing memories, feelings, etc. in a really heartfelt and empathetic exploration of mental health. ‘Am I making it worse? I think I’m making it worse.’Not that this story is all doom-and-gloom, quite the opposite really. Murderbot still delivers plenty of deadpan humor and more snark than there are stars in the sky. I was glad I had just finished Network Effect because this is a direct continuation of those events with the Barish-Estranza Corporation on it’s way to enslave the surviving colonists in order to strip-mine the planet. I enjoy how the ‘fuck the man’ vibes of Murderbot books tend to focus on issues of environmentalism and imperialism and how its just really Big corporations being really Big assholes.

Haunted by a trauma from earShame casts a lengthy shadow over the life of a young girl in Poor Deer, the brilliant second novel from Claire Oshetsky. Haunted by a trauma from early childhood that is muddled in misremembrance and living under a reputation marred by local rumor, Margaret Murphy has grown up under a pervading feeling of guilt that never lets her out of its grasp. In the dark hours of life we often turn to stories to make sense of our circumstances and light a candle of hope, yet Maragaret’s efforts to confess or seek atonement are under the scrutiny of the titular Poor Deer, a ghostly personification of guilt that kicks its hooves and demands only truth. All efforts to retell her past or imagine a brighter future are dashed under Poor Deer’s hooves and cast aside as ‘pretty lies.’ For Poor Deer ‘demands justice. She never forgives,’ and truth as well as the possibility of self-forgiveness or redemption become a mystery around which the novel spirals. This one truly amazed and affected me. A quiet yet powerful book, Oshetsky deftly balances the murky, oppressive weight of guilt that permeates the story with a lightness and grace of prose as they harness the atmosphere of fairy tales in order to propel the story on a feeling of whimsicality even despite the darkness. The vibes are outstanding, this is an unforgettable and utterly unique book. A heartfelt and heartwrenching investigation into the ways shame can linger a lifetime and reframe our realities, Poor Deer is ultimately a moving expression as to ‘why we press on, even after all hope is lost,’ and makes for an incredible reading experience.‘Wherever you go, I will go, and wherever you live, I will live; and your sorrows will be my sorrows, and I will never leave you.’While shame and guilt is often a frequent landscape to mine for literary insights, Oshetsky takes a rather unique approach that makes Poor Deer really unlike anything else I’ve ever read. It has a sense of magical realism, yet it reads with a fresh texture that defies easy categorization that touches upon the thematic insights into the ways truths sometimes don’t seem to line up. Poor Deer—a malapropism of the phrase “poor dear” Margaret hears after the tragedy of Agne’s death (several of these occur, humorously, in text such as Sister Bony Face being presumably Sister Boniface)—is a hulking, rather terrifying beast who personifies shame and the slope of her shoulders was the shape of grief itself.’ Always lurking in the corner or aggressively in Margaret’s face, Poor Deer is unsettling yet whimsical in a way only the best of A24 films could try to capture. ‘Are you my angel or my devil,’ young Margaret asks only to realize this dichotomy is beside the point for this beast.‘There's always a price to pay for our sins and follies, Bunny, and you'll be paying that price forever and a day.’This is often a difficult book to read as the focal point of tragedy is the horrific death of a 4 year old child (not a spoiler, we know right away but the mystery is a question of culpability) and the equally horrific treatment of the 4 year old who survives the day. It is truly shattering to experience a young girl feeling the rejection of her own mother as Oshetsky examines how one death can send a shockwave of destruction through two families and beyond (the element that Florence loses her best friend and potential love interest due to the tragedy is another really excellent thread in the story). Margaret, too young to fully comprehend, will now spend her life trying to sort out her shame and the events of that day, unable to feel forgiveness externally making self-forgiveness all the more fleeting. Set in a present as Margaret is 16 and writing her past from a motel room after picking up a stranger and her young child, most of the novel meanders through the whole of her life, bringing us back to the present where further lives may be in peril.‘Guilt is the worst of all. Guilt is the hollow heart of it. Guilt will follow her everywhere, two steps behind.’Margaret’s proximity to forgiveness and redemption is further exacerbated by her and her community's Catholicism, being lashed by proclamations of damnation and several symbolic moments of churches bearing down upon her. We also have the loss of a finger that possibly serves as a sort of mark of Cain symbolism. It becomes complex though as religion also offers a path for forgiveness and even when someone offers her that as an opportunity, Margaret feels unworthy because of what she has done.‘I expect great things of you, Margaret Murphy. Because you have suffered. There will come a day when you will get your chance. You will atone. You will save a life. You will change the world for the better. I believe it. I’ve prayed over it. One day God is going to put the chance right there in front of you.’Always the blockade and barrier, Poor Deer brushes aside any hope of forgiveness, even when Margaret attempts to confess. ‘God isn’t stronger than me,’ Poor Deer warns, ‘no one is stronger than me.’ In an interveiw with Shelbi Polk for Shondaland, Oshetsky discusses ‘growing up in a Catholic household, which was very mystical and very mixed with superstition,’ and how that informs the way the religious and fairy tale elements coalesce here as well as the way religions offers no solace for Margaret:‘My idea of God was very fairy tale-like. Sometimes it was mixed up with The Wizard of Oz. So, it seemed very natural to me to write that way. A child would have this fairy tale-like understanding of the world, and of God, and of sin and forgiveness…Catholicism has zero answers for this little girl. If you’re 4 and you kill someone, that’s not a sin. You’re not capable of mortal sin. So, how could she even confess it? It’s outside of the religion entirely. And yet, of course, she’s gonna carry that guilt forward forever. So, I wanted to explore that too, the way faith totally fails her. It has no answers for her.’Without anywhere else to turn, Margaret finds solace in storytelling. Despite the sorrow, her childhood has been full of ‘incantatory wonderings’ on the ways ‘words strung out like unmatched beads on a wire’ and she harnesses words like a tool to dig at an understanding of the past and an avenue to imagine possible futures. ‘You’ve told it all wrong again — you little monster.’Neil Gaiman—in a paraphrase of G.K. Chesterton—wrote that ‘fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.’ We see this here and the ways storytelling, such as this dark fairy tale-esque novel, is a way for Margaret to ‘finally beginning to figure out how to untie the impossible knot of a problem that had tied me up, for all the years of my life.’ Even if Poor Deer demands she rewrite again and again to finally embrace the truth, each new attempt at individual pieces gives her a deeper understanding of the whole.‘When I finally did find a way to untie that impossible knot, then all the most important questions in life would be answered. Why we love. Why we suffer. How we make sense of the happenings in our lives. The stories we tell ourselves to make it through to the next day. Why we press on, even after all hope is lost.’When are ‘pretty lies’ or ‘pretty stories’ a harmful lie and when are they a solace that helps better understand truth from the abstract. It is like the story Margaret hears of The Little Match Girl where it ends in death but the girl going to God is a solace, yet when Margaret insists Agnes is an angel she is called a fool and told Agnes ‘is in the ground.’ Is one or the other a better framing, and is Poor Deer’s insistence on a life for a life a better redemption than one Margaret can dream up?‘No one had ever told Margaret that they exdpected great things of her before. She couldn’t change the past, but maybe one day she could make up for it.’A short novel that will truly bore deep into your heart and shake you up inside, Claire Oshetsky’s Poor Deer is an absolute success. Often ambiguous as is seeks out the elusive answers to its own mysteries, this is an emotional ride that plunges you deep in examinations of grief and shame. Though don’t worry, you will arrive on the other side much better for it. While it does hit you with really heavy scenes it is all interspersed with rather comic vignettes that really break up the weight of things. With incredible prose and a fascinating narrative, Poor Deer is a must read that will haunt me for a long time to come.5/5‘Even in the most terrible chapters of my life, I’ve always known a certain savage beauty.’...more",Notes are private!,51,231,1,"Jan 16, 2024","Feb 26, 2024","Nov 16, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/127823311-poor-deer

Like a relay race, the past passes us the baton and we must make do with it while we can before passing it off to the next generation. We also pass along our stories to remind those of where we have been and hope they can serve as guidance in the future. This all truly comes alive in Yaa Gyasi’s staggeringly impressive debut novel, Homegoing where we see how ‘history is storytelling’ and generations inform upon one another. The novel charts family lineages of two half-sisters in Ghana from the fracture point—one is sold into the slave trade and sent to the United States while the other remains in Ghana—to the present day with the sin of slavery casting a horrific ripple through all of history as we encounter Jim Crow laws, the Civil Rights Movement, or dealing with the effects of colonialism and fighting towards Ghanaian independence. Homegoing is jaw-droppingly gorgeous, told in a series of short stories that proceed across the generations and show the scars of history and trauma in both its immediate and inherited forms. While the paths separate, there is always a subtle pull towards home, towards Ghana, towards family, that is felt in every chapter. Gyasi crafts a brilliant tale rife with symbolism and yearning, and one I was lucky enough this evening to hear her speak about in my hometown.  [image]I’m late to the party on this one—Homegoing arrived on the scene in 2016 to immediate accolades—and there is likely little left to say about this gem of a novel that hasn’t been said far more eloquently before, but I really enjoyed reading this as part of our community Big Read and hearing Gyasi talk about it. The novel, she explained, was inspired by her own trip to Ghana during her college years (Gyasi was born in Ghana but grew up in Alabama) and was her attempt to examine the ‘liminal identity’ she felt due to her heritage and current home. She told us that Willie was the character she admired most, yet it was H. who was her favorite to write, drawing from vast research on the Reconstruction Era in the United States where ‘no one forgets that they were once captive, even if they are now free,’ and the creeping realization that while free, they were still very much captive. H. finds himself forced to work the mines where 'the convicts working the mines were almost all like him. Black, once slave, once free, now slave again.' These sorts of realizations permeates the novel on both sides of the ocean as the effects of slavery, capitalism, and colonialism reverberate in each branch of the family tree.‘They would just trade one type of shackles for another, trade physical ones that wrapped around wrists and ankles for the invisible ones that wrapped around the mind.’Scars are highly symbolic in this novel, both physical and emotional, and we see how the ripples through history are always threatening to wash even the surest of personal journeys out to sea. Generational trauma plays a large part in Homegoing, being just one of many aspects of the family legacies as they deal with complicity in the slave trade, racism, poverty and all the while fight to keep afloat and hope the next generation can benefit from their struggles.‘We believe the one who has power. He is the one who gets to write the story. So when you study history, you must ask yourself, Whose story am I missing? Whose voice was suppressed so that this voice could come forth? Once you have figured that out, you must find that story too. From there you get a clearer, yet still imperfect, picture.’The collective narrative here is quite powerful and certainly more than the sum of its parts. Each chapter is both another leg in the legacy journey yet also feels self contained enough to have appeared as a stand-alone story. This keeps the book moving at a rather rapid pace with tension continuously rising and falling to pull you along. With each character we get a better depiction of the effects of slavery and racism, and even those left in Ghana feel it. Gyasi confronts the legacy of the slave trade in how an aspect of colonialism was to turn people against each other and sell each other for a short term gain and a larger benefit of the colonizers who would continuously keep them oppressed for generations to come. ‘Evil begets evil. It grows,’ Gyasi writes, ‘it transmutes, so that sometimes you cannot see that the evil in the world began as the evil in your own home.’An aspect I found particularly admirable was how, despite the short stay you have with each character, Gyasi manages to craft them in a way that displays how nuanced people really are. There are no flat characters here and we often see them struggling with conflicting ideas. Faith, for instance, is a large theme with many of these characters. Religion is shown as being an arm of colonialism, yet we also have Willie for whom her conviction in her faith is part of her strength. The conflicting messages of symbols serves to show how nothing in life is ever truly simple and everything is tainted in the sins of the past in some way, shape or form. It really captures the idea of the liminal identity that Gyasi speaks of.‘There's more at stake here than just slavery, my brother. It's a question of who will own the land, the people, the power. You cannot stick a knife in a goat and then say, Now I will remove my knife slowly, so let things be easy and clean, let there be no mess. There will always be blood.’ Each character must deal with the past, but also the present and as the novel progresses we see that for each way things may be improving (Marcus and Marjorie, for instance, are able to attend Stanford) in many ways things have remained the same or mutated into new forms of oppression. Misogynoir—the intersection of racism and misogyny—is largely felt into the present, as are moments of homophobia. History is an endless battle and often the characters become quite beleaguered by it all. This is often a rather brutal novel, not fading away from violence, and just when you think something good might happen, Gyasi pulls the rug out from under you. Yet, collectively, this becomes a very beautiful and moving story. The moments on the beach in Ghana with Marjorie and Marcus are fleetingly felt by the characters, but the reader sees the connection and significance of the stone in ways that say sometimes this is enough. Sometimes things bend towards beauty even in the harshest of worlds. ‘This is the problem of history. We cannot know that which we were not there to see and hear and experience for ourselves. We must rely upon the words of others.’Gyasi’s Homegoing is quite the achievement of fiction, making history into a brilliant and multi-faceted tapestry that probes at great evils but also champions the human spirit of endurance. A moving real, one that will not likely ever be forgotten.5/5‘Weakness is treating someone as though they belong to you.

Which sounds like a great way to re-frame the story, add in that the woodcutter father has realized the environmental destruction of his industry and decides to make a change and the narrator’s name has been refigured from Gretel to Greta as a nod to environmental activist Greta Thunberg and it seems like something I would love even if it is heavy-handed. Alas, this was a big swing and a miss for me, which pains me to say as Winterson is my favorite author. It’s pretty zany and while I do enjoy the whole move of Winterson into the quirky aunt telling kid’s stories that are all over the place and super stick-it-to-the-man, this just feels like too much going on at once and jumping from one thing to the next without enough to really hold it all together. The little illustrations are cool though:  [image]All that said, this was still worth the read and I like a lot of the actual messages here. I feel like children’s stories, especially fairy tales, are a great vessel for social criticisms where you can be more heavy handed but this felt a bit over-caffeinated in its telling instead of being charming like it was intended. I’ve seen Winterson pull it off elsewhere and even the goofiest of stories in her Christmas Days collection land better. It just tries to pull together too many things and becomes so far from the original fairy tale that it is likely to lose people. We have the whole environmental story, which would have worked well on its own, but then it ties into the story of the aunt eating everything and then later into a twist on the gingerbread house story with a witch and its just…too much. The aunt being an ogre is kind of fun (it does have a bit of a fatphobia element that I’ve sometimes noticed in her earlier works) but its almost too silly. The aim is children though so perhaps it works better at that age. I do like, however, how it is a clear metaphor for greed: ‘The point of life is to eat as much as possible, make as much money as possible, go on vacation as much as possible, have as many clothes as possible, buy thousands of household appliances, two new cars every year, a Jacuzzi in the yard, and a Luxury-Level Executive Home. Not oats, lettuce, and a bicycle’I also liked how the witch has a redemptive arc here (shoutout to witches) and it isn’t her that is evil but the Gingerbread House itself, being made out of an addictive gingerbread. It’s all a scheme of the ogre that the witch has become trapped in, so I’m pretty into Winterson doing a metaphor to mock things like MLMs or the horrors of people like the Sackler family getting people addicted on pills in order to keep the profits coming in.But overall, this just didn’t land beyond a few chuckles. I’ve enjoyed others in this series though and I think its all a cool idea, and I love Winterson.

This collection is startling yet comforting, poems to wrap around you like a favorite filthy blanket as you sweat out a hangover. I loved them. Pig is an extraordinary work that cycles around the titular animal, which becomes a transcendent and multi-faceted symbol for Sax’s prose to dissect in order to examine ideas of society, history, desire, State and religious violence, queerness and other aspects of identity in a realm where the boundaries between animal and human begin to blend. It is a very creative collection that keeps to its central image of the pig without ever overplaying the idea and arriving from a variety of continuously fresh and provocative angles of insight. From looking at pigs in history and pop culture to showing the symbol of the pig as an “unclean” animal as an expression of those outcast from heteronormative and other cultural norms, Pig is an arresting and moving collection of poems that is a joy to return to again and again to sift through the impressively layered messages within.

Sax is incredible and the playfulness of this collection really shines through and makes for an enjoyable read even in the bleakest of moments within it. My heart is also certainly won by the vast collection of fictional pigs referenced in this collection, from classics such as ‘odysseus’s men who chose to stay, to modern references such as the ‘30-50 feral hogs that run into my yard within 3-5 mins while my small kids play’ that gave us all a laugh on twitter. We even have a poem celebrating Miss Piggy as ‘great porcine drag queen…seminal queer iconoclast!’ I enjoyed catching a reference, such as in the poem Three Stories with ‘in the end, the children come to learn, the beast lives in them.’ (Lord of the Flies) or ‘in the end, it is the animal’s proximity to language that saves him.’ (Charlotte's Web) and the book begins with a quote from Animal Farm and concludes with Porky Pig’s sign off ‘th-th-th-that’s all folks!’ Though perhaps my favorite are the titles that quote famous pigs, such as the Piglet (of the Hundred Acre Woods) quote in the above poem or another with a quote from Charles M. Schulz’s Pigpen: ‘I have affixed to me the dirt of countless ages. Who am I to disturb history?’History is indeed alive in this collection, such as the opening poem which quickly recounts the history of pigs and their importance to society and ends with a warning of pigs inheriting the earth once society is gone. The first half of the book spends a lot of time on historical references, including a poem on the H1N1 virus that speaks towards ‘the next great illness to wing or swim or sing its way towards us.’ We also have Experiments, which repeats the poem twice with the second told in reverse, looking at a scene of a classroom where a pig dissection was interrupted by 9/11 happening. Though at the end of this section the pig and reader become one as ‘the shohet / sharpens his blade & turns / his attention at last toward / the reader’ and we begin to see the animal and man merge. In Authors Note we see Sax begin to blur ideas of degradation and desire—a running theme of these poems is embracing the filth and the pig inside us all, especially as a queer person that is already considered “unclean” by society—and Sax writes ‘once did look into the eye of a pig…and saw reflected back the blurred terror of this american world.’ This dredges up the numerous references to State violence, ostracization and exploitation that fill these pages as we begin to see that the pig is also us. ‘Who hasn’t lived,’ he asks us, ‘unclean / cast in a herd / drowned in the sea?’The social condemnations in this collection hit hard. We have Etymology, which examines the language of guns, and language is another symbol that recurs through the text. ‘in an effort to save a dying language, ’ he writes in one of the several poems with Piglet’s Very Small Animal quote as the title, ‘we stockpile books / balanced on the edge of legibility / in the basement of a modern building / paid for by the dying / apply for grants to teach this old alphabet to children.’ A few lines later he discusses a library collecting poems from children in countries under assault and that ‘this project is funded by the same government / that bankrupted their soil & currency.’ Language is our fight against our extinction, our way to pass on our memories, to communicate, to love, and for any poet language is also the center of their work. How tragic the imagery of funding the preservation of words from people we are also slaughtering. Like pigs, he reminds us. Though perhaps the strongest statements against State violence come in his poem Antizionist Abecedarian, a poem that Poetry Foundation objected to and banned any s of this very book from being published on their website for being critical of Israel bombing Palestine (Sax is Jewish, which comes up often in this collection). (2000 writers have recently signed to boycott Poetry Foundation for their banning s of this collection of poetry. Read about it HERE. Here is the poem:after you've finished building your missiles & after your borders collapse under the weight of their own split databases every worm in thisfertile & cursedground will be its own country. home never was a place in dirt or eveninside the skin but rather just exists in language. let me explain. my people kiss books as a form of prayer. if dropped we lift them to our lips & mouth an honest & uncomplicated apology—nowhere on earth belongs to us.once a man welcomed me home as i entered the old city so ipulled out a book of poems to show him my papers—my queer city of paper—my people's ink running through my blood. settlers believe land can be possessed—they carve their names into firearms &use this to impersonate the dead—we arevisitors here on earth. who but men blame the angels for the wild exceptionalism of men?yesterday a bird flew through an airport & i watched that borderzone collapse under its wings.Once again we see how language is vital to this work and to us as people. It connects, borders separate. Violence is everywhere in this collection and Sax shows how we are asked to turn away from thinking about it, ‘don’t worry, the market loves you,’ he jokes in Capital. A few lines here:the market wants you but not your opinionsdoesn’t want you to inquire into what money isthis little piggy went to market and returned to its repossessed duplexthis little piggy went to market and came back with half its meat harvestedthis little piggy went into a field and became the marketvendors are currently hedging stock in its tenderloinalgorithms are being written out in back fat.O market O makerIt is no wonder Sax writes ‘it’s clear the future does not bode well for the living.’ These poems move deathward, towards the end of civilization and humankind and asks ‘what will be left.’ He proposes ‘dance with me a moment / late in this last extinction // that you are reading this / must be enough’ which is a rather beautiful sentiment that reminds us of the power of communion and companionship with one another, even when all seems lost. What will be left is the pig.‘O bless all this life thrashing against death’sgarish precipice, O bless me lord, bless me doorman,bless me cormorant & courtship & torture & husbandry,give me enough compression to remember i once lived here& i’ll accept in the end not even death will wife me’Though not all is bleak here, even when it is. There is a lot of beauty here, even beauty in the degradation of it all. He writes of love, people who make his throat filled with flowers, ‘such beautiful flowers / i hardly have the words.’ And these poems are gorgeous in that way as well, in the way that Mahmoud Darwish wrote ‘ A poem in a difficult time. is beautiful flowers in a cemetery.’ Thank you for the flowers, Sam Sax. Pig is an extraordinary collection and I will be reading this many many times more.5/5Okay but also check out this poem he does in place of the notes about the Font that appear at the end of books:COLOPHONthis book is setin a history of speaking.a font is morethan baptizing waterthan an oil reservoirin a lamp. it asksonly: do you knowwhat i mean? & if not speakit back to me soi might understandmore clearly...more",Notes are private!,7,104,1,"Nov 10, 2023","Nov 10, 2023","Nov 10, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/101145323-pig

This is especially true when the celebrity icon is a woman and one As much as society loves to build up an idol they love to watch one fall and burn. This is especially true when the celebrity icon is a woman and one that can become a symbol of castigation such as the case of Britney Spears. Having been molded into an icon that was both highly sexualized yet also virginal and youthful, Spears skyrocketed to stardom and made many rich folks far richer but then that same celebrity image was turned into a weapon against her. But who is Spears behind the image that was created of her? ‘It’s time for me not to be someone who other people want,’ she writes in The Woman in Me, her new memoir, ‘it’s time to actually find myself.’ While it reads like a slow burn horror of a woman exploited, shamed and imprisoned by those closest to her, Spears never comes across as angry and the book feels less like a tell-all than it does a search for who she that is asking the same question her fans have been asking while pouring over her Instagram for clues: is she okay? This book is also an tragic example in the long history of how fragile women's rights over financial and bodily control are and that mental health has long been used against them as a way to remove those rights. A quick read that seems to fly through events at the same pace that her career seemed to be moving, it is hard to not feel compassion and sadness for Spears as she finds her voice and gives us insight into her mind during the whirlwind of a life that practically made as many headlines as the number of records she sold. ‘I wanted to hide, but I also wanted to be seen,’ she says, ‘both things could be true,’ and here we can finally see Spears on her terms as she deserves to be seen.‘Music stopped the noise, made me feel confident, and took me to a pure place of expressing myself exactly as I wanted to be seen and heard.’Britney Spears was everywhere when I was growing up, she was impossible to not know and even if you didn’t want to know you couldn’t escape the media’s narrative of her rise and unraveling. I was the right age where I could pretend I didn’t love her music and that I only knew every lyric to every song because my younger sister was a huge fan, but lets face it: Britney was an icon, her music was catchy, she WAS pop culture. There’s no way I’m not reading her memoir, I’m too invested in this story simply from being alive and into music when I was. It’s lovely to know she has been freed from her conservatorship, where her own father and lawyers took complete control over her for 13 years, but the whole story seems a large metaphor for what celebrity means in capitalism: you are less you and more a product to be controlled by corporate lawyers and marketing execs (remember when John Foggerty lost a lawsuit suing him over plagiarising the sounds of John Foggerty, since his voice and style were technically owned by a record company?). While this book leaves a long list of names to be angry and appalled at, Spears never comes across as angry. More sad, almost apologetic, and merely telling what happened. In fact so much of this feels dispassionate, as if she is tired beyond the capacity for rightful rage. But also it seems a lesson long beaten into her that women don’t get to be angry, that anything other than passive acceptance makes her a villain. Which is truly tragic and so much of this book reminds us of the long history of misogyny, of policing women’s bodies, words, tone, actions, and any other aspect of their lives. And how, because of this, women are shamed into feeling they deserve the abuse, as Spears shows when she writes 'the sadness and the loneliness that would hit me felt like my fault somehow, like I deserved unhappiness and bad luck.' Which is just so heartbreaking.‘Why did my managers work so hard to claim I was some kind of young-girl virgin even into my twenties?’Much has been written about the way Spears image was to take a young, virginal image of a girl and sexualize her for the sake of men’s lusts. She has often been discussed in comparison with Dolores Haze from Nabokov’s Lolita for the sexualization of a teenage girl (such as the music video with Spears in a risque school girl outfit dancing in the halls of a high school, though Spears admits here that the outfit was her idea). In her article on the recent documentary series, Framing Britney Spears, Grace O’Neil writes that ‘Britney is Dolores and we—the public who voraciously consumed her—are a pack of Humberts,’ and that her image was a “safe” way for men to satisfy a taboo lust. Though Tavi Gevinson, in an article you should definitely read as it is not just about Spears but power dynamics in general, points out that the documentary is ‘ eager to characterize Spears’s early image as an expression of female power rather than the corporation-sanctioned sexualization of a 16-year-old’ Which is a key thing, it was an image created to give the feeling that she was in control and sexually liberated, but as we all saw, it was also the way she was demonized and we should ‘engage the messier implications of the virginal-but-sexy archetype: Here is a girl who can perform sex for an audience’s benefit, but who, thank God, has not yet been tainted by experience. America’s response to Spears was puritanical, but so was the fantasy her image fulfilled.’ We also see in this book how breaking from the 'fantasy' is a reason to condemn her, but also remove her agency. It should be noted that the ""hysteria"" was a mental disorder that was attributed to women (until 1980), and was often used as a way to strip women of their rights and autonomy. Being labeled as ""crazy"" did just this to Spears.Spears shows how so much of her life was controlled by a very calculated misogyny, such as the Rolling Stones photoshoot with David LaChapelle that captilazied on the sexualization of a teenage girl. As Gevinson argues that Spears was never in control, and this was also calculated in order to allow people to turn a blind eye from the ways she was abused. ‘There is no need to believe it’s either Everything was Britney’s choice, and therefore she was always a sex-positive feminist or Nothing was Britney’s choice, and the evil adults made all her decisions. Both assertions sound desperate to protect her respectability — another version of her purity, in fact — as a prerequisite for compassion. They remind me of how readily conversations about abuse and assault focus on the moral character of the victim in order to confirm that they have indeed been victimized.’The first half of Spears book very quickly takes us through her career, though it is less an autopsy of her stardom and more a litany of harms. If this were a film we would cut directly from her telling Ed McMahon on Star Search at age 10 that she doesn’t have a boyfriend because ‘boys are mean’ to a montage of the her relationships with Justin Timeberlake and Kevin Federline. ‘Looking back, I think that both Justin and Kevin were very clever. They knew what they were doing, and I played right into it,” she writes, and shows how her desire to be loved became an opening to be exploited (OKAY but the moment she got to Timberlake being all ‘let me play you some soothing guitar’ as shes crying on the floor from the pain of her abortion she was very much pressured into having--not great JT). We also see how she was just access to fame for Federline and that he had no interest in being a father. And it all ends poorly for Spears, especially once the conservatorship begins. And if there is anyone to truly be mad at, it is her parents and management that failed to protect her and instead capitalized on all the drama.‘ I was so beaten down by all of it that I just surrendered.’All these events happened at a time of really heightened celebrity in the US spurred by channels like MTV that shifted the focus away from the actual music and into a celebration of privileged lifestyles. While shows like Jackass turned men with massive drug, alcohol and mental health problems into household names to laugh WITH while celebrity women became icons to laugh AT (and shamed for alcohol, drugs, sex or mental health struggles). Everyone seemed way too eager to see Spears have a public breakdown, everyone was excited for cameras to capture the next Lindsey Lohan binge, everyone enjoyed calling Paris Hilton dumb a bit too much to consider it harmless fun. Being joyful at someone’s supposed shortcomings is never cool but it became a commodity, and much of this seemed to be orchestrated to mock women who rose to stardom almost as some gross patriarchal lesson. It happens all the time but it was practically the focus of US entertainment aimed at youth culture. And it’s because the industry saw them all as products not people.That’s why reading this felt like a damning indictment against the way patriarchal societies objectify, commoditize, consume and control women. Britney was caged into a message to young women to be commoditized, to be docile and nice, to be exploited and happy for it or be punished. In her book Entitled: How Male Privilege Hurts Women, Dr. Kate Manne lays out the various ways men feel entitled to women’s bodies, labor, affection, etc. and this book practically goes through each of her points to check the boxes. On women’s bodies, for example:‘It was always incredible to me that so many people felt so comfortable talking about my body. It had started when I was young. Whether it was strangers in the media or within my own family, people seemed to experience my body as public property: something they could police, control, criticize, or use as a weapon. My body was strong enough to carry two children and agile enough to execute every choreographed move perfectly onstage. And now here I was, having every calorie recorded so people could continue to get rich off my body.’There is a similar message in Emily Ratajkowski’s memoir My Body. Sure, people will say that is the price of fame, but that is not okay and is just a way to hold an umbrella for abuse. Hop on social media right now and you’ll see plenty of people shaming Britney for this book and especially for having aborted the baby without acknowledging the emotional pressures put on her to do so or the way her whole life she was coached to not have any agency. She talks about how she notices the questions Timberlake was asked in interviews were very different than the type she got, which often asked about her body. It also plays into Dr. Manne’s idea on himpathy—that is the way people tend to sympathize with a man over a woman even when he is the abuser and demand she prove she isn’t somehow complicit in her own abuse—which we see in the way society rallied around Justin and his Cry Me A River song and began to look at Spears as a heartless heartbreaker when in reality I was shattered…I don’t think Justin realised the power he had in shaming me. I don’t think he understands to this day.’ And when things started to come apart, she was labeled as crazy and deserving of scorn instead of recognizing the mental health issues ‘because I now know that I was displaying just about every symptom of perinatal depression: sadness, anxiety, fatigue.’What did anyone expect when she was treated as unable to take care of herself and like a perpetual 17 year old sex icon her whole life. ‘I’d begin to think in some ways like a child,’ she admits. But it was also a rage against the world.‘Shaving my head was a way of saying to the world: Fuck you. You want me to be pretty for you? Fuck you. You want me to be good for you? Fuck you. You want me to be your dream girl? Fuck you. I’d been the good girl for years.’This book very well explores the way she was built into this image and then silenced for breaking it. And the latter half about the 13 years under the conservatorship are horrifying. ‘For thirteen years, I wasn't allowed to eat what I wanted, to drive, to spend my money how I wanted, to drink alcohol or even coffee,’ she says, but now she has ‘freedom to do what I want to do has given me back my womanhood. In my forties, I'm trying things for what feels like the first time. I feel like the woman in me was pushed down for so long.’ I’m glad to see she is able to feel she has a voice and search for what freedom means for her, but also for who she is. This is a quick read, a sad one too, but it is nice to hear her side and remember how harsh society is on women. Especially the ones they prop up for profit and then profit off of watching them burn down. I hope for nothing but the best and inner peace for Spears.⅘‘I've started to experience the riches of being an adult woman for the first time in many years. I feel like I've been underwater for so long, only rarely swimming up to the surface to gasp for air and a little food. When I regained my freedom, that was my cue to step out onto dry land and, any time I want, to take vacations, sip a cocktail, drive my car, go to a resort, or stare out at the ocean.’...more",Notes are private!,78,438,1,not set,not set,"Nov 09, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/63133205-the-woman-in-me

Like massive arms and massive hands, which is how you know he is packing a massive…rook to knight combo. That’s how chess works, right? I’m not really sure but that is what is so great about Check & Mate because even if you previously had no interest in chess this book is so charming and energetic about the game that you’ll have a great time no matter what. I am absolute dog shit at chess—my phone app has beaten me enough to accept this—but I am delighted that Hazelwood said “you know what should be sexy? CHESS!” Hazelwood has made a name for herself with a wildly successful series of spicy adult novels featuring young women navigating fields typically gatekept by men and finding romance and here she enters the realm of YA where 18 year old Mallory returns to the world of chess, rusty from a long hiatus inflicted by shame and keeping her family afloat. Now she must face-off against misogynistic expectations and chess world champion slash thirst trap icon Nolan “I swear I’m not an Adam Driver Insert” Sawyer. The “Kingkiller”. The man with the big, meaty, sexy hands (remember this). But also the man she embarrassed by defeating in her first match, making her the new, hot topic about Chess World. Hazelwood writes with bubbly wit and while the constant corporate branding name drops might make one wonder if this book is collecting ad revenue, it's a fresh and fun rom-com that deals with themes of teen parentification, friendship anxieties and being thrust into a judgemental spotlight where the personal life you can barely keep from falling apart is suddenly the topic of social media speculation. Check & Mate is as corny as it is horny but, honestly, it's also just a good time that knows its audience well.‘His movements, when he touches the pieces, are precise, economical, strong. I hate myself for noticing that.’Girl, trust me, we all noticed that. Anyways, I found the premise of this to be quite promising and it lives up to it. It’s almost interesting enough to uphold the reluctant rivals to lovers engine that drives the story. While most realistic-fiction YA tends towards a high school setting, it was refreshing to see this being set in chess tournaments and libraries (‘God bless libraries.’ Agreed). Part of the premise is that chess is now the Big Thing thanks to Tiktok and Sawyer, the bad boy of chess, for inspiring a lot of content around his looks and temper tantrums (Kylo Ren behavior…), which, sure, I could believe that happening in this post-The Queen’s Gambit-fame, social media influenced world. And the youth getting really into chess is a super cool idea, I’d love that to happen. It also helps raise the stakes in this book because chess matches are covered like they are the Super Bowl and the cash prize is enormous. And so are Sawyer’s arms. The financial opportunities are key to our gal Mal’s motivations, and shd has more or less vanished from her own life in order to raise her aggressively-tween sisters and care for her sick mother. Hazelwood presents the hardships of a parentified teen who feels cornered by her own life that has been bent towards constant service of others to the point that taking time for herself is guilt-inducing. But all of chess is cloaked in a sense of shame for her and she hadn’t played in years, though the reason behind this is something Hazelwood only teases until the big reveal late in the novel (though its so hinted at I doubt the reason will come as a surprise to anyone after the first 20 pages). Hazelwood captures being burnt out and frustrated well while also making detangling all her insecurities a coming-of-age narrative nestled into the overall plot. ‘There’s lots to consider. My feelings about chess, for one, which I cannot disentangle from my feelings for Dad. They are twisted, knotted together. There’s pain. Regret. Nostalgia. Guilt. Hate. Above all, there’s anger. So much anger inside me. Mountains of it, entire blasing landscapes without a single furyless corner in them.’The YA genre suits Hazelwood well, being able to turn on the firehose of emotions and make the more immature or quippy moments read as more age appropriate as it does in some of the adult novels Hazelwood often gets compared with. I enjoyed that the characters are older than most YA, being in that sort of anxiety-ridden purgatory between high school and “being an adult”. A great example of this is Mallory’s friendship with Easton and the interplay of Mallory feeling FOMO as Easton goes off to college while Easton worries she is being similarly phased out due to Mallory’s rising-star adventures. While Hazelwood is known for being pretty spicy she tones it back a lot here to suit a YA audience in ways that never feel like self-censorship. There’s still a lot of waistband grabbing (those big, manly hands…) and brief steamy moments though its mostly fade-to-black. Perhaps the lack of sex in the book also helped focus on ensuring the plot held up and was engaging. Truthfully, I couldn’t put this down.Still, I liked these characters—the dialog is fun and snarky without feeling like it needs to only be one-liners to the point of absurdity—and while Mal and Sawyer’s relationship sometimes seems to conveniently progress despite them really only talking about chess its all pretty cute. Sawyer’s character works well as an example of misconstrued perceptions on a person and behind the mystique he is actually quite a lovable person who treats Mallory well. He’s also possibly an Adam Driver-cast insert as both Driver and Star Wars get a call-out in text. This seems to be Hazelwood’s thing and The Love Hypothesis began as Star Wars Reylo fanfiction in a STEM field and minus Kylo Ren’s penchant for war crimes. Plus we have the whole Mallory as a sort of “chosen one” who defeats temper tantrum boy who has trained for years which isn’t NOT the plot of Force Awakens if you squint at it. Though Sawyer’s grandfather and his mental health issues come up, thankfully he wasn’t notable for having committed a genocide. Have I mentioned that this guy is hulking? ‘Most women in chess decide to skip these events and complete in women-only tournaments. I bet you’re wondering why.’While Sawyer is supportive and sweet, the rest of the chess world is a minefield of misogyny for Mallory to navigate. Journalists love to ask her ‘how does it feel to be a women in chess?’ and her first experience with Koch—essentially the villain of the book—is him asking if she beat Sawyer by dressing evocatively. Good on Hazelwood for addressing the extra pressures and judgment on a woman in male-coded fields while inspiring young women to embrace their hobbies and strengths and achieve in whatever they want to do. But also good on her for making Koch so fun to hate. I mean, this guy is basically some teenage Ben Shapiro character twiddling his evil mustache (okay Koch doesn’t have a mustache but you get the idea) and being insufferable to everyone. You’ll want to punch him. A few times.There are a lot of complaints online about the use of slang and pop culture references here, which is whatever. Does it seem like a sort of eye rolling technique to be “this is how teens talk right?”, sure. But I do want to start a conspiracy theory that books will have product inserts as the new form of tv commercials because Hazelwood name-checks so many corporate brands and highly-specific product names that it feels weird. It’s like when the kid is sleep-talking brands in White Noise and I kept joking that this book is generating ad revenue to keep the publishing industry rolling.After having read Colleen Hoover and Emily Henry this year, I figured I should complete the trifecta and read an Ali Hazelwood and I’m pretty glad I did. Overall, this was pretty fun. It moves at a quick pace (shocking for a story about chess games, I know) and has some pretty fun ups-and-downs while following a fairly formulaic romance plotline. Sure I could probably nitpick stuff about plot holes or whatever, but at the end of the day that seems beside the point to me. I’m judging this based on my rule I’ve just now invented called the A Knights Tale Rule: believability is beside the point when you came to laugh along to a story about Heath Ledger looking great on a horse. This is fun and cute and I had a pleasant time reading it. It also achieves its main goal: making chess seem sexy. So excuse me, I’m going to go get my ass kicked by my chess app again and pretend I’m Gary Kasparov playing against Deep Blue. 3.5/5 “Chess is a bad idea.”“Why?”“Look where it got me.”“It got you here.

You are not safe—you never were.’You’ve likely heard of the Trolley Problem, a thought experiment that asks us to consider the ethical dilemma of sacrificing one person in order to save a large group of people. French author Aliette de Bodard constructs an apocalyptic world where such a choice has been made in her short story Lullaby for a Lost World (you can read it HERE), a story she calls her ‘answer to Ursula K. Le Guin’s The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas.’ Told from the perspective of the last girl who was sent to her death in order to uphold the safety of a giant mansion in which The Master is said to keep the numerous residents cared for, our ghostly narrator is stirred to revenge upon watching the next girl being sentenced to death. Knowing the Le Guin connection was almost detrimental despite it being what made me eager to read this as where Le Guin achieves a staple of short fiction through the way her tale confronts the reader with an ethical quandery, this falls short by being merely a narrative without enough grounding in its own trolley problem set up to feel like anything more than a cheap, violent revenge story. That said, Aliette de Bodard excels at creating an unnerving atmosphere and delivers some gorgeous writing that make this story, which can be read in about five minutes, still worth a glance.There is a line in the poem Questionnaire by Wendell Berry that asks ‘For the sake of goodness, how much / evil are you willing to do?’ If one thinks about it, one must question at what point does any horrible deed make any “good” result no longer “good.” Le Guin probes this quite well in her story, Omelas, and I feel like that question is part of what gives the story its grit: the people are aware and complicit and because some have walked away we can really set up ethical boundaries to test our our opinions against. The problem with Lullaby for a Lost World is the level of complicity is very uncertain, just that once the narrator has gone to her death she realizes ‘it’s too high a price,’ in order to uphold ‘the tapestry of lies that made your old, careless life possible.’ Not that ignorance of the horrors can wash your hands of complicity—and we can certainly understand why the end paints with broad strokes of rage and survivorless rampage—but when positioning this as an answer to Omelas it feels cheap without the awareness that people have recognized they are choosing the sacrifice and have walked away. Without that it loses the spark that made Omelas so cutting.I can enjoy a good gory action scene, which this story certainly delivers, and I even think the random and completely unexplained unicorn transformation (YEP) is kind of awesome, but it also felt like way too much without really earning it. If that makes sense? Was it just wish fulfillment? Also (view spoiler)[if the entire rampage was trigger by her anger that yet another girl was to be killed to protect the mansion, why did she first brutally maul and then stomp upon that girl giving her just as painful and violent a death as the villain? It felt super unnecessary. (hide spoiler)] But also aside from the one conversation that we see The Master is grifting off their deaths, theres just not enough explanation of how anything is working to really make any of the punches land. The sudden violence being very graphic just comes across like explosions in a Michael Bay film at this point. Still, I have to say it was worth the read and I wonder if I would have enjoyed it more had I not known the Le Guin connection (or even picked up on the intended connection, which is pretty loose). Eerie, violent, and not a bad way to spend 5 minutes but also not a great way either. Definitely read the Le Guin story if you haven't, but for another take on Omelas, I think I'd still recommend N.K. Jemisin, The Ones Who Stay and Fight (read it here) over this one.2.5/5‘There is no rest. There is no forgiveness.

Polk plays with this quite effectively in her story St. Valentine, St. Abigail, St. Brigid (you can read it all HERE) where a young girl must accept that the price of protecting the girl she loves will come with a steep price. It is a rather whimsical story that moves through feelings of melancholy and desire as it explores the magic of the bees that Theresa’s family keeps, and Polk does well by keeping much shrouded in mystery and open to the reader’s imagination while giving just enough details and insights to uphold the story.

Working in a library, I am often worried for those without a permanent residence and am confronted with how very lucky I am to have four walls and a roof above my head during a snowstorm. Neil Gaiman’s picture book What You Need to Be Warm was born out of a similar concern. Gaiman took to social media to ask people what memories they have of being warmth and was flooded by countless powerful memories. He took these and wove them into a poem around which 13 illustrators have added their art.  [image]The results are beautiful and moving and we are reminded of those who must struggle to find warmth.

It breaks families in irretrievable pieces,’ writes Ruta Sepetys in her second novel, Salt to the Sea ‘but those who are gone are not necessarily lost.’ The novel becomes a tribute of sorts to those who perished in the tragedy, showing not only the horrors of war but also the sparks of hope and humanity that keep people moving forward. Salt of the Sea follows four characters caught between German occupation and the advancing Red Army as they attempt to flee by boat, each a reminder that the tragedies of war knows no borders. The narrative moves between a Lithuanian nurse, a young and pregnant Polish girl, A Prussian thief, and a German soldier, each giving a unique perspective on the advancing events and keeps the story feeling endlessly fresh and surprising. A well-researched and heart wrenching story that is as complex as it is compelling, Salt to the Sea is a moving tribute to those trapped in war and a reminder of humanity in the most inhumane of times.  [image]The Wilhelm GustloffDespite being the largest loss of life at sea, I had never heard of the Wilhelm Gustloff. Everyone knows the story of the Titanic and the sinking of the Lusitania is a commonly known sinking of a civilian vessel during wartime where 1,195 people were killed. In a conversation with Time Magazine, Sepetys offered several theories why so few have heard of it, namely that the Nazi ‘were amidst an evacuation and they didn’t want it to affect morale. They also were trying to hide the fact they were losing the war.’ In her research she learned that ‘survivors reported that when they spoke of it, there was a knock on their door, and they were told, ‘Why are you telling stories about some ship? That didn’t happen.”’ Whatever the reason, Sepetys has ensured the tragedy and those who suffered from it will be remembered and honored through this rather beautiful book. It is a perfect subject for Sepetys, as she aims to give voice to “hidden histories” and many of her books tell of events occurring in places and to people that aren’t usually centered in tellings about that era. Her words on this are quite powerful:‘Every nation has hidden history, countless stories preserved only by those who experienced them. Stories of war are often read and discussed worldwide by readers whose nations stood on opposite sides during battle. History divided us, but through reading we can be united in story, study, and remembrance. Books join us together as a global reading community, but more important, a global human community striving to learn from the past.’Here we find those caught in land no longer German, not yet Soviet, stuck in a war that has been lost but has yet to be won, and everyone exists in their own sort of inbetween where they aren’t yet dead but life feels dangerously thin.‘I moved from body to body, treating blisters, wounds, frostbite. But I had no treatment for what plagued people most the most. Fear.’Much of the novel occurs in a space where hardships have been endured and trust is hard to come by. The characters are fearful of anyone they do not know—especially due to their various nationalities and many have secrets to keep—and they forego names for descriptions like “the wandering boy,” “the knight,” or my favorite, “the shoe poet” for a cobbler who reads the life of the survivors based on their shoes. ‘The shoes always tell the story.’ The spirit to survive keeps them going and the small bits of humanity occasionally break through the mistrust. Though the idea of distrust and lies is a larger theme in the novel that is full of deceit and self-deception. Alfred, the rather repulsive character who has fully embraced Hitler and Nazism, writes heroic letters to a girl back at home speaking of his great deeds as a soldier, though when the perspective shifts we discover he is meek and only trusted with odd tasks like toilet cleaning. Moments like this keep your spirits up in such a bleak book, although Alfred’s nearly comic-book vilanny feels a bit off-beat with the rest of the novel. ‘What had human beings become? Did war make us evil or just activate an evil already lurking within us?’I really enjoyed the shifting perspectives here, especially as it keeps the chapters short and staccato’d, making it easy to just keep reading one more page, one more page, just one more…until suddenly you’ve plowed through the book (the emotional intensity helps too). That said, we are left with only a shallow depiction of each character though through them all it comes together to be something greater than the sum of its parts. Still, for such a haunting novel the characters could have been fleshed out a bit more. Most of the novel is them attempting to escape and embark the ship, their one shred of hope to survive the war:‘The Wilhelm Gustloff was pregnant with lost souls conceived of war. They would crowd into her belly and she would give birth to their freedom.’This is a book of both hope but also tragedy, and always a reminder that military attacks tend to spill the blood of the innocent or those just hoping to get away. I really enjoyed this and want to send a huge thank you to Maddie for recommending this one. I love the pace of this book and it reminds me of something you’d read for a class in high school and end up loving the rest of your life. I wish I had read this for a class actually. ‘When the survivors are gone, we must not let the truth disappear with them,’ Sepetys writes, ‘please, give them a voice.’ She achieves this marvelously in Salt of the Sea.4.5/5‘Those memories, they are the coals that shield my heart from frost.’...more",Notes are private!,27,128,1,"Nov 03, 2023","Nov 03, 2023","Nov 03, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25614492-salt-to-the-sea

I felt this was a stronger Life amongst the undead is never an easy time but this follow-up to Tillie Walden’s Clementine was a lot of good gory fun. I felt this was a stronger volume than the first, which is set in the world of Robert Kirkman’s Walking Dead series and while I would rather read a Walden original than an IP continuation I do enjoy seeing Walden make it their own (that said I thought Tegan and Sara: Junior High was delightful). I think, with IP, that the joy is mostly in seeing the continuing adventures of familiar characters in a familiar world and we are able to get more of that here now that the set-up of the first volume is out of the way. Also it’s cool to see Walden breathe fresh life into tired IP so there’s that too. Here we follow Clem, Ricca and Olivia as they end up on an island community off the coast of Canada and are finally able to remain in one place in safety for awhile. But danger always lurks—zombies wash up on the shore every day—complications arise and one must always be ready to fight in a world where one small mistake can end not just your life but your entire community.  [image]As always, Walden’s art is really lovely. In the first volume I felt it was occasionally a bit difficult to see who was who and what was going on—which I suppose does lean into the whole, fighting in a snowstorm thing—but here the art has a bit better direction and visual clarity. The characters also look more varied, which helps. I do wish these were done with perhaps a little splash of color, but the black and white does help represent the starkness of their world. Clementine continues to be a really badass queer character, wrestling with taking care of her friends and navigating a new community full of their own motivations and with a character becoming pregnant all sorts of new complications will be coming. I think an aspect I really enjoyed about this one is all the nods to the teens not really having any education beyond survival which really drives home the harshness of being born in the post-zombie apocalypse. Another point of interest was something I don’t think I’ve seen in a zombie story before; the story asks us to consider if and how we can honor the deceased in a world where the dead rise back up to mindlessly feast on the living.  [image]So while these aren’t my favorite, they are still pretty exciting. This one does take a bit to get going and it doesn’t quite have the same melancholy magic as Walden’s other works, but its still a good ride.

Such is the case of Brazilian author Ana Paula Maia’s Of Cattle and Men, where her direct, visceral prose—gorgeously translated from the Portuguese by Zoë Perry—unsettles with apocalyptic anxieties as much as it captivates and directs our attention to the murky moral musings at the heart of the story. Set in a small community largely upheld by a slaughterhouse and a meat processing plant, we follow men like stun operator Edgar Wilson and other slaughterhouse workers through a story that interrogates our relationship to meat, violence, and consumption. It is a clever story, one that makes us question where the dividing line is between ‘impure but morally acceptable’ and outright damnation, and Maia succeeds by allowing the narrative presentation of events speak for themselves instead of heavy-handed moralizing. Yet still the message is resoundingly clear and chilling. A steady stream of dread and death propels this tale of both human and bovine brutality and Of Cattle and Men is as evocative as it is insightful.‘Somebody’s got to do the dirty work. Other people’s dirty work. Nobody wants to do that sort of thing. That’s why God put guys like you and me on this earth.’Having recently been darkly delighted by Agustina Bazterrica’s Tender is the Flesh, a novel that also functions as an indictment of the meat industry where the line between human and animal becomes alarmingly blurred, I was please to find Of Cattle and Men still felt very fresh and unique read right after it. Maia has garnered comparisons with Cormac McCarthy for the raw brutality and poetic investigations into moral darkness that come alive in both their works. I see this most in the way they both expand moral investigation into the solemn weightiness of religious aesthetics is one of the sharpest edges to cut into both the reader and narrative.‘He believes that the sacramental host cleanses him of all impurity and redeems him of all imperfection. And so, by eating Christ’s flesh and drinking His blood, he feels part of Christ. But it never occurred to him that by eating the flesh of those cattle and drinking their blood, he would also become part of the animals he slaughters every day.’Though Maia’s prose is a glorious craft all to its own. She cites Fyodor Dostoevsky as a major influence and in that spirit her language is very raw and direct, reflective of the working class men it represents.The tone of this novella feels like a spiral towards madness, where animal and human bodies are piling up, ‘the hue of the twilight sky resembles that of a pomegranate cut in half’ or a statue of a saint canonized for healing plague victims falls and shatters all begins to amalgamate towards a feeling like the world might crack open at any moment to drip the blood of an apocalypse across the desiccated landscape. And what better setting for musings on damnation and inhumanity than a slaughterhouse? Touro do Milo Slaughterhouse is hidden away from the public who mostly only see the final product either on a tidy market shelf or seasoned, grilled and enticing on a plate, both with ‘not one glimpse of the unbridled horror behind something so tender and delicious.’ Through the mundane details of life amongst the men and beats in the slaughterhouse, we quickly begin to detect that ‘nobody will get out of here unscathed,’ a point made all the more chilling because ‘this thought makes Edgar Wilson glad’ as all who experience it, including the reader, will be forced to confront the darkness within instead of sweeping it out of sight, out of mind. ‘These are the confessions of blood and death of those who have already been condemned.’Through Edgar we see the allegorical message of the novel about ‘death that gives life.’ There are the many condemnations of the meat industry here, which even Edgar acknowledges is foul. When asked by a student touring the facility if he considers himself a murderer, he is quick to respond affirmatively. But when asked if he is ashamed he counters with a question if she has ever eaten a hamburger—she has—and ‘how do you think it got there?’ There are no tidy moral boundaries here and Maia asks us to consider our distance of complicity. ‘Those who eat are many, and they are never satiated. They are all men of blood, those who kill and those who eat. No one goes unpunished.’ We see how the men need these jobs to put food on the table, and we see how the cows that would normally go to waste are given to the hungry who beg outside the slaughterhouse. Yes it is all monstrous but society has integrated it to such an extent that it is difficult to disentangle without collapsing the local economy. And when we are forced to consider if the cows can be aware and have agency—an idea brought on by their increasingly bizarre behavioir—the darkness of it all really takes hold. ‘One abyss calling out to another abyss.’Though those who must partake in upholding the industry go through life like damned souls, and many meet abrupt, violent deaths. There is a certain hardness to Wilson—it is said he survived a blast in a mine even the Devil himself couldn’t have escaped from teasing the idea of Wilson as somehow an unholy, unstoppable being—and he’s not proud of what he does, but if someone has to do it, then let it be him, who has pity on those irrational beasts.’ He blesses each cow before executing it and abhors cruelty to the animals, going so far as murdering a man for not taking care to kill the cows properly. The divide between beast and man blurs throughout the novel, with the men sleeping in the field near the cows and ‘only the voices on one side and the mooing on the other distinguish the men from the ruminants,’ or the students touring the facility ‘looking like distressed cattle on their way to be stunned’. There is the juxtaposition of the cows seen as ‘impure but morally acceptable’ murder with the actions of Edgar against men he finds reprehensible and those of a man just out of prison for murder Edgar meets who dismisses the severity of his crimes because the dead man was a bad man.Of Cattle and Men is a chilling tale of the slippery slope of justifying violence and the damned men who carry out the violence. The writing in this is incredibly gripping and we can feel the dread building in every page. A searing criticism of the meat industry, this is a quick novella but one that will certainly haunt you for a long time.4/5‘Not even the moon can separate heaven from earth.

The Faint of Heart, a gorgeous YA graphic novel from writer and artist Kerilynn Wilson, makes us confront the bleakness of a utilitarian world devoid of emotion where art, fun, friendship and love are no longer valued and considered foolish. While I have to confess that the story requires some major leaps of faith, it does function as a really powerful metaphor and the art is astonishingly beautiful. This is worth it for the art alone, I mean, take a look at Wilson’s work:  [image]  [image]This is one you just sort of have to go with it and not question how removing the physical human heart works to begin with and why that would erase all feelings, but whatever, its cool. While the art gorgeously depicts this dystopian world I feel it would have benefited from a bit more world building (something I almost never say) even if only to let the story breathe a bit. This can be read in about 20 minutes and everything moves a bit too quickly after the initial set-up to really sink in, but it is altogether rather lovely. What we do know is this:‘The Scientist discovered that all sadness, anxiety, and anger would disappear when the heart was removed and placed in a numbing solution.It didn't numb only the bad feelings, though.

But what works best is how much this really does add texture to all we’ve previously known about Christopher, like the twist about the origin of his bone flute and how much he misses and loves skeleton girl. It’s all very sweet and tender: ‘That was the best thing about Christopher, and she enjoyed him in all ways; it was wonderful to have a companion who didn’t demand she be a perfect princess, but allowed her to be a person when she wanted to be.’But that also makes the ending all the more tragic.

When I first saw Scream I was at an age where the tongue-in-cheekness of it went over my head and instead was convinced a masked man was going to gut me like a fish in my own home. FUN. Okay, I was a sensitive child, I actually avoided horror films for most of my life but have always been drawn to horror in novel form. Stephen Graham Jones is one of my favorites doing horror these days and an aspect I really love about his work is that, like Scream, his stories often demonstrate an awareness of the genre tropes and succeed by delivering a playfulness with the elements, often in a surprising way. The Last Final Girl is one of his most head-on metafictional horrors—actually let me throw on my tweed coat with cool elbow patches and say “I daresay one might call the novel a post-modern horror.” Because one thing that I love about Jones is that he writes horror with literary sensibilities and while his plots may often be “low brow” they are done in a rather “high brow” way that is satisfying no matter where you are on the brow scale of things. But let me defend my thesis here that The Last Final Girl is post-modern. For starters, it has a level of self-awareness that is just shy of overdoing things (which, to be fair, overdoing it is sort of a staple of horror films) and is full of constant winks at the reader. Its filled with allusions to notable slasher films and while I’m sure a few breezed right by me aspects such as characters with names like Crystal Blake that poke at Camp Crystal Lake where Jason Voorhees drowns in Halloween. What really takes this to a fun level of self-awareness and meta-analysis, however, is the style. Now it’s one that seems to really put some readers off and while I feel it would have worked better in a short story than a novel (even a novel that barely breaches beyond novella length) I still have to applaud Jones for effectively sustaining it and using it to have the narration serve as its own self-analysis. The story is written in present tense as if someone is describing a film you are watching. This includes set direction, attention to camera angles and pans, and even mentions of voice overs. It’s really cool and likely works best as an audiobook if you are deciding to read this. And while it isn’t perfect here, one can see the evolution of Jones work: when reading The Only Good Indians I kept thinking about how beautifully cinematic his writing was and now I understand he is able to achieve that level of brilliance by testing and perfecting his writing with experiments like this book.This style makes you really feel like you are watching a movie, which is half the point of this book. The Last Final Girl, which features the survivor of a slasher-film-esque killing assembling a team of “final girls” to replace her slaughtered prom court as the serial killer returns for more blood, is a love letter to slasher films and is eager to display how aware it is of its own tropes. Sure, the story is often very corny, but—and here’s what I think is the coolest part of the books—this isn’t just an homage to slasher films but more so to their over-the-top and cheesy sequels. ‘”So…so is this a horror movie now, or a teen comedy?"" Brittney says.""It's an afterschool special,"" Izzy says.’That’s right. The story begins in the final scene of a horror film as the final girl overcomes the killer—in this case the slasher wears a Michael Jackson mask and is thus dubbed “Billy Jean”—and for the first half of the book our new cast is painfully aware they are the lower budget sequel that has to be as ridiculous as possible to top the first one. Izzy makes for a great final girl focus as she is more or less aware of her role in this “film” and addresses the tropes in order to survive, like saying ‘stupid girls go upstairs’ to herself in critical situations. Final Girls are a big trope in Jones novels, and always so lovingly so. In an interview for his novel My Heart Is a Chainsaw, Jones opens up about what Final Girls mean to him:‘The final girl is the vessel we keep our hope in. Final girls show us how to stand up against bullies. They show us how to insist on ourselves, in spite of everything. And that’s important, whether you’re dealing with some machete-wielder or a bad boss.’How can you not love this guy when he is able to present horror as such a meaningful and hopeful message. Jones always comes across as such a cool guy and I recently learned he teaches a class on haunted house fiction and I would like to enroll.It’s all very fun but we also live in a world where horror has been dissected, analyzed and spoofed to death, what more can be done?In the film Scream, the character Billy asserts ‘Movies don’t create psychos, movies make psychos more creative,’ and Stephen Graham Jones is the literary horror answer to that. The 90s were full of spoofs, such as the Scary Movie films, but those often felt like they were never quite sure if they wanted to mock the tropes or actually tell a decent story and ended up being cheap laughs and not much else. What Jones does, however, is play with the tropes in a very loving way that make you grin when you get the inside jokes and shriek or cringe at all the right parts. He dives so far into parody it becomes something original, or, as a character observes here ‘maybe the expected's gone full circle . . . Maybe it's so obvious now that that's the only thing that can be a surprise.’ And that is exactly what Jones brings to the table.The Last Final Girl is a cheesy good time that manages to still feel very thoughtful and heartfelt. The tension rises perfectly and when the violence hits, this is quite the bloodbath. It feels like an experiment, and while it is a good experiment it still seems a bit unpolished. Though we are in the present reaping the benefits from all this experimentation as Jones continues to put out exciting novels and I can’t wait to follow him into the grimdark future.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,9,110,1,not set,not set,"Oct 26, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16039485-the-last-final-girl

Solution is another stunner from Evenson, taking the horror trope of the mad scientist and updating it for modern anxieties of climate crisis and survivalism. The world is ending and the narrator, disgusted by the work his two sons have chosen that will ensure their own survival with an elite few while billions of others will perish, has found his own solution. His son, he says, have chosen to save ‘those who have sold their souls to the devil,’ and choosing who deserves to live is the sort of thing that got earth to this point to begin with. Instead, he has other plans: ‘I have not sold my soul to the devil. I used to think that there was just a simple either/or: either sell your soul or wait to wither away and die. But I have come to realize there is a third possibility: to become the devil himself. Do that, and all sold souls shall belong to you.’In typical Evenson fashion, the story progresses slowly, building tone and tension to a fever pitch as the reader begins to understand the horrors being tidily revealed. This was a fun one, combining multiple types of science horror and being delivered through a chilling monologue that makes us consider the old saying that the line between genius and insanity is very thin and often blurred. But it also makes the reader consider our own morals and actions. ‘At what point, seeing how little is being done—seeing how little changes even when people do notice the world is dying, seeing how little changes no matter which political party brandishes its readymade moral indignation and seizes power, seeing the way that corporations who have taken on the rights of people continue to do as they please—do you decide to take matters into your own hands?And when you do decide to do so, what can you possibly do?’Evenson is a favorite for a reason and this story is another reminder why I enjoy him.

Two Truths and a Lie, a “novelette” by Sarah Pinkser delves into the unsettling atmosphere of a hardly remembered public access show that Stella, our narrator and compulsive liar, thinks she’s making the show up when she tells her friend. But when they uncover old episodes of the show she begins to fear the series may have served as a dark prophecy for the child guest’s lives. And worse, almost the whole town appeared on it, including her. This is a short but certainly spooky story that questions if we fall into the trap of self-fulfilling prophecies.‘ Uncle Bob was the anti-Mr. Rogers. A cautionary uncle, not predatory, but not kind.’When I was a kid my mother assumed anything Jim Henson was for kids and thats how I got left alone to be terrified by episodes of Henson’s The Storyteller. As an adult its all pretty goofy but wow did those demon puppets frighten me in the episode The Soldier and Death. Another that came to mind for me was Courage the Cowardly Dog. Luckily for me, these shows never had any potentially supernatural powers to ruin my life (though my love of fairy tales likely started with that Henson show so maybe it did?). Something Pinsker captures so efficiently and eerily here is the way childhood nostalgia is a perfect breeding ground for terror. Authors like Stephen King or Stephen Graham Jones have often shown that mixing horror and childhood is creepily effective, and since nostalgia pokes at a tender place inside us it is also very vulnerable. There is something deeply unnerving about considering how the root of childhood memories has now gone rotten and twisted. Pinsker combines this with the way fairy tales and the simplistic innocence of childhood stories can quickly cast a dark shadow and it is all a recipe for a chilling read.Which brings us to Stella, who is quite a storyteller in her own life. ‘She had always done that, inventing things when she had no reason to lie,’ she self-accesses, ‘just because they sounded interesting, or because it gave her a thrill.’ So when one lie becomes a repressed truth, she is on the case to figure out what was so unsettling about the Uncle Bob show. The stories he tells seem to portend the disasters that would await these children in early adulthood, such as a story about driving away forever being told to a boy who would drive off a cliff. Then there is her own: ‘Once upon a time, there was a little girl who didn’t know who she was. Many children don’t know who they will be, and that’s not unusual, but what was unusual in this case was that the girl was willing to trade who she was for who she could be, so she began to do just that. Little by little, she replaced herself with parts of other people she liked better. Parts of stories she wanted to live. Nobody lied like this girl. She believed her own stories so completely, she forgot which ones were true and which were false…or if there was anything left of her…’Yet some stories don’t seem to have come true but became something even worse, making us wonder if the lives were shaped by rejection of the stories told. It’s all very creepy and while the story is a bit scattered, it comes together for a nice twist ending.Two Truths and a Lie is a fast and fun story that probes the creepiness of half remembered childhood and makes for a great spooky season read.

The Little Witch by M. Rickert is a charming yet creepy little tale (you can read it all here) of an aging woman who generally keeps to herself but has taken interest in a young girl she sees each Halloween dressed up as a witch in red boots and solemnly takes too much candy. The witch girl, it seems, does not age despite the passing years. The story is told with as much wholesome warmth as there is eerie mystery and abrupt disaster in the neighborhood, feeling much like a cozy evening with a cat snuggling in your lap by the fire but if that cat just happens to be a ghost. This is a perfect read for Halloween and leaves you with much to ponder, haunting you long after without being fearsome. ‘Such power was harnessed from either great evil or great good.’This really was a delightful story and Rickert creates such an all-encompassing atmosphere that is both cozy and charming yet still unsettling. The narrator—the older woman—tells the tale with a lot of vagueness that keeps you guessing and all the unconfirmed suspicions make for a perfect spooky experience. Yet, despite the sudden deaths going on, we feel her reclusive loneliness and her being avoided from the whispered rumors of her being a witch more than anything else. Is she hexing people or are these accidents a coincidence? And is that why Alice, the adorable little witch, is drawn to her? And who is the horned figure that accompanies her on Halloween nights? Yet all these uneasy questions seem snuggled in all warm in the blanket of the narrative that is more concerned with taking care of this mysterious houseguest who frolicks with the narrator’s cat and loves candy.‘Alice seemed perfectly happy to eat her marmalade toast by candlelight and, when she got to the third piece, I noticed how her little legs in the striped stockings and red boots had begun to swing happily beneath the kitchen table.’So if you are looking for a great spooky season read but are more interested in being charmed than chilled, The Little Witch is a perfect treat. It proceeds to a well constructed yet still ambiguous ending that has had me wrestling with all the half-revealed clues throughout the story yet I found the eerie atmosphere and unnerving events to be more devilishly delightful than dreadful. And who knows, maybe you’ll spot Alice this year trick-or-treating on Halloween night, better have some extra candy for her. 4/5...more",Notes are private!,23,101,1,not set,not set,"Oct 24, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/55423314-the-little-witch

There are even psychological studies that show people find the fear of entering a haunted house like the kind operating for the Halloween season to offer a sort of soothing post-experience effect, further drawing us to them. Haunted houses have become an archetype in fiction, often acting as a repository for grief and guilt but also functioning as a psychological mirror reflecting and enlarging the traumas inside the occupants minds. In this way it manipulates and preys upon us all and plays a role that seems just as alive as any character. Though a house is not always empty as such a place has often been twisted and traumatized by those who have perished within, and they may still lurk in the shadows… Such is the case with Cassandra Khaw’s Nothing But Blackened Teeth which, like a haunted house itself daring us to enter inside it’s pages, masterfully manipulates tropes as a sort of meta-commentary by way of chilling story, all brought to life by a gorgeous prose style that feels like it's tearing into the viscera of language and displaying it in all its bloody glory. A rather polarizing book and a quick read, I found this to be an absolute delight functioning on multiple levels that deliver a shocking and scary tale while also examining the intensity of grief, the archetypes of horror fiction and testing the rivets of friendship. It is a novel as gorgeous as it is gruesome.Haunted Houses come in many varieties. In his introduction for the novel Burnt Offerings, horror author Stephen Graham Jones offers two distinctions: the Stay Away Houses and the Hungry Houses. ‘ Whereas Stay Away Houses just want to be left alone,’ Jones writes, ‘Hungry Houses aren't complete without people to digest for reasons or decades or centuries.’ The latter category is most often exemplified by Shirley Jackson’s Hill House and here Khaw offers us another example with their own twists. When a group of friends, all former ghost hunters, enter an abandoned Heian-era mansion in Japan so Nadia and Faiz can achieve Nadia’s dream of being married in a haunted house, they are poking the home in the very wound that set it down into legend. Long ago, after hearing her bridegroom had perished before returning for their wedding, a bride had herself buried alive in the walls of her mansion and each year another girl would meet the same fate until the mansion finally fell into disrepair and disuse. Every aspect of the house is dripping dread and portending trauma as Khaw skillfully crafts an atmosphere and tone to the novel that transports you directly into the terror—you swear you can hear your own footsteps reverberating in the prose— and a lexicon of devouring and digestion sinks its teeth into much of the descriptions of the house.‘[The mansion] smelled instead like such old buildings do: green and damp and dark and hungry, hollow as a stomach that'd forgotten what it was like to eat.’This is not just any hungry house, however. In Night Side of the River, Jeanette Winterson offers a dichotomy of hauntings where either it is the place that is haunting you or it is the person being haunted from within—Winterson uses Hill House, which Jones’ also classified as a ‘Hungry House’, as an example of the latter where the house magnifies your own internal haunting and brings it externally. Khaw’s house, however, manages to be both as it preys on the mental states and fears of the group while also being a haunted place that, not unlike a Stay Away House, has sent its array of hitobashira and yokai out to torment and steal people away. This plays into an aspect of Asian horror and ghost lore that is different from the Western tradition, which we’ll get into shortly, but it also makes the character’s personalities such an important part of the story.‘After all, isn't that the foremost commandment in the scripture of horror? They who are queer, deviant, tattooed, tongue-pierced or other must always die first.’The characters are what really made this story work for me. It is a group of friends, but one where the tight-knot of friendship has frayed and old resentments are larger in the mind than older, fonder memories—‘Compassion, like everything else, can be worn dull by rough use.’ They get frustrated with their friends and must survive each other just as much as they must survive the mansion. When you inevitably want to yell at one of them, a character will as if on your behalf which is another clever way Khaw makes you feel inside the story with them. Our narrator, Kat, is fresh out of a hospital stay for what they term ‘terminal ennui’ and is still treading waters in a sea of grief (a primary target for Hungry Houses). Kat is close friends with Faiz, a friendship that was ‘guilt-bruised, gestated in the shambles of a stillborn relationship. But a friendship nonetheless.’ and Nadia feels threatened by their past so tensions are high. There is also Phillip, the white White-Knight type character with as much charm and charisma as his bank account that paid for this entire trip. Finally there is Lin, who is doing well on his own and provides excellent comic relief for the reader and frustration for the group as he finds it is ‘easier to run your mouth, run from the Sisyphean work that was being emotionally open.’A quick aside because I LOVE Lin. I’ve always wanted a character in a horror who just cracks jokes and giggles things like “oh we are all gonna die” because that would be me. Taking none of it seriously. Being kind of a dick to everyone, smoking a joint instead of running, being not very helpful. And is the character who knows the rules to horror (a great horror trope) and seems resigned to them. Lin rules.‘Don’t spook the ghosts.’So much of this is an exploration of grief, a grief that awakens the spirits within, a grief the ghosts feed off of. And Kat invites them in not just through grief, but quite literally asking the house to keep her company.‘Even if it was a house with rotting bones and a heart made out of a dead girl's ghost, I'd give it everything it wanted just for scraps. Some unabridged attention, some love.Even if it was from a corpse with blackened teeth.Anything to feel alive again right now.’Because loneliness is terrible. I found the depictions of grief to be quite extraordinary here, not just Faiz in terror at the possible loss of Nadia and showing how someone can completely fall apart, but the way grief is shown all muffled and imagery of being submerged in water is a frequently used technique.‘Have you ever cannonballed into a cold lake? The shock of an old memory is kind of like that; every neuron singing a bright hosanna: here we are. You forgot about us, but we didn’t forget about you.’Kat experiences the haunting most profoundly, seeing all the spirits and hearing the constant chant of their voices. Khaw is exceptional at using language to transfer seamlessly from the “real” to the “supernatural,” with ghosts and fears being tasted just as much as seen. ‘ I didn’t know someone else’s pain could have a texture, a bite, a gelatinousness you could hold in your teeth, but I could almost gnaw on [Redacted]’s dying.’Something I find particularly interesting in Blackened Teeth is the way the supernatural is so much a part of the “real” world, something that draws from the Eastern folklore around ghost where their realm can conjoin with ours and is just a natural thing you hope to avoid upsetting. This is the tradition Kat grew up in, like Khaw who is also from Malaysia, and where the group of friends did their ghost hunting:‘Growing up where we did, back in melting-pot Malaysia, down in the tropics where the mangroves spread dense as myths, you knew to look for ghosts. Superstition was a compass: it steered your attention through thin alleys, led your eyes to crosswalks filthy with makeshift shrines, offerings and appeasements scattered by traffic.’For those who are interested, I found this really cool list of haunted places in Malaysia that would likely be places our group would have checked out. This style of horror, however, is different than the US versions of horror where it is usually an intrusive evil that must be overcome and deafeated—Phillip portrays this trope in his character as someone who must muscle his way to victory—and here the house must be assuaged. Victory isn’t even part of the equation. In this way, I quite enjoyed that Khaw has opted to include multiple languages in the text and leave them untranslated. It works on several levels, particularly if they aren’t words you recognize because it emphasizes that this is foreign to you, that you are the stranger here and not the ghosts. And if it upsets you, there’s a chance Phillip is your avatar in the narrative as he sees everything as an experience he can purchase and own to accommodate and center him (there’s an argument to be made there is a subtle anti-colonialism message in this novella, especially when (view spoiler)[Phillip is centered at the end (hide spoiler)]). The language in all of Khaw’s work is something to marvel at and they create a prose that feels more like poetry. The figurative language swirls like smoke and is almost intangible the way it works in a poem and the vocabulary is so well chosen. It feels very ornate in a way that also feels like it is probing a supernatural past, and seem to similarly embody a sense of language that is like the objects in the house that seem to say ‘this was old before the word for such things existed.’ Khaw absolutely dazzles.‘This is the problem with horror movies: Everyone knows what's coming next but actions have momentum, every decision an equal and justified reaction. Just because you know you should, doesn't mean that you can, stop.’Which all brings me to what I loved so much about this novella: it is an examination of horror and the psychology behind it all. If haunted houses are a mirror of our psyche, it is only natural to fall into a sort of trope of your own psychology and each character well represents that. The fear kicks in and the emotions take the controls. All the pieces are set, the roles chosen, the rules to survive the house are pre-established: it’s like a board game fresh out of the box. They even joke about the order they should likely die in. I delighted at the scene where they search for a library to find a book that has answers because, well, that’s just how it goes in a haunted house. It’s very playful and amusing and the text is full of clever nods to its own self-awareness. It is a horror story playing itself out and we feel like we are rolling the dice along with them.‘My head swam, full of static again, like someone’d tuned the inside of my head to a broadcast decades dead.’I have to say, Nothing But Blackened Teeth completely charmed me as much as it chilled me. It is sharp as it is smart, especially in Khaw’s excellent examinations of horror dynamics. But above all, this is a really heartfelt novel where underneath the hauntings and violence it digs into ideas of grief and the awkward sadness of a slowly unraveling friend group. All constructed with prose that makes me grin ear to ear (picture creepy horror monster that feeds off poetry grin?) when I read it. A worthy addition to the literary canon of haunted houses, Cassandra Khaw’s Nothing But Blackened Teeth is a frightfully good time.

What artifacts and still frames from our collection of days could best be arranged to tell the story of our existence? For Christine Coulson, who spent twenty-five years writing for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, what better way to show a life than as a museum exhibit, which she does brilliantly in the quirky yet gorgeous novel One Woman Show. The focus of this exhibit is Kitty, living from 1906 to 1999, and her life is presented entirely through museum wall label texts with a few bits of overheard gossip from throughout her life sprinkled in for a bit of seasoning. Through these snapshots of her life—all written with a wry wit mimicking discussions on artistic themes and presentation while employing a clever and well refined lexicon—we see Kitty who ‘was raised as a prize—a pretty thing entitled to pretty things’ by wealthy parents enter into a tumultuous adulthood with the Great Depression and WWII rending all pre-planned futures asunder, go through multiple marriages and be a bit of a scandal amongst high society. Through the framing of a museum exhibit, One Woman Show is an effective and creative experiment that examines how women are often garniture in their own lives, being considered precious objects in a collection subject to appraisal from society.‘Even at age ten, Kitty senses a suffocating tyranny on the horizon. Not the war in Europe, but the fragile need to be forever cared for according to someone else’s tastes and appetites.’This is such an intriguing little book and Coulson—who wrote the wall labels for the MET’s British Galleries—successfully manages to probe a great depth of character and nuance through her miniature expressions of a person as a work of art. It is a quick book with each page being a single “piece” in the collection and given a single, succinct paragraph. For example:“BULLFIGHTER, AGED 44, 1950Mrs. Luis de Braganza (known as Kitty)Collection of Luiz Carlos Alfonso Antonio de Braganza Ex-Collection of Martha and Harrison Whitaker; William Wallingford IIITraveling exhibitionRejecting the vernacular during a visit to London, Kitty champions the canon in a discreet assignation with Picasso during the second of his two trips to England. The artist's legendary appetites are no match for Kitty in full force. She seduces with industry and abandon, replacing traditional modes of expression with robust techniques based on curvilinear forms. Picasso, awed by the stark and savage edges beneath Kitty's gilding, handles her as if she were made of bronze.”Its clever but never falls into the trap of substituting substance for format and becomes a rather incisive way to both follow Kitty’s story but also address aspects of society. While this one is listed as a ‘traveling exhibition,’ we often see the character’s represented as belonging to various collections, such as Kitty belonging to her parents private collection, and later each of her three husbands. We see how Kitty is quite literally an object on display, a high society woman who must live ‘within the confines of its pillowed virtue’ that become rather stifling. The text is playful, with character’s value appraisals changing along with events and new details about their persons and the composition of each display comes loaded with implications about the people and events depicted. Coulson should be praised for sustaining the style throughout while being always enjoyable and insightful as well as knowing how to keep the novel short enough that it doesn’t overplay the technique. It manages to avoid seeming like a gimmick and more like unique artwork. ‘What are we girls but farm animals once we get married off?’Objectification of women is a predominant theme in the novel, and we see how Kitty’s “value” is attached to whatever “collection” she is currently a part of. Her first marriage to Bucky is high quality, with museum cards for each bridesmaid that shows them all in a bit of surprise to find Kitty the centerpiece of a wedding collection instead of themselves marrying into Bucky’s Philadelphia fortune, but also shows the how for people of this status, love and marriage was more a business deal than actual affection. ‘Someday, I might really like you’ he tells Kitty on their wedding night. But her value changes in the collection, especially as a solo piece as a widow, or when she divorces her second husband (‘His highly polished veneer cannot conceal the violent carcass to which it is attached.’). The novel also looks at how women are harshly judged in society for aging, with Kitty being less valued by everyone around her in her advanced age, or how her lifelong habit of stealing small objects is sort of charming in youth but viewed as creepy when she is older.Kitty is quite a dynamic character, being quirky and a bit of a scandal (having been rumored to have slept with Picasso when he painted her) and her life takes us through many major events of the 20th century. I enjoy how she has a love for words as well. Coulson manages to address heavy topics in playful ways, such as how she combines Bucky’s bafflement at Kitty’s vocabulary with a somber moment when Kitty accepts that her multiple miscarriages are a sign she will never have children (and therefor never a “collection” of her own). She says there will be ‘no surfeit of babies after all,’ and he, not understanding what many of her words mean, responds ‘who needs surfing babies anyways.’ Coulson keeps the story moving quickly and lightheartedly without sacrificing depth. One Woman Show is an exciting and entertaining read that takes art criticism and shifts it’s gaze to human life. It is a fast read but you come through feeling like you’ve experienced much more beyond the mere length of pages. A great look at society, patriarchy and a must read for lovers of art and museums.4.5/5...more",Notes are private!,2,110,1,not set,not set,"Oct 20, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/101146034-one-woman-show

That’s where we win, and that’s where we lose.’I’ve always been particularly charmed by the short stories of Hairuki Murakami and it seems a no-brainer to have his work adapted into a manga format. I’m mostly surprised this was my first time encountering such an adaptation and I wonder if previous ones have existed that just never made it’s way to the US. Hairuki Murakamai Manga Stories presents four different stories adapted by Jean-Christophe Deveney and with artwork from PMGL (while the word manga is in the title, the pages and frames all read from left to right and pages front to back) and gives a unique, visual offering into the variety of tales Murakami crafts. Its a fun exercise and while I’m not entirely sure these were the ideal selection of stories and found a bit of dissonance between the art and the way his stories often feel when reading them this was still worth picking up. Especially for long-time fans of the author, though for those looking for an introduction to him I would probably not recommend this as a good first read as, while it presents the whimsicality and range of his narratives, it lacks the actual writing that makes his stories so endlessly readable and enjoyable. Still, it is a fine collectors piece and I will certainly be checking out the second volume.  [image]I once read a critic question why someone would do a film adaption of a book where the main character is the writing (I believe it was James Franco’s adaptation of Child of God by Cormac McCarthy?). While I do often find film and books to be less of a compatible medium as Hollywood would like us to believe, I tend to find graphic novel adaptations to be enjoyable more often. This one, however, I think falls under the aforementioned critic’s question, particularly as the stories chosen here are not particularly enhanced by giving them a visual treatment. Super-Frog Saves Tokyo is an obvious exception, as the aspects of a giant frog showing up in an apartment and some of the later scenes are pretty exciting to see visually, but the rest are all more or less mundane without feeling them through Murakami’s writing. His writing is what keeps me coming back almost more than his often surreal and zany stories and here you are lacking the vibes of his descriptions, the narrators’ internal thoughts wrestling with ambiguous emotions, and Murakami’s gift of rather soothing storytelling. Which is what makes most of these stories so good in the first place. Perhaps a visual adaptation of one of his novels would have been a better choice as his short stories do tend to be more ponderous and geared towards experiencing some enigmatic sadness.  [image]That said, these are rather faithful adaptations and do probe to the heart of the emotional undercurrents. The art didn’t really capture for me how I tend to feel his stories inside myself when I read them, but its not bad either. I did really enjoy that the style changes for each story and I found Where I'm Likely to Find It and The Seventh Man to work much better artistically than the others, with the latter being a really good visual vibe for the story. I’m not backpedaling here, I actually really did have a good time with this collection, but my mind just seems to notice what felt amiss more than what worked.

It’s a staple of the genre, and one Stephen Graham Jones is exceptionally good at. Though while we tend to always focus on the transformation from childhood to adult, there is less attention on the transition between young adulthood towards an acceptance of advanced aging and maturity. Jones short story The Night Cyclist (you can read the entire story here) is a sort of coming-of-middle-aged horror, finding our narrator in a place in life where many would start sniffing around to detect a mid-life crisis while he himself is sniffing around a crime scene and stumbling into a quiet and violent horror. A chef getting of in his years, he has recently separated from a four year relationship being caught in an act of infidelity and finds his only solace on the wheels of his bike. It’s his way of staying active, his way of getting to and from work, but also it recaptures his youth and years of bike racing. What begins as a chance encounter with the horrors of the night becomes—on the surface—a violent and action packed story of monsters and murder but beneath it all is a very tender meditation on trying to age with grace and grappling with vanishing youth. ‘Coming home at two in the morning, Velcroed into my old racing shoes that have the clips worn down to nubs—dull little nubs my pedals know like a ball knows its socket—I could pretend that life had never ended. That I was still me. That I hadn’t run Doreen off on purpose. That I wouldn’t run the next Doreen off just the same.’If we have a character struggling to accept his aging, what better foil than a vampire who drains the life of others to maintain life eternal and strength unlimited. Sure it is all a bit cheesy—a midnight bike race against a mysterious figure who is mysteriously fast and potentially leaving behind a trail of bodies in a biker vs. driver war of attrition that has now tipped into violence—but Jones has a almost preternatural ability to make something corny come across as really charming and warm even if it is a horror story. I like to refer to him as my comfort-read horror, its really the best way to describe his work. ‘Some people hold on to that with video games, some with books about space, some with basketball or tennis, if their knees hold together.For me it was a bike. For me it was this.’What really worked here is the way a big part of the character's coming-of-age history, his cycling, was also so critical to his mid-life mental stability. It's something that struck me as true and made me think about how my teenage experience with being a top cross country runner was so much of my personal coming-of-age story and how running is still very important to me now. It's where I can clear my head (i get my best thinking done while running), feel good about myself, just relax in that odd way a good exercise can be comforting. I don't run competitively anymore, much like he no longer races bikes, but I loved the scene when he is chasing down the midnight biker and its all coming flooding back to him because on some good trail runs I feel that too. The way you can suddenly feeling like your mind is a dashboard of meters and switches where you adjust your controls, shut off the alarms signaling tiredness and put more pressure on speed. Jones captures this effectively.This one isn’t his strongest, but there is still such a literary quality and quiet depth of emotional thought that brings it alive. If Jones isn’t a cyclist he sure did some great research because I believed it all (though have no knowledge of any of that but sure, I was in). I also really enjoy how much love he shows for his characters, and his home of Denver, which just makes his stories so infectious and lovely. But also super violent.

Wendy Xu brings this up in her gorgeous new graphic novel, The Infinity Particle, and through this touching sci-fi story expands on these ideas between humans as well as a future with interpersonal relationships with AI. After moving Mars for an exciting job working for a pioneering engineer in the field of AI, Clementine finds herself caught up in the mysteries surrounding her boss’ personal AI unit, Kyle. Though attempting to help him uncovers big ethical issues surrounding AI as well as emotions deep within each other. Stunning in both artistic and emotional quality, Infinity Particle probes ethical quandaries of autonomy and consent, moving at an exciting pace through the growing mysteries of this highly engaging and thoughtful graphic novel.  [image]I’m sure you’ve seen that the news is constantly full of stories concerning AI on issues of consent and also bias (also we should be paying artists, writers and actors), though Infinity Particle takes questions of consent to the future on issues about how much autonomy a self-sufficient AI would have in society. Xu—who’s graphic novels I always adore and I highly recommend Tidesong—presents us with questions on identity in a really interesting way and aspect on AI’s developing emotions as well as emotional connections. I enjoyed how much the story is steeped in STEM and ethical issues without getting overly complex while still being quite ponderous. I also loved all the AI companions who are incredibly cute:  [image]The cat buddy especially since he reminds me of the Lumbercats from that Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts show. The art in this is breathtaking and really pops in its minimal color palette. Xu has creative use of panels to push dialogue along, never gets overly wordy, and keeps the pace moving quite efficiently. That said, while it doesn’t necessarily feel too rushed it does sort of hit all the plot points and reach the conclusion a bit hurriedly. Still, this hits some strong emotions. There is a really adorable romance plot, but also a lot of time spent on feelings of loss. The story only hints at the backstories of characters, but in ways where the small glimpses explode into big feelings in your heart and make you really feel for the characters.This was a lot of fun and really heartfelt and adorable. It is interesting to see how many graphic novels seem to be tackling issues around AI’s integrating with society—I enjoyed this one more but Pixels of You also takes an interesting look at AI ethics as well as a romantic relationship between a flesh and blood human and AI human—which I suppose is a future reality we are rapidly approaching so its nice to see books already probing the big questions.

My parents come from Michigan’s Upper Penninsula so we would spend holidays and summers there and walking through the forest at night during a big snow is such a specific feeling lodged in my heart, one that Jon Fosse’s A Silence managed to probe and enlarge the vague emotion with an incredible tenderness. Everything is muffled and soft, even the crunch of your footsteps, and while it may be frightening it is ‘a fear without anxiety’ as our narrator here describes his journey while lost through the forest. This is the tone that permeates all of A Silence, a story following the stream-of-consciousness of a man who, after getting his car stuck after aimlessly driving, has now gotten lost in the woods at night under falling snow. But he is not totally alone and the things he witnesses seem to defy tidy understanding. The same can be said for this book, which is practically more a short story than a novella, and likely drawing on his work as a playwright, almost feels like a one-act play with the narrator's mind as a stage just as much as the singular setting of the forest. It is a story that slowly seeps into your consciousness, calming you in the face of vague sadness and loss with its staccato prose, and sends you on a Dantean exploration for the divine in the spaces between the words much like the figures who arrive in the spaces between the trees.  [image]Fosse, dubbed the Samuel Beckett of the 21st century and recipient of the 2023 Nobel Prize in literature, has a gift for sparseness and thoughtful ambiguity and was recognized by the Nobel Committee for his ability to ‘give voice to the unsayable.’ Fosse makes the unsayable just as loud as any fine-tuned and powerful sentence here, quieting the reader and the setting under the hush of falling snow where the narrator often wonders ‘But a silence can’t speak, can it.’ However, ‘Yes, silence can speak in its way, and the voice you hear when it does, yes, whose voice is it.’ Who—and even what—the narrator encounters in the woods drift through the story with little explanation yet leave behind a metaphysical trail of thought to follow along. After first realizing he is lost, the narrator sees a glowing white outline coming towards him, becoming more a shining and inexplicable ‘presence’ that seems to guide him on this brief journey as a sort of wilderness Virgil. In fact, the opening of this story seems to mirror that of Dante’s first Canto of The Divine Comedy. Dante wrote: ‘In the middle of the journey of our life, I came to myself, in a dark wood, where the direct way was lost. It is a hard thing to speak of, how wild, harsh and impenetrable that wood was, so that thinking of it recreates the fear. It is scarcely less bitter than death: but, in order to tell of the good that I found there, I must tell of the other things I saw there.’While death is never mentioned directly, the reader will naturally gravitate towards that. The story remains vague and is open to interpretation because it exists beyond words, ‘it's not something that can be understood either, it's something else, maybe it's something that's only experienced.’ Simple death feels too tidy of an explanation to carry the quiet enormity of feelings being touched upon here, and isn’t the subject that Fosse tends to aim towards. In an interview with Music & Literature in 2019, he said:‘I don’t worry about dying; there is a lot of pain in life. And in me there is a lot of sorrow. As Ibsen said: “I received the gift of sorrow, and then I became a poet.” Pain, sorrow, melancholia, and depression are a gift too. You can make something good out of them.’There is a prevailing melancholia throughout much of Fosse’s works, notably Melancholy and Melancholy II, and ideas of meaning in life surround death are explored in other novels like the equally quiet Morning & Evening. Fosse often succeeds without drawing direct connections though and leaving the novel wide open to interpretation.‘ yes, it’s like everything is without meaning, and like meanings, yes, meanings don’t exist any more, because everything just sort of is, everything is meaning.’This interpretability is accomplished by packing any sense of meaning into the unsayable, into space between words, in the ‘quiet that it's like you can reach out and touch the silence.’ But what purpose does this serve. For Fosse, he says this is often a search for peace. Fosse had previously been a heavy drinker until, in 2012, he collapsed from severe delirium and alcohol poisoning and gave up drinking entirely. That summer he would convert to Catholicism and we find a search for the divine in many of his works, though he doesn’t like to outwardly state it. In a interview with LA Review of Books, he was asked about his statement that he tries to ‘overcome language, move beyond it’ and if the absence of language is how one approaches the divine. Fosse responds: ‘I’m very afraid of using the word “God.” I rarely do it and never when talking about my own writing. God is far too much for me to talk about. When I manage to write well, there is a second, silent language. This silent language says what it is all about. It’s not the story, but you can hear something behind it — a silent voice speaking. It’s this that makes literature work well for me.’This silent language is everywhere in A Shining, and we also see how language gets stripped away to better hear it. The narrator often casts aside phrases as mere ‘figures of speech’ that have no inherent meaning, moving deeper into silence as he moves deeper into the forest and always, always listening.‘I want to listen to the silence. Because it’s in the silence that God can be heard…when I listen I hear nothing i hear if the nothing can be heard, if thats not just a figure of speech, just something people say, I think, yes, the nothing, not any thing, not in any case the voice of God, whatever that is. But I’ll leave that for other people to decide.’What he does hear—occassionally—are the voices of his parents or another, nameless voice that sounds much like his own walking beside him and saying ‘I’m here, I’m here always, I’m always here.’ What these figures serve I’ll leave up to you to decide, but it makes for a very powerful story wrapped in a small book. We also see how ‘you can’t just say yes’ and give in, it is a path you must choose to go.‘embracing everything that exists, but its like nothing exists…’This is an odd but moving little book. At first it feels a bit tedious, and the narrator’s assertion that ‘boredom had taken hold of me—usually i was never bored but now i had fallen prey to it,’ may take hold of you as well in the beginning. The story builds through the narrator’s thoughts, which are rather circoitus and seem to build on each other like building blocks of ideas being assembled and there is a nearly excessive use of repetition. It’s all for effect, and the story does eventually lull you into it, but for a story under 70pgs it was a bit of a barrier to break into. Still, Fosse has a brilliant mind and A Shining makes for a very ponderous story ripe with meaning that seems always just out of reach. This is an excellent representation, however, of the Nobel Committee’s praise for Fosse for being able to ‘give voice to the unsayable.’3.5/5‘The forest is big.

Caitlin Marceau’s This is Where We Talk Things Out is horror by way of family drama, plunging us on a dark dive into a toxic mother-daughter relationship where gaslighting and long-simmering frustrations are as frightening and dealy as any ghouls or ghosts. Despite long attempts at boundaries, Miller begrudgingly accepts her mother’s invitation for a weekend at a cabin that might hopefully serve as a catalyst for repairing their relationship, or be the final fight to cut her off entirely.

Most of the time this is just the amusement of seeing the teenager who is too old to want to be on vacation with family yet still too young to stay home doing the whole moody young teen act, but occasionally the bite seems worse. Nobody can quite cut you down like a family member. This is Where We Talk Things Out isn’t quite that type of vacation though, instead being an isolated cabin in the wilderness during a January storm and, as Miller begins to dread, they might not be there just to talk things out. This book deals with narcissistic parents and abusive relationships, so be forewarned if this is a topic that makes you uncomfortable (though, being a horror novel, it is geared to make any reader uncomfortable) and if you are experiencing these sort of issues, please know there are resources available to help. This reads like a hostage situation, tapping into horrors akin to Stephen King’s Misery and (view spoiler)[William Faulkner’s A Rose for Emily (which you should totally read here) (hide spoiler)].The interactions between mother and daughter are at all times balanced on the edge of a knife where Miller feels she must either accept the cuts or tumble into catastrophe, and this sense of unease grows until it is practically suffocating. ‘I want you to really think about how you use your words, how you hurt me with them,’ her mother, Sylive, often says, ‘and think very carefully about how you’re going to speak to me moving forward.’ This story is bursting with gaslighting where Miller is often made to feel that her very understandable desire for boundaries are antagonistic and Sylvie frequently pushes Miller to anger in order to act victimized by her daughter. Plus there is the issue of Florence, Miller’s longterm girlfriend, with whom Sylvie seems to have gotten past her homophobia but still resentful of Florence ‘taking her daughter away.’ You know, the type of mother that will hate anyone who captures your attention. Grief plays a large part here as well, with the death of her father looming over everything like a thunderhead ready to unleash and all of Miller’s past attempts to separate from her mother and heal start to feel like sutures being ripped apart in the tension.‘The more Miller got away from home, the more she’d been able to realise how toxic it had grown to be after her father had gotten sick. Or maybe it had always been that way, with Sylvie holding on too tightly to the child that had survived, and she’d only noticed it when her father was no longer around to keep the household balanced.’Periods of grief of depression often cause us to feel nostalgic, and here is where the novel began to really turn the screws of creepy unease. The cabin is as close to a reproduction of Miller’s childhood home as possible, complete with her old clothes still in the drawer. ‘There’s something so unnatural about seeing her childhood repurposed for the cabin’s interior,’ she thinks, ‘she knows it’s Sylvie’s way of moving past her grief, but it only serves to wake Miller's own pain back.’ But is this attempt to bring back the past more than just grief, and is Sylvie’s mental health becoming far more threatening than Miller could ever imagine? This is a story that will give you chills and take your breath away. While it heads in a fairly predictable direction when it gets there it is still a punch to the face and the journey towards the end is so full of dreads its almost a relief it ends so abruptly. Personally I wish there was a bit more as it does have a bit of a slow burn then sudden conclusion, but it still hits hard. This Is Where We Talk Things Out is an excellent and terrifying domestic horror and I can’t wait to check out more by Caitlin Marceau.4/5...more",Notes are private!,6,88,1,not set,not set,"Oct 12, 2023",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/61179496-this-is-where-we-talk-things-out

Which is exactly what Mattie and Emma need in order to get a permit to practice magic seeing as the feds are doubling up their patrols and being Black and Choctaw is a sure way to end up in a residential boarding school—you know, the kind remembered for rampant abuse—or have their magic sealed off like has happened to Luella. A fun, fantastical tale that digs into the long history of racism in the US while also showing the power of family and found communities that band together in the face of oppression, Brooms is as a lovely to look at as it is to read and features a wonderfully inclusive cast of characters.  [image]I really enjoyed the art in this one, bringing the US south in the 30’s alive but with witchcraft in the mix and Duvall handles action really well with excellent use of frames. Bex Glendining, the colorist, also picks some exquisite palettes that really pop. This whole thing just looks so pretty and magical, I mean look at this:  [image]The story is quite exciting as well with a really high-stakes plot that is very involved in the magical world Walls creates but nods to the extreme prejudice in society and laws. There is a lot of really engaging world building done in a short space, both for the racial injustices in a magical society and also in the way these broom races work. The story does well by folding a lot of the exposition into the story naturally, like the way the rules of the races are delivered at the starting line (and change based on the race) in a way that not only helps it all make sense but also builds tension. Magic spells are allowed and the races felt like a lot like Mario Kart but with magic bolts and illusions instead of turtle shells and banana peels. And I loved the whole story of Billie Mae out to make a name for herself as the fastest broom racer in the country, yet unable to compete in professional races due to being Black and hoping to raise enough money to escape to California and start her career.  [image]While the plot is tense and full of adventure, the real heart is the characters. I enjoyed the variety of characters here with a variety of races and how the indigenous characters used a sort of root magic that seemed to differentiate them from other magic users. There is a cute queer romance, disability representation and also a trans character with a really touching side-plot and I loved the focus on this found family that comes together to support each other on and off the racetrack (well, I guess there's not a track but you know what I mean). The whole thing feels very heartfelt and uplifting and the characters have a lot of personality.Brooms is a huge success and also a perfect read for this spooky season! Overflowing with action and suspense, this is historical fiction meets fantasy for a really thoughtful look at people living on the margins of society coming together against oppression. Hopefully they will win the race and this book is sure to win your heart.⅘  [image]...more",Notes are private!,13,100,1,not set,not set,"Oct 11, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/103512530-brooms

It’s like visiting with old friends, with each volume offering a fun blend of characters both new and familiar and here we even get an exciting trip back to one of my favorite of McGuire’s many worlds: the Moors. When a burst of lightning brings Jill back to the school, it might actually be Jack trapped inside her dead-and-resurrected body and now the usual cohorts have to travel to the Moors to set things right. With the signature quirky charm and humor shining brightly amidst all the darkness and unease, Come Tumbling Down delivers more high-energy plot than usual but plenty of heartfelt investigations on friendship, bravery and sacrifice as well all culminating for another marvelous experience.  [image]I enjoy how this series keeps weaving back and forth between the past and forward moving present with the actions of Jack and Jill as a bloodied string pulling it all together. I’m also glad I read this volume during October as the Moors—based in some serious vampire and Frankenstein influence—are a perfect spooky season setting. We have characters returned from the dead, some awful betrayals leading to beheadings, and some real shocker moments where beloved characters may meet their doom. It’s action packed for a Wayward Children story and reminds us that, by this point in their lives, these characters are almost like superheros struggling with trauma. ‘Whatever they might have become when they'd been cast out of their chosen homes, they'd been heroes once, each in their own ways. And they did not forget.’ Theres some awesome determination and bravery in the face of fear and, as always, McGuire uses it to deliver some really empowering messages that remind us that its okay to give space to our sadness, but to not let our sadness rule us. We can overcome tragic pasts and use it to help others.‘The world doesn't stop spinning because you're sad, and that's good; if it did, people would go around breaking hearts like they were sheets of maple sugar, just to keep the world exactly where it is. They'd make it out like it was a good thing, a few crying children in exchange for a peace that never falters or fades. We can be sad and we can be hurt and we can even be killed, but the world keeps turning, and the things we're supposed to do keep needing to be done.’Something I enjoy about McGuire is how much darkness she is able to fold into these stories without making them bleak. Here we have a lot of reckoning with the fact that you can’t always win and even if you do, there might be some scars. ‘Sometimes heroism is pressing on when the ending is already predestined... Sometimes a hero has to fall.’ Though at the same time, it all feels almost too safe as characters are frequently resurrected, but I like how she leans into that with some humor and lessons.‘Apparently, the rest of you go around raising the dead when you don’t have anything better to do. It’s a miracle we have any graveyards left.’This was a fun addition to the series and I like how we see Kade really taking on a leadership role (it’s clear where this is heading even if he is struggling to accept it) and seeing the characters all grow with their interactions. I think I might like the quieter tales that give the backstories a bit more, and perhaps its just because both of those were so good, but the ensemble cast tales are just so much fun they can’t be denied. Also I love Jack, she is great. Can’t wait for the next volume as this one seems to tie up an arc (though McGuire has a way of reviving threads so who knows) but I’m excited for whatever comes next because ‘new things are the best kind of magic there is.’ This series is just a joy to read.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,8,94,1,not set,not set,"Oct 10, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44804083-come-tumbling-down

And you never forget’Having been a fan of Stephen Graham Jones for awhile now, it has haunted me year after year that I had not yet read The Only Good Indians. The book stalked me, perched on my shelf, eyeing me to be its victim come spooky season. This year it finally caught me. Like the characters hunted by Elk Woman, once it had its hold on me I could think of nothing else, practically do nothing else but be dragged along its narrative of growing dread and violence. And I loved every moment of it. Jones has a nearly supernatural skill to craft so much horror, grief, humor and action onto the page, none of them competing for emotional space but instead amalgamating into something far greater and gripping. His stories are populated by endearing characters who open their hearts full of flaws and tattered hopes and Jones never shies away from sending them to violent ends. Here they are pitted in a race against an encroaching fate that manifests generations of grief and guilt into an apocalyptic atmosphere of almost certain doom. On the surface of The Only Good Indians is a truly terrifying monster tale that functions as a window into themes of indigenous identity and feelings of futility to escape guilt, poverty and reservation life as Jones demonstrates horror as a legitimate literary medium that will leave you chills.‘Thanksgiving was going to be an Indian holiday this year, with the four of them bringing in a haul like this.’Each turn of the page piles onto a growing sense of dread in this sharp and sinister novel. It opens on a scene of violent death--‘INDIAN MAN KILLED IN DISPUTE OUTSIDE BAR’ the headline reads, ‘thats one way to put it’ the character thinks, knowing it was a mysterious elk that really got him killed. But this does more than introduce the unique twist on a man vs. nature theme and immediately draws our attention to the violence and aggression faced by indigenous people in the US (indigenous people are 2.5 times as likely to experience violence compared to any other race, and 84.3% of women‘ it was like–he hates himself the most for this–it was probably what it was like a century and more ago, when soldiers gathered up on ridges above Blackfeet encampments to turn the cranks on their big guns, terraforming this new land for their occupation. Fertilize it with blood.’Their actions recalls the genocides that took the land from their people and corralled them into lives on reservations. Guilt chases us all through our lives, but this time it might be really out to get them in the form of Elk Woman.“We’re from where we’re from,” she says back. “Scars are part of the deal, aren’t they?”If this sounds a bit like I Know What You Did Last Summer set on a reservation, its probably because not only does The Only Good Indians pay homage to indigenous heritage but to the heritage of the genre as well. Jones discussed in an interview, that the book was crafted to be ‘wanted to write a slasher, but in the way a slasher hasn’t been done before’ and he makes creative use of many tropes here. Notably, Jones plays with a common, and unfortunately fairly racially insensitive horror trope of the “indian curse”—you know, the whole “don’t build a house on an Indian graveyard” thing—and re-appropriates it in the form of a curse now hunting Blackfeet (similarly, Jones title re-appropriates the infamous genocidal quote by US Army general-in-chief Phillip Henry Sheridan). But we have other elements as well, and I really appreciated the nod to “Final Girls” of horror fame by having Denorah be nicknamed “Finals Girl” by her father due to her basketball notoriety taking her team to the finals. What is quite fresh here, however, is the way horror tropes are used as a way to explore cultural identity, and one that the characters are always questioning themselves: what does it mean to be Blackfeet in the modern world? Consider the moment when they decide to hold a sweat to honor tradition:“There’s nothing, like, against doing it at night, is there?” Gabe asks.“Let me check the big Indian rule book,” Cassidy says. “Oh yeah. You can’t do anything, according to it. You’ve got to do everything just like it’s been done for two hundred years.”“Two thousand.”They laugh together.There is an undercurrent in the novel that ‘three-braid days are over and done with,’ that nobody is going around earnestly believing themselves the reincarnation of ‘Blood Clot Boy’, that the stereotypes used about their people have little to nothing to do with life on the reservation and there is a prevailing sadness about this:‘meaning the few of his ancestors who made it through raids and plagues, massacres and genocide, diabetes and all the wobbly-tired cars the rest of America was done with, they may as well have just stood up into that big Gatling gun of history, yeah?’There is a chilling desperation here, too, because nobody seems to be able to escape it. And in The Only Good Indians even when you think you’ve broken free, your curse comes to call.‘Really, Lewis imagines, he deserves some big Indian award for having made it to thirty-six without pulling into the drive-through for a burger and fries, easing away from diabetes and high blood pressure and leukemia. And he gets the rest of the trophies for having avoided all the car crashes and jail time and alcoholism on his cultural dance card. Or maybe the reward for lucking through all that—meth too, he guesses—is having been married ten years now to Peta, who doesn’t have to put up with motorcycle parts in the sink…’But back to the horror. Because this one really chilled me, I mean, I cut a midnight walk with my dog short because I couldn’t stop thinking about Elk Woman appearing in flashes between the passing boxcars of a train--this book gets INSIDE you. It helps that Jones is such a visual writer and all the jump scares and abrupt violence—of which there is plenty and I’ll never think of motorcycle engines the same again—registers as very cinematic. And for as clear as it is Jones truly cares about his characters, he also will kill them at any moment so it keeps you on your toes. Even the slower scenes in the middle make you wonder when everything will explode into gore. It’s all written with such care and I enjoyed discovering that the elk in the novel were inspired by the James Dickey poem A Birth, which you can read in full here but I find the opening stanza particularly alive in this novel:‘Inventing a story with grass, I find a young horse deep inside it.I cannot nail wires around him: My fence posts fail to be solid…’An aspect I found to be very successful is the way the horror is very psychological, with the quick reminders of their crime making them wonder if they are losing their grip on reality. ‘If animals came back to haunt the people who shot them, then the old-time Blackfeet would have had ghost buffalo so thick in camp they couldn't even walk around,’ Lewis thinks, but then he questions every sound and begins to question if friends are just an elk in disguise. Which is what really makes this story frightening: we can fear Elk Woman and her finally catching us, but what is more alarming is knowing she can push us to commit the atrocities for her. It speaks to the ways the characters think how many of their friends or families ruin their own lives, backed into crimes, drugs or alcoholism, and we see how quickly an argument can turn into violence. Because ‘when the whole world hurts, you bite it, don’t you?’ When asked what he hoped to communicate with this book, Stephen Graham Jones responded ‘Horror, man. If someone hesitates before turning the living room light off, if they’re counting the steps down a dark hall, than I’ve done what I’m here to do.’ I am about to post this and then shut off all the lights at work, and I’m already dreading the moment when I have to walk through the totally blackened bookstore with thoughts of Elk Woman in my head. Will her face rise above a shelf? I hope not. But thats how I know this book really worked for me, because I cannot stop thinking about it. It should be said too that there is a great humor mixed in, even in the frightening moments (c’mon, Lewis deciding someone has to go because they don’t catch the laugh line from a novel they both supposedly read is great). But there are also some truly visceral and wildly disquieting moments that I will likely never shake. The Only Good Indians should become a spooky season classic.4.5/5‘For them, ten years ago, that's another lifetime.For you, it's yesterday.’...more",Notes are private!,11,227,1,"Oct 06, 2023","Oct 06, 2023","Oct 06, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52180399-the-only-good-indians

Horrorstör by Grady HendrixSeeing how working a low-wage retail job is a quotidian nightmare, it naturally lends itself as a springboard into horror. Horrorstör by Grady Hendrix cartwheels and leaps off that springboard to yell cannonball right into a pool of blood, blending fear and funny for a wild and wicked ride of retail horror. Now I’m not talking the horror of the close-talkers, the arm touchers, the “if it doesn’t scan it must be free” types, the “you must be new here” folks, the “someone peed on the clothes in the fitting room” days, the “someone smeared poop on the bathroom wall” days, the “people are having sex in the fitting room where someone pooped on the wall” days, the register crashing on a Christmas season saturday, or even the “I can’t open another register because there is literally nobody else but me here” moments. Well, those too, but I’m talking economic anxiety manifesting into violent, deadly ghosts making the already-creepy afterhours of a retail store into a haunted house horrorfest that Shirley Jackson would swig her brandy and yell “oh HELL YEA!” at. Okay I can’t confirm the last part but IF SHE DID it would fit this book quite well. Hendrix comically spoofs retail work, turning motivational slogans and corporate workstructure into a kafkaesque comedy hellbent on tearing your sanity to shreds and then unleashes evil hellbent on tearing the employees to shreds. Which is what I imagine was about to happen to me one time if I hadn't just given up and agreed with a customer that Louise Penny's writing is ruined when translated into English from French (Oh they aren't translated, not everyone in Canada writes in French, but there was no convincing them). Who would have guessed building an IKEA-knock-off on a site of an old prison full of torture trauma could have been a bad idea?This was my first foray into Hendrix and I have to thank my cool coworker Taylor for basically forcing me to read this. YOU WERE RIGHT. This was so much fun and what starts as some biting satire that will have you laughing very abruptly turns into a gore-fest that will have you screaming. With fun mostly, but whew can Hendrix write some violence. I really vibed with the retail stuff and the oddball cast of characters forced into close proximity under the constant duress of customers now having to survive the night after an ill-advised séance goes awry. But I really loved how it is all a big metaphor for being underpaid, overworked, and feeling trapped in the spiral of slowly dying for the sake of someone else's stock profits. So great, now IKEA will seem scary. Though I still believe it would be a perfect place to hold down the fort during a zombie apocalypse.

The titular house in Starling House, the southern gothic fantasy from Alix E. Harrow, is not only a place around which many rumors are whispered but one where such discordant voices may just be waiting in its gloomy eaves just waiting to be heard. Starling House is a rather cozy horror that, despite an unfortunately slogging pace, wraps you up in irresistible prose and intoxicating, uneasy atmosphere as it teases out its secrets. Combing the legacy of Southern Gothic with a rather Beauty and the Beast-esque romance and other fairy tale elements, we watch as Opal goes from poverty and struggling to care for her younger brother into becoming caretaker of Starling House where it’s reclusive Warden holds back a shocking secret. Despite a story that is overly reliant on miscommunication and an ambitious narrative that doesn’t land all its tricks, Starling House is a satisfying and sinister good time that examines the way storytelling can reshape the truth and why some truths seem to be a vortex of violence. ‘He told me Hell was real, and so were its demons.’While I felt that this book was reaching to pull off too many techniques that, ultimately, felt unnecessary, it isn’t to saw Harrow is a bad writer. Quite the contrary, as this story really engulfs you in its dreariness and dread. It is a slow-burn narrative, one that is perhaps a bit stretched out, but it functions quite well as a thematic exploration of the ways the truths we try to bury will always return. Harrow raws on the tradition of American gothic writers, such as Nathaniel Hawthorne and Edgar Allan Poe, and the ways the focus is less on a specific evil but on the ways evils are folded into the very fiber of the past, such as an American legacy of colonialism and slavery. Though Harrow also figures into the legacy of women’s rage that speaks so sharply in the Southern Gothic and seems to channel many of the ideas of outsiders and moral frustrations that appear in the works of Flannery O'Connor and offers a specific Southern US setting. It is her first story to take place in home of Kentucky, something she spoke about in a conversation with NPR:‘This is the first book that I set fully in, like committed to writing about Kentucky…One of the reasons that I had found that difficult to do before is because I find it to be a place of very mixed experiences that I love very, very, very much, and which has just an incredible violence and terror to it.’That legacy of violence and terror is certainly present here, in the ways that, like the best of Southern Gothic, grotesqueries and spooky settings tend to function as a symbol of past sins that seep like shed blood towards the present.‘Starling House makes me think of an underfed pet or a broken doll, a thing unloved by the person who promised to love it best.’Starling House is the perfect symbol of all the silenced rage and sacrificed lives that haunt the town if one knows under which rocks of history to look. It is a house that calls to Opal all her life.‘Because I dreamed of Starling House long before I ever saw it. Because sometimes when the light slants soft through the west windows and turns the dust mots into tiny golden fireflies I like to pretend the house belongs to me, or that I belong to it.’Though, as readers learn, this is no ordinary haunted house. In his introduction for the novel Burnt Offerings, horror author Stephen Graham Jones offers two distinctions of haunted houses: the Stay Away Houses and the Hungry Houses. Jone’s explains that Stay Away one's drive people away but‘Hungry Houses aren't complete without people to digest for reasons or decades or centuries,’ though here we have an interesting twist that the house—more a character than a setting itself—draws people in to keep to care for it and protect the secrets it holds dear. The way Harrow excels at making settings a character is really wonderful and in keeping with many gothic themes, though the town itself feels rather underutilized, more existing off-page or in history than really engaged with in the present. This is an aspect of the novel overall that felt rather lackluster. There is a lot of potential for town itself to feel like a character, either cloyingly or comfortingly, (which is something that Stephen King has long been known for executing with incredible results) though it almost feels like an afterthought after the initial set-up. Characters like the librarian in particular—I often find helpful librarian characters to be eyerollingly saccharine caricatures of the field or only serve as twee nods (see also: vocational awe) but here she felt really authentic and to function the way a modern library setting would to the point where I wonder if Harrow has worked in libraries—or even the brother feel under used. And E. Starling, who seems should be a major figure in the book, gets far too little page time. There are a lot of little strands that either fall flat or seem left underexplored and occasionally it felt like Harrow was trying to pack in as many tropes or ideas as possible to appeal to a vast variety of “to read” lists instead of doing any of them particularly well. Two examples are how, while racism comes up here, it feels more just a nod and under examined which is a shame as it fits really well into the major themes of Southern Gothic, and a character is briefly mentioned as bisexual almost as if to say “put this on library lists for LGBTQ books, please” rather than earnest attempts at representation (as someone who is pansexual it’s like…oh yay rep but also seems just something an author can say without having to explore and still have a straight relationship so is it really?). I also appreciated the footnotes (which do sort of get explained) but she abandons the technique a third of the way through the book and makes it feel tacked on rather than integrated.Harrow does a good job, however, at stradling the line between YA and adult fiction and I think this is a book that would really appeal to readers of both genres. That said, I think this might have worked better as a YA. The horror elements are fairly tame (its almost cozy), the romance (which feels very unearned and out of nowhere) isn’t exactly spicy, and the characters felt much more like older teens than adults. Opal especially feels more like a fiery teenage character with too much on her plate than a mid-twenties woman struggling to feed her brother in a rent-free hotel room. ‘I slam the door as I leave, because if you’re going to act like a hormonal teenager you might as well commit to the role,’ she says at one point, and I think this would have benefitted to Harrow commiting to Opal’s role by making her a teen. ‘The house has always had a taste for the brave ones.’I did like the characters, however. Arthur, who seems an allusion to the similarly reclusive Arthur “Boo” Radley from To Kill a Mockingbird, is constantly mentioned as being ugly. This ties into the Beauty and the Beast allusions, but it also is part of a larger theme that what is considered ugly is cast aside and ignored. It is, perhaps, almost gratuitous how much Opal talks about how ugly he is (but then almost like flicking a lightswitch is in love with him) but it does seem to fit the themes quite well.‘They averted their eyes from evil, and in doing so, became complicit in it.’What does really work is the exploration of how a place can be trapped or haunted by the past. Opal is given a multi-figure offer to dig up some secrets by the Big Bad Company of the novel and decides to do some digging for her own sake (for a character that is supposed to be really intelligent, she is always the last to know and not since reading Verity have I so much wanted to shout “pay attention to the important clues oh my god what are you doing”). We discover so many histories are enfolded inside, and each time she probes another voice emerges adding a new dimension to the tale, rewriting previously believed histories and often adding more layers of mystery than questions answered. ‘I was a songbird in a den of foxes, and they were so hungry.’Power, we see, is often about shaping history for the purpose of the powerful. It is how stories fall through the cracks, or get reconfigured into something far from the truth. And then go to great lengths to ensure their version becomes the “history,” which, as anyone who has read the gothic tales can attest, tend to be the reason why ghosts and ghouls come screaming back from the grave.‘They simply told themselves a different story, one that was easier to believe because they’d heard it before: Once there was a bad woman who ruined a good man. Once there was a witch who cursed a village. Once there was an odd, ugly girl whom everyone hated, because it was safe to hate her.’Which all works really well and leads to a rather exciting conclusion, though for a novel that felt stretched out the climax (which is, admittedly, rather emotionally lovely and tender) feels rather rushed. Starling House is a rather thrilling, slow-burn gothic fantasy that was tough to put down. While I may have been rather critical, overall it is quite enjoyable and just felt like it needed more polishing to smooth out the elements and pacing. Those who enjoy gothic tales, fantasy and a bit of romance will find much to enjoy here and while this wasn’t my favorite it makes me really want to read Harrow’s earlier tales.

Okay, sure, I guess surviving the experience without a traumatic time is better, especially when a bit of twisted fun devolves into a hellish nightmare as it does in Kalynn Bayron’s YA horror novel You’re Not Supposed to Die Tonight. Meet Cassidy, The Final Girl. Well at least she plays one every night throughout the summer at Camp Mirror Lake’s slasher survivor experience where guests play to take part in a survival horror game in honor of a classic movie filmed at the camp where the staff prides themselves on realism and fear is guaranteed. Except there might be more to the camp than the teenage staff realizes, and Cassidy might have to put her Final Girl skills to the test and truly survive when real blood starts to be shed. And suddenly the idea of being the “final” survivor is more frightening when her own girlfriend is also a potential victim. A fun and frightening romp that pays homage to horror tropes while using them in exciting ways, You’re Not Supposed to Die Tonight keeps the tension building, the twists coming one after the next, and will have you frantically flipping pages as if to keep ahead from a killer hot on your trail.‘I’ve been playing the part of a girl who escapes a serial killer every night for months. It’s not a game this time. The consequences are real, but we still have to play.’I couldn’t put this one down. It’s a breeze of a read that teases you forward with mystery after mystery and keeps building tension that ensures you can’t look away. Like the games the staff create, everything seems a bit manufactured but easily ignored when caught up in the thrill. Sure, some of it is a bit of a stretch in order to make the plot work, but Bayron does a good job at checking the perimeter of her plot and ensuring to address those concerns within the narrative. It works and adds to the fun, plus its a horror thriller and as long as the main inner-logic plays out in an enjoyable way that's what matters most. Honestly though, if you are doing a tribute to horror film tropes, you are allowed plot holes because plot holes are more or less a horror film trope.It does take a bit to get really going, but it keeps you on your toes and she does an excellent job and brewing up tension. By a quarter of the way in I was already screaming “get the hell out of there--go, go, go!” because lets be real, I see someone tossing bodies in a lake, I’m saying fuck this job and I’m fucking off down the road. Say hi to the killer for me! Okay, but the missing staff bit combined with the fact that abruptly up and leaving isn’t really a thing you can just do did seem like a way overlooked red flag someone should have checked on, but whatever its fun and I enjoyed the all-too-relatable humor of shit talking the people who left you short handed. Also the humor that addresses group dynamics such as, say, your tough guy boyfriend leaves you to be caught by the killer so he can escape. Girl, leave him. I enjoyed the nods to different slasher films that all felt natural to the story instead of a *wink wink, look at what I know about* namedrop, particularly the character Paige rattling off horror film logic and the rules to surviving a la that one kid in the original Scream where being a virgin is ironically the only good thing he has going for him. Oh and I enjoyed that this doesn’t shirk from the blood and gore and also doesn’t go over the top with it. Heads up if you are squeamish, there’s some good quality massacring here. It all comes together pretty well with a shadowy past and equally shadowy villains to uncover that falls into the supernatural side of things. There is a convoluted climax scene that sticks the landing well enough and I must admit I got my fun and frights from this one. I also enjoyed the characters—plenty of Black and queer representation in this one—who managed to be fun and varied without being annoying or overly tropey (okay, Cassidy is a total Final Girl cliche but it leans into that because its sort of the whole point of the book). You’re Not Supposed to Die Tonight is an exciting ride that will work well for a wide audience from teens to adults and while it might show its own inner mechanics a bit, it does so in a way that works itself into the plot as if painted in camouflage.

While a few story in the writer and translator’s newest collection, Our Strangers, last several pages, the vast majority are confined to a single page and many contain only a few brief lines. Such is the case of ‘Late Afternoon’, which reads in its entirety ’How long the shadow is, / coming across the counter, / from this grain of salt.’ This succinctly captures the magic of these micro-fictions: a tiny grain of salt casting what appears to be, comparatively, a long shadow that stretches deep into our thoughts. She is amazing, and what is equally amazing is that Our Strangers is the flagship publication from Bookshop Editions who have a mission to only sell through indie bookstores and will uphold Davis’ pledge to not sell her books on Amazon. It is a new expansion from Bookshop.org, who offer the infrastructure for indie bookstores to have a digital storefront and deliver books anywhere by mail, an important aspect to be competitive with Amazon to ensure those with barriers such as mobility or lack of a nearby bookstore are accommodated. A charmingly quirky, humorous and rather ponderous collection of stories, Our Strangers yet again shows Lydia Davis is a master of her own game as an expert wordsmith.Davis has incredible insight into how the slightest changes of words can open up whole avenues of thought, something likely perfected during her work as a translator (notably Swann's Way and Madame Bovary) as well as a writer. Perception plays a big part of this collection with many stories nudging how the interplay of words can affect that. A couple in one story are confused when, upon entering a restaurant on a Sunday, are told ‘the restaurant only serves breakfast on Sundays.’ Do they serve only breakfast that day or is it only on Sundays that they serve breakfast? Similarly, in a series of stories about a man’s deceased father, he questions ‘Do I have a father, or did I have a father?’ and how the words we choose shape how we think about a situation. This sort of thing is like catnip for me, I can’t get enough. I’ve long loved Davis’ work, though sometimes I would wonder if the stories are particularly deep in miniature or if I’m choosing to see them this way differently than others because I’m going in with the Davis-expectations and do I give more space to explore the sentences because I expect them to unfold in ways I wouldn’t with other writers? Sort of how in one story here she questions if a lamp is actually ugly or if it is because the rest of the store is ugly it would be assumed the lamp is too. I thought about that a lot here and have concluded, yes, they do unfold in miraculous ways but so much of that is by the way she crafts everything to specifically entice you to investigate further. For starters, they are short so it doesn’t feel daunting but also the interplay of words and how they affect perception bait us into further analysis. Some stories, for example, are printed with short lines like a poetry format, inviting your mind to slow down and interpret it like a poem. Davis has such an excellent handle on phrasing and formatting that psychologically encourages the reader to look further without us even realizing it and it all feels so warm and inviting that readers' natural rhythm slows down to look at the sentence level the way you’d slowly walk through a field of flowers taking them all in. Beauty in the miniature.Speaking of proximity, I was charmed by the series of stories all titled Claim to Fame that poke fun at the way we brag proximity to celebrities as if that makes us more noteworthy by proxy. ‘Karl Marx and my father both had daughters,’ she writes in the second one, ‘both daughters grew up to become translators. Both translated Gustave Flaubert’s Madame Bovary’ (Marx’s daughter, Eleanor Marx translated numerous works by Gustave Flaubert and Henrik Ibsen and was a writer and social activist herself). I feel series stories work better for me in this one than the dream series in her previous book, Can’t and Won’t, and I enjoyed the thread of themes through this whole collection on subjects like marriage, aging, death and, fun enough: bugs.I also really enjoy the effort to be competitive with Amazon and creating a press to do so. ‘We all have to have a stake in our community and an investment in our community,’ Davis says, ‘and I don’t feel that Amazon has a stake in anything except its own profit..and it made me furious that bookstores were being outsold or undercut by this bully, Amazon.’ This reminds me of the Indie Vault that Ingram has recently set up to ensure indie bookstores would have access to print runs that Amazon was previously purchasing in their entirety to ensure no other outlets would access to a new title for a month or so. Good luck to Davis and bookshop.org.Our Strangers is a lovely little collection that brought all my love for Lydia Davis right back in full. A joy of a read and a true treat for those who love wordplay or appreciating a story on a molecular sentence level, Our Strangers reminds us that the concept of a “story” is rather pliable and so much more than just a plot.4.5/5...more",Notes are private!,10,137,1,not set,not set,"Sep 30, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/125346444-our-strangers

Here our fearless PI, John Persons, is hired by a young kid with ‘the stare of someone three times his age and something twice as dangerous’ to kill his stepfather. All for the payment of whatever is in the boy’s piggybank, though what lurks inside the stepfather is far more sinister, far less human, and liable to devour all of London. Khaw writes with such confidence and cool, bringing a visceral tale of tentacles and sci fi body horror to life in the tough guy tones of classic noir speech and swagger. A short novella that teases a far larger context where the reader is mostly lost in the fog but can piece together enough from the snippets we pick up, Hammers on Bone is hardboiled, hard hitting and a hell of a lot of fun.‘You don’t stop where the money ends. You find out where they’re all coming from and you take them out. You hear?’I wish there was better term than Lovecraftian because it dredges up feelings about his thematic xenophobia (I wrote about that a bit here), but he did inspire a lot of writers and Hammers on Bone does fit the category. I do enjoy seeing authors making good use of his vibes of lurking menace and eerie cult-like communities without making the whole quiet alien invasion a metaphor of replacement theory while still making it feel like humanity is teetering on the edge of a precipice we aren’t even yet aware exists. As a sucker for anything noir, I really enjoyed the way Khaw infuses the cosmic horror with the gritty noir narration and general shadowy aesthetics. It’s like X-Files meets Chinatown and while you should be aware it does retain a lot of the misogynistic terminology of old noir films, the aspects of antiquated speech full of snarky comebacks, stakeouts, gun-totting standoffs ‘or any of the other metaphors familiar to noir’ are quite a fun time. It may be a bit jarring as the story is set more of less present day London (a Tesla factory was my first tip-off to anchor the timeline), though it does seem that the noir speech is sort of an act the being inside Persons is playing for effect. For the reader or for some other reason is unclear, but it does seem self aware it doesn’t necessarily fit and I think its kind of awesome Khaw did it anyways. Honestly, I just think Khaw is super cool and while I understand complaints of “overwriting,” I just eat it up. It’s wonderfully executed and its sci-fi noir so why not? I’m on board and I plan on reading more. And you can’t stop me bwahahaha (please read this in noir villain voice. I’d like a cool mustache for this role too). But she does pick themes and mine the lexicon to full effect. For noir aspects we get some great lines line ‘a switchblade chill,’ or a street ‘ wears the fog like a dame’s best scarf, slightly jaunty, with an edge of challenge,’ and of course there has to be some punchy line about being a tough guy with a heart of gold, especially around the ladies:‘I’m not one for a fine touch. I’m a man. I barrel through life, guns blazing, asking questions rarely. For her, though, I’ll dig through my guts for the right approach.’And the femme fatale here is introduced reading a copy of Dune so extra cool points to her. I do love the line ‘The cry of the gun is loud as the death of stars,’ as it perfectly blends both the noir and the sci-fi elements in one, snappy line. Then we have the horror aspects. The language is visceral and ‘throbbing with polyps and wet tissue, with tendrils,’ it’s all blood and bones and sinew and its delightfully gross as fuck. Khaw does gross violence very well in a way that is unsettling but never feels immoderate or upsetting and--wait, can I say that? If gross violence can be tasteful and pleasant, Khaw nails it. I think it’s just that her writing is so poetic and if its gross it is gorgeously so.‘No room for the damned’There is certainly a larger context than the book gives you explanation for, and the epilogue gives you clues but much of it is half-answers where you aren’t even sure of the question. Personally I kind of loved that, like, yea there's a larger thing going on that is beyond my comprehension and no I’m not getting to find out what it is (it’s a mystery book at heart) the way you feel mid-mystery mini-series. I’m not sure if Khaw intends to write more to provide a larger explanation (there is a second book, A Song for Quiet, which is a prequel and I don’t know how much it provides on that front) but I think it’s just fine as is. I do see how that might bother some readers, but I think the reaching towards something you can’t understand fits the cosmic horror mystery vibe and as a kid catching tv shows only in nonsequential reruns I guess I just got used to having to piece together or assume context. This is a quick little read full of a lot of impact and entertainment. The blending of all the elements might not always flow seamlessly, but I kind of appreciate it for what it is and it’s a nice, gross, and horrific little ride. Khaw rules and Hammers on Bones is an eerie little menacing book.4/5...more",Notes are private!,10,76,1,"Sep 28, 2023","Sep 29, 2023","Sep 28, 2023",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/30199328-hammers-on-bone

It loves us all. It just ... loves the rules more.’A good fairy tale opens up the world and society the way a reader opens u‘The Market does love me. It loves us all. It just ... loves the rules more.’A good fairy tale opens up the world and society the way a reader opens up, lets say, a fairy tale book and reads the deeper complexities hiding under the surface of its cover. What we find there is often both strange yet familiar, and like the hero’s journey we embark into these fantastical realms to return with a lesson for our own world. In an Absent Dream, the fourth novella in Seanan McGuire’s enchanting Wayward Children series, discusses how ‘reality, it must sadly be said, has a way of complicating things, even things we might believe could never be that complicated,’ and that concepts of fairness and markets might be complex no matter how we fair we try to make them. Enter the world of the Goblin Market, ‘a place where dreamers go when they don’t fit in with the dreams their homes think worth dreaming,’— it is surely inspired by Christina Rossetti’s Goblin Market poems both for the market and the shared theme on the importance of sisters—a place where “fairness” is enforced and those who violate are transfigured into birds. Readers will remember Katherine Lundy from the first book, and here we see exactly how the mysteriously backward-aging girl came to be. Always a dark delight, this fourth volume of the series is another excellent look at fantastical logic and magical lands, this time probing the difficult decisions not only around if one would actually want to stay or return home, but what home even means.‘The Goblin Market had seemed like a beautiful adventure on her first visit, a place where the rules made sense and the penalties were fair. Then it had become something terrible, a place where friends could die and not come back. Maybe the truth was somewhere in the middle of those two things, but now she understood how much there was to lose, and she was afraid.’As always, McGuire presents us with a child for whom a trip into a magical land seems like both a curse and a blessing. Here we meet Lundy in her early youth—‘She was ordinary. She was remarkable. Of such commonplace contradictions are weapons made.’—which is all the more tragic knowing what we already know but McGuire tells such engrossing tales we can set that all aside and just enjoy the ride. Plus I absolutely adore when McGuire writes about bookish people:‘In the way of bookish children, she carried her books into trees and along the banks of chuckling creeks, weaving her way along their slippery shores with the sort of grace that belongs only to bibliophiles protecting their treasures.’While this series already has a lot of world building at its disposal, I appreciate that each book dispenses with easy readymades and always creates something that feels very fresh for the series. The Market is fascinating and really challenges us to consider ideas of fairness and what “fair value” truly means. There is no currency, only a sort of barter system designed to keep people from taking advantage of each other.‘There is wanting and there is needing, and when you want, you can make good choices, but when you need, it’s important the people around you not be looking to take advantage. When there are no clear prices, only the nebulous idea of ‘fair value,’ people get hurt. People get cheated.’At first glance it may seem like a critique of either capitalism or any anti-capitalist system depending on how you view it, but I feel it is not so direct and more a critique on how ideas of value and fairness are subjective and that a “perfect” system is an impossible idea. As Ursula K. Le Guin once wrote, ‘‘Every eutopia contains a dystopia, every dystopia contains a eutopia,’ for all the intentions on fairness here, things sometimes just don’t always feel humane. ‘Sometimes 'fair' is bigger than just you. Sometimes ‘fair’ has to think about what’s best for everyone,’ Lundy is told, but there is also the clever notion that our Earthly ideas of fairness are formed in a very unfair and unjust world so we couldn’t possibly grasp the exact meaning of fairness as the Market understands it. And the Market demands strict adherence to the rules ‘It doesn’t let any of us break them. It punishes us when it has to, because the rules have to be for everyone if they’re going to be for anyone.’ To me, this book recalls all those moments where children are told, as if a valid justification for anything, that ‘lifes not fair.’ McGuire is so good at capturing little childhood feelings, fears, or lessons and turning them into stories that are charming to a wide range of ages.‘For there is no friend like a sister / In calm or stormy weather’- Christina RossettiDrawing from the source of Rossetti’s Goblin Market, a poem about the adventures of two sisters, the later portion of this book really pits the Market against the love of a sister and makes Lundy’s decisions a whole lot harder to make. While the idea of home seems tenuous at times—is it the real world where she feels outcasted, or is it the Market where things can go very wrong—we see her realize “home” can be a person as well. There are some lovely thoughts on sisterhood here: ‘Let us speak, for a moment, on the matter of sisters. They can be enemies to fight or companions to lean upon: they can, at times, be strangers. They are not required to be friends, or to have involvement in one another's lives, or to be anything more than strangers united by the circumstances of their birth. Still, there is a magic in the word ""sister,"" a magic which speaks of shared roots and hence shared branches, of a certain ease that is always to be pursued, if not always to be found.’Moments like these really endear you to the characters and make the book all the more heartbreaking. Friendships are tested, pitted against sisterhood, and all the while we must wonder what is truly fair value. ‘You forgot that sometimes, fair value comes from change, and death, and sacrifice. You can’t have everything and give fair value.’These books are such brief but powerful little bursts of dark, delightful joy and I’m so glad I have many more left. While perhaps not the strongest so far this was still a wonderful, wild, and mind bending ride and I can’t wait to read the next. McGuire is masterful at fairy tales and I’d encourage everyone to try this series out.4/5...more",Notes are private!,12,69,1,not set,not set,"Sep 26, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/38244358-in-an-absent-dream

Which is a shame because the premise sounded like something I’d really enjoy with a religious cult overrunning a small town that emboldens all the horrific bigotry that wasn’t even trying to hide under the surface that well, but even the fancy and fun brick designs on every page couldn’t bring this story to life. I should have trusted myself and how much I felt wildly underwhelmed by their viral short story, Things Have Gotten Worse Since We Last Spoke, but LaRocca keeps putting out books and I figured they’ve gotta be getting better, right? Ehhh. It doesn’t help that the writing is clunky and sort of reeks of trying, and while with horror suspending disbelief is something I’m totally fine with, theres a difference between glossing over plot holes for the sake of fun and feeling inauthentic even in the novel’s own inner logic. This falls hard into the second category. Good writing can make even unlikely scenes or actions feel at least contextually justified, but here it feels so in service to the plot you wonder if the words are getting paid to SCAB.Sorry, maybe this was for you and I usually give horror a lot of grace with the way issues are handled because, well, it’s horror and it is intended to unsettle and disturb, but there’s a way to use disturbing elements to create a larger theme and overall purpose and then there’s just vomiting out the most fucked up thing you can think of to make people squirm. Without a “why,” the latter begins to feel hollow and you shiver it off pretty quickly and much of this book feels like it is searching for a “why” instead of leading us to it and over-seasoning the narrative with shocks instead of delivering something worth devouring underneath. Feeling very overstuffed while ultimately shallow and with some problematic executions, Everything the Darkness Eats is a total misfire that aims to shock but ends up being merely annoying,It is a shame this was a let down, but there is a really strong rise in literary horror that functions as a brilliant investigation into queer identities or cultural insights from authors usually left out of the conversation long dominated by straight white men and seeing how effectively those have been handled really made this pale by comparison. This just didn’t offer much beyond edgelord shocks and bad plott and, sure, there is the message that bigotry like homophobia and ableism is bad, and religious trauma is really harmful, but none of that feels fresh here and the insights into that feel either very shallow or underexplored when the only tool for excavation are shocks that don’t add up to much. Tell Me I’m Worthless is a good example of a book that manages to have extremely disturbing scenes that all culminate for a deep, dark investigation into fascism and transphobia. A lot of what I wrote about their short story (read all that here) still stands in Everything the Darkness Eats as well, and it feels like such a wasted opportunity. Also, in a story where erasing events that happened is a large element, it feels like LaRocca is playing with traumas like sexual assault rather blithely in a way that isn’t effective and just seems uncool. Plus the whole “well at least the person who led the group of people all sexually assaulting me is sexy” was…yikes. This book is going to upset people, but not in a fun spooky way more just in a hey maybe people with disabilities and sexual assault survivors being seemingly exploited isn’t enjoyable.Furthermore a lot of the story just doesn’t work. It comes together at the very end in a rather forced way and there’s very little take-away.

I can see others enjoying the novel if cheap shocks are your thing, but it just felt pretty empty and hollow to me.

Even if that first sting of love is short and bittersweet, it often lingers like a shadow laying long across the landscape of the self. In Brazilian author Stênio Gardel’s The Words That Remain, a long lost first love quietly lingering as it remains folded inside a letter given to our narrator who is unable to read and ‘grew old wishing to know what it said.’ Having spent his life running from pain and homophobia, Raimundo spends the twilight years of his life learning to read in order to finally know the words his first lover, Cícero, hidden in the silence of the page much like queer relationships such as their own had to be kept hidden away from society. Told in a kaleidoscopic fashion transferring perspectives and frequently jumping all along the timeline on bridges of emotion and memory, the story is delivered in a steady stream of poetic prose—the English translation by Bruna Dantas Lobato is quite gorgeous and was certainly no simple task making it apparent why this is a strong contender for the National Book Award for Translation—that all culminates to quite a powerful experience. Heartbreaking yet hopeful and full of deep symbolism, The Words That Remain is a succinct and poetic expression on the resilience of queer people to be able to be themselves in the face of oppression and the way we carry and shift love across a lifetime.‘I’ve been on so many roads, but I only wandered like that because I had to, hunting the distance, which only got farther and farther…’I was awed by the sheer beauty of the writing in The Words That Remain, often arriving in long, run on sentences that make you feel as out of breath from their emotion as the characters using language to process their experiences. There are abrupt shifts along the timeline and between perspectives, leaving the reader to piece it together which can sometimes be jarring and confusing even when it works well but also seems to capture the instability experienced by the characters. Language is seen as a way to capture beauty, sort of how Raimundo views Cícero’s name, ‘Only six letters, but it could hold so much.’ The irony of the story is that Raimundo cannot read or write, having been brought up in a rural laborers home where ‘father said writing was for people who don’t need to put food on the table,’ and the hardships of working class poverty chase him his entire life around Brazil. And then there is the letter. ‘Cícero’s letter. Which was half-blessed, half-cursed, wholly mysterious,’ a symbol both of the love that was taken from them by beating from their respective fathers that send them running away from home and a constant reminder to Raimundo of his isolation from society, ‘because ignorance does that, excludes, isolates, and didn’t I live in isolation?’ But his isolation also comes from having to hide who he is, always fearing he will be exposed as a gay man and cast out because of it. ‘I’ll defend myself. I like men, but I still am one,’ and that desire to be seen as a man often brings a lot of internalized (and outward) homophobia. Which can get a bit rough to read, heads up, particularly the way his close relationship with Suzzanny begins with violent transphobia. In a way I was reminded a bit of McGlue by Ottessa Moshfegh though this is much more tender and optimistic.‘The stars must have fallen and become the seeds of reality at his feet.’The attitudes towards queerness are harsh and tragic here. We see Raimundo’s father beat him even after we learn the sad fate of the father’s brother, Dalberto, who ‘was half of his heart, the half he lost to the river and to his father’s tough fist.’ Even though we see him think ‘I wanted to stay by your side, to pull you out of the water as many times as you needed,’ we see him still succumb to fear and hurt his son for the very same thing. It is fear, fear ‘this can only take you to the bottom of the river or under the ground,’ and telling his son he is on a ‘path of death.’ This also seeps into the two lovers, feeling their experiences together was ‘A good taste, but that left something sour in the back of their minds.' They can't even feel good about feeling loved when so much of their lives has been teaching them to feel shame over it.So much of this is symbolized in the cross left where the uncle took his last breath, ‘the cross that marked the river and that would mark [Raimundo’s] life,’ which not only stands as a symbol of remembrance of the horrors committed and lives lost, but also that society tries to justify their homophobia through religion. The lack of the cross when Raimundo is older represents the changing attitudes in society, but also the removal of the cross reflects the removal of the shame he felt. ‘A man liking another man is not a death sentence, it’s a life sentence, full of life, I felt full of life.’Shame makes up a large part of the novel, the way the father ‘only saw my shame,’ and the way his shame becomes self-hatred. The river from his hometown becomes rather symbolic of shame and there is a motif of drowning, both literal and metaphorically, throughout such as how shame registers ‘like my body is filled with stones.’ But we must let go of shame, and be who we really are. ‘Shame was of no use to me, what it did was open the door to the street, and when the door closed behind me, with the whole street out in front of me, the whole world out in front of me, I let go of shame’s hand.’I love the way Gardel juxtaposes the image of letting go of shame’s hand with Raimundo’s desire to never let go of Cícero’s hand even if people see them together. But this also keys into a major theme of the novel: change. There is a campfire story about the devil offering change for the price of one’s soul, something we see haunts Cícero, but as the novel progresses we can see how change can actually free your soul. I quite enjoy how this is so well represented by the concept of poetry as Raimundo learns it in his reading classes: ‘Our teacher explained words in poems mean more than they seem, words are stretched, so where words alone can’t go, with poetry they can, they fly, like the bird, the bird that can hear loud silences, that can open up dawns, shrink rivers, horizon stretchers, only words can do that!’Just like poetry can change what words are and can do, love can change a person and embracing one’s true self can do the same. We see that with Suzzanny being more than just her body, and we see the way love can change the context of how we see the world, when ‘I made the decision to see the world differently’‘their embrace irrigated the deep roots inside them, which clung to their guts and everything else inside them. Even their souls. And the roots turned their veins into sap and grew through their pores like branches climbing toward the sun. When they touched, they became entangled and turned into a single stalk, with a flower that opened on their chest. Yellow poppy in a blood red sepal.’It is often said that first loves cut the deepest, and that sting can remain for a long time. Yet, they also say time can heal and how often as the years go by and new loves meld with us that the sting fades and what were painful memories now feel safe to touch. And while there was ‘a lifetime kept in that letter,’ will the words still mean the same thing when read many decades after they were written? Can we change when we are no longer ashamed of ourselves, and can our resilience in the face of aggression brought on by bad faith fear lead to happier times ahead? The Words That Remain drags us through tragedy but has an optimistic heart at its core, one that is full of striking imagery and phrases that are nearly overwhelming in their beauty. This is quite a moving read.4.5/5‘even in old age we don’t stop wishing for something, the point of life is to keep going.’...more",Notes are private!,20,198,1,"Sep 22, 2023","Sep 22, 2023","Sep 22, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/61911382-the-words-that-remain

The new data shows an alarming 65% surge from the previous year for a total of 1, 247 demands to remove 4,240 unique titles among other library services. This represents a 92% increase in titles challenged in public libraries while schools saw an 11% increase. For context, the previous year’s data revealed 700 attempts to ban 1,915 titles. And these are just the challanges we know about as  an estimated 82-97% of challanges go unreported. So we are seeing continued surges in these challenges and bans (PEN America compiles an index of them all here), as well as an increase in harassment and threats of violence against public educators and library staff such as the alarming number of libraries that have been forced to close due to bomb threats. And while 69% of people oppose book bans by government officials and 65% by school or library boards, the problem continues to increase with more than 150 bills in 35 states to restrict access to books and punish library workers.First, a challenge is an attempt to restrict access to a title, a ban is a removal, which is important to keep in mind when reading the usually sensationalized reporting on the topic of attacks on intellectual freedoms. The majority of these challenges come from a small number of people—in 2002 just 11 people were behind 60% of all bans—andgroups like Moms for Liberty, Citizens Defending Freedom and Parents' Rights in Education have been rallying people as book ban hobbyists in order to relentlessly attack despite having little to no substance behind their complaints. Mom’s For Liberty, who have been linked to issues of harassment and violence, are associated with many white supremacist and other extremist groups, and have been designated as a hate organization, tend to throw a lot into the media without context or via willful ignorance to inflate the appearance of issues or generate clicks. For instance, a recent claim of censorship when a library denied a purchase request for a book was made without the context that it was Amazon kindle exclusive meaning physical copies don’t exist and Kindle does not sell libraries ebook rights. Similarly, many of the bills are unenforceable and show no understanding on how library collection development or checkouts actually operate, it is primarily grandstanding with public tax dollars in hopes of dissuading people from working in libraries.This is part of a larger issue with social media ""meme activism"" that betrays a lack of seriousness through sensationalism, always on the attack without a coherent platform of opinions. This was recently writ large when the influencer behind LibsofTikTok was unable to produce any answers to her opinions when questioned in an interview, resorting to reversals or distractions instead. What was once a culture war has now become shallow marketing, such as a long-shot Missouri GOP candidate burning books with a flamethrower as part of a donation ad. It is all merely outrage marketing for attention, the issues are interchangeable. Update: the remainder of this  is from 2023, but still applicable todayThese challenges and bans are deeply unpopular, but keep happening and are also part of a coordinated effort to flood local boards and dismantle public institutions, books are just part of the method towards that goal. So let’s talk about this a bit, particularly the language around it and actually useful ways to uphold the freedom to read (for the scope of this, it will all be US book bans in public institutions, though everyone should not it occurs elsewhere and that US prisons have the highest level of book banning), but first, here are the most banned books from the ‘22-’23 school year.  [image]61% of the books that were banned are YA titles, and 75% are fictional stories. It should also be noted that while districts are giving lip service to the idea of book removal boards, 96% of the removed titles were done so without following the ALA's removal procedure. This is a violation of intellectual freedoms but also the Library Bill of Rights.Last year, I discussed a lot of the issues around Book banning here so for this I’m going to take a different angle. Namely, I’d really like to talk about how much language is important to everything here. There is something to note about the shift in book challenges from the past year. Here are the reasons given over the past 3 years:  [image]Now compare that to the reasons given for the ‘22-’23 school year:  [image]Now this might seem that attacks on books that involve queer or Black characters is declining, however this isn’t exactly the case as those are still the most frequently challenged but are being challenged under the guise of other reasons (ie. violence). But what else is eyebrow raising is the issue of “wellbeing” being a reason, such as this week the book Red: A Crayon's Story was banned in a North Carolina district despite not having any mention of gender or sexuality but for promoting the idea of “be yourself.” This is rolled into pushback against teaching about mental health, personal boundaries, or even concepts like sharing and friendship which organizations like No Left Turn, Mom’s For Liberty or other right-wing groups have deemed “marxist education”. Interesting to note, the attacks on schools have risen but tend to not be from people involved with the schools.   [image]I’d be willing to bet you’d see a similar result with public libraries and change “parent” to “uses library card”. Part of this abuse of rhetoric is pushing these beliefs that schools, libraries and books are engaged in activities or “pushing an agenda” that is completely fictionalized and marketed for political clout. And people are profiting off of it at the expense of the public. Let’s look at that really quickly as it is a growing issue and one my community is currently having issues with that has been making national news as a group of right wing business partners dubbed Ottawa Impact orchestrated a takeover of the county board position (most running unopposed after several candidates dropped out due to threats of violence against their families) and have been using that to defund all public health services as well as push against libraries and public schools. Attacking ideas of wellbeing like mental or sexual health has been a cornerstone of their position, and members of this group organized and defunded a local library just last year over three books, one being Gender Queer: A Memoir. They also dismantled the county DEI committees and labeled anyone involved in one as a Marxist and groomer (yay, I’m on the library DEI committee, so fun for me). We are seeing a complete attack on language, with librarians or public health workers being called “groomers” just for acknowledging queer people exist while people like Joe Moss, the head of the organization and widely rumored to have a history of sexual misconduct, states in his campaign platform that he and his organization oppose the concept of sexual consent—which he refers to as ‘marxist’ concept—specifically ‘between a child and an adult’. This board also passed a law to “protect the innocence of children” without stating in any way what that means despite being asked directly, but now can defund or demonize any organization or person they deem to have violated this. Not only have people lost jobs (the entire health dept is days away from being defunded and shuttered while board members have taken massive raises and hired family members at increased pay rates) but public employees are spotlighted for harassment in the community. What started with attacking a library is now a county wide issue.‘The revolt against brutality begins with a revolt against the language that hides that brutality.’-Rebecca SolnitWhich makes a lot of the book challenges seem pretty absurd when using language like pornography and grooming which is in no way true to these books. Recently a school in my county banned the book Jarhead  for being “an unpatriotic stance on the US military” despite being written by a Marine. Groups that push a ""parents rights"" angle misuse rhetoric by glossing over that they only mean certain parents and ignores the rights of children. Particularly the right to read as granted by the Library Bill of Rights. It’s sad when words just get tossed around like grenades devoid of meaning yet still cause damage. But on the flip side, they are trying to erase language that oppressed communities need to help process experiences. By banning queer books and books for centering, say, the Black experience, they are attempting to erase those experiences, or at least Other them. In the queer community, language has become a useful tool to understand one’s own identity and process it, but by denying people access to this language everyone is still faced with oppression but without the language to cope with it. Similarly, the pushback against any language that promotes inclusivity, or wellbeing or acknowledging plurality and cultural differences gets attacked as “woke”, “Marxist” or “too political” (laughable as all language is inherently political) in order to remove the ways we can address a concept. Language gives us a shortcut to an idea and specific language is used or clarity. As the Solnit quote above states, if we can’t name an idea, we can’t process it, have it help us, or fight against it. But lets be honest, most of the culture warring over this is entirely in bad faith and simply a wedge issue to destroy faith in public institutions.So what can we do? Most social media about the topic is only being seen by people already aware of the issues, so we need to think creatively about how to reach people who aren’t already invested or interested. Also, as the example of my county shows, local elections are huge and can cause a lot of damage. To help, pay attention to local elections and vote for people who don’t have a goal to defund public libraries or schools. Show up to board meetings and defend intellectual freedom, these are rarely well attended and just a small vocal minority can do a lot of damage when unopposed. Write to your local paper about the importance of intellectual freedom. Most importantly, use and support your local library. Donating books to the library might seem helpful, but there are already librarians to do that and money would be better spent donating to organizations already fighting to protect intellectual freedoms. Request queer books to show there is a need in the community or donate time and money to help. Review and recommend banned books on social media, like this very website here. And remember that rhetoric is key and not to abuse it, which is part of why I dislike the ""banned books week"" emphasis it puts on the bans instead of fighting for the ""freedom to read."" Books are for everyone, and a small group of people should not be removing access to books from people who need them.

Night Fever, a darkly brilliant noir-esque graphic novel from duo Ed Brubaker and Sean Phillips, asks this question in a spiral of an everyman tripping into a nightmarish, shadowy world of criminals and the obscenely rich while on a work trip to Paris to promote the publishing company he works for. Night Fever feels like a classic noir film that comes alive in gorgeous illustrations that make excellent use of light and color and a seedy 1970s setting and brushes up against elements of horror through the ambiguous and potentially hallucinogenic qualities of the story. The story follows Johnathan Webb who, after sleepless nights haunted by an old recurring dream of his that somehow is recreated in an upcoming novel his company is publishing, stumbles into a mysterious party and assumes another identity ‘like I was writing a script in my head and following it. Writing a different version of myself.’ But is this stronger, more confident identity an insight to who he truly is inside, and is Rainer, the man who befriends him and pushes him into a whirlwind adventure of violence, someone he can trust? Night Fever is a wild ride full of the unexpected that is as eye popping as it is mind blowing.  [image]I came to this book through Dave Schaafsma’s extraordinary  and the fact that he finds the coolest graphic novels. If you are a graphic novel fan, be sure to give him a follow. While I was vaguely reminded of The Book Tour and its Kafkaesque drama of a book tour that spills into a killing spree, this manages to be darker in a more visceral way and much more of a big action, international thriller (it helps that the lead looks like an older version of Matt Damon with his mustache in The Informant!). The whole thing just looks great, I really love the art style (which feels like a nod to older comic styles and really fits the narrative) and the use of color is perfect. It just screams trippy noir.  [image]Everything feels haunting and vaguely threatening. Which really works when it appears to ambiguously descend into cosmic or psychological horrors. Or, as the lead puts it:  [image]‘Violence. But with a veneer of class.’I really enjoyed how dark this was, particularly when it examines the depths of the depravity and the darkness that could be lurking inside any of us. Such as when Webb has a series of blackouts and questions ‘What part of your mind is pulling the strings then? Is it the real you…? And if so…why is it so ugly?’ There is an element as well that makes us question who is really pulling the strings of society. Are we in control or is it an illusion created by the rich where the world is their plaything? Or is there someone ever further than them? It all swirls together in a feverish blend of violence and psychological horror that feels sharp and smart. I also was glad that it avoided the cliche Fight Club twist as I was concerned it was going to turn into a whole “he was both people the whole time!” thing when it began to nudge ideas of being the stronger, cooler self that we wish we could be.This was a short graphic novel but just packed with fun.

Longlisted for the 2023 National Book Awards for Young People’s Literature, this is the first picture book both written and illustrated by Harrison (already well beloved for her artwork in Hair Love, Sulwe or her Little Dreamers & Little Leaders board books) and I hope she will do many more. This is a heartbreaking but important little story, one that follows a child who experiences the daily hurt of body shaming and and must find a way to make space for herself and love herself despite the cruel words of others. It it a really well done look at the small boxes social expectations try to fit everyone in, especially with oppressive ""beauty"" and body standards.

It’s tragic to think of small children unsure what to make of being teased for something that they cannot control and weren’t even aware of until being teased, judged and compared with others.

[image]Harrison makes excellent use of the page with gorgeous artwork and the way she tells the story with very minimal narration with the imagery working just as hard as any words could, makes it hit even harder. The way she uses words in the images—such as the child holding onto the hurtful words and having to learn what to do with them—was very well done. It’s also a reminder how cruel people can be, and even when faced with the effects of their actions and words they often refuse to take responsibility and double down on shaming the person who is trying to express their hurt (such as one figure who blames the girl for just “being too sensitive”). But the important lesson is to be yourself for you, to stand up for yourself, love yourself and find a way to make space for yourself. The latter is pulled off beautifully by introducing pages that unfold to quite literally give more space.

Coetzee stated ‘all autobiography is storytelling; all writing is autobiography.’ This truly comesIn his Nobel acceptance speech in 2003, author J.M. Coetzee stated ‘all autobiography is storytelling; all writing is autobiography.’ This truly comes alive in brilliant lucidity in the works of our most recent Nobel laureate, the incredible French writer Annie Ernaux. She explores memoir like a character study, examining memory and her past—whether it be the capturing the essence of her family, the passing of her mother from Alzheimer's, Ernaux’s numerous affairs, or simply chronicling a place and how she moves within it—with the emotional intensity and philosophical insight of a novel. In an era where autofiction has been rather popular and there have been large debates over the idea of “authentic” voices in storytelling storytelling and what that means about demanding an artist defend their own identity for the sake of marketing, the works of Annie Ernaux don’t just blur the line between fiction and autobiography, they make the distinction feel beside the point. She is an author certainly deserving of the Nobel Prize in Literature, for which the Swedish Acadamy awarded her in 2022 ‘for the courage and clinical acuity with which she uncovers the roots, estrangements and collective restraints of personal memory,’ and I am thankful they did as she has become a favorite author of mine over the past year. ‘I Will Write to Avenge My People from Seven Stories Press— a press named for the seven authors who committed to publishing their works with the new press, one of which being Annie Ernaux—provides Ernaux’s Nobel lecture along with the opening address, banquet and presentation speeches and gives us a lovely insight into the writer’s vision and beliefs on literature, something she calls ‘a space of emancipation.’‘How can one reflect on life without also reflecting on writing? Without wondering whether writing reinforces or disrupts the accepted, interiorized representations of beings and things?’Ernaux tells us that from the moment she was able to read ‘books were my companions, and reading was my natural occupation.’ I always love to know great authors I enjoy and spend much of my interior time with also found solace in the quiet practice of reading or, like Jeanette Winterson talks about, found books to be a refuge from daily life. And while some claim to not, such as Henrik Ibsen claiming he only ever read the Bible or the newspaper, I’ve found the act of reading widely to be a common thread amongst great authors. Such was the advice of another Nobel Laureate for Literature, William Faulkner, who said to ‘ read everything—trash, classics, good and bad, and see how they do it. Just like a carpenter who works as an apprentice and studies the master.’ Ernaux lists a few early favorites, saying ‘the suspicion with which they were regarded at my religious school made them even more desirable’ (something that struck me as important to note in an era in the US where book bannings are at a dangerously all-time high) and I was charmed by her mention that she recalls being pleased as a teenager to hear Albert Camus was awarded the Nobel and now she shares that honor with him. An honor, she notes, is not just for her but for all women everywhere in a world where women still fight for ‘legitimacy as producers of written works.’‘But to what end? Not to tell the story of my life nor free myself of its secrets but to decipher a lived situation, an event, a romantic relationship, and thereby reveal something that only writing can bring into being and perhaps pass on to the consciousness and memories of others.’Inspired by the Arthur Rimbaud’s cry ‘I am of an inferior race for all eternity,’ Ernaux had written in her diary as a young girl ‘I will write to avenge my people,’ and discusses how she hopes her work has lived up to this promise. Coming from a working class background, she studied ‘in a provincial university with the daughters and sons of the local bourgeoisie,’ and hoped her achievements in literature would be part uplift her class of origin:‘I proudly and naively believed that writing books, becoming a writer, as the lat in a line of landless laborers, factory workers, and shopkeepers—people despised for their manners, their accent, their lack of education—would be enough to redress the social injustice linked to social class at birth.’But she also wishes to write to avenge women, to make it known a woman can be just as worthy of artistic greatness as any man. For this reason writing as the “I” in her books is so important ‘as an exploratory tool.’ ‘They can only be read in the same way if the “I” of the book becomes transparent, in a sense, and the “I” of the reader comes to occupy it; if this “I,” to put it another way, becomes transpersonal, if singular becomes universal.’I feel this is what makes Ernaux so infectiously readable as the emotions that strike (she does passion extraordinarily well) feel as if they are coming from within your own heart instead of from the page. And so three cheers to Annie Ernaux. I love her works and I was really pleased to read her insights, especially that she chooses to not write for an audience but from her experiences. This is a very quick but powerful read, a bite sized joy really, and makes me want to read much more of her ideas on literature. Which I suppose is what all her works are and we are lucky for it...more",Notes are private!,1,115,1,not set,not set,"Sep 17, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/125078547-i-will-write-to-avenge-my-people

If you are Tiberius Claudius Drusus Nero Germanicus, you keep your head What is one to do when all around are the menaces of manipulation and murder? If you are Tiberius Claudius Drusus Nero Germanicus, you keep your head down, stay out of the way, and write a scorching history about it. Such is the tale of Robert Grave’s classic I, Claudius, a book that was a major inspiration for George R.R. Martin (it shows) and will surprise nobody to learn is the favorite novel of David Chase, the writer of the hit TV show The Sopranos (reading about G’ma Livia murdering and manipulating everyone in Rome makes you realize where Livia Soprano got her name). But, I gotta say, this was a hell of a book to be reading right when a social media trend showing that men think about the Roman Empire WAY more than you'd expect and found myself being asked at random how often I thought of the Romans and replying ”well pretty much constantly lately...why you ask?”   [image]But you know who else was thinking about the Roman Empire a lot? Tiberius Claudius Drusu...okay you can call him Claudius for short. Though if you were to ask around Rome you’d find he was more ‘known to my friends and relatives and associates as Claudius the Idiot', or ""That Claudius', or 'Claudius the Stammerer', or 'Clau-Clau-Claudius', or at best as ‘Poor Uncle Claudius',’ Nobody liked him or took him seriously—even his own mother said he was ‘too stupid’ to love—but being ignored and undervalued can come in handy when anyone with even the hint of desire for power finds themselves poisoned or at the very least plotted against. We can read this as an underdog tale in a way, and it makes for excellent historical fiction—so much so that it made Time Magazine’s 100 All-Time Best Novels list. Not bad for a book the author claims he only wrote for financial reasons to pay off a debt and broke into two volumes due to strict deadlines. Dense, yet rather readable with plenty of intrigue launching us into a deadly game of power struggles, I, Claudius also has some excellent humor and self-awareness that make for an all-around great read that will completely consume you. Just don’t consume the poisoned figs…‘He's as stupid as a donkey - what am I saying? Donkeys are sensible beings by comparison - he's as stupid as ... as ... Heavens, he's as stupid as my son Claudius!’Aww, little buddy Claudius, don’t take it too badly, you’ll be Emperor one day. I’ll admit that this book took me a bit to get into the groove. It starts pretty slow and covers a LOT of history without making all that much forward progress to where I thought I’d read non-fiction with more bite and excitement to it. I am GLAD I read on because once this picks up it is a relentless stream of people ruining each other’s day and becomes quite the wild ride. Plus we get Caligula being Caligula, and after having read Camus’ amazing play about him, I was quite happy to read about him some more. At the center of this all is Claudius who is guided by historians Livy and Pollio to play the fool to stay alive and pursue the life of a historian. As anyone with knowledge of the Roman Empire knows, Claudius will one day become Emperor (his time as ruler is covered in the second book, Claudius the God and His Wife Messalina), something that is as baffling to Claudius even in the face of prophecy as it is to anyone around him. Though if he becomes Emperor ‘at least I'll be able to make people read my books now.’ So, win win I guess. ‘Augustus ruled the world, but Livia ruled Augustus.’Much of the novel involves the long plotting of Livia, wife of Augustus, to ensure her lineage takes the throne and manipulating Augustus to get what she wants. Cross Livia and cross over to the land of the dead. Or get accused of horrible crimes, be exiled to an island, eventually freed, and THEN get dead. She can wait, she will get you. ‘Livia: a blight upon the nation as a mother, a blight upon the house of Caesar as a stepmother’ wrote Roman historian Tacitus, and so began the now debated stories of Empress Livia the great villain and serial poisoner, an angle that Claudius is all too happy to represent here. Claudius begins this book asserting he will be true to the facts, even at the expense of his own family members and will not leave out any details. And so we get a brutal account where almost nobody goes unscathed under Claudius’ watchful eye which, due to his status of being a fool, grants him a lot of access to the goings-on. But for real, every time he shows up someone is all ‘ah hell not that dipshit again,’ so you can’t really blame him for raking them over the coals of canonized history. ‘There are two different ways of writing history: one is to persuade men to virtue and the other is to compel men to truth.’Perhaps my favorite aspect of the book is how self-aware it is. There are the metafictional aspects that the book you hold in your hand is supposed to quite literally be written by Claudius in a dialect he assumed would be more readable for future generations—he is given a prophecy at the start that gives the publication year of Graves’ novel as the date when his words will be discovered—and declares he will leave the manuscript somewhere it can be easily found. ‘For my experience as a historian is that more documents survive by chance than by intention.’ But most interesting is the way the novel frequently discusses issues of writing history, both as fact or fiction. Take Pollio’s statement for instance: ‘He has you there, Livy, on your weakest spot. You credit the Romans of seven centuries ago with impossibly modern motives and habits and speeches. Yes, it’s readable all right, but it’s not history.’This fallacy of “presentism” often mars historical fiction or commentary. One might wonder if, by giving that a shoutout, Graves felt he could sneak in a few of the slights against Germans that appear in the novel, him fresh out of WWI and all, such as when Claudius writes ‘Never trust a German out of your sight, but never be afraid of him when you have him face to face.’ Graves can be forgiven for historical errors, as he is not trying to pass it off as history but openly writing a novel. But historians have to be much more careful, as the discussion between Pollio and Livy shows, with Claudius picking Pollio as his model for Pollio’s ‘accuracy and diligence.’ ‘But there’s also a serious matter in question and that is, the proper writing of history. It may be that I have made mistakes. What historian is free from them? I have not, at least, told deliberate falsehoods: you’ll not accuse me of that. Any legendary episode from early historical writings which bears on my theme of the ancient greatness of Rome I gladly incorporate in the story: though it may not be true in factual detail, it is true in spirit. If I come across two versions of the same episode I choose the one nearest my theme, and you won’t find me grubbing around Etruscan cemeteries in search of any third account which may flatly contradict both — what good would that do?”“It would serve the cause of the truth,” said Pollio gently. “Wouldn’t that be something?”“And if by serving the cause of truth we admit our revered ancestors to have been cowards, liars and traitors? What then?”I’ll leave this boy to answer the question. He’s just starting in life. Come on, boy, answer it!”Now, one might question how accurate (within the fictional world of Graves) Claudius truly is? Is he trying to vilify Livia more than necessary, why does he spout off about Cato the Censor, what private grudges make their way into the pages to become history the way he saw it? I found all this a rather clever and fun texturing to the novel, one Graves no doubt was aware plays with history in a way that would probably trick less discerning readers into assuming it was factual, the truth and fiction so tightly blended.So if intrigue and murder are your thing, or if you find yourself thinking about the Roman Empire more than most would expect, I, Claudius is a book for you. Honestly, I wouldn’t have thought it was one for me, but that's why I love having a book club because I end up reading books I would have never picked up on my own and end up really enjoying them. This is quite the wild ride of historical fiction through the history of Roman emperors and Graves can certainly write with such intelligence and engagement that was hard to put down. Just don’t piss off Livia.4/5...more",Notes are private!,42,191,1,"Sep 14, 2023","Sep 14, 2023","Sep 14, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18765.I_Claudius

Which is what works best in Nails and Eyes, the Akutagawa Prize winning novella by Kaori Fujino, an unsettling tale of a young woman living in claustrophobic proximity with a young child after usurping the role formerly occupied by the dead wife of the man with whom she’d been having an affair. Beautifully translated by Kendall Heitzmann and published by Pushkin Press along with two short stories that, unfortunately, are more filler than fearsome, this is a story that works best when exploring the uneasy aspects of domesticity that—for myself at least—seemed underserved by a rather cheap ending going for dramatic shock instead of slow-simmering distress. Making excellent symbolism with eyesight and nails, this is a well-crafted story full of fantastic atmosphere that had a lot of unrealized potential for me but will likely be a great thrill for many readers.‘It's good to try not to see things. You should try it. It's good to close your eyes to things.’I really enjoyed the way this story focuses so much on ideas of vision. There is the unnamed young woman, who has notably poor vision that functions as a metaphor for her poor intuition, juxtaposed with the narrator who is said to have exceptional vision. This, apparently, includes being able to see beyond herself and into the hearts of others. The story is narrated some years down the line from the events that transpire, all told to “you”—the then young woman who moved in after the death of the narrator’s mother in an ‘accident’—but is highly perceptive of what is going on despite the character only being 3 years old. Which is a big stretch and sort of fell flat for me. The age is sort of necessary for the plot to work but even the larger concept here of vision encompasses the idea of seeing back into one’s past just didn’t fully land. But the idea that the woman can’t see well and also takes no notice of the young child, pacifying her with a constant diet of sweets to keep her out of the way, works quite well. She has stumbled through life having made poor choices but passing through them unscathed with a total lack of self-awareness, but time is running out on her luck, she just can’t see it. When she comes across a certain passage in a novel, it speaks to her:’‘You need to try closing your eyes to all of it, too. It’s just that easy. No matter how awful something is, it all goes away once you do that. If I can’t see it, it’s as if it’s not even there. Not for me, anyway, it’s not.’She doesn’t bother to learn the context of a quote (said by a despotic dictator) and can’t see how aligning herself with it is not to anyone’s benefit. I found I quite liked the middle of the story as she tries to usurp the role of the now-deceased mother, reading her home-life blog and trying to decorate and cultivate a good sense of taste in the apartment space. ‘You had possibilities. I had possibilities, too, and they vastly outnumbered yours.’The writing during these passages especially shines, and with the overall uneasy atmosphere it was making for a sharp novella where disposing of a lover’s wife to fill the role poorly while not even realize you are drowning in your own life could have been enough as an unnerving tale. In a way I was reminded of Mieko Kawakami’s unsettling visions. I liked the aspect too of the woman trying to make the home seem bigger as a refusal to notice how small her life really was as the metaphorical walls are closing in around her without her noticing. Though this is likely more a “its not you its me” reception to the story but I felt the ending seemed forced and, while it did build to that, a dramatic outpouring for the sake of a shocking twist never feels as effective to me as ones that ends like a soundless scream engulfing us in its jaws of quotidian terror within which we are all trapped. But thats just me, you might love this, plenty of others have.Also (view spoiler)[the kid totally killed the OG mom, right? (hide spoiler)].The other two stories, while quite well written, fell a bit flat for me (I probably would have 4 starred this otherwise as I admit the craft of the novella is good and it hits its intended goals even if that just wasn’t to my subjective taste). The first involves an elderly woman in hospice who has a nightly visitor to her bed but only when he arrives she ‘remembers that they go through this every night’ and forgets during the day (or does she repress the memory). One can ascertain what is probably, horrifically, happening even without being said and the unsaid or unnoticed is a big theme with Fujino in this collection. The final one, which ends pretty abruptly, deals with a child afraid he has been cursed by the local park he was obsessed with, and here we also see obsessions—like the young woman’s obsession with cultivating a home—bring us towards our possible demise.Overall, this wasn’t my favorite though I the writing is sharp and Fujimo has a great dexterity in playing with her themes and symbols. This isn’t horror, per say, more uneasiness of the ordinary bringing us right to the precipice of horror, yet the unsettling aspects of it achieve its purpose. Nails and Eyes shows a lot of promise and I would certainly try her again, this one just didn’t quite work for me though I do respect its many merits.3/5...more",Notes are private!,13,81,1,not set,not set,"Sep 13, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/66092863-nails-and-eyes

She garnishes these in wry humor and fantastical narratives, a skill that has brought a well-earned reputation and makes for some fascinating reads. Good Bones and Simple Murders (1994) is a collection of writings that defy easy compartmentalization—being brief stories, riffs on fairy tales or otherwise general musings that would likely pass in the present under the name creative nonfiction—that make for bite-sized adventures into her charming imagination. While at worst these seem like the draft form of ideas she had little else use for, it is a fun read made more exciting by the sprinkling in of her original sketches to compliment the pieces. You’ll find her predominant themes on display here, particularly her criticisms of gender roles in society, though the ideas come across like those bags of “Fun Sized” candies people give out on Halloween that aren’t quite as fun as the packaging would have you believe. Still, Atwood is heralded as a modern classic for a reason and fans of the author will find much to enjoy here even if some of it does feel a bit dated and understuffed.I particularly enjoyed the innovation with structure she uses across these stories. Few are very straightforward, often starting with the seed of an idea and quickly blooming into a take on a fairy tale. But we have stories that read like a choose-you-own-adventure, stories that read like a short essay or thought experiment, or stories that just simply explore what the word “bread” makes you think of. It’s all pretty fun. As with Atwood there is a lot of humorous jabs at patriarchy or criticisms on male-dominated literary history—‘there are never any evil stepfathers’ she quips in one—but works like “Womens Novels” which criticizes the gender roles often enforced in novels reads as a bit outdated while still makes good points that highlight inequality and misogyny that is still just as present and horrible. Still, it is classic Atwood and the writing is sharp and witty.Good Bones and Simple Murders is a fun little collection that makes for quick reading and some good chuckles. The array of ideas and presentations of them is charming and shows off the author's writing abilities that have made her so beloved.

A new Hirshfield poem is always cause for celebration, and with The Asking: New & Selected we not only get a new batch of gorgeous poetry but also a much needed selected volume from across Hirshfield’s prestigious career. Hirshfield is easily one of my favorite living poets, once praised by the late, great W.S. Merwin for her ability to make words ‘move like light beams-searching, discovering, pausing to make sure,’ and her poems offer such intricate and tidy philosophical insights that they often leave you awash in their beauty for years to come. This volume offers the best from across nine volumes of poetry (her most recent being Ledger in 2020) and many new poems such as the one from which the collection takes it’s title saying ‘don’t despair of this falling world, not yet / didn’t it give you the asking.’ Such statements are the heart of her works, addressing the dualities of life where ‘one's gain is not the other lessened,’ facing the inevitability of death and embracing our temporality in this world teeming with plant and animal life, asking us not to despair yet making space for sadness and grief as much as joy and tenderness. ‘A thought is a forest’ that comes alive through her words that reach, like tree branches, into the reader’s soul. This is a perfect collection for those looking for an introduction to this amazing poet and a lovely reminder of her entire career with plenty new to find for long-time readers, but either way it is a celebration of a poet that has always been dear to my heart.The WeighingThe heart's reasonsseen clearly,even the hardestwill carryits whip-marks and sadnessand must be forgiven.As the drought-starvedeland forgivesthe drought-starved lionwho finally takes her,enters willingly thenthe life she cannot refuse,and is lion, is fed,and does not remember the other.So few grains of happinessmeasured against all the darkand still the scales balance.The world asks of usonly the strength we have and we give it.Then it asks more, and we give it.‘Poetry is the language that foments revolutions of being,’ says Jane Hirshfield and it is because ‘it is based on a thoroughly lived life.’ I find reading her poetry to be like looking at the world anew, discovering mysteries I’d not known existed before and finding deeper understanding of those already pressing. Nobel Laureate Czesław Miłosz wrote that ‘her poetry illuminates the Buddhist virtue of mindfulness,’ which is a perfect summation. Hirshfield spent 8 years of study at the San Francisco Zen Center and this comes across through her prose as the surface simplicity of her work sends our minds into a deeper harmonization with life in a way that is unbelievably inviting and comforting even in the darker moments. As she writes in her poem The Supple Deer, ‘to be that porous, to have such largeness pass / through me, is a feeling we as the reader experience engaging with her work. Her work often looks at ideas of duality, such as life and death, and this comes across brilliantly with much of her clever wordplay. For instance, in the poem Of Yield and Abandon she writes ‘There is something that waits inside us, / a nearness that fissures, that fishes,’ though I also just find so many of her phrasings to lodge themselves forever in my mind. The lines ‘A day is vast./ Until noon./ Then it's over.’ lives rent free in my head every time I wake up early and hope to get a lot accomplished before noon.Door and SentenceMy life,you were a door I was givento walk through.Dawdlingin lintel and loosestrife as much as permitted.Your own glass knob,I spoke you:A sentence, however often rewritten,ending always with the same slightly rusty-hinged preposition,sometimes, for mercy, hidden.Hirshfield has written as many essays on poetry as she has poems its seems, and I often find her insights there to be just as stunning. In a 2023 interview with NPR Hirshfield discusses how, for her, poetry is ‘an attempt to see from more than one point of view in more than one way, to enlist the collaboration of tongue, heart, mind, body, everything I have ever experienced, and to try to write into an awareness which is larger than the everyday, walking around forms of thought.’ I find this quite lovely. She continues that poetry is not ‘anger towards certain decisions which are made in the halls of power,’ but quite the opposite.‘Poetry is the attempt to understand fully what is real, what is present, what is it imaginable, what is feelable, and how can I loosen the grip of what I already know to find some new, changed relationship, to find something I didn’t know until the poem was written and finished? And then I know something new, and I have been changed.…poems are vessels of transformation. They are the glass crucible that a chemical reaction takes place in. And what comes out at the end is a different thing than what went in at the beginning.’I think we feel this way when we read her for sure, finding ourselves transformed and seeing the world in new ways. RipenessRipeness iswhat falls away with ease.Not only the heavy apple,the pear,but also the dried brown strandsof autumn iris from their core.To let your bodylove this worldthat gave itself to your carein all of its ripeness,with ease,and will take itself from youin equal ripeness and ease,is also harvest.And however sharplyyou are tested —this sorrow, that great love —it too will leave on that clean knife.Life and death, naturally, become the biggest stage for transformation in her works. She writes about death in a way that reminds us how natural it is, being less something to be feared and more just another stage we all encounter. A favorite of mine is the poem A Standing Deer which concludes with a passage comparing our lives vanishing into death like deer passing in a field. Here are the final two stanzas:Beloved, what can be, what was,will be taken from us.I have disappointed.I am sorry. I knew no better.A root seeks water.Tenderness only breaks open the earth.This morning, out the window,the deer stood like a blessing, then vanished.Hirshfield often plays with ying-and-yang dualities, or contrasting yet complimentary ideas such as the house growing either cluttered or sparse, being both empty and filled, or, as in ’Nothing Lasts’: ‘Grief and hope / the skipping rope’s two ends’, these two ideas having their interplay at the heart of her work. In these dualities we are reminded that much of life is what we make of it, or as she says in One will feel this as a blessing, another as horror’. There is the grief that she--we all--disappoint others, and the inevitability that everything will be taken from us. But, as common with Hirshfield, this doesn’t lead to despair but rather an acceptance of temporality that is beautifully embedded in the image of a deer seen out the window.It Was Like This: You Were HappyIt was like this:you were happy, then you were sad,then happy again, then not.It went on.You were innocent or you were guilty.Actions were taken, or not.At times you spoke, at other times you were silent.Mostly, it seems you were silent—what could you say?Now it is almost over.Like a lover, your life bends down and kisses your life.It does this not in forgiveness—between you, there is nothing to forgive—but with the simple nod of a baker at the momenthe sees the bread is finished with transformation.Eating, too, is a thing now only for others.It doesn’t matter what they will make of youor your days: they will be wrong,they will miss the wrong woman, miss the wrong man,all the stories they tell will be tales of their own invention.Your story was this: you were happy, then you were sad,you slept, you awakened.Sometimes you ate roasted chestnuts, sometimes persimmons.In her later poems, particularly the collection Ledger, we begin to see her investigations of death become more personal in an look at accepting that one day she must ‘walk into the time that is coming’ because ‘a great darkness is coming / a both eyed darkness’ of our inevitable deaths. ‘Little soul, / the book of your hours / is closing.’ She discusses in an interview that writing this collection also made her aware the environmental concerns that permeate her poetry was also becoming more dire. ‘ I had been writing about climate for a long time. I had been writing about the imperiled natural world for a long time. But it became urgent when it became clear it was no longer future. It was here. ’ We see this increased intensity in this collection, which fits with the poems about death and more political matters to make for a rather haunting read.Let Them Not SayLet them not say: we did not see it.We saw.Let them not say: we did not hear it.We heard.Let them not say: they did not taste it.We ate, we trembled.Let them not say: it was not spoken, not written.We spoke,we witnessed with voices and hands.Let them not say: they did nothing.We did not-enough.Let them say, as they must say something: A kerosene beauty.It burned.Let them say we warmed ourselves by it,read by its light, praised,and it burned.The new poems to be found in this collection are wonderful as well (the poem earlier, Door and Sentence is from the new works) and have a rather optimistic flair to them. We have poems of the Solstice, being out in nature, a day that seems worth living if all one did was save a single ant, and even a poem to late poet Adam Zagajewski. Hirshfield has been publishing since 1971 and has only gotten better.‘I would liketo add to my life,while we are still living,a little salt and butter,one more slice of the edible apple,a teaspoon of jamfrom the long-simmered fig.To tasteas if something tasted for the first timewhat we will have become then’I cannot express how wonderful The Asking: New & Selected is, how joyous it is to hold a career of such beauty and power in one binding along with new gems to enjoy.

It is a marvelous place to be. 5/5OptimismMore and more I have come to admire resilience.Not the simple resistance of a pillow, whose foamreturns over andover to the same shape, but the sinuous tenacity of atree: finding thelight newly blocked on one side,it turns in another.A blind intelligence, true.But out of such persistence arose turtles, rivers,mitochondria, fias.all this resinous, unretractable earth....more",Notes are private!,15,96,1,"Sep 12, 2023","Sep 12, 2023","Sep 12, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/71872909-the-asking

The two are so close that the narrator seems to only experience life through the frame of her bolder companion, Isora—so much so that we only know her as ‘Shit’, a nickname bestowed upon her by Isora. The novella explores burgeoning girlhood in a way that emphasizes animalistic nature, with bodily fluids, food and carnal pleasures being the primary focus of their thoughts and actions. A bold and direct examination on the complexities of growing up, Dogs of Summer is lyricism dripping in filth that may be too off-putting for some readers but still manages to find moments of beauty and profundity.  [image]Teide, the volcano on TenerifeShit and Isora are rarely apart. Isora lives with her grandmother following her mother’s suicide and Shit spends her days following Isora’s lead on everything. Despite being a constant source of troublemaking, Shit idolizes her peer for her carefree attitude and that she is further developed (increasingly drawing the interest of boys). Shit does anything Isora asks and often has little of herself outside the friendship which begins to become more intimate and sexual.‘‘I’d have followed her to the toilet or to the mouth of a volcano. I’d have peered over the edge until I saw the dormant fire, until I felt the vulcano’s dormant fire inside me.’The two explore their bodies—and each other’s such as a scene grinding on each other while wearing Isora’s deceased mother’s underwear—and their surroundings. It is rather episodic, with increasing sexual exploration and being thrust into a growing complexity with the other children in their community, and as the short novel progresses we all the relationships becoming more volatile and Shit sashaying back and forth between feeling ‘[Isora] was my best friend i wanted to be like her,’ and ‘sometimes i hated her and wanted to destroy her.’ Yet even when they are apart through anger, Shit finds she can think of nothing but Isora and fantasizes about her frequently. This infatuation seems doom-laden, with an undertone of violence to the homophobia in the community and the pair’s escapades putting them increasingly within the grasp of the local boy’s lusts. All of which seems symbolized in the violent colors of the horizon.‘We were going to die so we might as well do as much grinding as we could.’The story is rather crass at almost every turn, and the moments of humor are still quite crude, such as Isora learning the English word “bitch” and using it constantly while telling adults its just an English term of endearment. It is also flowing with bodily fluids, ingrown hairs, and constant masturbation (sometimes to the point of self-injury). An early description of Isora reads as follows: ‘spews out her guts and gets the shits and then she eats and shits and spews and pops Fortasec like it’s candy, and she eats and shits and shits and shits and spews…’ You get the idea. Everything is base nature of sex, shit or food, and even Isora’s description of their friendship is that they are like ‘pack of yogurts from the minimarket…that always come in pairs.’ Nothing is this story is tempered either and it as if Abreu is attempting to depict humans at their most animalistic.Those sensitive to frank sexuality and overt and unsentimental depictions of bodily fluids, functions and descriptions may struggle with this short novel as it is practically on every page. While I tend to be unbothered, even I thought “huh this is a lot” a few times, so read at your own discretion. Still, there is a tenderness underneath all the shit and vomit. I quite enjoyed the narrative voice here, told very lyrically (Abreu is a poet as well as a novelist and this reads very much like prose poetry with translator Julia Sanches brilliantly retaining a very rhythmic quality to the language) and matter-of-factly. Being a pre-teen, Shit seems to not quite understand a lot of what is going on around her and a larger image of events and details about the community and people comes through her tellings that she herself is not aware of. It works quite well with a rich sense of irony. This is most effective in her musings about Isora, where there is a much larger blooming romantic feeling and sexual excitement than she is willing to admit or even able to process. I was quite charmed by the lyrics the duo write in their ‘SsOoOngG BoOoKkk,’ where Shit’s juvenile pickings at love hint at a far vaster undercurrent of emotions than the words express.Julia Sanches does a wonderful job with the translation, with deliberate misspellings, taking poetic license with punctuation (or lack thereof) and capitalization, and retaining a lot of the untranslated Canary Island slang. Curious, however, is the title. The title is Panza de Burro, which would translate to Donkey’s Belly, an an idiomatic reference to the weather phenomena of low altitude clouds caused by trade winds in Canary Islands. The choice of Dogs of Summer nudges a phrase more familiar to English speakers—the dog days of summer, or if you are me, having Dog Days Are Over by Florence + the Machine stuck in your head the whole time reading this—so I understand the choice although the phrase ‘donkey’s belly’ describing the clouds appears in the novel several times and would give readers an understanding why it is the title. I’ve loved Sanches’ work elsewhere too (her being the translator was what inspired me to pick this up as I see translators as the ultimate book recommenders) so I trust her judgement.Unsentimental and willing to explore the messy depths and complexities of budding sexuality and other coming-of-age themes, Dogs of Summer packs a lot in just a short amount of time. Crude, rude and very vivid in these depictions, it can be a lot to take in but there is still a beauty to be found. The ending comes as a shock and is perhaps a bit unnecessary (to be honest it wasn’t my favorite abrupt conclusion though I suppose it works), but it does encapsulate the high-stakes of girlhood in a world both hostile and ready to exploit young women. I’m very impressed by Abreu’s style and while I think I respect this novel more than I necessarily enjoyed it, I will certainly read more from her when it becomes available.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,16,112,1,not set,not set,"Sep 11, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/122770085-dogs-of-summer

By the stars, we hope.’Storytelling is at core of understanding a culture as culture is, in its own way, a type of collective narrative. Though, as in Becky Chambers’ Record of a Spaceborn Few’ one begins to wonder if the connotative division between patriotism and propaganda is blurred when perpetuating such a narrative is essential to upholding a civilization where the reality is at odds with the stories being told. The third novel in Chambers’ Wayfarer series, Record of a Spaceborn Few is the quietest book yet though also one of the most complex and interesting to me. Set aboard the Exodant fleet and following a large ensemble cast of characters (one being the family of Cpt. Ashby’s sister, Tessa), Chambers examines a sort of eutopia where everyone’s basic needs are met but overall it is beginning to crumble, especially in the eyes of the younger generation for whom ‘survival alone wasn’t enough’ compared to their dreams which can be as vast as the cosmos. Chambers excels at crafting cultural thought experiments as sci-fi narratives and this volume furthers their extraordinary world galaxy building through deep investigation into how one overlooked group fits in context with the rest of the galactic commons. Family is a predominant theme in this series, be it found family or blood-relations, and here we see the whole fleet as a large family made up of smaller ones and how all their goals, fears, labors and loves fit together against the backdrop of a slowly dying fleet and culture. Thoughtful, heartfelt and thoroughly engrossing despite only minimal plot, Record of a Spaceborn Few is another excellent chapter in the Wayfarers series that places characters at a crossroads of safe banality and risky enterprise while exploring themes on death and family.‘We are a longstanding species with a very short memory. If we don’t keep record, we’ll make the same mistakes over and over again.’Chambers gift to make stories out of what basically amounts to sci-fi anthropology is endlessly entertaining to me and feels very indebted to the works of the late, great Ursula K. Le Guin who also told stories via cultural examinations such as in The Left Hand of Darkness. Like that novel, Chambers inserts fictional historical accounts and anthropological writings between chapters that create context for the galaxy at large, though much of how we learn about galactic politics and daily life is gleaned through the actions and conversations of characters. Often dubbed “cozy sci-fi” for the rather heartwarming messages and characters, I would add that these books also feel so cozy because they allow you to experience them as if you are nestled inside the world which comes alive and makes sense through the complexity of its construction. Though it is perhaps Le Guin’s The Dispossessed that Record feels most akin too as much of the book sets about looking at a civilization that seems to be a sort of eutopia and examining the cracks forming in the perfect veneer their own self-mythologizing would have you believe. Because, when it comes down to it, this is a hippy commune in space that is not everything they want you to think it is.‘What was better – a constant safeness that never grew and never changed, or a life of reaching, building, striving, even though you knew you’d never be completely satisfied?’The Exodant fleet boasts there is a home and food for every member and no job is seen as “lesser” This also includes sex work, like the character Sunny, which is seen as a form of being an entertainer not unlike a musician and Exodants are a very sex-positive culture—though this is no less embarrassing to teenagers to hear their parents speak so openly about sex which was a detail that was both humorous but also felt true (I enjoy how so much of this series is asking “how does this species think about sex?”). Self-worth is not tied to capitalist instincts and all are viewed as equally valid.‘There is no such thing as a meaningless job in the Fleet. Everything has a purpose, a recognisable benefit. If you have food on your plate, you thank a farmer. If you have clothing, you thank a textile manufacturer. If you have murals to brighten your day, you thank an artist. Even the most menial of tasks benefits someone, benefits all.’However, the fleet technology is old (it opens with a ship equipment failure that causes a mass death), the people live meagerly, and propagating one’s own narrative is losing its luster. Particularly with younger people for whom the possibilities of the wider cosmos full of danger and potential glory seem quite attractive. This is best explored through the character Kip, who, as only a teen can so eloquently put it, says ‘Stars, fuck this place. Fuck these stupid rules and stupid jobs and fuck being sixteen. He was getting out...anything was better than here.’ (I LOVE how Chambers has characters say ‘stars’ like a curse word like everyone yelling ‘frak’ in the rebooted Battlestar Galactica). And there is also Tessa’s daughter, Aya, who is scared of space and wants to live on the ground. Yet, for all its shortcomings, we see how the fleet can be attractive to someone like Sawyer who seeks refuge there: even a poor home and meager living is better than being broke and unhoused. As Le Guin once wrote, ‘Every eutopia contains a dystopia, every dystopia contains a eutopia.’‘That’s a poisonous thing, thinking your way is all there is.’The interactions between archivist Isabel and a Harmagian, Ghuh'loloan, were exceedingly enjoyable and ponderous (I love the aspect that humans smell bad to other species, sort of like humans to Vulcans in Star Trek) because in this way the Exodant’s cultural narrative is lit up against the larger narrative of the Galactic Commons for a more dynamic picture of everything. The Exodants are caught either falling behind keeping their old ways or accepting help and adapting, though a big lesson is ‘ I worry about those who think adopting someone else's story means abandoning their own.’ I really appreciate the angle of looking at the cultures and the galaxy as a whole as a big narrative (I mean, we process experience as a narrative in general) and how, sometimes, we need to access if the narrative is useful or harmful.‘Our species doesn’t operate by reality. It operates by stories. Cities are a story. Money is a story. Space was a story, once. A king tells us a story about who we are and why we’re great, and that story is enough to make us go kill people who tell a different story. Or maybe the people kill the king because they don’t like his story and have begun to tell themselves a different one. When our planet started dying, our species was so caught up in stories. We had thousands of stories about ourselves – that’s still true, don’t forget that for a minute – but not enough of us were looking at the reality of things. Once reality caught up with us and we started changing our stories to acknowledge it, it was too late.’This of course details the Harmagians rejecting their own empire when faced with the consequences and horrors of their wars and creating the Commons to try to do something good and cooperative, but another aspect of Chambers novels is always how excellently their sci fi worlds correlate to present-day social issues. In the US, for example, there has been huge pushback against any mentioning of negatives in the US, like the history of slavery, leading to mass book bans and attacks on public institutions to control the narrative. But nobody is perfect and we must learn responsibility to our stories and accept reality.‘Show me a species who has never wronged another. Show me a species who has always been perfect or fair…either we are all worthy of the Commons or none of us are.’Chambers shows how storytelling can quickly become propaganda and that facing the harsh truths is always better than dismissing them and mistaking it for patriotism. But, will the Exodants be able to adapt and how will they maintain their culture if they do (okay but it is super heartbreaking when Tessa brings up that she doesn’t understand why her brother, Ashby, is so upset over replacing his AI…).‘learn nothing of your subjects, and you will disrupt them. Learn something of your subjects, and you will disrupt them.’Narratives, however, also show what cultures value and I find Chambers always does a wonderful job with this in their books. Family and home are a big one here, but also death. It is noted ‘socially unsettled [humans] become around death,’ and how much this seems connected to their ideas of family, something the Harmagians find quite odd. For Eyas, this also means that in her role as caretaker for the dead she too becomes a sort of cultural narrative but she is struggling with how stifling this all feels ‘because I always have to be Eyas the symbol…I can only ever be this one thing.’ How much do we find ourselves living stories that tell of our culture, nation, family or perhaps become a mere symbol of ourselves instead of an authentic self (paging Jean-Paul Sartre), and is this useful or merely propagating our own myths. Speaking of, I love the aspect that Exodants want to use names of the past on Earth but are bad at it, like intending to name a child Wolf but ending up with Walrus.‘Knowledge should always be free,’ she said. ‘What people do with it is up to them.’The quietest of the series but also the most focused, I really loved Record of a Spaceborn Few. I like the whole aspect that the hippie-commune place is both cool but also becoming impractical and the message about adapting to change can be a way to benefit all. I loved the family dynamics in this one (the adorable older lesbian couple is great) and how it just offers another heartfelt look at what its like to live in this world. Another solid read.4.5/5‘We are the Exodus Fleet. We are those that wandered, that wander still. We are the homesteaders that shelter our families. We are the miners and foragers in the open.

The Wind Knows My Name, the newest novel from celebrated Chilean author Isabel Allende, focuses on these people in a sweeping storyline that takes us from Vienna at the outset of the Holocaust to the child internment camps at the present day US border. Following the stories of several characters&Mdash;Samuel, Leticia, Selena, and the young Anita—who initially seem completely isolated from one another, Allende gorgeously weaves their various timelines, continents and lives together to form an endearing portrait of human connectivity and caring. It is historical fiction with history still in the making, and Allende draws a direct line from the atrocities of the holocaust through the CIA-driven massacres and dictatorships in Latin America of the late 20th century and into the Trump administration by way of the devastation and despair they created for political gain. A haunting yet beautiful novel managing a lot in a short space, The Wind Knows My Name finds the power of love even in the darkest spaces.There is a lot of history reverberating through Allende’s novel. It begins with Kristallnacht in 1938 where a young Samuel Adler is sent by his jewish parents on the Kindertransport to England to escape the brutal horrors taking shape. As if a rhyme to his narrative, we have young, blind Anita Diaz arriving by rail to the US only to be taken from her mother and imprisoned as she awaits trial. We also meet refugee lawer Selena Durán who, teaming up with Frank Angileri who represents a firm looking for a PR boost after accusations of embezzlement and trafficking, hopes to protect these children and reunite them with family. For more on the legal side of this tragedy of family separations and deportations, one might be interested in reading Tell Me How It Ends: An Essay in Forty Questions, a book about defending children in deportation cases from by the incredible author Valeria Luiselli (her Faces in the Crowd is a favorite novella of mine) who worked as a translator for these children. Then we have Leticia who ‘remembered little from her childhood’ only that she had to flee El Salvador after the El Mozote massacre in 1981, making her another child displaced by political violence like Samuel. These stories slowly wind together in Allende’s masterful plotting and it becomes a very emotional read that will certainly keep you flipping pages.It is interesting to consider historical fiction that is so involved with present day history. Much of the novel deals with the child internment camps and family separations that still make the news today. The focus in the novel is on the spearations that occurred in 2018 under the Zero Tolerance Policy put in place by then President Trump and largely masterminded by white nationalist Stephen Miller. The order, issued in April, was overturned in June of that year, though separations were reported to still occur after and in October of 2018 it was reported that 2,654 children had been removed from their families and placed in detention centers that were known for inhuman treatment (there were 4,500 complaints of sexual misconduct against children from 2014-2018, including the family detention centers previous to the Trump administration). Worse, there was no plan to facilitate reuniting families after and as of Feb 2023, around 1000 children have still not been reunited with their families. This is the political landscape that the characters in the present are trying to navigate.The novel works best when Allende allows us to experience the characters being characters and interacting, letting us feel the political tensions rather than the moments that seem a bit like political exposition instead. One might say there are times the novel feels a bit like activism—such as some of the lengthy monologues Selena gives Frank in response to a question, though to be fair it is in keeping with wanting to discuss the legal aspects—but the issues here are very important and it doesn’t detract. It just does occasionally make the characters feel a bit out of focus in the framing. Samuel, for instance, has a lot of sections that read a bit flat as we are told about him over big swaths of time but when it slows down a bit Allende excels at instilling bold emotional resonance in the reader. The terror of escaping Vienna as ‘the stench of fear, like rust and rotting garbage’ becomes violently overbearing, the culture shocks that land ‘like a slap in the face’ as he comes to the US, or the frustrations with relationships all really endear us to him.‘And this girl is traumatized -- she misses her mother, she's been pulled away from everything she knows, her family, her friends, her school, her community, her language. ’Anita is perhaps my favorite character in the novel and I adore the way her character becomes a symbol of endurance. Moving through the world, legally blind, she becomes a figure of all those who move through the treacherous political landscape innocent in intentions, just looking for a safe space to be, and never knowing what is coming at them. Her faith in stories is lovely as well, with her adapting the world and events around into fairy tales as a way to survive them and inspire others to hold fast to hope as well. Unfortunately she is a bit underutilized which is a shame as all the horrors and violence being filtered through her childhood innocence in her tellings of them make it all the more haunting, unsettling, and emotionally effective.Overall, The Wind Knows My Name becomes a sort of found family narrative of bittersweet tenderness amidst a landscape of cruelty and despair. Allende clearly cares strongly for her characters, and that love shines through in her depictions of them, thus endearing them further to us and while often heartbreaking, this is a book that is difficult to put down. It feels a bit uneven at times but altogether it is a striking portrait of lives displaced and suffering that can find solace in one another. 3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,10,220,1,"Sep 09, 2023","Sep 09, 2023","Sep 09, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62583516-the-wind-knows-my-name

Ernaux writes with no shame and an eagerness to explore the philosophical undercurrents of her life and memory—an exquisite quality that made her more than deserving of her Nobel Prize in 2022—and we see this in her latest offering, Young Man, about an affair she had in her mid-fifties with a university student nearly 30 years her junior. A rather slim volume, Young Man feels more like a short biographical story even compared to her usual 90ish page books, perhaps as this one is more tempered in emotions than, say, the volatile passions of The Possession. Here she gives much of the space to probing self-examinations of her actions that still leave you satisfied, and we see in her writing the fulfillment of her epigraph ‘if I don’t write things down, they haven’t been carried through to completion, they have only been lived.’ Complete with several pages of photographs from the time of the affair, a short autobiography, and lovingly translated by Alison Strayer, Young Man is a tiny morsel of delight for Ernaux fan’s that contemplates themes on aging, power and gender dynamics, and they ways we dig at our own perceptions of self through our juxtapositions with others.‘My main reason for wanting our story to continue was that, in a sense, it was already over and I was a fictional character.’Ernaux writes biography like a searing character study of a novel, so bold and unabashed in honesty and insights and always delivered on immaculate sentences that arrive as ‘a series of hits or punches,’ as Amina Cain describes her in her book on writing, A Horse at Night. Originally written 20 years ago right after the affair in the book took place and revised for publication in France in 2022, Young Man has Ernaux mapping her emotional introspections of what this affair with a much younger man meant to her. She admits to being aware of the power-imbalance (‘I was in a dominant position’), aware that others consider her relationship inappropriate, and does admit ‘I used the weapons of that dominance, whose fragility, in a romantic relationship, I nonetheless recognized’ but it is less about justifying herself or apologizing or even any moral judgment and more just about capturing what she was feeling. The whole power imbalance is a lot to consider, and while she does discuss this in terms of the double standard that men often date women uncomfortably younger than them without social shame it doesn’t necessarily come across as if she thought she was giving an attempt at subversive feminism or something. Though this does touch on a double standard of aging and, as French writer Mona Chollet says, ‘Men don’t age better than women, they’re just allowed to age,’ which is another aspect of older men dating young women as a sort of status symbol to show for themselves ‘their decay is not counted against them.’ She does admit, however, that her reasoning behind the affair is largely the similar: to recapture her own youth. In looking at the young man’s young face ‘mine was young too’ without the reminder of aging she saw in her own husband. ‘Men have known this forever, and I saw no reason to deprive myself.’ With Ernaux you know you are going to get honesty.‘A mature woman appeared to be more dangerous than a young woman.’She discusses the frequent looks of disapproval she gets but doesn’t allow them to bother her but ‘reinforced my determination.’ It becomes a way for her to re-experience youth, such as introducing him to places and art new to him that makes them suddenly new for her as well, and she thrives off it. ‘I felt as if I were the same outrageous girl again,’ she writes in reference to a time when, at age 18, her mother felt scandalized by a tight dress she wore drawing a lot of attention, ‘this time, without the slightest sense of shame, but a sense of victory.’ Though she is still always aware of that age gap and how the relationship often makes them both neither of their own generation or the other’s. Young Man is a bit slight, even for Ernaux, but it is still a nice foray into the aspects of her books that remind me why I keep coming back for more. She is always open and honest, even admitting this whole thing was about her and it wasn’t like she compared him to other men but that all men were basically just one blurr in a photo with herself as the focus. It’s a slice of life shaken up with all its pockets turned out to collect any riches of living that can be examined and valued, and I love that about her works. She charms me every time and I can’t wait for more of her good gossip.3.5/5‘I felt only the sweetness of my own continuity and the consistency of my desire.’IMPORTANT UPDATE:  [image]Thanks to Seven Stories Press for sending me this amazing Annie Ernaux metal font hat for preordering a bunch of her books, because now she and I have matching hats and that pretty much makes us besties, right?...more",Notes are private!,14,165,1,"Sep 08, 2023","Sep 08, 2023","Sep 08, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/125078616-the-young-man

Yea I know that sounds weird, but this guy makes grisly horror something that seeps into you as rather tender and charming while also scaring the shit out of you. And that is a dynamic I can get really get down with. I especially enjoy his short stories, such as this one, Wait for Night, because he has perfected this perfect balance of plot, side-descriptions of the characters lives, overall atmosphere and length, being bite sized terrors that taste deliciously literary. This guy does coming-of-age nostalgia inside of horror that feels like the best of Stephen King (who it assuredly is inspired by) but manages to be better. And he does such strong voice, like you more hear this than read it. I’m just fond of SGJ, okay? Anyways, Wait for Night is such a good example of how he has just delightfully well done examinations of social lives—usually of people who have grown up in pretty rough conditions where hunger was more frequent than finances—and often can tap into a whole realm of ideas and mannerism through short and sharp descriptions. Such as this aside about one of the laborers the narrator works with cleaning out canals in Coloroado who calls himself The Reverend: ‘I don’t think he was really a reverend, but it’s not like I was the high school football star I’d taken to claiming either. We all gave each other a lot of latitude. That’s how it goes with day laboring. You’re always your best self, just down on your luck a bit, only here for a week, maybe two, until your real thing comes through.’This is a whole sociological world building in a paragraph, and when later there is a quick comment about not having played football before it makes you laugh because earlier he led you to believe he at least played high school football. But no. Oh yea, this is also a horror story. With dead things pulled out of the earth and violent monsters. And then a big badass monster fight like Godzilla vs Kong except not those monsters, though I’ll save the big reveal for Jones to pull off for you. Because you can read this whole thing in this here link, and you totally should because it’s Spooky Season.

Terrace Story, the second novel by Hilary Leichter, explores space from physical dimensions, metaphysical space and even outer space in a surreal and zany story that have a surprisingly cast emotional undercurrent. Structured across four stories that move in at various distances in orbit around the opening story of a mysterious terrace that appears where it shouldn’t, Leichter explores the distances between people and the ways they grow and shrink across lifetimes as well as the liminal spaces storytelling creates in order to hold entire worlds within. With an incredible emotional depth that can be just as sad as the story is playful, Terrace Story is a profound delight that makes us think of all the spaces we inhabit in our lives and the malleable spaces created by language.‘ Inhabited space transcends geometrical space.’―Gaston Bachelard, The Poetics of SpaceThe novel opens with a story of Anne and Edward, finding their emotional space growing with the birth of their daughter, Rose, but their physical space shrinking as financial woes back them into a small corner of an apartment. Yet, impossibly, a gorgeous terrace filled with ‘an outdoor kind of joy’ appears whenever Anne’s friend, Stephanie, visits. This story originally appeared in Harper’s Magazine (you can read it here) and has now been expanded to explore the spaces of those surrounding this incident, with linked stories that examine the lives, loves and losses of Anne’s parents, Stephanie, and, finally, Rose many years later. This collage of characters pulls us through many moments of joy and sadness, covering lifetimes of connections and betrayals, dreams and death. An aspect of Leichter that will keep me reading anything she writes is how perfectly she can balance silly with sad and plumb incredible emotional depths even in the most bizarre of tales. Her previous novel, Temporary managed this quite effectively as well, and heart we find our heart swelling just like the ways Stephanie finds she can transform physical space with her mind. The surreal ability works in both a literal and metaphorical sense, being a perfect expression of how we often create ‘a place to put the wanting’ we feel in life, or the way with love we often ‘put it in someone else,’ or find it expanding (or contracting) into spaces we didn’t know existed before. Like how one can love a child with all their heart and then, with the birth of a second, discover they suddenly have double the love to share. Or the way memory makes time and space malleable, like when Stephanie finds ‘events that happened across months and formed a single continuous memory, erasing larger units of time,’ or wonders if all the memories of time spent with a lover was merely one moment or if she ‘had stretched Will across the story to make him last longer.’ The effect Leichter creates here is dazzling and as bittersweet as it is occasionally bizarre.‘Who can remember with any accuracy life’s initial drift towards its final shape?’There are some truly beautiful moments but, as a fellow student suggests about the ability to create space, is the act of creation balanced out by subtraction somewhere? Throughout these stories we often see more loss than growth, from the tragic amount of space that grows between Anne’s parents, or the fear of their own child that creates an impenetrable distance between Stephanie and her parents, and we see how more space can often be a sadness.‘Their fear had shuttled into the space between who they actually were and who they had imagined themselves to be. Until now, they had not noticed any space between these two things at all.’There were moments I found myself very choked up, even as I was delighted by the playfulness of these collected tales. Extinction is Anne’s mother’s expertise and we are often bent towards thoughts on how the space of absence that can also grow. The book takes place in its own frame of reality (or more than one), but the references to the extinction of things like crows makes us consider how our actions surrounding climate and growing space for people may be subtracting the life of the planet or space for animals.‘When you are in a place that does not really exist, you can populate it with as many fables and legends as you like.’Though perhaps my favorite aspect of this book is the way it shows the special space created by language and storytelling. Stories can contain entire worlds full of their own people complete with individual motivations, and I enjoyed the way a story about a King, Hermit and Queen that threads through the second part of the book creates an alternative space to examine the ideas going on within the larger story (also it had a very Jeanette Winterson-esque feel to it that made me happy). I love the way Anne and Edward have their own set of proper nouns for certain inside-joke ideas, the most important being the titular idea of Terrace Story which are stories they tell while on the terrace imbuing truth with fiction to create a whole imaginary reality while in the impossible space of the terrace. We also see how changing a proper noun, such as Edward to Eddie or Rose to Rosie implies a different angle towards that idea, with Anne fearing Stephanie’s alteration of Edward to Eddie might have an ulterior motive. It all becomes an excellent exploration on the malleability of language and the ways it shapes the world around us.In short, Terrace Story really charmed me. Leichter’s tales come together for something strange and sad yet profound and penetrating in ways you don’t expect. It won’t be for everyone, but those who like to follow along an offbeat and destabilizing tale will find much to love here. It is an excellent look at family and the connection we have between each other, and does so in a fascinating way. An emotional ride, Terrace Story is a fun success.4.5/5‘That’s how quickly time was moving now. If you blinked, you missed an entire story.

This is at the heart of Uruguayan writer Ida Vitale’s experimental—and often obfuscating—Byobu, which follows a man who has a ‘knack for stopping to look at minuscule things lacking in importance,’ and examines the notion that ‘everything important lies below the surface.’ A poet first and foremost, Vitale proceeds using language like a shovel to dig with abstractions in order to unearth the heart of an idea instead of navigating us along a plotline towards it as if it were a city’s center. The whole book (less than 100pgs told in brief vignettes) comes at us as if ‘inside a nebulous veil.’ This creates a very quiet and contemplative work, though also one without much to grasp hold of. Her ideas appear like fingerprints on a glass window, floating aimless in space, that we can see when we look closely but almost completely transparent from afar. But those fingerprints of language are truly something to behold and Vitale weaves such expressive phrases and striking imagery. While never learning much about our character, who bears the name of the title Byobu, his ‘ meticulous consciousness’ becomes a vessel to examine how one lives in the world, the juxtaposition of what truly matters versus what society values, and even the idea of narrative in the face of the books near absence of narrative. ‘Poetry seeks to extract from its abyss certain words that might constitute the scar tissue we are all unconsciously chasing.’While this is a rather aimless book without much to really feel beyond completion, I am still in awe at Vitale’s use of language as well as the excellent—and likely difficult and intricate—translation work by Sean Manning. We have images of jasmines as ‘a vertical Milky Way, delirious with aroma,’ or reflections of singular words that form an entire landscape in the mind. It is often dense and something that, in keeping with the message of the book, forces you to slow down and contemplate fully. Though it all comes at you in short chapters that sometimes aren’t even the length of a page. One of the more beautiful ones—at least I felt—is Unforgivable Distraction which reads in its entirety as such:‘A threadlike obsession begs for a fissure through which to recall, from within a free soul, a lost moment of a past that is constantly less stable, more emaciated and evanescent. Sentences arrive not quite crystallized, as if coming from somebody talking on a beach alone, convinced no one else can hear them, that no one can collect them to confirm or deny them. Sentences that are immediately buried by the sand of that careless loss. Byobu thinks: there is no despair quite like the shadow that collapses down upon our most guarded memories, akin to a wall without ivy, the ivy piling up at its base, with no sense of purpose or beauty, a green tomb, a dark mass grave.’I love this careful expression of the emotions and actions of language. Simple images come alive into something much larger, such as how the image of a single traffic light sends us tumbling down a rabbit hole of thought on it as a ‘mechanism of supervision and compliance with an ergonomic intention’ (a major theme of the book is the idea of compliance with society or being defiant and disrupting that flow). But the language just comes alive and, as Vitale describes being out in nature, ‘it’s a delight for the flesh and the imagination.’The imagination seems to be what Vitale argues for in Byobu. The mystery and magic of the world is what counteracts the mundane, and she shows how the former can be found when we quiet our minds and appreciate the minutia and abstractions in life. The circuitous thought process is favored over the direct, which we see in the novel in the expressions that ‘the world loves conversations in straight lines and single-minded strides. Intersections divert. Labyrinths confound.’ Byobu values useless facts and deep but unprofitable thinking, which he sees as something vital to retain in a world of straight lines and valuing knowledge on ‘advancing in society’ instead of advancing in spiritual, emotional or intellectual growth. We see the grandiousity of language as a direct rebuttal to the tempered and shallowness of ordinary society Vitale describes as ‘the insight that marionettes have most likely gained, by virtue of delegating the heavy burden of their movement to other hands,’ that allows them to be cogs in neoliberal advancement. While we don’t know much about the character of Byobu, I did find him rather empathetic and enjoyed his ‘habitual indecisiveness’ and felt very much attacked by him described as ‘Truly melancholic due to lack of rest, his dark moods moods intensified, cyclically obstructing even the most accidental access to sleep.’ But most importantly I enjoyed the way he looks at the world: ‘he always looks at everything with eyes that are also tongue and touch and ears and sex, letting himself be penetrated by the world and lamenting not having a magical memory where everything seen and sensed and everything read in the prodigious coagulations of the alphabet enters for eternity.’That said, there is just not much to cling to and while I appreciate the lack of narrative as an expression on narrative, its almost too formless to make much of it with. I do, however, love her commentary on this aspect, such as in the beginning her discussion that ‘a story’s existence, even if not well defined or well assigned, even if only in its formative stage, just barely latent, emits vague but urgent emanations.’ She asserts that ‘Openness too can dissolve in the outrage of extroverting every boundary,’ and much of the poetic quality of this book is in subverting boundaries and trying to examine living in the world through an abstract way.‘The author assumes that whoever follows him through the twists of his invention is sure of their own ideas and will turn to them to give their ending to the story.’Overall, Byobu is a gorgeously written book with a lot of interesting ideas, but is almost too formless for it’s own good and doesn’t have much forward moving power to keep you wanting to read. Still, it is quite lovely and I enjoy many of the ideas within and hope that soon I can read translations of Vitale’s poetry. 3.5/5‘Where are we running to, those of us who are so still?’...more",Notes are private!,17,107,1,not set,not set,"Sep 01, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58946084-byobu

But multitudes have perished, and are perishing every hour - and in the oddest places! - for the lack of it.’Sometimes a novel comes along that completely overpowers you. It sends your heart soaring to great heights on wings of perfect prose and then plummeting towards destruction on the rocks below. It crushes you and then rebuilds you from the wreckage then sends you out into the world, electrified by the experience, to contemplate the themes that are now humming through your entire body and mind. Giovanni’s Room is such a book. It’s perhaps too good. My emotions are just bleeding in a corner wanting to ask Baldwin “what the fuck is wrong with you, this was amazing.” For really thought, this second novel by James Baldwin, Giovanni’s Room adroitly addresses love, guilt, and our inner battles with ourselves over the two through a story and impeccable writing style that will have the reader exhausted from feeling all the feelings and thankful for it. It comes alive in the streets and bars of Paris as David, an American expatriate living in Paris (not unlike Baldwin himself at the time), struggles to accept himself and his feelings for Giovanni, nestling us into the titular room where they hide away from the world much like David is trying to hide his sexual identity. We experience how people who feel cornered often react in destructive ways. A powerhouse of a short novel that takes a sharp aim at the constricting social expectations of gender and sexuality while also exploring shame, expatriatism and the elusiveness of freedom, Baldwin’s Giovanni’s Room feels perfect in all its design and execution.‘He made me think of home—perhaps home is not a place but simply an irrevocable condition.’Feeling distraught by the US and its prevalent racism, James Baldwin left for Paris in 1948 where he hoped to be able to see himself outside of the context of American prejudice. ‘Paris is, according to its legend,’ Baldwin wrote in his 1954 essay A Question of Identity, ‘the city where everyone loses his head, and his morals, lives through at least one histoire d’amour, ceases, quite, to arrive anywhere on time, and thumbs his nose at the Puritans—the city, in brief, where all become drunken on the fine old air of freedom.’ It was in Paris he wrote his first novel, Go Tell It on the Mountain in 1953 and then, later, Giovanni’s Room in 1956, the latter featuring an American expatriate in Paris that allowed him to discuss many of his thoughts about the two countries juxtaposed by travel. While Baldwin would argue it was far from autobiographical, Room was in part inspired by a real man Baldwin had met which he discusses in a 1980 interview: ‘We all met in a bar, there was a blond French guy sitting at a table, he bought us drinks. And, two or three days later, I saw his face in the headlines of a Paris paper. He had been arrested and was later guillotined . . . I saw him in the headlines, which reminded me that I was already working on him without knowing it.’What he would work on became a perfect little novel, though his US publisher, Knopf, was not interested in it because they wanted him to write of the Black experience. Baldwin had done so quite successfully in his previous book but with Room felt he could not address this as well as themes on homosexuality together. ‘The sexual-moral light was a hard thing to deal with. I could not handle both propositions in the same book,’ he admitted, ‘there was no room for it.’ In another interview, Baldwin says Knopf told him publishing a queer novel would alienate his audience and ‘will ruin your career,’ stating they would not even publish it ‘as a favour to you.’ So ‘I told them, ‘Fuck you’,’ he says, and Giovanni’s Room was instead published under Dial Press. We are all lucky for it, as this is a gorgeous book and it is a shame to think it almost never happened. Especially with how strikingly gorgeous the writing is, navigating the emotional currents with such poetic finesse that we, the reader, find ourselves totally at it’s mercy, gleeful and grateful to be caught in the tumultuous undertow as Baldwin sweeps us out to the sea of destruction with these characters. His dialog is pitch perfect and his atmosphere is so encompassing and vibrant we are there with David shivering in shame through the streets or awash in boozy, conflicted confidence in the bars. Baldwin handles words with the best of them.‘I stared at absurd Paris, which was as cluttered now, under the scalding sun, as the landscape of my heart.’The novel almost feels like something from Ernest Hemingway at the outset, and perhaps this is what makes the subversion of the traditional concepts of masculinity play out even more effectively. David is living in Paris spending time with Hella, a girl he ‘thought she would be fun to have fun with,’ and drinks his time away with friends while she is gone to Spain to consider his marriage proposal—something that seems more going through the motions of expectations than a heartfelt desire for marriage. The idea of an expatriate in Paris has been a frequently romanticized theme in US literature, and through the characters we get a taste of the idea ‘you don’t have a home until you leave it and then, when you have left it, you never can go back.’ This is true of Giovanni as well, who has left Italy after a personal tragedy and also uses travel as a means of escaping who one was to discover who they will become under a new geographical context. However, we see how ‘nothing is more unbearable, once one has it, than freedom,’ and the characters find themselves feeling dislocated and unmoored more than anything, perhaps running to their own destruction in search of having anything to grasp. ‘ Perhaps everybody has a garden of Eden, I don't know; but they have scarcely seen their garden before they see the flaming sword. Then, perhaps, life only offers the choice of remembering the garden or forgetting it.’‘The Americans have no sense of doom, none whatever,’ Baldwin reflects. ‘They do not recognize doom when they see it,’ and right from the start we are keenly aware everything is careening towards imminent doom . The story is framed on the final day of Giovanni’s life before he faces the guillotine (the guillotine was last used in 1977 and then France outlawed capital punishment in 1981) and mostly told reflecting on the story of the time David and Giovanni spent together until Hella returns and everyone must face-up for their actions. There is a tone of dread permeating every facet of the novel, even worming its way into the nooks and crannies of desire so that we feel nearly suffocated by its imminence.‘The beast which Giovanni had awakened in me would never go to sleep again; but one day I would not be with Giovanni any more. And would I then, like all the others, find myself turning and following all kinds of boys down God knows what dark avenues, into what dark places? With this fearful intimation there opened in me hatred for Giovanni which was as powerful as my love and which was nourished by the same roots.’This suffocation seems to impart the social forces that impose the shame and dread, largely because David struggles with a sense of identity that is outside the socially enforced expectations of gender and sexuality. In his childhood he hears arguments between between his widower father and Aunt Ellen, with his Aunt chastizing his drunkenness and womanizing as setting a bad example while his father expresses his desires for David to be a ‘true man’ and ‘when I say a man, Ellen, I don’t mean a Sunday school teacher.’ The expectations of what is masculinity haunt him, causing his early gay experiences to be a mark of shame and self-hatred in him.‘I couldn't be free until I was attached—no, committed—to someone.’There are some very misogynistic moments in the novel—be advised—though Baldwin seems fairly aware of them as such and the comments by both David and Giovanni seems a reflection of the social conditioning they are struggling within. Not that this excuses their comments or behaviors. Though we also see how the gender expectations are even more oppressive for women, such as Hella’s discussion on how it is a ‘humiliating necessity’ that women are disregarded unless she is attached to a man, ‘to be at the mercy of some gross, unshaven strange before you can begin to be yourself.’ This doubles into the theme on how when chasing a sense of freedom, you often find yourself more constrained or oppressed.‘I was guilty and irritated and full of love and pain. I wanted to kick him and I wanted to take him in my arms’The expectations of heteronormativity cause David great internal suffering and he can never fully give himself to Giovanni. We see this play out in David’s symbolic impressions of Giovanni’s room, seeing it as both a haven for love but, due to his shame and disgust with himself, begins to despise the room. His desires come chased with loathing and diffidence which is a destructive force that wounds not only the one who swallows it down but all those around them as well. As if they are bystanders to the blast. It becomes a betrayal, not only to the self, but to love in general. ‘You want to leave Giovanni because he makes you stink. You want to despise Giovanni because he is not afraid of the stink of love. You want to kill him in the name of all your lying moralities. And you--you are immoral. You are, by far, the most immoral man I have met in all my life. Look, look what you have done to me. Do you think you could have done this if I did not love you? Is this what you should do to love?’If one is caught up trying to play the role of who society thinks they should be, they can never be who they truly are and the dissonance between the hidden self and the public self brings only trauma. This becomes more intensely felt as one slips away from youth where playacting is more easily digestible. ‘Confusion is a luxury which only the very, very young can possibly afford and you are not that young anymore,’ David is warned. Warnings from older men appear all throughout the novel, with a particularly chilling moment in the bar when a man appears like a haggard and horrid seer from myths to broadcast David’s doom.Self-deception becomes a major theme of the novel in this way. ‘People who believe that they are strong-willed and the masters of their destiny can only continue to believe this by becoming specialists in self-deception,’ Baldwin writes and we witness how David’s acknowledgement of his own self-deception but unwillingness to fully depart from it becomes his own undoing. Similarly, the frustrations of others that become seemingly hopeless and unbearable destroys them in turn.‘People who remember court madness through pain, the pain of the perpetually recurring death of their innocence; people who forget court another kind of madness, the madness of the denial of pain and the hatred of innocence; and the world is mostly divided between madmen who remember and madmen who forget. Heroes are rare.’But it is also why we all must fight for a more welcoming and empathetic society that allows space for such things. The thing about social expectations is we are all complicit in them by perpetuating them instead of dismantling them and Giovanni’s Room is a call to confront this in life. We’ve come a long way, but there is still a lot to be done.‘If you cannot love me, I will die. Before you came I wanted to die, I have told you many times. It is cruel to have made me want to live only to make my death more bloody.’I could rant forever about the power and beauty of Giovanni’s Room and Baldwin as an author in general. This is an emotional ride that will shake you to the core while dazzling you with pure poetic intensity. This is a novel full of incredible social and interpersonal criticisms that bruise you but make you better for it and I cannot wait to read literally everything Baldwin wrote. Giovanni’s Room is not only a queer masterpiece but an all around amazing and essential novel.5/5‘No matter how it seems now, I must confess: I loved him. I do not think that I will ever love anyone like that again.’...more",Notes are private!,65,360,1,"Aug 31, 2023","Aug 31, 2023","Aug 31, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17288631-giovanni-s-room

Which is a familiar story for many, such as Thomas Mauceri—author of this incredible graphic memoir In Search of Gil Scott-Heron—who first heard that song in college during the frustrations over the Florida recounts in the Gore/Bush election in 2000. Seb Piquet, who’s gorgeous artwork brings this book to life, delivers that moment perfectly:  [image]This memoir will appeal to both long time fans of the artist as well as newcomers who will certainly want to give him a listen after, particularly as Mauceri breaks up the narrative with lovely inserts going into detail about key songs (either his favorites or ones relevant to that point in the story) such as The Bottle, New York Is Killing Me, The Other Side and more. He was an incredible artist, often called the ‘godfather of rap’ (though he found that reductive and preferred to be a ‘bluesologist’) and inspired generations of musicians (we see Kanye West perform a song at Gil’s funeral that he’d written as a tribute to the legend) his is a sad tale that chases the history of Scott-Heron and how it intertwines with Thomas Mauceri’s own life as he spends years trying to finally connect with Scott-Heron for a documentary only to discover he has passed on the day they are supposed to meet. Which is where this memoir begins. A loving tribute to a cherished artist as well as a meditation on place, race, and history unfolding, In Search of Gil Scott-Heron is a heartfelt and gorgeous graphic memoir.  [image]This is just as much the story of Thomas Mauceri as it is the history of Gil Scott-Heron, which some readers might be surprised about, but the intertwining of tales really works here. Especially in place of the documentary he was never able to create. We begin with Mauceri coming from France to study in the US, having to leave after 9/11, and returning time and time again for projects, always hoping to connect with Gil in order to do a documentary about him. He wanted to show how much the city and the whole of Black history from the Civil Rights to the present comes alive in his music as much as those elements helped create his music. Piquet’s illustrations of the various places in Harlem and New York really capture this, and there are also some really powerful scenes about political events such as the election of Barack Obama in 2004 while Mauceri was in New York. And while he never meets Gil, we do meet a lot of people important to his life, such as Abiodun Oyewole of The Last Poets. It is a really great narrative that tells the lives of both men and captures how much your inspiring artists leave a mark on your life.  [image]Scott-Heron’s words seem reflective of theAudre Lorde poem, A Litany for Survival that ends:when we speak we are afraidour words will not be heardnor welcomedbut when we are silentwe are still afraid So it is better to speakrememberingwe were never meant to survive.’I found In Search of Gil Scott-Heron to be a rather moving and interesting read that, despite not being what I expected, ended up being something really cool and dynamic. I love seeing how much an artist can impact someone and I really liked the way it tied in modern US political history with this story. I remember all these events as well (though I was about a decade younger) so it was a fascinating framing for revisiting them. Do yourself a massive favor and put on some Gil Scott-Heron and raise a toast to the amazing artist now gone, and check this book out if you can!⅘  [image]...more",Notes are private!,4,70,1,not set,not set,"Aug 30, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/63389603-in-search-of-gil-scott-heron

After a lifetimeSara’s longterm relationship takes a turn in her adorable and informative graphic memoir, Us, when Diana breaks some big news to her. After a lifetime of trying to understand themselves, Diana has realized she is a trans woman and is ready to make the transition but is nervous how Sara will treat her as well as all the social elements that will inevitably come into play. This is a really tender and touching look at Diana’s transition as well as Sara’s journey to realizing she is bisexual, all told through Sara Soler’s cute illustrations and translated into english by Siliva Perea Labayen (Sara and Diana are from Spain). The memoir proceeds with a bubbly and boisterous energy that makes it fast-paced, humorous and very accessible while still productively covering big ideas. From social stigmas and harassment (Sara points out how misuderstandings and disinformation have allowed people to ‘opt harmful attitudes’ that can be very hurtful and dangerous) to the discomforts around how to present oneself and the oppressive weight of social gender roles, Us covers a lot of topics through the story of Sara and Diana’s relationship and experience. It is careful to make room for many different kinds of experiences as well, discussing the topics in the way they related to them but showing that everyone is unique and may have different experiences. ‘There are as many experiences as there are trans people in the world. Each person chooses their own path.’ This is a really lovely graphic memoir and truly shows how much love and support goes a long way.  [image]’You’re not alone’ is one of the most important messages in this book.This story covers several years and does well by showing how coming to terms and transitioning can be a big process. When Diana first brings it up it is a full two years before she is ready to make any changes and the opening of this book dives into a lot of anxieties that can keep people trapped in their own silence and afraid to be themselves. What makes Us really work is how effectively it juggles a lot of big concepts on the intersections along the spectrum of gender and sexuality. It is a good look at how society comes into play as well. For example, Diana notes how finally seeing positive trans representation in media was a big opening for her to finally start addressing what she was feeling inside and Sara discusses how the stereotypes of trans people and usually only being seen as villains or murder victims can be really harmful. Especially in a demographic that has an alarmingly high suicide rate and rate of being victims to violence. Having positive representation isn’t the only thing though, and having the support of loved ones and space to accept yourself positively have shown to be a huge mental health benefit for lgbtq+ people of all varieties. I really appreciate how this book never deadnames or misgenders Diana, even in the scenes before her transition, which shows that it is actually not that difficult to get that correct if you try. And earnestly trying is what is often most important. Through Sara’s journey the book also discusses the stigmas against bisexual people (like myself), which I appreciated being threaded in for a larger scope of discussion on these topics.Perhaps the biggest topic discusses is gender roles and how socially enforced stereotypes around gender can be harmful to everyone. Things like “boys don’t cry” or “girls should be delicate”, for instance, are shown as harmful and how beliefs on how someone of a gender should act are increasingly oppressive if that just isn’t who you are. There are also a lot of interesting looks at how, once she presents as a woman, Diana begins to experience the harassment and misogyny faced by women and it is really eye opening for her. Something I found this book does well is offer information and ideas in a way that reach a large audience and how it applies to them. It’s just a well done book but through all of it, the most important thing we learn about Diana and Sara is:  [image]”We’re happy!”I really enjoyed Us by Sara Soler and I feel this is an important book that many can get a lot out of as well as just enjoy the couple’s really loving relationship and openness about their experiences. Us is fun, funny and quite effectively done while being very heartfelt.5/5...more",Notes are private!,17,140,1,not set,not set,"Aug 29, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/79959268-us

The story of Medusa still resonates today, particularly in the way the young girl was thought of as a monster in order to ignore the fact that she was the victim of sexual assault and then, later, public opinion. Dear Medusa, a YA novel in verse by Olivia A. Cole, takes this premise into the modern day high school where 16 year old Alice must survive the vicious rumors and social outcasting after she is sexually assaulted by a popular teacher. Like the greek myth, the victim has been turned to a monster, a life sacrificed in order to uphold the toxicity of patriarchal values so ingrained in society that instead of supporting the victim everyone jumps to blame and chastise her instead of the perpetrator. Cole handles this with grace and Dear Medusa is a very empathetic and healing novel as well as offering sharp social criticisms on a wide set of issues from victim shaming, racism, homophobia and the misogynistic policing of women’s bodies. A heavy but heartfelt novel, Dear Medusa uses poetic form to cut right to the heart of these issues to explore the maelstrom of emotions therein while demonstrating the healing power of friendship and illuminating the struggles faced by teenage girls in a patriarchal society that objectifies them.I’m quite fond of the recent trend of YA novels in verse. As a major fan of poetry, I enjoy seeing the form introduced to teenage readers in a way that is engaging and enticing, making it far more accessible to enjoy than the usual academic introductions. It also demonstrates to readers that writing, like journaling, can be an excellent avenue for self-reflection and emotional processing. But most importantly, I find poetry to have a unique ability to plug in directly to the main vein of emotions and present them in all their abstractness and ambiguity. Cole handles the prose quite effectively and can harness both narrative plot and internal struggles in a rather gorgeous manner. Which is good because there is a lot to unpack in this novel. The story centers on the aftermath of a sexual assault by a popular teacher and the way Alice, despite being the victim, becomes a symbol of shame in the school. I wrote quite extensively on this in relation to Medusa earlier this year here and I feel Cole does an excellent job of adapting the thematic insights of the Medusa tale to the modern age. Towards the end of the novel, Alice begins to write letters to Medusa (hence the title) and while I enjoyed this I felt it came so late in the novel and wasn’t utilized enough making it feel tacked on in case anyone missed the Medusa theme and would have been more effective had it been used for a greater portion of the novel. That said, Cole uses this book as an excellent way to highlight a lot of themes on the abuse and oppressions faced by teenage girls. We see right away what Kate Manne coins as himpathy in her book Down Girl: The Logic of Misogyny, namely that people will sympathize with a man over a woman even when he has wronged her. The teacher is popular and instead of accepting their idol has been tarnished, the public opinion turns against Alice. We sadly see this far too often, people asking of a victim “well what was she wearing” or that she invited the abuse. Anything to make it her fault and not his, anything to reframe the conversation into a moral indictment of the victim to dispute their victimhood while completely turning a blind eye on the actions of the perpetrator.A major issue with this is ignoring the massive imbalance in the power dynamics. The idea that a girl has the power because of her body is wildly problematic and merely a misogynist excuse for bad behavior. It even comes in the form of weaponizing sexual positivity, such as older men praising young women or underaged girls for being “so mature” or “confindent” as a manipulation tactic to avert their attention from their lack of power in the dynamic and away from the awareness they are being groomed or assaulted. In an incredible  essay on the subject, Tavi Gevinson discusses how much language is couched in ways to manipulate the perspectives on the scales of power in this way: ‘I now view some of my “empowering” experiences as violating, exploitative, and manipulative. I noticed that “gray” and “complicated” were words I used to stop questioning whatever had happened, rather than to understand it. “Formative” revealed itself to mean “traumatic.” “Creep” or “bad guy” or “pervy but not Harvey Weinstein” now strike me as wildly nonspecific euphemisms for a danger that was too uncomfortable to grapple with at the time and that, again, prioritizes men’s identities over their actions. This slow-motion aftershock has been its own traumatic event.’Similarly, in her book My Body, Emily Ratajkowski writes:‘In my early twenties, it had never occurred to me that the women who gained their power from beauty were indebted to the men whose desire granted them that power in the first place. Those men were the ones in control, not the women the world fawned over. Facing the reality of the dynamics at play would have meant admitting how limited my power really was—how limited any woman’s power is when she survives and even succeeds in the world as a thing to be looked at.’These are real struggles teenage girls face, and the most horrific part is that the looks from older men are not just strangers on the street but often men that are in positions of power over them or tasked with their protection. Like Alice’s teacher.Another issue here is that this is so much a part of society specifically because it upholds patriarchal order. As Simone de Beauvoir discusses in The Second Sex, girls learn at an early age that society is coded in the male gaze. Men are gazing at them, making them objects. This makes a young girl see her own body as valued only by its status as a sexual object, and as they too are objectified by their bodies, it can cause girls to grow up seeing their entire being as an object given value through the male gaze, and girls such as Alice are manipulated into confusing their sexualization with their identity. Furthermore, girls bodies are often policed (ie double standards in dress codes) with girls told to cover up or being victim blamed for ""dressing provocatively"" which then teaches girls that their bodies are the problem but not the abusers utter inability to control their behaviors. Cole probes all these issues in the novel and it is quite well done.Though there is much more beyond this issue, and introducing the array of friends in the novel opens up the opportunity for further dissections of society and sexuality. Alice is bisexual and Deja is both asexual and Black, and Dear Medusa does better than most other books I’ve encountered on presenting what asexuality is. The therapy sessions also open up a great discussion on misogynoir (the intersection of misogyny and racism) and other intersections of oppression girls face.Dear Medusa covers a lot of ground and can be quite heavy, but it is also extremely well done and effective at bringing these issues to light. The poetic style also makes it a quick read that can seamlessly shift between topics and helps present these themes in an accessible way. A really valuable read for anyone, especially as Alice reminds us:“to have menin your lifewho knowthat the battlewe face againstmen who arewolves can onlybe wonwith the helpof menwho are not.”Worth the read and worth thinking about and addressing in your own life.4.5/5...more",Notes are private!,1,101,1,"Aug 27, 2023","Oct 25, 2023","Aug 27, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61389548-dear-medusa

A celebrated and successful writer in Bolivia, this new translation from Isabel Adey brings her powerful work to English-speaking readers and I am so thankful for the recent rise in interest for translations of modern Latin-American gothic literature as this is an excellent, unsettling and rather crisp collection of stories. Short in length with only six stories, each bruises the reader in a quick succession of pummeling stories that rise in intensity as they often slither towards a piece of previously undisclosed information that cracks open the horrors of being alive and centers us on the struggles to survive them. All but one story is set in Bolivia, but offers an insight into the multitudes of peoples who live there, such as the Mennonites from Canada who settled in Bolivia or a woman who grew up in a pocket of Japanese immigrants and now teaches origami at a women’s prison. Gritty yet told in gorgeous prose, Fresh Dirt From the Grave is a disquieting collection of tales that show how a sudden disruption can accumulate suffering with far-reaching tentacles of trauma. ‘Because it had all been just that: a disruption.’While some of the stories can be fairly distressing with uncomfortable themes, Rivero’s writing is so luminously gorgeous. Even in the dreary descriptions, such as the ocean being ‘just watery vomit with nothing on the horizon, a giant emerald back full of evil and beauty. It was a miserable place,’ and the landscapes always ‘teeming with evil and beauty.’ We frequently see the two as inseparable, as ‘one and the same fold. Darkness and light,’ and for all the horrors inflicted we see the will to survive as a light shining in all the darkness. These stories are not unlike the ‘perfection of the coral snake created by that inmate’ we find in It Looks Human When it Rains which the origami instructor, Keiko, describes as ‘a baby dragon on the brink of stirring from its inanimate nature, and it looked as if it had been made with tweezers. But it had been born from those rough, criminal hand’: these stories are build out of the rough, gritty traumas of life but in Rivero’s hands they come out as beautiful and intricately detailed.The characters in these stories are often fighting to not be washed away by the world. They are the regular person, the victims to those in power and capital, the lives that are trying to not be pushed off the edge of existence without anyone even noticing. They recall the unsettling voice a couple in Kindred Deer, now living in New York near the Finger Lakes, hear within the static of the Bolivian news station they turn on to hear about home:‘Those voices, those beloved accents arrive muffled by the interference from the bad weather. ‘They’re killing us,’ someone sobs in an interview. I fidget in my seat. I want to know more about the desperate ‘us’ that reveals itself in that broken voice.’These are quiet voices hoping to be heard in the static of it all. And several of these stories have inspiration in true events. The opening tale, Blessed are the Meek is a tale of revenge inspired by the horrific sexual assaults in a Bolivian-Mennonite community in Manitoba Colony (this same incident, women being gassed and then assaulted, inspired the novel Women Talking by Miriam Toews and the film adaptation of it). This story starts the collection with a real punch to the gut (but a darkly satisfying conclusion), showing how although the daughter had been assaulted and wronged, she and her family were forced to flee and feel the shame in order to protect the men in charge, to ‘cleanse the wound with silence.’ She is even gaslit to believe it was her fault for allowing the Devil in through her supposed weakness and is misremembering her attackers face because ‘the Devil plays these tricks in the imagination when the imagination rebels, and it also makes us submit,’ and is causing further harm to the community by ‘falsely’ accusing a man of something that was ‘clearly’ just the Devil she invited in. The following tale, Fish, Turtle, Vulture was inspired by the survival story of José Salvador Alvarenga, who was lost at sea for 438 days, and, like in Rivero’s version that adds a potentially sinister twist near the end, conversed with with his deceased crewmate, Ezequiel Córdoba, for several days after he had passed. Many details in this story come from Salvador Alvarenga’s life, such as the crewmate's mother and her tortillas or asking the dead companion what death is like. But even the stories not directly tied to a notable event ring true in the ways we can be terrorized in life, such as the lengthy confession of life in Donkey Skin from a person who wants their story told before they forget it and have it lost due to their medical problems, or the aunt with serious mental health issues that assails a family (with plenty of skeletons in their closet) in Socorro.Several times we see the devils deal of trading health and physical safety for frail financial stability, such as selling blood in Donkey Skin or the more extreme trade-off in Kindred Deer where the husband’s health is severely hindered in order to profit from experimental medical trials. In this same story, Rivero looks at how this can occur on a national level in times of conflict, with what are usually the poor sacrificing their lives for the prosperity of those in power.‘I suppose as far as this culture of medals and nationalism is concerned, going to war is enough to turn you into a hero, and even more so if you return home ground to dust in a sealed casket decorated with the colours of the flag.’In most of these, the true trauma creeps up like a twist, such as when Kieko’s garden work with her college-aged room renter dredges up painful memories of a surprise love-child from her husband they were forced to take in and the confrontation of accepting what happened to her.Fresh Dirt from the Grave can test your nerves and take your mind to dark places, but it is ultimately a rather gorgeously written collection on the will to survive in all the darkness. While the narrative techniques don’t vary much and it can seem a bit repetitive by the end, it is still a hard hitting book. Short but lasting in its intensity, Rivero is an author I really hope to see be more widely translated so I can enjoy more of her work. 3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,35,142,1,"Aug 27, 2023","Aug 27, 2023","Aug 27, 2023",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/61910651-fresh-dirt-from-the-grave

It’s a ‘I came because of a story.’Minds are easily enchanted by tales of heroic journeys with the promise of a beautiful maiden in need of rescuing. It’s a staple of fairy tales and also a point that has inspired many retellings with gender-bent twists or heroic heroines who don’t need saving. All of which might have us considering what the romanticization of tales like this suggest are social values and what constitutes as heroic. Thornhedge, the latest novella from T. Kingfisher in Tor’s recent line-up of her works (though, according to the author’s note, the first manuscript she submitted), probes such questions through her loose retelling of the Sleeping Beauty tale. It is a quiet, sweet story, if a little sauceless at times, where we find the fairy who has cursed a young maiden to a lengthy sleep is not evil at all. Toadling ‘had lived with dread for 200 years’ standing sentry outside the tower where the young princess rests, though when a knight comes ‘because of a story’ seeking some sort of adventure or at least to know if it is true, the truth behind the myth comes out for why she would prefer he did not continue his quest. While this is admittedly fun with a lot going for it—especially Toadling who is so endearing—it simultaneously feels like it doesn’t lean into it’s own retelling enough while also relying to much on it as the bones to hold the whole structure up. Sweet and imaginative, though perhaps needing more nuance and room to breathe to allow the long history of events stretch their narrative legs a bit, Thornhedge is still an interesting look at how stories can twist to romanticize a tale at the expense of the truth.There seems to be a recipe for romantic knight’s quests and rescue missions, usually involving a “fair maiden” who has been captured away by some great evil. A dragon perhaps, or an evil sorceress, and it seems almost a given in these tales that the princess is beautiful and the sorceress…lacking in beauty. Enter Toadling, sweet, shy, lovable Toadling, who we are told many times she is not beautiful (the knight tells her as much, but does say she is interesting which is either a condolence or perhaps more valuable anyways), and she is watching a tower where sleeps a princess. Who is trapped for a fairly valid reason. I won’t give away the plot but its pretty fun and sets up what could have been a really interesting look at how the Sleeping Beauty tale is merely a misunderstanding of what happened but instead becomes almost overly good and evil flipped on its head. Anyways, regardless, knowing the recipe for knight quests, this story doesn’t seem to fit and gossip has a way of trying to make the events much sexier and we learn “the truth” which is then juxtaposed with the stories around these events that are circulating 200 years later. Unsurprisingly, what we hear is a very romanticized version (a retelling of its own, I suppose) that leans into the rather masculine “knight saves the day to win the princess.” Or, as David Foster Wallace discusses in his essay Back into the New Fire (in an essay that is a bit problematic but we are going to use this for a different purpose so that's a discussion for another time), ‘the way the story always goes, good Sir Knight risks life and lance against the dragon not to “rescue” the good-looking virgin, but to “win” her. And any knight, from any era, can tell you what “win” means here.’ Which is a huge bummer for Toadling because she’s become a villain and the real villain is now the sought after “prize.” Nevermind the fact that, while being an ancient evil, she is in human form forever asleep as an 8 year old girl. Which, perhaps is part of the subversiveness of how the romanticization of the story is sexualizing an 8 year old girl for knights to “win,” but either way Kingfisher is directing us to how pretty gross the whole idea of a knight “winning” a captive princess is.‘I mostly came for answers,’ our knight tells Toadling, ‘or maybe just the story.’ Unlike most knights, this one is more interested in winning a story and seemingly not a beautiful princess, though I’m sure it has crossed his mind. Kingfisher plays with some expectations here as well, making him a Muslim knight and also describing him as not particularly attractive as well. Though this does touch on how it is sort of unclear when this story is supposed to take place or if it is actually our Earth or a fantasy world with most of the same elements and general vibes. I mean, I do enjoy that we are going for an inclusive story but Toadling was just describing people waving crusades banners and now monks are just hanging with the Muslim knight talking about god like everything is just cool? It seemed a missed opportunity to discuss the religious violence or at least find a way to frame the story in history. Which I guess we are supposed to brush aside for the sake of the story, but at least the world building for the world of fairies is rather lovely and I especially enjoy the way time works in this book with decades passing in the fairy realm being only a few days in the human one. Anyways, an interesting dynamic is that the knight has to confront the version of the story he has heard with the existence and warnings of Toadling, who is pretty charming in her quirky shyness (poor fairy girl has been in solitude for centuries, so you’ll forgive her awkwardness) but doesn’t really fit the bill for a heroic knights quest. His stubbornness in thinking he can lift a non-existent curse on her (does he think she’ll turn beautiful?) makes for some rather cute and charming scenes.But for all the sweetness, the atmosphere is rather lacking. I found Kingfisher’s What Moves the Dead to be an unsettling delight, particularly for the way it felt electrifying in the tense tone and eerie atmosphere. Toadling is great and quiet, but the story is almost too quiet and soft as well, seeming like the whole thing is far removed in soft flashbacks bathed in a sepia tone with little contrast to emphasize the sinister shadows and thorns of the story. Not that there aren’t some great scenes, but it all feels a bit unhurried in a telling that is also too truncated for the scenes to really land. I think Marquise explains all this much more efficiently in her , but the elements of Fayette simply being a pure evil being felt too much like a shortcut past what could have been a tension building exploration of childhood cruelty giving way to unbearable darkness. The novel decides this is just an evil child beyond redemption and that’s that—the nature of who she is supposed to be and all the changeling lore is pretty cool, granted, but it all happens too quickly to really give you much to grip onto even with one pretty dramatic and violent scene. I did, however, really enjoy the way the magic mixes with the world and the kingdom falling into a state of disrepair as ‘the people bled away drop by drop and nobody tried to staunch the flow.’ You do feel Toadling’s sadness and longing quite strongly, and I found her to be such a well constructed and lovable character you really do root for. Despite some aspects that didn’t quite work for me, i would still encourage you to read Thronhedge as it is quite a fun little tale. I would have enjoyed more space given to let the story flow and at times it seems it would have benefitted by playing around with its own elements more. It felt unsure if it was a retelling or an homage at times, and I think it could have been more successful by just really leaning into itself. Still, I read this in a single sitting and found it quite engaging the whole way and I really appreciate the aspect on seeing how history can get twisted into myths and legends that fit the needs of those who desire conquest or an romanticized tale at the expense of the truth. While I may have been a bit critical here, Thornhedge was enjoyable and I will certainly continue to read more T.

Clifton is ‘one of our preeminent poets of joy,’ poet Ross Gay says in his introduction, and I’ve always found her words to be as soothing and thoughtful as they are empowering and progressive. Also how can I not love poems such as June 20, my own birthday has its own poem where she talks about being born in one week (Clifton’s birthday is June 27th), to ‘emerge face first / into their temporary joy.’ Her poems are compact yet contain multitudes, and here she turns her attention to both the personal and the political, with many poems discussing family such as her parents and the abuses from her father. This is a collection about surviving the world and the self, with so much grace and beauty it is astonishing it can fit in just 80pages, reaffirming why Lucille Clifton was such a decorated and celebrated poet. Reissued for the 30th anniversary of The Book of Light, it now comes with a lovely introduction from Ross Gay as well as a heartfelt afterword by her daughter, Sidney Clifton, and is an indispensable collection of gorgeous poetry.night vision the girl fits her body into the space between the bedand the wall. she is a stalk,exhausted. she will do something with this. she willsurround these bones with flesh,she will cultivate night vision.she will train her tongueto lie still in her mouth and listen.the girl slips into sleep.her dream is red and raging.she will rememberto build something human with itThe Book of Light is divided into three sections, Reflection looking inward, Lightning Bolt with her gaze more out towards the world, and the metaphysical and ponderous final section titled Splendor. As her daughter, Sidney, explains in the afterword: ‘These poems were written in a time of personal reclining: with the parents she struggled to love, understand, and forgive; with a husband who left too early and with no explanations or apologies; and with a future she hadn’t anticipated.’Her ‘vulnerability birthing poems’ comes through this entire collection, in poems where she speaks frankly about how ‘each morning i pull myself / out of despair’ or the difficulties of memories about her father, such as in My Lost Father where she writes ‘where he moves / he leaves a wake of tears.’ These poems can bruise, but they are also healing and often full of joy. On this, Ross Gay elaborates that ‘joy is a condition that emanates from the complicated, difficult, wonderful, and devastating fact that we belong to something beyond ourselves: namely, one another.’ And that sense of connection she instills always wraps you up in the beauty of her words like a caring hug.For this reason Gay tells us that in Clifton voice we read ‘voice not as a possession, but as possession itself.’ This entire collection crackles in such a magnificent voice.here yet be dragonsso many languages have fallenoff of the edge of the worldinto the dragon’s mouth. somewhere there be monsters whose teethare sharp and sparkle with lostpeople. lost poems. whoamong us can imagine ourselvesunimagined? whoamong us can speak with so fragiletongue and remain proud?There is a fun variety to the poems here though. We have a poem written to US republican senator Jesse Helms—who was strongly opposed to civil rights, women’s rights, gay rights and voting rights—that caused controversy when it came out for her sharp criticisms of military bombings where ‘civilian deaths have become / collateral damage’ (read it here). Mythology comes into play in several poems, such as one about Sisyphus in the underworld (‘how sweet power is, the story / gods never tell’) or about Atlas who states ‘i have learned to carry it / the way a poor man learns / to carry everything.’ And there is also a series of poems addressed to Clark Kent and Superman, asking ‘who will come flying / after me, leaping tall buildings? / you?’ that shows we don’t need superheroes to save us, we just have each other and we can be strong enough. Though perhaps one of the most memorable is the final poem, brothers. It is told in eight parts as a conversation between the Devil and God where we only hear the Devil’s voice, quoting Carolyn Forché for the title of the sixth part: ‘the silence of God is God’, as the Devil asks:tell me, tell us whyIn the confusion of a mountain of babies stacked like cordwood,Or limbs walking away from each other,Of tongues bitten throughBy the language of assault,Tell me, tell us whyYou neither raised Your handNor turned away, tell us whyYou watched the excommunication ofThat world and You said nothing.The Devil lated admits ‘still there is mercy, there is grace’ and concludes pondering that ‘to ask You to explain / is to deny You.’ Clifton shows that acceptance comes from beyond words. And of course there is this one, one of her most well known and loved:won't you celebrate with mewhat i have shaped intoa kind of life? i had no model.born in babylonboth nonwhite and womanwhat did i see to be except myself?i made it uphere on this bridge betweenstarshine and clay,my one hand holding tightmy other hand; come celebratewith me that everydaysomething has tried to kill meand has failed.Lucille Clifton was a miraculously good poet and her skills come shining from every page of The Book of Light. The opening poem lists many different words for light, though none seem to shine as bright as Lucille herself. A favorite poet, I turn to her quite often and always find something new to enjoy or think about.

Facades change, as do the people within them and it becomes like a sort of geographical ship of Theseus while we, too, have changed in our mutual time apart. This dissonance is both thematic and tonal to Maya Binyam’s brilliant debut novel, Hangman, amplified by the state of separation having been one of political exile and the return shrouded in a bit of mystery that seems to only portend the news of death. It is a story made up of smaller stories all cascading at the narrator, each registering with a near-mythic property to them as we hear life stories of politics, family, traditions, exorcisms or simply two grad students arguing ideology. Binyam’s writing is utterly captivating, crafting a surreal and sardonic tale of an émigré finding themselves a stranger in a strange land that happens to be his home country now as unfamiliar to him as he is to it. Moving with a steady drip of existential dread through a labyrinth of conversations, the narrator seems stubbornly disinterested in assembling a sense of meaning or self-reflection and instead allows himself to be pulled through events as if ‘waiting for my life to happen’ in a way that makes everything feel threateningly disjointed and disorienting. Wryly humorous and deeply ponderous, Hangman reads like an existential fable on exile, homecomings, culture and the ways each shape and are shaped by political history all wrapped up in the narrator’s surreal journey back into Africa.‘Sometimes the events of the world were clear, and at other times they rearranged themselves in such a way that nothing made sense, and even if they did make sense to other people, they made no discernible sense to you.’This is an astonishingly accomplished debut with sharp writing that pulls off stylistic flair and is entirely engrossing. The opening chapter had me completely enthralled, opening with death and a body transported on a return trip home, and it keeps you turning pages with a growing tension and dread as we guess as to what is occurring and getting tiny pieces of clarity along the way—not unlike the stick-figure game that is the novel’s namesake. It is a rather enigmatic novel, one where the events feel akin to having bit off more than one could chew and trying to make sense of it all, though the writing manages to create this effect while still having confident control over all the elements. We are at the mercy of Binyam’s narration through a man who, through his refusal of a deeper meaning to anything, will not read between the lines for symbolism, and it whisks us through the story shrouded in a sort of acerbic ambiguity. There are almost no proper nouns, making room for rather humorously cumbersome flourishes like repeatedly addressing someone as “my son’s mother’s brother” but it also establishes an atmosphere of distance and detachment. Locations are never named, though through the whiffs of clues we can assume it is somewhere in a post-revolution country of Africa and the narrator had been a political refugee in the US (there are references to drones and a President who “looks like us” as his brother writes). It all seems rather cacophonous at times, seemingly leading somewhere we don’t quite grasp which is often reflected in the cities themselves—’viaducts cast the city in shadow, enticing its inhabitants to ascend staircases that led to nowhere’—or homes such as the narrator’s cousin’s that seems to be made up ‘entirely of hallways.’In many ways it feels adjacent to Franz Kafka, though shorn of the Europeanness, but here it isn’t that the logic is impenetrable or simply meaningless, it’s that we are outside of being able to even grasp the meaning while the narrator insists on it’s meaninglessness that keeps us feeling small in the mechanisms of some threatening and surreal story. ‘Some situations in life really were confusing and couldn’t be appreciated without prior knowledge about local customs, current events, and other people’s personal lives. However, that information was usually discernible, even if it wasn’t explained in a straightforward manner. Even invisible histories had their physical manifestations.’This addresses issues on two fronts in the novel, being both his feeling outside the country of his birth but also seen in the ways the country in which one takes refuge might resist any efforts to understand their cultural differences and ‘People just choose to ignore those manifestations, because being ignorant gave them an excuse to do whatever they wanted.’ The home he has left is no longer his own it seems, and feels ‘only partially accessible to me, given that tie, geography and my changing legal status as a citizen, refugee, tourist, etc., had conspired to dislocate me from it.’ He feels distressed by the dichotomy of re-emerging in a society of more collectivist traditions after having been shaped by the mold of individualism rampant in US culture yet seems uninterested in examining it beyond the surface despite having, we briefly learn, been jailed for being a political revolutionary. ‘He could either be like everyone and help no one, or be an individual and help the world.’Politics, it seems, is constantly invading and morphing everything and everyone under it. It lingers over every conversation and many of the mordant situations read like parables, such as being required to have a cart to get your baggage at the airport and having to pay someone in order to obtain a cart but having to way of accessing money, or his cousin asking to invest in the completion of a home that has already been finished. The narrator’s own former home is now occupied by missionaries who presumably purchased the house from the government, making for a quick yet devastating jab at the legacies of missionaries colonizing Africa. As for US aid programs to Africa, Hangman addresses aid as something that often exists more for the benefit of the giver to feel they’ve done something than for the recipient, ‘Sending them in lieu of things the local government had asked for, and which might have sustained its constituents forever.’We see this in the used clothing a man forces upon our narrator, or the phone’s the President gives to those who lost their homes in a disaster when what they really needed was a home. But we feel good because someone was selected as ‘a stand-in for the gratitude of all’ and we can turn our heads again.‘That was how people, living people, dealt with the new of people who were suffering: pretending to summon the experience of dying…Pretending that it could be controlled was just something that living people did in order to convince themselves that the real experience was something that happened only to others.’Our narrator sees much of the way people process grief and tragedy as a ‘performance,’ and it is one he isn’t inclined to participate in. Even the potential death of his own brother doesn’t spark anything in him (though his emails do seem to mimic the scam emails of the early 2000s and perhaps he suspects his brother of just trying to get money). It’s all the same to him either way:‘Most of the things that happened in life had no meaning, but eventually all the meaningless things combined to produce an emotion so strong that people felt the need to find an explanation for it. So, at the end of their lives, they described the events of their lives through the lens of happiness, or sadness, or resentment, even though the same things happened to basically all of us.’Of course we can see how he might be jaded from time in prison and the US, which he finds less the land of possibility and freedom and more just another way to be oppressed, this time largely by racism and his Otherness marking him as suspicious and not worth bridging cultural barriers to understand. Hangman is often quite bleak, particularly with a narrator we see being pushed along as if he weren’t even in control of himself (‘and then my body went away’ he says to describe his getting on the flight to Africa), and slowly being transformed by his experiences without any attempt at consent. Yet for all the bleakness, the surreal humor keeps it afloat and it refuses to be bogged down. The ending is a knockout, one that I found excellently executed despite not usually thinking twists actually work beyond initial shock. I won’t spoil anything but I’m going to spoiler tag the next bit just in case (view spoiler)[It arrives as a two-fold twist and while I think we can get caught up in all the foreshadowing of the main twist, doing so allows the second part of it to catch us off guard (hide spoiler)], Binyam is not only good at crafting the writing of a novel, but shows a brilliant understanding of the mechanics of how a reader reads and processes a text and uses that to help pull of her conclusion.I really loved this one. It’s elusive and sly, surreal and sinister, yet rather goofy and fun even in the face of otherwise unbearable bleakness. Hangman is a unique look at the exile narrative, one that turns its own gaze inward, as well as the ideas of our own understanding of ourselves and our place in the world. Witty and wild, Hangman is an extraordinary debut and this is a strong promise to start a career I can’t wait to watch.4.5/5‘It didn’t matter that we had been political prisoners, neglectful fathers, exiles, and so on, because now we were just two people, two tourists, returned to a country that might as well have been any country in the world.

It’s a comical spiral of bad decisions, selfish motivations, hurt feelings and even more bad decisions that are often ‘the kind of mess we’d get into in our 20s, not our mid-30s.’   [image]Bongiovanni offers a really blunt look at being queer in your 30s and offers an insightful commentary on how so much of the efforts for offering queer-specific spaces and support tends to aim towards teens and young adults and is something many feel they grow out of and feel left on the outside. It is also a look at the idea of found-families (the group here meets all working at a restaurant, the classic queer friend group location) and how friendships that were once so tight-knit can start to drift apart as life goes on.

It’s all a mess, but a fun mess to watch because it feels very real and there are some lovely moments of self reflection along with all the bad choices and hurt feelings.

In an era where new myth retellings are hitting New Release shelves on a near weekly basis, it was a pleasure to dive into Natalie Hayne’s Pandora’s Jar: Women in the Greek Myths, in which the Haynes combines her vast knowledge of greek mythology and witty humor to step through key women figures in myths. This collection of essays in not a retelling, but instead a deep dive into the various interpretations of these figures that have existed through time in ‘ an attempt to fill in some of the black space’ and offer a more dynamic portrait of them. It is a fun and often very funny book, combining classic texts like Homer, Aeschylus, Euripides (and more) with later tellings such as Nathaniel Hawthorne and even pop-culture references and more recent retellings such as Clash of the Titans or the Hadestown musical. I suspect this is one that will be quite hit or miss with readers, though I found it to be very approachable and easy to wade through for someone with very little knowledge of the myths such as myself and I really enjoyed seeing all the different variations and thinking about what the contexts say about various aspects of motivation, villany, heroism and more. A pretty quick collection with as many laughs as there are insights, I am officially a big fan of Natalie Haynes.‘Which version of a story we choose to tell, which characters we place in the foreground, which ones we allow to fade into the shadows: these reflect both the teller and the reader, as much as they show the characters of the myth.’If we are looking at variations on myths, you should probably throw on this Anaïs Mitchell song. Besides, it comes up in the text. Pandora’s Jar is divided up into chapters each focusing on a different figure: Pandora, Jocasta, Helen, Medusa, The Amazons, Clytemnestra, Eurydice, Phaedra, Medea and Penelope. Though within each chapter many other figures share some of the focus, such as how Pasiphaë’s agency in her sexual encounter with the bull changes in variations on the tale. Haynes sets out ‘to show how differently they were viewed in the ancient world. How major female characters in Ovid would become non-existent Hollywood wives in twenty-first-cinema,’ how artists like sculptures or poets depicted them (I particularly love the passage on Carol Ann Duffy’s poem Eurydice where Orpheus is an unwanted stalker ‘who follows her round / writting poems’ until she admits ‘In fact girls, I’d rather be dead’ and Haynes points out nobody ever really asks Euridyce what she thinks of anything). For the most part, this book just shows how differently we can view a story through changes of framing or which characters are highlighted, though there is also an effort to give space to women that are often cast outside the spotlight. In this way we also see how expressions of value can change based on how the story is told. A notable example is how in the versions that are toned down, such as those by Nathaniel Hawthorne in A Wonder-Book for Girls and Boys, tend to make the heroes less complex in ways that minimize the struggles or victimization of women. ‘These myths are full of violence,’ Haynes says, ‘and we should at least ask why it is the violence against women that is removed in order to make our heroes uncomplicated adventurers.’ Haynes herself does not shy away from the very violent and often vengeful acts of some of these women and discusses how removing unseemly aspects makes for flat characters and unrealistic portrayals. ‘We do not live in a world of heroes and villains, and if we believe we do, we should really consider the possibility that we haven’t thought about things properly. We cannot hope to make sense of our stories or ourselves (myths are a mirror of us, after all) if we refuse to look at half of the picture. Or--worse--don’t even notice half of it is missing.’I enjoy how this opens up the validity of looking at all the representations, not to find a ‘truer’ one, but to enjoy how complex and changing storytelling can be and how various figures can be used for various purposes. I like to say that myths and fairy tales are not corporate IP so play with them all you want, just do it well. ‘The version of a story we find in Iliad or the Odyssey is not somehow more valid than a version we find in a fifth-century BCE play or on the side of a vase merely because it is older.’ And I think that is cool, just enjoy the myths how you do and let people enjoy them how they do.It was a delight reading this after having read Haynes’ Medusa retelling, Stone Blind, and seeing how that chapter felt like collecting all the notes and key statements that were made later in the novel. Her story is another good example of how the symbolism of myths can change dramatically, such as how Medusa became a symbol for the #MeToo movement.  [image]Haynes briefly talks about the Luciano Garbati statue of Medusa holding Perseus’ head (left) created as a response to the Benvenuto Cellini’s classic statue (right) as an example of shifting imagery (though it should be noted that many feminist activists criticized the statue and the choice of displaying the art of a man as a statement against sexual assault). There is some great discourse as well on the idea of Penelope as the “good” wife and Clytemnestra as the “bad” wife (and how different tales change her proximity to the slaying of Agamemnon and her motivations for doing so), and as I can’t resist a good Beyoncé reference I enjoyed her take on Clytemnestra in context of Beyoncé's Lemonade. There’s Star Trek in here too. It’s just fun.‘When women take up space, there is less available for men. But it means we get a whole story instead of half of one. It scarcely needs saying that our understanding of the story of Oedipus is enriched when we know the story of Jocasta, and vice versa.’To counter my opening statement about myths changing, Haynes adds ‘There’s comfort in stories which don’t change, even the sad ones.’ I think thats why people can often feel very particular about a favorite version of a story. In his book Retelling Stories, Framing Culture: Traditional Story and Metanarratives in Children's Literature, John Stephens writes ‘ ‘a tendency…to privilege similarity over difference’ when it comes to retellings, but Haynes makes a good case to see differences as a chance to think deeper about these figures. I enjoyed that she frames this book around the story of Pandora and the jar and the variations on what might have entered the world. Here we see all the different tales that have entered the world and this was an exciting, humorous and very accessible way to look at the implications behind them all as a method of better appreciating the women in Greek Myths. 3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,32,183,1,"Aug 17, 2023","Aug 17, 2023","Aug 17, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58275735-pandora-s-jar

Deeply necessary and often devastating, Kate Beaton’s harrowing graphic memoir Ducks: Two Years in the Oil Sands takes a brutal and bluntly honest look at the labor force from the safety risks, harassment to sexual assaults that occurred and puts a spotlight on how the workers are just as exploited as the land. Fresh out of college but also fresh out of money to pay off her loans, Beaton leaves home to take part in the Alberta oil boom becoming yet another in the lineage of those who must leave Nova Scotia to go where the money and jobs are. But in an isolated place where men outnumber the women 50 to 1, she finds this places a target on her for unwanted advances and harassment and all the while the destruction of the land by the oil industry, the unsafe conditions and the deaths of coworkers start assailing her mind as well. She shows how these conditions make sexual assault a near inevitability. Beaton takes a very empathetic look at those caught in this sort of life, and for many readers this might often leave you feeling rather empty inside at points, as if inside you was also a vast frozen land with icy wind being mined like the stolen lands in her narrative. There is a lot to process here and, truthful, this dredged up a lot of complicated emotions and memories of my own past working factories and other male dominated, physical labor jobs that also often took an existential toll on me. Yet there is still beauty within this story of Beaton’s struggles—as well as a rather lovely art style that helps propel the story told in a long series of anecdotes along a 2 year arc—and this is an important plea to understand the toll misogyny, harassment and assault takes on women as well as the mental and physical tolls this line of work can bring. Brilliantly layered themes addressed with plenty of empathy, nuances and addressing many issues as systemic instead of isolated, Ducks is an essential read.  [image]This was a really important read done with such heartbreaking honesty and heartfelt integrity. The story really moves along and covers a lot of ground, and while it can seem a bit repetitive it doesn’t bog it down and instead seems a rather authentic representation of just how repetitive the days in this type of work can be. But also really effectively shows how the minor harassments or general creepiness from men start to become an unbearable weight under the constant repetition of examples. This can be a rather difficult read emotionally and also a touchy subject, as one character learns when she tries to write an article about the horrible conditions faced by women there and is told she is trying to vilify honest labor and make all men seem like monsters. Beaton addresses this more head-on in her afterword:‘I have seen many people quick to become defensive against the suggestion that gendered violence exists in places like the oil sands. They may either work there and are proud of the work they do and the livelihoods they support with it, or they know and love men there, and are insulted by the insinuation of being lumped in with anything to do with something as abhorrent as sexual assault.’The horrible part is how most of the men don’t see their actions as anything other than “how guys are” and find her frustration to be playful instead of actual disgust. Yet it is damaging and takes a huge toll. As Beaton writes in the afterword about the sexual assault that occurs ‘I was nothing in his life but a short release from the boredom and loneliness endemic in camp life, but he was a major trauma in mine.’ I found it rather effective the way she shows that, even if it isn’t everyone who is harassing (she makes a point several times to talk about how there are plenty of men there who leave her alone) the sheer quantity of it happening is unnerving and how it is practically inevitable that her safety will be violated. Especially in the camps where she keeps her door locked and hears men try to open it in the middle of the night (another woman says one time a man hid in her closet and jumped out at her), and how being taken advantage of while drunk is viewed as being her own fault—even her own friend accuses her of trying to make regrettable sex seem like an assault instead of owning her own decisions. But it is important to remember that there is no such thing as consent in a situation where you cannot say “no”. This includes situations where you feel saying no is a threat to your personal safety. It is addressed multiple times how speaking out even on everyday harassment is almost impossible, from being ignored or told to just take a joke, and if someone is fired over a complaint the woman is viewed by everyone as the villain, a troublemaker just trying to get attention. She constantly hears men saying the women at the camp only work there to get sex in a place with less competition and women who are assaulted are always blamed for it. It’s very distressing.  [image]Much of Ducks focuses not only on how these men could be anyone but also on how the conditions of the camps enables it. Of those outside the situation her character says ‘they don't think that the loneliness and homesickness and boredom and lack of women around would affect their brother or dad or husband the same way.’ Which is just tragic and as much an indictment on the management as the men behaving this way. When one is not given a safe space to speak out, these acts become enabled through the culture of silence enforced around them.I used to work in a factory, and later doing a uniform and floor mat delivery at factories and a lot of the depictions of labor hit very close to home. I would go to a good 30some factories a week, some that I knew every time I left I’d have weird allergies or feel ill from physically (I think of Beaton saying there ‘just shit’ in the air and when she asks ‘Do I even want to know what kind of cancer will have in 20 years?’ I think of all the glues and sprays we used in the sign-making factory I once worked at with no ventilation), and the thing that bothered me the most was the odd comments people would make to me during my stops. I think a big part was wondering what made them think I was a person they could say that too, and if they’d say that to a stranger what sort of terrible comments do they make around people they feel comfortable with. And what am I going to do, complain? I’ll just be replaced on that stop on the route. All the homophobic comments when I worked in the factory sure hurt but what was I going to do, out myself as pansexual by complaining? How’s that going to go for me after that? I mean, I can’t possibly truly understand what Beaton went through but I did have a lot of difficult memories about working in physical labor jobs while reading this. It happens everywhere, and part of the problem is that this sort of behavior is almost coded into the image of “tough labor guy.” Though another aspect of this, which Beaton effectively demonstrates, is this is damaging to the men as well. The character Ryan, for example, is going through a difficult period of mental health and suicide ideation but doesn’t feel he can talk about it (it’ll just make him the butt of jokes if he does), and that gets into how toxic masculinity can become a sort of shame chamber where men feel they can’t express any emotion that isn’t anger.  [image]The ducks are shown to not only be the literal ducks that die due to environmental destruction from the company, but also to metaphorically be the workers as well, led to what they think is a safe place to land and find themselves exploited. Most of the workers have traveled far to be there where the money is, many from Nova Scotia like Beaton herself. For many, this is all they have, and where will they have to go once the work dries up?‘I need to tell you this--there is no knowing Cape Breton without knowing how deeply ingrained two diametrically opposed experiences are: A deep love for home, and the knowledge of how frequently we have to leave it to find work somewhere else.’But there is also the element of the fact that literal ducks die from landing in the water there and the company’s solutions to environmental protection are about the same as their safety policy: lip service and half-assed attempts and looking like you are trying without caring either way. There are endless meetings about safety nobody pays attention to and it is noted how celebrating X amount of hours since a “lost time accident” is a way to gloss over the many injuries that actually are taking place. But then there is the environment being polluted and the indigenous activists speaking out only to be a blip on the media and then never given a voice again.‘Everything's ruined, our lives around our lands are ruined, our water, the air, everything.Their almighty dollar comes first. That's pretty sad. You can't eat money.At the cost of our lives-as long as they get their money. They don't care how many of us they kill off.’The part that really broke my heart was when Beaton is able to get away for a while and chase her dream far from the horrible conditions, only to find she can’t afford to do so and has to be plunged back into the oil sands again. I think of doing 80hr weeks in the factory (we wouldn’t know if we worked Saturday and Sunday until Friday afternoon so making plans was not happening) and people saying yea but overtime is great. Sure the money was alright but I was 25, I’d rather see my child and have a life. It’s not like a job I hated was fulfilling. Though then I worked jobs I didn’t hate and found I couldn’t afford to live on it, spending a few years where I was working three jobs, delivering bulk coffee around the Midwest (trading up for the uniform company driver job), picking up bookstore shifts and then bartending weddings every Friday and Saturday night. Just as exhausting (but slightly better pay but hey only 70hr weeks!). I’m not saying I don’t want to work but you shouldn’t have to be rich to not devote your whole existence to making money for someone above you. Beaton shows that very effectively here. And, as one character mentions, it isn’t those making their millions that are doing the dangerous work and away from their families so much.This is a really heartfelt and heart wrenching look at life in that line of work but also a sharp condemnation of the misogyny that occurs there. This is a book I think everyone would benefit from reading and I am amazed at Kate Beaton for being so vulnerable and honest with this work. Ducks is one of the finest graphic memoirs I’ve ever read and while it is emotionally devastating, it is also very necessary.5/5  [image]...more",Notes are private!,7,173,1,"Aug 16, 2023","Aug 16, 2023","Aug 16, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59069071-ducks

Swaying between first and third person on a surreal riptide of self-reflection that addresses his dismay and distress over his career, his family and ultimately himself, Hilst sends us on an avant-garde journey full of sporadic and seamless transitions of spiraling ramblings and poems interjected into the text. It is a dark, metaphysical voyage of a ‘distorted and trembling’ mind and while only 60 pages in length it will leave you battered and bewildered yet likely in awe of her craft and the philosophical heart that comes alive in the maelstrom of imagery and ideas. While it is certainly dense and disorienting—Morris certainly deserved the Susan Sontag Prize for Literary Translation he was awarded for what must have been quite the undertaking with all the wordplay and hypnotic cadence to Hilst’s prose—it is also a joy to read and not impenetrable by any means. With My Dog-Eyes is a fascinating and feverish account of a mind losing its grip on itself that brilliantly demonstrates the possibilities of language and narrative by an author celebrated in her home country and deserving of a much further reaching admiration.‘Amós Kéres, mathematician, doomed to the gallows for attempting suicide, justified in his view for having understood that the universe is the work of Evil an man its disciple, and then almost executed for trying to prove the logic of his understanding’Hilst’s fixation on fraught mental health is on dazzling display in this short yet sprawling novella. As Adam Morris writes in the introduction, this book ‘directly addresses the nexus she believed existed between genius and madness, poetry and mathematics, ’ a subject she frequently explored given her own father had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, as well as a younger cousin she once took as a doomed lover, and her mother with dementia. The ideas presented in the book come in disarray, pushing each other to the side to abruptly take the stage—sometimes apropos of nothing and within the same sentence—and seem blown about like like leaves dancing in the tumult of ‘the wind of ideas uncovering the grotesque mess of our condition.’ These grotesqueries and her habit of exploring sexuality often led critics and readers to term her books as obscene. However, as Morris postulates:‘in Hilst's formulation, the obscene is differentiated from the erotic and the pornographic by its philosophical and spiritual elements, and also through its act of social provocation.’This is a philosophical work indeed, often owing a great deal to the minds Kéres himself quotes, most notably Bertrand Russell. It is certainly an avant-garde style and difficult to translate, though the celebrity of Hilst having been mostly confined to Brazil is also due to her refusal to publish outside of small presses providing meager copies. Still, she has been highly acclaimed. Hilst disliked being compared to Virginia Woolf or Clarice Lispector, as critics commonly did, and preferred to align her work with the authors she considered her major influences such as Henry Miller, D.H. Lawrence and Georges Bataille. ‘If I wrote in English,’ she claimed, ‘I’d be Joyce,’ and one can easily find similarities to the famous soliloquies in Ulysses in her own prose style here.‘God? A surface of ice anchored to laughter. That was God’Hilst is an author where her biographical details are just as engaging as her stories. A socialite known for her great beauty in her youth, she once stalked Marlon Brando across Paris to seduce him, even dating Dean Martin to get nearer to him. She collected young poets who came to her home, Casa do Sol, to be near her brilliance and serve her around the house (which she filled with numerous dogs, approaching 100 of them at any given time). Her status allowed her entry into the circles of mathematicians and philosophers she respected and learned from them. In her later years to drink heavily for the purpose of not remembering the night, though never starting before 7pm.‘A minuscule heart tryingTo escape insteadDilatingIn search of pure understanding’This is a discombobulating ride, full of references to other works and punctuated with Kéres’ own poems (such as the one above) that give further abstract insights into his mind. He is a mathematician and has viewed the world through strict principals towards discovering and decoding order, though as his thoughts become scattered (he is put on leave for often pausing 15 full minutes in the middle of a sentence during his lectures) and turn towards suicide the math that once upheld his mind now tortures it (such as question like the solution to I plus I, I being the self).‘I looked at numbers formulas equations theorems and it was a pleasure, a fiery freeze, a bodyguard for wandering alone without the speech-rupture of others, logicality and reason and nevertheless the possibility of a surprise as though we were unfolding a piece of silk, blue triangles on the fresh surface and suddenly just a dull little grid, lines that we can separate and recompose into triangles again, yes, this we could do, but where did the blue get to, where?’We follow as best we can through spiralling thoughts on his distaste for academia, his frustrations with being a father and husband, his fondness for a local brothel where he goes to work on equations, and through a sinister and surreal sequence imagining his own execution. It is all in a search for a sense of freedom from the oppressive weight of reality.‘I can hear him thinking of the various manners of madness and suicide. The madness of the Search, which is made of concentric circles and never arrives at the center, the obscuring, incarnate illusion of finding and understanding. Madness of the refusal, one of the saying everything's okay, we're here and that's enough, we refuse to understand. The madness of passion, the disordered appearance of light upon flesh, delicious-tasting chaos, idiocy feigning affinities. The madness of work and of possession. The madness of going so deep and later turning to look and seeing the world awash in vain slaughter, to be absolutely alone in the depths.’Hilst’s With My Dog-Eyes is quite the work, though it does lead somewhere and is certainly worth your while. Even if to admire the incredible use of imagery and language constructing this examination of a troubled mind. I am eager to read more of Hilst after this, and am thankful for Morris’ lengthy and insightful introduction. Brief yet feeling far greater than its page length (I finished it in a day but felt like I’d read it for far longer, in a good way) this is a heady and impressive work that pushes language to see what it is really made of. 3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,4,85,1,"Aug 15, 2023","Aug 15, 2023","Aug 15, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18209522-with-my-dog-eyes

Writing this now in Las Vegas, I’ve been reading these poems again in honor of the Vegas trip upon which they went astray. So far I have not, but we’ll see what happens after this margarita I just ordered. Something about bringing this for the weekend makes me think Roberto Bolaño would enjoy this anecdote. Bolaño has long been a favorite of mine and over the years I’ve returned again and again to this volume, the massive nearly-900pgs of The Unknown University, to sit with his mind and view Bolaño as he believed was most himself: his poetry. Though better known now for his novels he wrote near the end of his life, he considered himself first and foremost a poet and hoped that through his novels readers would come to his poems. My Gift to YouMy gift to you will be an abyss, she said,but it will be so subtle you'll perceive itonly after many years have passedand you are far from Mexico and me.You'll find it when you need it most,and that won't bethe happy ending,but it will be an instant of emptiness and joy.And maybe then you'll remember me,if only just a little This is a book I don’t think one can ever truly “finish,” as with the best of poetry each return visit resonates differently. A bilingual edition, translated by Laura Healy, this book collects writings from across Bolaño’s entire life and reads much like a diary of ideas tracing a course through his travels until he tragically passed at the age of 50. I’ve always had such a fondness for Bolaño and love the romantic image of him writing poetry late into the night during his time working as a night watchman at a park. I too have worked for parks and spent time scribbling bad poetry on the job, working grounds maintenance driving mowers and a garbage truck, so the garbage trucks and drivers that often appear in his works rather fondly mean a lot to me as well. But what I love best is the way he makes literature seem like the most vital part of life. IT'S BETTER TO LEARN HOW TO READ THAN TO LEARN HOW TO DIELiteracy isMuch betterAnd more importantThan the arduous studyOf DeathIt will be with you all your lifeAnd will even dole outHappinessAnd a certain misfortune or twoLearning to dieOn the other handLearning to lookThe Grim Reaper in the faceWill only serve you a short whileThe brief momentOf truth and disgustAnd then never againEpilogue and Moral: Dying is more important than reading, but it doesn't last as long. You could argue that living is dying every day. Or that reading is learning to die, obliquely. In conclusion, and as with so many things, the example continues to be Stevenson. Reading is learning to die, but also learning to be happy, to be brave.’Also I love his wordless poem, Scion so much that it is forever on my skin:  [image]Through these poems we see a beautiful portrait of the late writer take shape, with many self-portrait poems that scatter his timeline. He writes of ‘all of us, / brushing cheeks with death,’ in his signature style that always feels like a nightmare slowly uncurling in a surreal fog around us, always teetering on the precipice of disaster or, as he writes, his frame of life is always ‘Like in a horror film. / Know what I mean? / The ones we called psychological thrillers.’ He wrote that he used his words to examine ‘our models of fear.’‘The poet doesn't wish to be greater / than others…Not wealth or fame... Simply waiting for someone or something in the ruins.’We also see so much of his rebelliousness, which is rooted in the political but trandsends this over the course of his life. While he had to leave the Chile of his youth behind and frequently speaks against the Pinochet regime, he believed himself not an exile as he often said that poetry itself was his country of origin. As he writes in Romantic Dogs: ‘had lost a country but had won a dream. And if he had that dream, the rest did not matter.’ Still, he shows an affinity for the poets of his country and, despite his youthful rebellion against Octavio Paz, we see the love for and influence of Nicanor Parra in his works. ‘Get walking, then, Latin AmericansGet walking get walkingStart searching for the missing footstepsOf the lost poetsIn the motionless mudLet’s lose ourselves in nothingnessThere where the only things heard areParra’s footstepsAnd the dreams of generationSacrificed beneath the wheelUnchronicled.’This volume is like an infinite university as much as it is the Unknown University and I have such a fondness for it. An absolute favorite writer, I love having all his poems in one place as well as the inclusion of a slightly different manuscript of Antwerp, included here under the title People Walking Away and is, according to Bolaño, ‘the only novel that doesn’t embarrass me.’ I return to this book again and again, and this latest revisit has been rather lovely. Certainly a beautiful book.‘In a thousand years nothing will be leftof all that’s been written this century.They’ll read loose sentences, tracesof lost women,fragments of motionless children,your slow green eyessimply will not exist.It will be like the Greek Anthology,but even further away,like a beach in winterfor another wonder, another indifference.’...more",Notes are private!,0,143,1,not set,not set,"Aug 13, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16241798-the-unknown-university

I have to say this is an author who makes me want to read romance, she has such a sharp and smart approach to it that captures your mind as much as your heart and just allows you to really, truly think about the emotional mechanics of blossoming relationships. You might know Alexene Farol Follmuth best by her pen name Olivie Blake, and after reading and loving her novel Alone With You in the Ether I knew I had to give her another read. My Mechanical Romance, published without the pen name, is an absolutely lovely YA that is a romance built within an engaging examination of the gender politics around women in STEM fields. Bel has been plunged into a new school for her senior year and persuaded to join the school’s robotics team where she meets team captain Teo who is as bright as he is beautiful and overbearing. Beset by rocky team dynamics, biases and frequent disputes, Bel is determined to prove she belongs and Farol Follmuth delivers a swoon-worthy good time that feels honest and insightful as well as heartwarmingly romantic. Picture me with cartoon hearts for eyes and that's basically how I was reading this whole thing.‘I promise I'll still like you, even if I ever have a problem you can't fix.’Farol Follmuth is exceptional at characters and I enjoy how in both of her books I’ve read the romance is really a vehicle for in-depth character studies of rather intellectual leads that pauses to reflect on issues of interpersonal frustrations, mental health and personality. Her stories are smart and make character flaws learning opportunities—I really enjoy how these characters develop through recognizing how their actions affect others and how trying to be better versions of themselves requires a lot of self-reflection as to why you are the way you are—that not only feel real but are good reminders to the reader about themselves. But this book also really addresses how our perceptions of others are often biased based on initial reactions to them and as we learn more about these characters our own perception of them changes. Teo comes across as rather arrogant at first and his whole quest to get himself into MIT can feel rather smug, but as the story progresses we discover a sweetness in him and as we learn more about him he becomes a rather endearing character. Same with many of the side characters, although they are a lot less developed and can occasionally feel a little flat. Though a big theme is about working together, recognizing that people can have a variety of strengths, that we can’t always solve every problem the way we solve math, and that being caring is much more productive than being cruel.‘The world is not very helpful to a smart girl. More often it will try to force you inside a box. But I urge you not to listen.’A big aspect of this book centers on how Bel is overlooked on the team and issues of misogyny lurk under a lot of the interactions. Even Neelam, the only other girl on the team, is instantly hostile to Bel in a way that seems to indicate underlying issues of internalized misogyny that pit women against each other by seeing the other as a threat. Not that Bel is exactly effective at being a team player, a lesson that everyone has to learn (especially as they all rely too heavinly on Teo). There is a big, bold message that women have a place in STEM and its done in a really lovely and empowering way.But what just really works for me is how much I love Farol Follmuth’s writing. While Alone With You in the Ether felt effectively geared towards a more adult audience, her writing here fits perfectly for a YA audience without feeling pandering and still being equally engaging to adults. She has such a good grasp on voice, you can practically hear these characters on the page and her dual perspective from Bel to Teo is nicely nuanced. Plus she is so funny. I love Bel’s quirkiness and snark and she can roll out some comical (and often self-depricating) humor that doesn’t feel forced and the pop culture references feel earned and honest (I kind of loved the teacher holding up a sign with a Beyonce reference as it feels sort of dated in a way that shows the age gap between the characters). The banter is great and while I found Emily Henry to have great one-liners it never felt like how people actually talk whereas the conversations here seem like you could actually be hearing them in a high school hallway. Plus the character dynamics really work and I feel a lot of this owes to her attention to getting down the character’s psychological moods quite well.‘I’m at my best when I’m with you.’Overall, My Mechanical Romance is a winner and I am fully on board with Alexene Farol Follmuth (aka Olive Blake) and will read anything she writes. She is just a delight and this book is so adorable while still being a rather smart and empowering look at feminist issues and the current conversations around STEM fields.

It’s the exceptionalism of you,’ and this theme seems to permeate her debut short story collection, Emergency. Across these seven brilliantly layered stories are the lives of women in reaction to their past, often having given into the belief of exceptionalism and found that the older men they married to enter a world of wealth and comfort offered no respite from the patriarchal ills they would eventually find stifling and from which they would flee. Alcott has such an intelligent and fluid prose that would make you assume it were already a celebrated classic were the stories not set in the modern world, and her writing can deftly sneak into the most vulnerable spaces in her characters as well as the reader as she makes us confront the questions of ‘who I was or how I suffered.’ Alcott’s Emergency examines the struggles to escape our former selves and atone for our pasts while also offering an intricate critique on class climbing, marriage and, ultimately, the fraught realities of women in a society where guilt and shame is doled out simply for having feelings. ‘Few of us what to believe that our pain is so common it can be treated.’A recently diovrced woman is rumored to have passed as a teenager to hang with the boys, another finds nude photos of her mother in an art exhibit, there are musings on delinquent pasts, the loss of a friend, and plenty of guilt or recontextualizing relationships due to stories of violence or even the COVID pandemic. This is a crisp collection, and while it is a succinct seven stories each has such a vastness of insight and feeling that the collection as a whole feels so much sturdier and bulkier than most. I cannot heap enough praise on Alcott’s prose and all the subtle nuances and layers of insight she gracefully unearths with it like a shovel that can strike a murky, rocky soil and extract only gold every time. Each sentence grasps psychological investigations that pull us through these tales—frequently bumping through emotional landscapes of detachment and muted sadness—where by the end we feel we’ve experienced a whole life within the single slice of life. As she writes in Natural Light,where finding a nude photo of the character’s mother leads to a new angle on her mother’s life as well as uneasily assessing her own failed marriage, ‘your real self was mostly revealed in negotiation with the unforseen element,’ and across each of these stories we see how a new twist in life shakes the character’s whole timeline into the light for examination. Emergency is bookended by two absolute knock-out stories, with the title story offering a collective narration on the rumors of an artist’s behavoir following her divorce, and Temporary Housing that offers a series of gut punches as a woman, having escaped an impoverished past riddled with drugs and drinking, reflects on the intensely intimate—always bordering on, but never quiet reaching erotic—friendship with a girl. Each story unlocks a dynamic portrait of their lives in context with a narrative action that is relatively brief: the first being the woman allowing teenage boys to assume she is a fellow teenager and party with them and the latter around a fight leaving the narrator with a chipped tooth after a prank potentially ruins a neighbor’s marriage. But in both, and most of these stories, we see the girl these women once were in light of the ways they have found to survive. ‘‘Maybe we aren’t girls, surely we were never children, but we might have the talents of animals, sensing everything that wants to kill us and that we need to kill. Hills aren’t a problem, gates we can perch on, dark we can see in, and now we’re quiet by the glow of that couple’s back window.’In Adrienne Rich’s aformentioned speech, she warns that a privileged education can tokenize a woman and contort her to the perspectives of the oppressors, shucking off the needs of women as a whole to hide in privileged lifestyles and used as an example that perpetuates patriarchy. It isn’t denying an oppressive system but believing oneself an exception to it, or as Alcott says in her interview ‘the great lie of the exceptional woman who travels in male circles.’ We see this directly in the opening story where she writes: ‘Helen still believed in a notion we had all worked to disavow, as all adults must: that to any rule, she might prove the brillant exception.’For believing in these myths, these characters often have to pay it down like a debt the rest of their lives. When the women in many of these stories choose a partner, they find the financial gain to be a comfort but realize they have become a token of themselves, often berated for their feelings (or having them utterly dismissed), groomed to mature into the sort of women the older men want instead of who they are, and expected to be an accessory instead of a person. Instead of understanding themselves in context with actions, they are seeing themselves contextualized to fit the desires of others, such as the observation about Helen in the first story:‘Her age, she might have realized then, had never belonged to her: she’d been younger or older, the thing by which somebody else felt a sense of himself.’ (emphasis mine)I really appreciated the collective narration in this story, told as a ‘we’ such as ‘we had stopped inquiring’ or ‘we can all agree it’s clear, that she basically believed those years were null and void, that age had not accrued.’ In a way it feels like society rationalizing and prescribing the reasoning, outside of Helen’s own inner rationality, the ways a person becomes an object for social media to write threads explaining the context what someone else’s choices ‘clearly’ mean as if they are the authority over someone else’s impulses. Helen is an artist with a massive instagram following, are these her fans, her friends, and could Helen even know the distinction? Social media plays heavily into the story Reputation Management where the narrators guilt at having erased the accusations of sexual violence of a man from the internet (her job is what the title implies) is suddenly confronted with her being the target of the day on social media after a public outburst. This extends the theme to show how everyone can suddenly become a object for society to dissect, though her being labeled ‘hot bigot’ in posts reminds us of the extra layer of sexualization that befalls women even when being insulted.‘Sometimes you made a mistake and it feels like a blessing: lucky and funny: clear and perfect: so much purer than anything you could contrive.’I love Alcott’s attention to language in this collection. She has an exceptional skill with syntax and there are some great passages on how our stock phrases are an insight into defining a person. But we also see how a person is more than just one aspect despite how society tends to shortcut a singular angle to define the whole of a person. In A World Without Men, for instance, we witness a lengthy marriage become reassessed during the COVID pandemic when they are staying at home together all the time. The wife finds her compass for understanding herself is lost without having others to bounce situations off of and observes that ‘rather than making her feel connected to all life, it told her that the small details of hers didn’t matter.’ All these disparate pieces of a person seem to unravel without social interaction and we see how society is oppressive but also how it can be vital to understand ourselves in the context of others. I appreciate that Alcott can make us empathize with difficult characters as well and reminds us that flaws and frustrations offer a texture to which we can better cling to the character studies and narrative. ‘He scrounged up some stained little words that we’ve all, in selfishness, used. There is only so much you can do.’A round of applause for Alcott and Emergency is certainly in order. There is a quiet tenderness to the way she approaches her characters while still opening up their biographies to probe the most vulnerable moments of their inner-selves and a rather incisive social critique going on all the while. The tight selection of stories (some stronger than others) is also refreshing and garners a heightened focus on the prevailing themes that bind these stories together as much as the physical binding itself. Alcott is a maestro with words and these stories move in surprising ways all culminating for a brilliantly executed collection that manages to be both soft and cutting at the same time.4.5/5...more",Notes are private!,2,140,1,not set,not set,"Aug 08, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62586010-emergency

Such is the Life comes at you fast and from every direction, so it is easy to get so caught up in the kinetic energy that we lose sight of ourselves. Such is the case of the busy man in The Lost Soul, an absolutely gorgeous picture book for adults by Nobel winning Polish author Olga Tokarczuk (translated by Antonia Lloyd-Jones) and brought to life in astonishing artwork from Joanna Concejo. Look at this delightful book:  [image]The art is so lovely. Several pages are printed on translucent sheets that make you feel you are stepping through the scenery, which is a cool choice. This is really a wonderful art piece on its own.   [image]‘if someone could look down on us from above, they'd see that the world is full of people running about in a hurry, sweating and very tired, and their lost souls, always left behind, unable to keep up with their owners.’This is a charming story about waiting for your soul or inner child to catch back up with you, lost somewhere down the line in all the hustle and bustle of life. The art conveys the loneliness felt even when surrounded by some many others, and the lack of color through much of the work gives a somber atmosphere perfectly matching the sparseness of Tokarczuk’s words that accompany the story. I like how the art is drawn on what looks like graphing paper, perfectly fitting his description of life:‘But sometimes he felt as if the world around him were flat, as if he were moving across a smooth page in a math exercise book, entirely covered in evenly spaced squares.’It is that feeling of being more a number on a chart and less a person, of being something that is part of the world but lacking the soul to step off the page. Which is why the man decides to go sit in a cottage and wait for his soul to return to him.  [image]I love how this book reminds us to slow down and enjoy the beauty in the quotidian, to let our souls catch up to us and just take in the wonders of life. As the story progresses and his soul returns—represented by a young girl—we see color begin to enter the art. His plants begin to grow bright green and cover his world and we feel refreshed and alive with him. It is such a charming story with incredible art. Also a big shoutout to Alan’s  for making me aware of this. I love Olga Tokarczuk’s work and this is a wonderful little collector’s piece as well as a fun book. I like how the concept of being a picture book returns us to our inner child much in the way the story calls for us to do. Adorable and moving, this is a book to warm your heart.

This is where it starts.Already her life felt like a miracle.”Tempering is a process of applying heat to steel to remove excess hardness and in turn make it more flexible and able to withstand greater pressure without breaking. This feels very metaphorical for bildungsromans, such as Meg Rosoff’s Friends Like These where being forged in heat is literally the sweltering city summer and the pressures of fraught friendships. Young and naive, Beth moves to New York City in 1983 to take an internship at a newspaper—if this is a coming-of-age NYC story you should probably cue this song for maximum experience, you are welcome fellow Swifties—and is quickly tumbling in the chaos of harsh city living from caustic roommates in a rundown apartment to a nightlife that ‘sounds like an insurrection’ where the pleasures are equally measured out with peril. Enter Edie with her personality like a gravitational force that pulls Beth in for an immediate close friendship that will change the orbit of her formative years forever. There’s a blurb that implies this is like a YA intro to Elena Ferrante and while that seems a loose connection it’s also not wrong. A slow-burn YA narrative that still reads at a blistering pace, this is a gritty and intense look at growing up in a hurry with the pressures of sex, drugs and a toxic friendship pulling Beth into adulthood as the AIDs epidemic is a growing menance advancing on the horizon.‘She liked being part of something dirty and dangerous.’To be honest, I didn’t realize this way a YA novel when I snagged it and I’m glad I did because this was quite the gripping, gritty read. Very cinematic in its execution, the novel meanders through drinks and debauchery while piecing together a portrait of a single summer that will change Beth from the optimistically naive teenager to a world-weary woman who can handle life without needing a friend to guide her. I’ve had friendships like this, and I think your late teens and early 20s often provide the right catalyst of intensely felt burgeoning emotions that open the door for sudden and very close friendships that often burn out as quickly as they begin. It seems only natural that Beth would quickly become an accessory for Edie, an Upper West Side native with streetsmart and keys to all the pleasures New York has to offer a young woman willing to be plunged into a wild ride of life. Yet we quickly see how toxic Edie can be, perhaps quicker than Beth though even once she begins to recognize it, she is so caught in her orbit it is hard to break free. Because that’s how people like Edie operate and while the side characters here are rather flat, Edie is a dynamic character that feels very true to life. She separates Beth from everyone else, pulling her under her complete control of what Beth should do or who she should see. She makes Beth put in a lot of emotional labor to the friendship and while she love-bombs her at times, her actions show quite a callus indifference at other times. It is classic manipulation and Beth has to learn the hard way while simultaneously caterwauling through drunken nights, drugs, and potentially ill-advised sexual encounters. ‘Be nice to everyone,’ Edie advises, ‘you never know who might come in handy,’ and Rosoff very effectively depicts the ways people can transform themselves into whoever they need to be in a given situation in order to manipulate others. Not that Edie is doing great herself and her mental health struggles often engulf Beth in their maelstrom.Dangerous relationships don’t just stop at friendships here, however. ‘Beth was the understudy in Dawn and Tom’s disaster of a relationship,’ we are told, though we see her sneak into a starring role, and meanwhile Edie is having an affair with a married man who’s wife is pregnant (Edie stops taking her birth control without telling him), and suddenly innocent Beth is caught in emotional tangles of rather volatile relationships. Its a very classic dangerous coming-of-age narrative, with all these young people being pulled around by their hormones and impulses living high-intensity lives by day being thrust into night lives full of alcohol, drugs, and sex. Nobody is getting out alive without some scars.I found the Edie and Beth dynamic to be quite engaging on issues of class as well, while also exploring aspects of Jewish identity which they both share. Beth is naive but very perspective, which helps her survive, but is from a lower-income upbringing raised by two holocaust survivors and she bears that history. Edie, however, comes from money but has a neurotic, overbearing mother and a high-profile NYC therapist (it seems to sort of play on two very different stereotypes of Jewish people). There is a scene early on where Beth notices a hot dog vendor has the tattoo of his time in a concentration camp and is appalled to consider how someone could survive such a horrific genocide and wind up in poverty selling hot dogs, while meanwhile the city is run by those who never faced anything close to that and hide behind the comforts of their money.'Arriving in New York for the first time was like wearing a sign that said CHEAT ME.'This is represented too in the city where Beth quickly notices the grimness of the low-income districts. The novel does give a rather unkind, stereotypical look at big city poverty areas full of needles, prostitutes, sex offenders and muggers, but we also see how this is an image reinforced by the wealthy to keep these people down and out of “polite society.” Law enforcement is quick to police these people but couldn’t care less when it comes to helping (Beth goes to the police when Edie goes missing and they don’t give a flat fuck). If you shift the public image from thinking of these people as economically oppressed to being a nest of criminals, nobody will have to feel guilt for letting them rot in poverty and poor living conditions while enjoying their excess privileges. This plays into the AIDs crisis which is always lurking in the background, slowly circling closer to engulf people in Beth’s life as the novel progresses. By looking at it as only affecting “degenerates,” nobody talked about it and brushed it off until it was a huge epidemic. The silence around it turned deadly. Though perhaps Rosoff’s depiction of NYC leans a bit towards stereotyping it as criminal in a way it doesn’t just establish a very gritty atmosphere but it nudges us towards thinking about why this is and the thematic relationship to the health crisis.“And what have I learned? she asked herself.That no one friend could give you everything.That complex friends came with complex agendas.That liars tell the best stories.”I quite enjoy Friends Like These and found this to be an intense, fast read that threw some great punches. Her writing is sharp and you can really feel the summer heat emitting from these pages. She writes summer so effectively that, though I also read this in a single sitting on a hot summer day, I would have wanted a cool drink to accompany my read even if I had read it during a winter blizzard. A crisp and engaging coming-of-age story with a rather depressed and tragic lesson being learned—Beth certainly leaves the story without the starry-eyed optimism with which she enters it—this was a really effective character study and gripping tale. In a way, it feels like Sally Rooney for a teen audience and while I suspect this won’t be all that especially engaging with the target audience I did find it well constructed. And while this is aimed at a YA audience but equally effective for adult readers, Friends Like These is a great summer coming-of-age read.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,2,161,1,not set,not set,"Aug 04, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/71469231-friends-like-these

There are few griefs m‘One believes the stupidest things in grief,’ Gerardo Sámano Córdova writes in his debut novel, the literary horror Monstrilio. There are few griefs more shattering than the death of a child and one might do the strangest things in grief to try and recover that loss, often with more sadness to follow. Take Maud Gonne for instance, the Irish revolutionary and long time love interest of poet W.B. Yeats, who reunited with the father of her deceased son and had sex on his coffin thinking it would bring him back (and the sadness that the conceived child, Iseult, was never considered her daughter after and left out of Maud’s will). Or look how this sort of grief arrives in fiction, such as Pet Sematary by King or even the reincarnation of dead body parts in Frankenstein. Not unlike the latter, Monstrilio involves life being created from dead organs—a lung in this case—and the subsequent struggles of parenting this creation. Luckily for Monstrilio, or M as he is later called, he is loved despite his ravenous appetite for flesh (working his way up from cats to whole humans over the course of the novel), and over the four perspectives in the novel Córdova explores ideas of family, both found family and blood lineage. A slow burn of a novel offering an excellent blend of horror, folktale and examinations of queer identities, Monstrilio confronts ideas of grief, family, sexuality and, ultimately, that we cannot hide our true selves.‘This thing—an actual fucking monster—was loved.’For a horror novel, the tone in Monstrilio tends towards tender affection as the story spirals away from a shocking opening scene when Magos cuts open her dead son and removes his only lung. Born with only one lung, Santiago was not expected to live but made it 11 years before his death. Returning home to Mexico City, she hears an urban legend of a woman feeding the heart of a dead girl until it grew up into a beautiful man and undertakes a similar experiment. Amidst the grief of the deceased, Monstrilio is born and, despite some initial shock and fear, those around him decide to love him no matter what. Like a shockwave from the blast occurring in a particularly tragic scene of grief, the story is pulled from Mago’s perspective into 3 subsequent perspectives over the years: Lena, the best friend; Joseph, the ex-husband and father; and finally Monstrilio himself. It is a stylistic choice that (mostly) works and allows us to see how these events radiate outward across many lives. ‘They are happy to believe I forget how they maimed me.’Grief is shown as arriving in many forms. For Mago, there is magical thinking (which turns out to actually work) and action, whereas for Joseph he seems to struggle with his own inability to grieve how he, or Mago, feels he should. Which brings tension between them.‘I wanted him to snap, to finally and absolutely lose it. To break. He was withering. To wither is not the same as to break; to break is to have pieces to put back together, and to wither is to dry up, to wilt, to lose bone, to die, and death is the most boring.’But we also see how it affects those around us, such as Lena who allows her judgement to be clouded by the wills of others and performs a surgery that will alter Monstrilio forever. M’s perspective being saved for last is not just because it is the best section of the novel and wraps up all the disparate elements into a tight punch of a finale, but because M’s feeling and needs are constantly being pushed aside to fit the ideas of what the other character’s think they need (this is most evident in the surgery aspect). This makes for an excellent look at the way the push and pull of families affects everyone, especially the younger ones caught up in it, and is made more ominous and chilling through the lens of horror.‘Hunger can be magnificent.’Which also nudges the theme of the body that is always present in the text. On one hand we have the fact that M is quite literally a monster created out of a dead child’s lung, yet despite his form he is no less a part of the family or loved like a child. But in later portions of the novel he transforms into a human form which helps him disguise who he is inside. And what he hungers for cannot be hidden. Hunger is a quite a dynamic symbol here, being both his literal hunger but also as an investigation into sexuality. The majority of the primary characters are queer, with Joseph marrying Paul after his divorce from Mago which is perhaps a hidden “hunger” that he was finally able to reveal, but it does all sort of touch on the idea that queer sexuality is often othered or seen as unnatural despite being very normal and natural, especially to the person having those emotions. Which parallels M’s feelings about hunger, and in the latter half of the novel we see how hiding oneself for the benefit of “polite society” and whatnot doesn’t mean you don’t still feel this way. Trying to pass myself off as totally straight was awful and I could take the teasing for like things that were socially-coded as for women (I will not apologize for my vast love of Beyonce or the color pink) but to feel like I couldn’t just be like no I’m pansexual and nonbinary and that doesn’t change the me you know but I’d like to not have to feel I have to keep that hidden. Sure, being a horror novel where this is quite literally a flesh-eating monster muddies the waters here but you get the point. The parallel of M eating flesh and Mago being a performance artist that eats the written word is quite charming as well, if a bit on the nose.I do love how this fits in with a lot of the more literary horror of BIPOC and queer voices such as Stephen Graham Jones, Carmen Maria Machado or Alison Rumfitt (to name just a few) that are using the genre in subversive ways to really discuss themes of identity and expanding the genre to the folklore of other cultures. I think there is a lot going on in this book that is really great, however at times it felt in some ways far longer than it needed to be (this would absolutely destroy me if it was a crisp novella) but then the individual sections almost felt undercooked. At times it seemed like two books being blended into one and the cracks show on occasion. And while I like a direct prose, there were times this felt like pulling the story forward along a screenplay where it’s assumed the emotion will be infused later by the actors instead of actually injecting emotion into the scenes. Not that this was devoid of emotion—there is a particularly amazing scene at the beginning of crushing grief juxtaposed with a rather slapstick-seeming struggle beforehand that made me think YES, Gerardo Sámano Córdova can really bring it!—but the novel is perhaps too up close to the details and loses its own context, like a photo of a face so close up that the overall impression of the face gets lost. That said, I’m over-emphasizing here to try and pin down what sort of felt like an itch distracting me the whole time and for a debut this is still quite good. But I know he can tighten it up and I will definitely be back for his next book.Monstrilio is an impressive literary horror that takes us around the world and deep into family dynamics. Gerardo Sámano Córdova certainly has something special here and I love the infusion of Mexican folkhorror with this rather tender examination of family and grief. Admittedly the individual sections are a mixed bag, but it all pulls together at the end for a rather memorable, shocking and moving experience.4/5...more",Notes are private!,16,240,1,not set,not set,"Aug 03, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62888191-monstrilio

But then there are times when it feels like your own self is trying to sabotage you no matter what you do, even sabotaging your drive to do something about it. Everything Is OK is an honest and soothing graphic novel by Debbie Tung that tackles the latter issue and serves as a memoir opening up about her own depression. As someone that has also struggled with depression off and on throughout life, I found this very relatable and I think that Tung is really wonderful for being able to be so upfront with her own life as a way to reach others and help them through hard times and remember that they are not alone. Because you aren’t alone and even when it seems impossible to go forward or that nobody cares, there are people who do care and you can get through it (also know there are many resources to help and people to provide aid and support), and sometimes half the struggle is just recognizing you need help. Which there is no shame in doing, as Everything Is OK does a great job of demonstrating. This is a playful yet very raw and emotional read and Tung’s adorable artwork helps guide you through the memoir that is perhaps a bit basic with broadstroke advice but nonetheless moving and heartwarming.   [image]RelatableI feel like it doesn’t get talked about enough that depression can come in many different forms and can present as individually as we are all unique individuals. Someone smiling and cracking jokes can still be trying to desperately keep their head above water internally, for instance I find I’m usually at my most humorous and quickest with a good one-liner during my darkest times. Which is also something that gets ignored often—depression can manifest in bouts mania or intense activity and creativity. I find I try to push thoughts aside by taking on too much to try to feel better about myself and often make jokes like wow I’m burning through novels super quick I should probably check on my mental health. It’s funny to others because, yep, I read a lot of pretty dark novels and actually because I enjoy them, but in reality it’s not the content its the sudden sleepless drive that I need to watch for. Not that you can really control when depression might strike and it’s often like a Stephen King jump scare showing up on a sunny day in a crowded place. Which is also an aspect I find really tragic about depression is how you can be surrounded by people yet still be feeling really alone. And second guessing every encounter or assuming the worst. For many, getting out of bed can be hard or their inner thoughts are so loud they never feel rested and are anxious about everything to come. And sometimes even though you know you are just down and should get up, get out, maybe go for a run or do something to get out of the rut, you just simply cannot. Or even your favorite things suddenly give you no joy. Debbie Tung captures these feelings quite effectively here.Whew, long interlude but lets talk about this book some more. I quite enjoyed Book Love by her and she has a knack at capturing what makes her, her so I was interested to see how she would handle another very relatable topic. Lately I often wonder ‘is anyone doing okay right now?!’ and I suspect a lot of people will get something out of this book, even if its just a better perspective on depression. It goes through her personal experiences, from panic attacks to worrying her therapist won’t like her and more, all while being supported by a very patient and loving partner so I’m so glad she had that. It really made me feel for her and she really allows herself to be vulnerable here. There are a lot of great messages about recognizing the problem, seeking help, and keeping with it too.  [image]Some aspects really hit home. She talks about how there is still such a stigma around mental health, showing how when you have a cold people are quick to be supportive and tell you to feel better. But mental health people often judge you, think you are trying to get attention or make excuses for behavior. We’ve certainly made progress on this front but always can do better and we need to allow people the space to process and be themselves and make room to allow ourselves to feel emotion instead of keeping it bottled up. As a child I was told boys don’t cry and I’m glad I didn’t listen because I fucking love a good cry when needed--hell I just sobbed my eyes out at the Barbie movie. No shame. Cry at movies, its the coolest. But I also really related to the therapist scenes. I’m so bad at therapists, I always just want to tell them ‘you helped me!’ so they feel good about themselves and feel like they are good at their jobs I guess? But also being vulnerable is hard. Lets all make space to let people be more vulnerable.Everything is OK is a sweet little graphic memoir. It gets rather same-y and might be overly long, as well as not really being all that unique despite being her individual story, but all the same it is a lovely read. I would encourage anyone to check it out, especially if any of this sounds relatable. And also take care of your mental health, friends, and check in on each other.3.5/5  [image]You don’t need permission from anyone to be yourself...more",Notes are private!,0,114,1,not set,not set,"Aug 02, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60320130-everything-is-ok

A short but powerful little book, I found this to be as illuminating as it was intoxicating to read, enhanced by reading it alongside Cain’s novella Indelicacy which was written around the same time. The interplay of both books was an exciting experience seeing both theory and practice of the ideas expressed here, particularly the ways she examines the question ‘How can a detail be urgent and at the same time concealed?’ or her statement that ‘For me, fiction is a space of plainness and excess.’ Brimming with insights and adding multiple books to my to-read list, A Horse at Night is a sublime investigation into the visual qualities and details of language and simply a beautiful book on writing. ‘A novel can and should hold different registers of feeling and experience at once, and from that something new can emerge.’Dorothy Project never lets me down and this was another big hit for me. When I first opened this book, inspired by zeynep’s amazing , my eyes were drawn to this passage: ‘Again and again in novel after novel, plot gets in the way of detail. It destroys the dream.’ As someone who prefers small, quiet novels that really allow the details to shine brightest and amalgamate into something greater than the sum of their parts, I knew this was an authorial mind I needed to investigate and launched into a serene few days reading this as well as Indelicacy (read my  here). Along with Cain’s own insights on her writing, she imbues her examinations with those of other writers as well as critical analysis of their works. Elena Ferrante’s The Lost Daughter or The Ravishing of Lol Stein by Marguerite Duras are examined most at length, but I enjoyed seeing her takes on authors like Annie Ernaux—who she writes ‘does obsession and jealous very well’ and her ‘sentences are a series of hits or punches’, something I strongly agree with. I really appreciated seeing lesser known works I was excited to discover we both have read and enjoyed like the atmospheric The Weak Spot by Lucie Elven or the works of Azareen Van der Vliet Oloomi. Basically, this book will make you excited about reading and make you want to read everything she mentions (I’ve already read Self-Portrait in Green based on this book). ‘Perhaps solitude is a practice as much as an instinct, its pleasures very much contextual. Sometimes being alone is terrible.’Cain’s discussions on solitude really soothed my weary soul, and are key to the narrative in Indelicacy. As someone who has two jobs that involve being interrupted constantly and a busy life outside work where there are always multiple parties vying for my attention, sometimes it is easy to lose sight of yourself in it all. Which is something Cain really speaks on, though she also discusses how we need others in our lives and to be around other ideas, minds, and that connection is a big part of what makes life worth living. I think she says it best here: ‘To be in favor of solitude is not to be against community or friendship or love. It’s not that being alone is better, just that without the experience of it we block ourselves from discovering something enormously beneficial, perhaps even vital, to selfhood. Who are you when you are not a friend, a partner, a lover, a sibling, a parent, a child? When no one is with you, what do you do, and do you do it differently than if someone was there? It’s hard to see someone fully when another person is always attached to them. More importantly, it’s hard for us to see our own selves if we’re not ever alone.’On the flip side, she also writes: ‘Too much time alone is just as risky as not enough, for it allows us to sink into our cyclical patterns of thought and narrative. We need someone to hold up a mirror so we can see who we are when we are taken outside of our heads. We need to hear others’ thoughts too.’Speaking of the novel Indelicacy, I found her ideas on the way she embeds visual images into the sparseness of her sentences to be very interesting to consider when reading her novel. She has excellent passages on how reading is very much a visual experience, which is why open spaces like reading facing a field or a beach is so rewarding because we can project our ideas out onto them. She also discusses authors like Renee Gladman who she says ‘enters the space of [language], taking the reader with her,’ and there are some excellent insights into writers who pull us through ‘to the other side’ where both the work and we, the reader, are transformed by it. Ekphrasis is another element Cain really enjoys, which appears in her novels as well, and I quite liked her section on A.S. Byatt discussing Honoré de Balzac’s use of ekphrasis that ‘he makes the whole thing ghostly by making it live,’ which Cain continues with her look at ‘letting the portrait walk.’ Cain looks at writing very much like putting paint onto a canvas and her execution of these ideas was quite lovely to see.For Cain, details are the most interesting. ‘I’ve mostly been paying attention to things we could say are “acessories” to [novels], not to what we would say is crucial,’ she says, but demonstrates how ‘an impression can be just as important as meaning.’ How true. When we think of a novel we love, often it is a small scene or tiny detail that really wedges into our hearts and minds and its these tiny impressions we turn back to again and again. Its like when you are drunk and trying to explain why you like something and some seemingly minute and absurd detail suddenly takes on a universe of meaning in your heart. Cain understands this and expresses it so eloquently that her words here have become one of those tiny details that will stick with me.Cain tells us that she is ‘attached to fiction,’ and as someone else who would admit that about myself, I found this to be such a rewarding little read. I love her thoughts on writing, and animals (which comes up a lot, tying back into a discussion on Sigrid Nunez’s The Friend), and this definitely made me think about why I appreciate quiet, interior novels. Keep a pen close at hand when reading too, I was constantly underlining amazing sentences. Amina Cain can WRITE. This is certainly a book I will be thinking about for a long time because, as Cain writes, ‘when one closes a book it doesn’t mean the feeling of the book closes too.’5/5...more",Notes are private!,0,190,1,Aug 2023,Aug 2023,"Aug 01, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60065627-a-horse-at-night

And so, once more upon a time, Roshani Chokshi embarks us on a magical fairy tale on the powers of hope, love, and redemption in her charming and sweet novella aptly named Once More Upon a Time. Having been completely blown away by Chokshi’s dark, modern fairy tale-esque The Last Tale of the Flower Bride, I absolutely needed to read more of her work and I was thrilled by this delightful look at the lighter side of fairy tales. Drawing on many common tropes, Once More Upon a Time feels both familiar and fresh, told with a great deal of humor and adorable side-companions that almost made this feel like Disney fairy tales at their utmost best where both younger and older readers will find their hearts warmed. ‘You can wander the world and be beholden to no one, and still find yourself trapped.’Something I’ve found Chokshi excels at is depictions of love and the anxieties that surround it. This is a tale of second-chances: to reverse the death of his new queen, Imelda, Ambrose agrees to have their love erased even though their rule requires them to be in love. As they venture on a quest together following the loss of their kingdom, new sparks begin to fly and all the awkwardness of rekindling romance comes pouring through the narrative. Plus the banter is utterly delightful and the side characters—notably a smartass honey badger—provide a lot of wonderful laughs. I really just sailed through this on waves of pure bliss. It’s short, sweet, and just a perfect escape read and shows Chokshi can land any fairy tale trope she sets out to perform. 4/5...more",Notes are private!,0,127,1,not set,not set,"Aug 01, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56628279-once-more-upon-a-time

Or only life?’The color green is often symbolic of growth and new beginnings, though it can also express envy or jealousy as well. ‘Is it a disaster? Or only life?’The color green is often symbolic of growth and new beginnings, though it can also express envy or jealousy as well. I enjoy dynamic, multi-functional symbols because, like so much in life, you can detect a sense of meaning but in many ways they evade easy categorization. Or like the sirens that blare in the middle of the night to the confusion of the apartment dwellers during Marie NDiaye’s often elusive Self-Portrait in Green we find ‘We don’t know, we’ve forgotten, how to interpret it.’ But still it seems it must point toward something, such as the various women in green that appear throughout this short novella, sometimes a symbol of growth (former best friend turned woman in green that marries her father and is frequently mentioned as expanding in size while her father shrinks), or envy (the woman in green who married a friend’s former lover), or sometimes ‘a kind of green woman I haven’t yet come across,’ where wearing green isn’t a requirement for being a woman in green. An ambiguous autofiction—it is the product of NDiaye being asked to write a memoir—the self-portrait of the title seems to become one less centered on the self and more the self in-relation-to the various women in green that cross her path. Told through scattered diary-esque entries ranging from 2000-2004 and written in a way that captures a surreal unease (beautifully captured by Jordan Stump in a PEN Award-winning translation), Self-Portrait in Green is an elusive and thought provoking little novella.‘Again the ambiguity, the groping, the unanswered questions about all this green.’I came to this curious novella by way of Amina Cain discussing the visual quality of the tale, and having read and enjoyed NDiaye’s That Time of Year, I figured she was worth another read. I’m glad I did, and while this book may seem a bit frustrating to some—not unlike That Time of Year the events feel protentous yet obfuscating with something rather off creating a rather unsettling feel—it is one that is best enjoyed by letting it wash over you and feeling companionship with the narrator through your shared uncertainty. A book built on amalgamating details instead of plot, it opens on a scene of impending disaster with a river potentially about to overflow (the river, she observes, is distinctly feminine for this) and this sense of dread is carried through each vignette. Things never quite line up. A friend has a double who acts erratically, a strange object is running amok, a woman standing by a banana tree can’t be observed by the narrators children, or a woman who hangs herself is later witnessed in a grocery store. Everything is on the verge of existence and non-existence and we see how we, too, may be on such a precipice.‘the belief in the infinity of possibilities, the illusion that you can forever start over again, that every mark made on you lasts a little while then ends up disappearing—all that we no longer have.’What makes this book so intriguing is the refusal of any concrete center to pin the idea of a woman and green upon. She is instead an shifting symbol seemingly pointing towards a shared idea. She is sometimes an image of brute force, of disdain, and often an idea of for ‘not what was, but what should have been, could have been, had she only made some other choice way back then, and she regrets the choice she made, the path of sorrow.’ She is anywhere and can appear at any time, even after death because ‘how can you even die, simply that, when you live a life of stone, unchanging and immobile?’ Though perhaps the best singular impression of a woman in green is the author’s own mother, despite her not even being in green:‘My mother is a woman in green, untouchable, disappointing, infinitely mutable, very cold, able, by force of will, to become very beautiful, and able, too, not to want to.’The idea of giving a name to things, like the concept of a woman in green, seems to express the idea of having a power over something or at least a sense of control. Such as the mysterious dark object running around town that the narrator is asked by her children to say what it is—when she can’t she decides instead she hasn’t seen it. Self-Portrait in Green is strange, surreal, yet rather gorgeous and NDiaye has an excellent control over language meant to feel like losing control. Perhaps it is the very elusiveness that makes it so meaningful, because what is meaning but something we create as a narrative out of the chaos around us. It is a book that, I suspect, rewards close rereads and individual readers will likely find individual meaning within it. I am enthralled with the uniqueness of NDiaye’s works and how—like a woman in green—they haunt your mind for a long time to come.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,0,157,1,"Jul 31, 2023","Jul 31, 2023","Jul 31, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58296462-self-portrait-in-green

This is an issue I have struggled with all life long and I found the story of Rue taking on too much work and feeling crushed under the weight of all the labor and expectations—and really struggling when a mistake is noticed—to be quite relatable. I suspect others will too. There is that desire to show you can do things, and the reward of people appreciating your efforts, but then you take on more than you can handle and, instead of feeling achievement, the litany of tasks becomes a burden and anxiety sets in.

It is a novel propelled by images more so than plot, following Vitória from being ‘saved’ from her working class life cleaning an art museum to her general discontent in a life of fancy society. Through it all, the desire to be a writer overrides everything and she continuously shoves everything aside to create space regardless of ‘how indelicate’ her behavior is perceived or her husband’s annoyance that she would choose to labor over literature instead of quietly submit to a life of leisure. Though Cain writes in a sparse prose style, it feels almost magical how vast the imagery is that emits from her slender sentences. A rather haunting, stylistically stunning and very interior novel that registers more as a visual experience, Indelicacy examines the artistic life in conjunction with social status, gender expectations and the ways we must often elbow out our own space to create.‘Still in the process of becoming, the soul makes room.’I often find that the novels with the barest of plots make space to let the details really shine. It is like a quiet evening, when all the bustle of the day dies down and, instead of simply darkness and silence, we suddenly hear the cacophonous choirs of insects under a dazzling display of starshine. Such is the case with Indelicacy where within its own quiet spaces we can truly hear her language sing. I read this alongside her book on writing, A Horse at Night: On Writing (read my  here), which made for a truly illuminating experience, seeing how her ideas lead into her sentences and her sentences into her ideas back and forth across both books. Most notably are the ways Vitória’s excavations of self, such as questioning ‘what part of me is false?’ in order to cut those aspects from her life and further engage in her writing, aligns with Cain’s own efforts to parse down her language for the most economical effect and authenticity. As she writes in A Horse at Night: ‘going further into my writing means being vigilant about shedding what is false, even the smallest bit of it.’ Cain excels at embedding imagery into her writing and transports us into the space, not unlike the way Vitória feels she would like to ender the ‘wooden buildings meant to conjure the street of a village’ she sees on a ballet stage or how ‘you look at the painting and you want to go farther into the room.’ And the sparseness of words opens a room to be projected into:‘Why is empty space a comfort and a relief? It’s not because I project myself there, it's because I can’t. It shows me my projections but they haven’t left my mind. Empty space remains empty, always. And for a little while a small part of me can be empty too.’Her writing projects into our minds like the ways Vitória says she sees handwriting projected onto the faces of others. This is all the more impressive considering the vague time period this is set—we hear of carriages and candle-lit rooms but the texture of time seems it could be any time, all times, or no time but its own yet it feels so visually vivid nonetheless. It is an exquisite form of creation and we feel as if, like a painting, our eyes are lingering on a canvas more than reading words on a page.‘Writing was not the only thing I wanted to do, but the important thing, I thought, was that I wanted to do it more than anything else.’This is not a typical story of art life, of trying to find a story and create it (we never do learn much of what she writes about) but more about having to create a space for it to occur. Which, honestly, I vibed with way too hard. Life is so full and your focus is being hooked from all angles all demanding full attention at the same time and sometimes you just have to really shove your own space. At the novels start we find our narrator working in a museum scrubbing floors with her only friend, Antoinette, looking at art the same way she looks at society: from the outside wishing she could go in. She wants to be a writer and it is what gives her pleasure and purpose—‘In books I found even more strongly my desire to write, to write back to them and their jagged, perfect words. I found life that ran close to my own’—and a sudden twist of fate finds her married to a wealthy man and freed of her working class woes (admittedly this is a bit of a shoehorned plot point, but whatever I read a lot of fairy tales and can cope). While Simone de Beauvoir wrote that women must have financial mobility in order for liberation, Virginia Woolf adds a second necessity: ‘A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction.’ Vitoria enjoys the comforts of her new status but just wants to write (which is strongly against her husband’s wishes). There is also the element of Solange, the maid, reminding her at all times of where she came from and feels twinges of guilt seeing as the symbol of the working class clearly detests her. Cain borrowed the character name from Jean Genet’s play The Maids, writing in A Horse at Night that she did this‘not with the intent to rewrite her, but because I was interested in the currents that often remain invisible, that aren’t usually acted out as they are in The Maids...I wanted my Solange to carry within her…a dark history of maids throughout time.’There is also the aspect that the narrator wants to remove anything false from her life. She spends much of the novel reflecting on the sacrifices women have made, such as her thoughts about women who work at a factory turning horses into glue:‘We should memorialize the horses, remember them truthfully, and the women who have to spend their days in that way....I have benefited from a woman who never stops working, walking back from the factory in the morning and the night.’But with the presence of Solange, can she really feel this affinity to the working class is an authentic self in her new status? Yet she also cannot find her position as a women of wealth to be authentic either, admitting to eating ‘like a pig’ and other poor manners such as her brusque way of dealing with others and embracing her eccentricities for which her husband accuses her of doing because she believes herself better than everyone else (she is, she retorts). In a world where every step is judged, especially if one is a woman, how can you feel authentic? And how can you find space to create (her plan, which arrives at the end of the novel, is quite the twist).‘...saw me only in relation to property and propriety. To be domestic first and then to be a shallow vessel out and about in the world. Didn’t he understand that was not who I was?’What I love most about this novella was how much it felt like a classic novel. There is a lot of Virginia Woolf in the general vibes, most notably when after attending an author event between two men who spend the whole time counting their accolades she tells them to their faces ‘when you open your mouths, you are male worms eating from a toilet.’ I especially enjoyed the tender passages describing various paintings, each pointing towards something thematic in the novel through its juxtaposition with the text, and how this tied into the narrator’s artistic struggles as well as she ‘wanted to write about paintings, but I wasn’t seen as someone who could say something interesting about art.’ The way this novel knots all its ideas about writing together with the expressions of her creative journey is rather breathtaking and it is so stylistically stunning I could not tear my thoughts away from it for days. Indelicacy is a quiet novel with a loud voice that packs a wealth of imagery into the tiniest of spaces. A lovely read and I would highly recommend reading this alongside A Horse at Night: On Writing as I found both enhanced by doing so.4/5‘I had created an experience for someone; I hadn’t been sure I could actually do that.’...more",Notes are private!,2,147,1,"Jul 28, 2023","Jul 28, 2023","Jul 28, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/52536626-indelicacy

The Summer I Turned Pretty by Jenny Han chronicles the maelstrom of anxieties and desires of changing relationships over the course of the summer when Belly turns 16, contrasting it through glimpses of previous summers through her childhood to best explore the ways things change amongst a group of friends when attraction enters the picture. This was a rather lovely read, but all is not the idyllic summer of love in this gorgeous North Carolina town. Stormcloud are clearly rumbling in Conrad’s mind, making him standoffish, aggressive, and not the boy Belly thought she fell in love with over the previous summers and the sweetness of Jeremiah begins to take a whole new meaning. With all these changes, will relationship wreck upon the waves or may these friends sail on to more bright summer days?‘Would you rather live one perfect day over and over or live your life with no perfect days but just decent ones?’I had a blast reading this one, enjoying remembering the tumultuous time of being a teenager which this book captures so well. These characters are flawed, but in ways that I definitely remember relating to or seeing in my peers at the time and its hard not to feel for them as they struggle through all the changes in their lives. And, to be fair, ‘It's the imperfections that make things beautiful.’ While this book may make you cringe at points, it also felt truthful. And perhaps some of my cringing was not wanting to admit I saw my former self in some of these pages, the parts I try to pretend weren’t there and have hopefully outgrown. But that is also what made this so engaging is how well it plunges you right back into all those conflicting emotions, feeling both still a kid inside but wanting to be seen as mature, cool, and someone that someone might fall in love with.Han does a good job exploring what begins as a love triangle but transforms into a love…square (personally, I felt bad for Cam, who was clearly being used to ensure the brother’s notice her new sexuality&mdash,and honestly, he was probably the most emotionally stable and mature of them all) But this was an interesting read, tracing the course of emotions that sprouted in earlier summers and seeing how attraction and a desire to be wanted can shake all that about. Which is what Han captures best, the way things change and that ‘things couldn't stay the same forever.’ As an adult, you realize change is just part of the territory. It doesn’t get easier, but you learn to expect it, adapt, how to catalog the losses and keep going because you’ve learned that time will keep marching and those hurts will fade. But when you are 15 it is all new, and the soft world of childhood starts taking on harsher edges. People are not static the way you think when only a handful of years feels like a long time, and the teenage years are such a whirlwind of change—physically and emotionally—that it can feel like being completely unmoored and thrust into chaos. Han nails this feeling, along with some sort of corny but cute teenage philosophizing. And sure, some of the characters are a bit cliched and too-much, but WHO WASN’T AT 16. This was lovely and sad and frustrating and just all the great summer reading vibes and though I didn’t turn pretty can I at least say I had my hot girl book summer?...more",Notes are private!,8,258,1,not set,not set,"Jul 27, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/59602700-the-summer-i-turned-pretty

Yet one boy is determined to free his people from their thirst and set the record straight in Moses Ose Utomi’s The Lies of the Ajungo, a fable-like, speculative novella drawing from Nigerian culture. While we often champion storytelling as a way to liberate our minds, it can also entrap us in propaganda, and propaganda passed down for generations can find those imprisoned in lies unsure even who their captors are. Yet, luckily, storytelling continues to be a joy in the hands of Utomi, writing with effortless fluidity and the sort of whimsicality that carries deep lessons such as in the best of children’s classics, punctuated by exciting and visceral violent moments of struggle. Having to battle the learned helplessness codified into his culture through common phrases and stories as much as he must battle the harsh desert, The Lies of the Anjungo is a high stakes, life or death tale that looks at the ways stories can divide and oppress us if they are used to mask a brutal truth.Short but powerful, The Lies of the Ajungo is an incredibly engaging work of speculative fiction. With just a few quick strokes of language, Utomi constructs a world that feels vast, alive with culture and history, and is also very dangerous. It has a small cast of endearing characters that feel rather archetypal, and along the perilous paths they must overcome the prejudices against anyone outside their culture and come together to discover the truths hidden from them. Danger is everywhere, especially when you don’t know who to trust, and this small cast is continuously getting smaller as violence seems to strike suddenly and furiously in the desert. There are some fantastic magical elements to this fable, such as the Seers with the Eyes of God to better see the world and convert other’s energy into their own strength in combat. The creativity is fun and adds to the rather nuanced dynamics of the world.‘[P]ower came from translating understanding into belief, from standing so firmly in one's knowledge of the world that the knowledge itself became an armor--and a weapon.’Storytelling passes down lessons and codifies culture, but, as George Orwell wrote in 1984, ‘who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past,’ and irresponsible use of rhetoric and history as propaganda can reshape the past as we understand it. Tutu, the young boy who embarks on this bildungsroman quest narrative, understands how erasing the name of his city to rename in The City of Lies is just the first step in rewriting history in order to keep his people down. Without their tongues they cannot tell others of their oppression, and if they do they are assumed to be liars. ‘There are no friends outside the City of Lies’ the boy has been taught, though is this a warning against strangers or a way to ensure they will never trust strangers either? ‘It was hard to overrule years and years of honed mistrust,’ and perhaps this mistrust instilled in each of the kingdoms is a way to keep them divided. But for who? We see how without language, one cannot pass on their own history.The Lies of the Ajuno has a great message about the selfishness and greed of those with money and power, and the horrific acts they will commit to never lose their power over others. This is also an exciting and enraging reminder that sometimes being directed towards hating a common enemy from afar can cause you to miss the enemy right in front of you. This really successfully pulls off a lot of sociopolitical commentary as well as world building all in around 80pgs. I enjoy all these short books like this and fans of Nnedi Okorafor will likely enjoy this book. It is easily a one-sitting read (not only will you not want to put it down but the writing really sweeps you up and carries you off. But, as we see here, even a short tale—even a single, short saying&dash;can come loaded with potency and the power to change how we see the world around us. So take care with language, use it to liberate and not imprison, and dive into the dangerous and deceitful world Moses Ose Utomi has created for us. This appears to be the start for an upcoming series and I cannot wait for more.4.5/5‘Tears are precious. Don’t waste them on your enemies.

And what if nobody believes you? Such isThe imagination is an ideal place for fear to take root, but what if the things you fear turn out to be real. And what if nobody believes you? Such is the dilemma for Lucy in Neil Gaiman’s lovely picture book, The Wolves in the Walls, when an old saying that ‘When the wolves come out of the walls, it's all over’ starts to become an impending threat. As a kid I always had a very active imagination and enjoyed adventuring in my mind with imaginary friends (a talking dinosaur was part of my crew) to conquer monsters (they lived in the trees and only could move in shadows), so when Lucy and her friend Pig-Puppet begin hearing wolves lurking, I was transported right back to those feelings of childhood awe where your own imagination can tip you towards terror. This book is brilliantly illustrated by Dave McKean with a combination of hand-drawn art, photographs and computer graphics that captures the aura of imagination with both a playfulness and unsettling atmosphere. It is an eerie tale about confronting your fears but also explores ideas around the frustration of not being believed and the stories and phrases that we pass along without even knowing why. Cute, and creepy you’ll have a lot of fun when…  [image]...the wolves came out of the wallsInspired by a nightmare his then 4 year old daughter had, Gaiman nails this horror story for kids. I find Neil Gaiman to be at his strongest when approaching dark fairy tales that are aimed for children but are equally enjoyable as adults, and his picture book Wolves in the Walls is a perfect example. It is pure imagination expressed in picture book form, being both whimsical and frightening and written in a way that feels like an old fairy tale you think you should already know. The repetition of things in threes—a classic fairy tale device—the lurking threats, the playfulness of words all pull you along in this story that is full of fun twists and surprises. It feels like a modern classic in a way, especially as it has been adapted multiple times including a musical stage production where Neil Gaiman provided some of the lyrics.  [image]Stage adaptations: Puppet adaptation by Toby Olié (top) and National Theater of Scotland (bottom)It also has been adapted into an interactive movie where, as Lucy’s imaginary friend in addition to Pig-Puppet, you can help her find clues and battle the wolves. This story just inspires creativity and fun.  [image]The interactive version available for VR headsetsOne aspect that I really enjoyed was the way stories shape our understanding of reality. Throughout the book nobody believes Lucy but continuously quotes an old saying about when the wolves come out, it’s all over. Yet nobody has a good answer to when Lucy asks “who” says that, why or what “it” means. I had a teacher in high school who, whenever someone would say something to the effect of “well they say that…”, would ask “who is ‘they’?” It was a good reminder to question why something has been decided as a truth and stop and consider what it all really means. It also makes me think about old sayings we use without really knowing the etymology (just the other day I looked up why the old saying “from soup to nuts” exists when a patron used it) and how that is a form of myth making in a way. It’s used quite effectively here and instantly embeds you into what feels like a pre-established tale despite it being a Gaiman original.  [image]I just love the art in this too. It does seem a bit dated with obviously older computer graphics elements but in a way I feel it almost adds to the story, aging it like a fine wine and enhancing the feeling this is an old tale passed down. It also manages to be cute while simultaneously disquieting, having a bit of an uncanny valley anxiety emitting from it as well as feeling like creepy puppets at times. I like how well it contrasts with the more cartoonish wolves, which plays into the theme of facing your fears and discovering they aren’t all that terrifying (and might be even more scared of you).Overall, this is lovely. Clearly a story for children but it warms my adult heart and transports you into its childlike magic. I’ve always wanted to like Gaiman more than I end up actually enjoying some of his work, but I’ve found his work geared towards children hits high marks.

Such can be said of my own heart from Chloe Michelle Howarth’s searingly gorgeous sapphic novel, Sunburn, which has practically reprogramed my heartbeat to its poetic rhythms. ‘Now is the time between birth and slaughter’ begins this breathtaking bildungsroman that takes intimate investigations on the multitudes of change felt at the cusp of adulthood to show how they become milestones of the self in this interim between the cradle and grave. It is a story of Lucy and her awakening desires for Susannah, a desire so great she feels her body cannot possibly contain it, yet in the face of an unwelcoming society that feeds on rumors and castigations she feels her desire is shameful and contorts from happiness to fit the image others want for her. It is also a story of shifting dynamics between friends and family as ‘things fall apart when you grow up.’ Sunburns reads in a blaze of poetic glory fueled by intense and introspective prose that captures adolescent anxiety overcome by emotion across a narrative of being ‘pulled in two very different directions,’ of love in conflict with one’s community and the strength required to walk away from shame into self-actualization.‘Since I have known her, Susannah has been a flame in bloom. She took me from ash and made me human. I fear if she spends one more day in the garden, her flame will dwindle, and to ash I will return.’This book skyrocketed to my “favorites” shelf. I really enjoyed buddy reading this one with Liv (you should definitely read their  incredible  here) and discussing it along the way. Set in rural Ireland in the early 90’s, Sunburn follows Lucy between the ages of 15 to 20, pulling us along her internal monologues as she tries to ride the currents of her own emotions while fearing she will dash upon the rocks of public image and ostracization. Her focus, growing into an obsession and outpouring of love, is always Susannah. ‘The way that Lucy feels about Susannah is the book, ’ Haworth explains in an interview and we experience Lucy process major moments of growth over the years in relation to her love for Susannah. It begins in trepidation, realizing ‘I am reading deeper into her unconscious movements,’ but initially completely unable to recognize what she is feeling is a crush. Its adorable. The two begin to grow closer and closer through their teenage years and eventually reveal their shared desires for one another, unleashing a universe of passion and new concerns that carry the second half of the novel.‘Another girl like me exists, and she is the most perfect girl in the world. The awful deed is done, our perfect love comes to life. I am hers, and she is mine.’Chloe Michelle Howarth’s prose really sends the novel on an emotional roller coaster that made this not only one of the most underlined books I’ve read in years but also one that shook my heart and soul so gloriously that it was probably detectable on a seismograph. Howarth seizes upon teenage angst and over-dramatic flair as an opportunity to push her prose into ecstatic expressions. You get some killer lines like ‘hate me if you want to hate me, I’d love the attention,’ that make me love this book even more, but also Howarth teases that, despite there being some really sharp symbolism in the book, Lucy’s mind often overanalyzes everything in a really relatable way.‘Tonight I find myself looking for her scent in the air, her touch in the pillowcase. It’s a strain to find meaning where there is none. It’s such a teenaged thing to do, why can I not stop doing it? Not everything is a symbol. Sometimes the world is plain and obvious. Sometimes the things I feel and the things I want don’t matter.’ BEEN THERE. Though this is not language Lucy can vocalize so much of her outpourings for Susannah arrive in the form of letters, adding another wonderful dynamic to the narrative but also nudging a primary theme about hiding desire.‘And although we go far to escape them, at one time or another, we must return to Crossmore. To the roots of ourselves.’The rural Irish setting is key to the novel and to Howarth’s heart, with Crossmore and the visual landscape reflecting her own natural surroundings. ‘I wanted it to be really unapologetically Irish, with Irish names and such,’ Howarth said in the Irish Times, ‘I wouldn’t have enjoyed writing something that didn’t include that’ There is a connection with nature and the way ‘the days drip by as slow as half-melted candle wax,’ could also be applied to the slow but sensory pacing of the novel that really helps you feel like you inhabit the space alongside the characters. Add to this the ways that emotions and the seasons are often intertwined (or, as Liv points out, the way light reflects the state of Susannah), with summer being the season of outpourings of passion:‘The Summer has been just a little bit too warm, the sun has been a little too bright. My thoughts have been a little bit too uncontrollable. And my emotions a little too humid. They only grow more humid. It all just gets stickier. Soon I think I will be unable to go even one day without lying on the grass with her.’Much of the novel takes place in 1992, which is one year before Ireland would decriminalize homosexuality in 1993 (later in 2015 Ireland was the first country to legalized same sex marriage by popular vote as well as allow trans people to legally self-identify) and in a rural community where the idea of “traditional values” reign supreme. It is a place where ‘motherhood is the nearest thing to an inherited career that I can hope for,’ and people are kept in line by rumours and outcast for being different.‘Nasty rumours, which are scarcely confirmed and forever remembered…This is not a forgiving place. The fear of it takes me over. It takes us all over. We all have secrets, everybody is hiding something.’Susannah and Lucy have different reactions to these sorts of rumors with Susannah already implicated due to the split of her wealthy parents and a mother that runs around with men. ‘I fear that Crossmore is too deep in me, and I would not know how to exist elsewhere,’ Lucy worries, and this fear along with losing her mother’s love if she were to openly admit she is a lesbian, become a rift between Susannah and her.‘With or without me, she will go on blooming, she will always be a glorious thing. I would rather lose everything than lose her. I realise this too late…’In many ways Sunburn is about choices that define identities with the choice between Susannah and Crossmore in general a major struggle for teenage Lucy. Before Susannah, Lucy struggles to understand herself and uncertain why she can’t feel anything for boys like Martin the way she thinks she should. Once she enters a relationship with Susannah, however, Lucy feels her true self, feels purpose, feels pulsating with desire to live and dream.‘At last, I am defined. All my lonely days were not wasted, they led me to this most perfect union, this weaving of our two souls. The parts of me that were once afraid can no longer be found.Perhaps they will come back to terrify me again, but for now, I can’t feel them. For now, I allow myself to be wanted by her.’She also feels a validated sense of self worth. ‘All along I thought Susannah was like a god,’ she muses, having obsessed over her for years, ‘now I kind of feel like a god too,’ or that they ‘are equal parts.’ There is the aspect that she feels validated but, like every aspect of this book, it is viewed in context with—and because of—Susannah.‘ I live in a body that has loved her and I see with eyes that have witnessed her. She is part of my muscles, my tissue, she is unforgettable.’Susannah gives her meaning she didn’t know she had before. But while ‘neither of us wants to be a cousin that the village isn’t supposed to know about,’ Susannah wants to be able to be openly a couple while Lucy fears the social repercussions. ‘Even with all the love that I have for her, I’m not ready to be out. Not yet. I’m just somebody in love with Susannah. That’s enough.’ Lucy wants it all, Crossmore and Susannah, and neither to define her.‘I always thought a place like Crossmore would kill a person like me, but I realise now that places like Crossmore are made for people like me. There is space for me, for us, out on the edges, among the ruins and the hedges and the stone walls. These things are immovable. They belong to the world and cannot be altered. I hope that Susannah and I are like these things.I carve our initials into trees and scratch them onto rocks, hoping that a piece of us will remain in the landscape.’However, we see this isn’t the case. When Lucy allows Crossmore and the opinions of others to define her, it is a feeling of shame, sin, and falseness. ‘I pretend so well I almost believe myself,’ she says. When they are caught together she thinks ‘heaven is fractured; Susannah and I are among you now, all you awful sinners,’ and even later still clings to the idea that ‘to be with her is a sin,’ until Evelyn finally tells her ‘Girl, there’s no such thing as sin.’ Which returns to the idea of Susannah as a god figure, because in Crossmore we are also reminded of the deep Catholic hold on rural Ireland.‘Never in all my years of Christianity has there been talk of an angel like this.’I can’t help but mention Sister Michael from Derry Girls admitting “I do love a good statue” as a jest at how much iconography permeates Catholicism, which is also present in Lucy’s veneration of Susannah. There is a lot of religious symbolism in her imagery of Susannah (burning fire for instance) and the worship comes interlaced with guilt and sin. It is a really incisive linguistic tell of her Catholicism and how her desire for Susannah is both viewed as a move towards something holy but also fearful as a fall from grace. Having been raised in the Catholic church and being close with ex-christian queer peers, trust me, this is totally a thing. ‘All I’ve done is fall for Susannah. It is not shameful or radical or wild. Anybody would fall for Susannah. I never meant to upset anybody.’This book is a burning indictment on the harms caused from homophobia. All Lucy and Susannah wanted was love. To be able to be, say, go to a dance together without it being a scandal. To simply exist in the world together without it being turned into a whole thing to give the rumor or hatemongers something to rage about to fill the voids in their life.‘‘My love now seems to be an aggressive, political thing. It is the ceaseless search for an identity and then committing to that identity. It is a fight to exist in my own home. Is that not exhausting? Is it worth it? It feels like the good parts of loving have been thrown on the backseat and forgotten about.’Among the harshest aspects are the ways those who claim to love her react. ‘To Mother, I am no longer Lucy,’ she thinks as her mother ignores her and refuses to feed her (Liv makes a brilliant point that food is used symbolically for love in the novel, from withholding it to Martin’s lumpy and cold meals reflective of her inability to truly love him).‘If everybody loved me as much as they claim to, I don’t think I would be in this position, back and forth between them like a pendulum, always stuck between her and everything else in the world. I am so sick I could scream.’Mothers figures are a key theme to the novel, with Lucy seeing how Susannah wilts when her mother leaves and fears the same for herself if she does not lie about her true self to regain her mother’s approval. ‘Either I can be who Mother expects me to be, or I can be whoever I want to be. Each seems as treacherous as the other. I will find myself, soon, I just need to stop acting my age and grow up.’ And life changes are coming at her fast.‘The life that I know will morph out of shape. The girls will be far away. I will be somebody different. I am grown, and yet I have never felt so young.’Though this attempt to be what her mother wants instead of herself causes her to analyze every aspect of her life during one of lifes biggest moments of transitions: graduating school and moving beyond the gates of adolescence. Sunburn so eloquently captures that feeling of excitement yet also sadness during moments of big change and makes it felt so deeply I was right back at 18 watching friendships being packed into boxes as we dispersed around the country. ‘Something has changed. We are not the people that we used to be,’ Lucy observes, and this seeps into every relationship she knows. Especially Martin, who was a friendship so easy but now under the context of dating to appease her mother everything feels fragile and timid.  ‘Being in his company has become so loaded. Now that he thinks I am almost his girlfriend, it’s like I am no longer his friend…Our boundaries, our language, our movements, they must all be monitored, I must bend over backwards to stop from hurting or arousing his feelings.’Martin is a really endearing character and Howarth does an excellent job setting up the major life choice between Martin and a life with Susannah—or at least a life embracing her sexuality—by having Martin be a perfect choice on all fronts all except for her sexuality. He ‘is so kind and caring and offers a secure future,’ her family approves, society approves, but she can never truly love him. Will she find that this element of love is more important than hiding behind a socially acceptable mask? ‘These days all anyone wants to talk about is what is going to happen next, so much so that nobody cares about what’s happening now. All Susannah wants to do is run away, and all Martin wants to do is settle down, and I realise that I’ve only ever thought of ways to keep everyone happy, so I have no idea what I want’This becomes the big lesson of the novel. ‘I can have her, she says, but it has to be all of her, and it has to be honest, and it has to be now,’ yet can she walk away from the people of her life, from Crossmore, to embrace this? ‘We live with our eyes closed, Susannah and her money, Martin and his land, and me, without the confidence or ability to do anything on my own,’ she thinks, and we see how she is often guided by a mother figure because of her inability to stand for herself. Though it is the mothers who hurt her the most, even Maria, the mother figure of her friend group, who will later betray Lucy’s secrets. ‘If you’d lose them over this, then maybe you never had them at all,’ Susannah advises. A harsh truth, but a difficult one to embrace.‘There are so many people in the real world, Lucy. Not everybody is your mother. Not everybody wants to get married off and live on a farm. People would love you the way you are, we just need to find those people’I could honestly go on about this novel for pages and pages. Sunburn is a towering achievement of queer fiction, of coming-of-age stories, of poetic expression, of just simply being a deeply moving novel. It captures so many specific feelings of riding the tide from childhood into adulthood as the maelstrom of desires, ego, and self-conscious investigations rains down. ‘Sweet Susannah, where I am a burnt-out star, you are the sun,’ says Lucy, and here I sit looking at this novel as if it, too, is the sun. Startlingly gorgeous and nuanced, this is a masterpiece of a debut novel from Chloe Michelle Howarth. It will burn you in its brilliant blaze of passion, and you will be better for it.5/5‘Susannah is the place where I belong.

With Hiromi Kawakami, we often find any distinction between human and animal to be rather tenuous, and in the eight stories found in her collection Dragon Palace, we not only find the characters’ personal identities to often be in flux and ambiguous but also their animalistic identity. ‘Each and every home contains at least one member who has something inhuman about them,’ a character advises in one story, and we see a spectrum of characters ranging from definitely human, to transitioning from animal to human, and many others who openly announce ‘I am not human.’ This new release, translated by Ted Goossen, is actually a collection mostly drawing from Hiromi Kawakami’s earlier stories but they all fit together quite nicely with overarching themes and an overall narrative feeling approaching folklore. An octopus becomes a human sex pest, an older woman commands a cult with sex, moles care for depressed humans, humans care for humans that might also be foxes, kitchens have gods living under the stove and more fantastical and fascinating occurrences go on in this collection. With gendered examinations on sexuality (often brushing up against the taboo) and sexual power dynamics, and a look at identity in outlandish situations, Hiromi Kawakami’s Dragon Palace is chock full of dark charm.I’ve long loved the quietness of Kawakami’s narratives, the way she can make loneliness snuggle up with you like a cat on your lap, and the way a character’s day to day can shimmer in nearly overwhelming bittersweet emotion. There is certainly another side to her as well where she can crack open the world and pour out a dark magic that awaits just beneath the surface. Dragon Palace finds itself among the latter, feeling much more like Record of a Night Too Brief or the interconnected stories of People From My Neighborhood than, say, my personal favorite The Nakano Thrift Shop. Which isn’t a bad thing, I quite enjoy the whimsicality she finds in the bizarre and her ability to write stories that feel like folklore just outside of full understanding, I just tend to really love the softness of her writing in the former. Though I wonder, perhaps, how much of that is the brilliance of Allison Markin Powell’s translation, whereas both this and People From My Neighborhood were Goossen and have a more detatched feel to them not unlike how Haruki Murakami comes across in his (or really any other translator’s) translation. Not that this is necessarily negative, as it seamlessly moves between normal reality and the more bizarre moments without making them feel out of place which is a really key aspect to capture in her stories.Like most of her work, Dragon Palace often steers situations towards the sexual and there appears to be a few themes for her explorations of it. Large age gaps are often present, such as in her beloved Strange Weather in Tokyo, and in Fox’s Den we read about a caretaker for the elderly who slowly falls into a sexual relationship with a man twice her age (after having earlier chastised him for sexual harassment) as well as the story Shimazaki where a woman falls in love with her ancestor who is now over 400 years old. With the latter, the idea seems to use romantic love to probe our ideas of what familial love is by approaching taboos, which is also common for Kawakami. I did find The Ten Loves of Mr. Nishino to be rather problematic in this way though here it feels more symbolic like in a fairy tale. The story The Roar details the life of a character who is passed amongst his sisters, feeding from their breasts and marrying one of them. While I think “sister” is meant loosely here (maybe?), I’m curious why breastfeeding from an older sister is something that has now appeared in multiple of her books (it is used to convey the closeness of Nishino with his sister in The Ten Loves of Mr. Nishino as well).As with much of the more bizarre aspects in her more magical tales, Kawakami seems to be pushing the envelope on ideas of relationships and love into the taboo as a sort of social commentary on how couched our ideas are in social norms. I don’t, however, find it nearly as effective as, say, Sayaka Murata who puts her finger more directly on the topic and guides the reader towards that understanding in what is usually a more shocking manner. Though the stories here certainly explore sexual power dynamics through many of these moments. Two of the stronger stories bookend this collection and both feature an animal that has turned human, the first being an octopus who became a man in order to seduce women and the latter being a sea horse who was drawn to the love of a man and has spent decades being objectified and passed from husband to husband as a sort of trophy (it made me want to revisit Cassandra Khaw’s The Salt Grows Heavy which opens with a revenge tale of sorts for that type of situation). The juxtaposition takes a stab at the way unequal sexual power dynamics are often socially normalized such as the narrator engaging in some rather misogynistic bonding and finding it completely normal, even ‘liberating’ as he says.‘I felt strangely liberated. I stood there assigning numbers and adjectives to each woman that came by, one after another. In the process, they stopped being individuals with personalities and real lives.’Which is all undeniably gross and I’m certain the woman they chase through the streets as she runs for her safety does not find the experience liberating. Nor does the sea horse turned woman find being objectified to be liberating and instead seeks to return to the ocean, as does her daughter (that her sons have no ocean-tendencies but the daughter seems so much like her nudges the theme as well). In Kawakami stories we notice the taboo sexuality, though the fact that sex can often be a horror story for women who are assaulted, objectified or otherwise abused is something that is commonplace. The Kitchen God, for instance, has a sexual assault occur late in the story that passes with hardly any recognition (that aside, it is easily my favorite story in the collection, following a young woman with kleptomania and the society of older women in her housing complex, but also a kitchen god spirit). The title story Dragon Palace, however, throws the dynamic out of whack and features a woman revered like a cult leader who uses sexuality to keep her followers in line, and they in turn using it against her.‘I didn't know my own name. I didn't know why I had been born into this world. I had no idea what would become of me.’Though not everything about this collection is entirely sexual, don’t let me give the wrong impression. A rather charming story tilted Mole features—you guessed it!—a mole who picks up depressed humans and brings them into his hole until they recover. The humans have ‘lost the energy to stay alive,’ but ‘ this does not mean they are dead. Apparently, dying requires actual strength,’ and when he identifies their condition they shrink down to a size that can fit in his pocket. This story also addresses the ideas of animals in our own society, with him working an office job long enough that people mostly don’t notice anymore. I like the tenderness of this one as well and shows a strong idea of community because the loss of human to this condition has a ripple effect:‘If left alone, they hollow out. First, they themselves, then the place where they stand, then ultimately the entire area around them empties. All real substance is lost.’This loss of substance seems to permeate this collection, with ideas of identity being a sort of substance the characters are unsure what to do with. The octopus, for instance, is unsure if he is octopus or man at times and feels he’s lost that connection to the ocean (likely why he often shifts into ‘an undulating, shape-shifting blob’ with the frail grasp on identity), and much of The Roar deals with having no idea of ones own purpose. Are we animals just following instinct and surviving, or are we some grand idea of humans with a purpose, and does chasing the belief in the latter lead us to despair?Hiromi Kawakami is a drop-everything-to-read author for me and I’m glad I did that with Dragon Palace despite being a tad underwhelmed at times. That said, I read this fairly slowly which seemed to help, as I’d often find myself thinking of the stories for several days and enjoying them more the longer I turned them over in my head. She has such a wonderful use of whimsicality, and while these are rather dark stories they still feel effervescent in the mind while you read them. A strange yet ultimately satisfying collection.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,17,134,1,"Sep 28, 2023","Sep 28, 2023","Jul 21, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/123236963-dragon-palace

These 20 stories arrive just under 200pgs, making for bite-sized nightmares coming from all directions. While the stories where the darkness registers as upsetting don’t quite land as well as the stories that are less direct and more generally unsettling, the variety is quite exciting and there are plenty of stories that stick with you to compensate for the ones that fell a bit flat. Though with the range of tales here I suspect each reader will find different ones that really work for them. Wonderfully translated by Sarah Moses, this collection makes a great follow-up for fans of Bazterrica’s Tender is the Flesh who want a wealth of tiny terrors.‘They love one another because they repulse one another.’Bazterrica can find fright anywhere, and the only thing you can truly expect here is the unexpected. The ability to find horror in the everyday reminds me a bit of the magic Stephen King pulls in his early work, where even a sunny afternoon can fracture into trauma or a haunting and you are left feeling nowhere is safe. Such is the opening story, A Light, Swift and Monsterous Sound when a neighbor falling to his death possibly having intended to take the narrator into the grave with him causes a woman to realize nothing is safe. Of the many epigraphs to the stories—which made for excellent commentary on them—perhaps the most informative is the one from Jorge Luis Borges:‘There is an hour of the afternoon when the plain is on the verge of saying something. It never says it, or perhaps it says it infinitely, or perhaps we do not understand it, or we understand it and it is as untranslatable as music.’The best of the stories seem to embody that idea: and unnerving feeling that can’t quite be translated but lingers with you, recontextualizing everything in shades of fear. For me, its the vague stories that don’t need to punctuate the end that I enjoyed most, something I find Brian Evenson is excellent at or how much I enjoyed Ling Ma’s Bliss Montage and her style of unsettling uncertainty. Not that the others won’t be your thing, and there is quite a litany of ways to disturb the reader that comes flying from these pages.In this way I also particularly enjoyed the stories in Nineteen Claws and a Black Bird that dealt with creeping horror that takes hold of your mind. There are stories such as Unamuno’s Boxes with the mindset of seeing everything as a potential true crime story about to unfold or the commentary on ideas of the “ideal body” can lead to toxic behavior obsessions to obtain it in The Continuous Equality of the Circumference where, in a twist, a woman decides ‘she needs her body to take on the round, infinite shape of a circle.’ Though the most predominant theme is the terrors that come from patriarchy and toxic masculinity, often featuring women subjected to gross and sexually driven aggression or assault, so be advised this can be quite the distressing collection. Some work better as a statement through a horror story than others, whereas some I just found to be rather fucked up without much else to say about it. Still, there are some sharp moments, like Roberto where a girl grows a literal rabbit in her pants much to the unexpected shock of her teacher who thought he was getting away with something asking to see it. I did quite enjoy Mary Carminum as well, where a lewd bet between two men lands them at the mercy of a sort of feminist, religious cult that puts them in their place. As earlier stated, the stories worked best for me when the horror arrives from the everyday moments that suddenly turn sinister and unveil a hell on earth. Perhaps this is also why the final story was one of my favorites.‘[E]ach of us is a wolf devouring the other in exquisite eternity.’Agustina Bazterrica’s short story collection Nineteen Claws and a Black Bird is a mixed bag of tales, though there are so many and in such a variety that it still manages to be effective and send shivers down your spine. This does deal with a lot of really heavy themes so reader be advised, though for the most part they manage to tell something greater than the trauma and critique society through the lens of a horror story. Sharp and haunting, this was a worthwhile collection.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,3,183,1,"Jul 20, 2023","Jul 20, 2023","Jul 20, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/62919399-nineteen-claws-and-a-black-bird

Just words or images on a page can transport us to imaginative worlds, instill strong emotions that overcome us and make us laugh, cry, love and dream. While I tend to find graphic adaptations of “classic” novels to be rather hit or miss, Fido Nesti’s 1984 is a real success that brings Orwell’s beloved and eerie novel to life and truly immerses us in the frightening dystopia. This is an artistic journey that stays faithful to the story and delivers uneasy imagery that adds to the story instead of seems just an excuse to have a graphic novel as I sometimes feel these adaptations tend to go. This would be great for hesitant readers who still want to experience Orwell’s work but fans of the original novel (I won’t get into the plot much but I have ed it at length here) will find this a rewarding visual plunge into the darkness of the tale.   [image]Fido Nesti has a really engaging style that is rather cartoonish in a way that doesn’t soften the blow but rather makes it almost more distressing through the grotesque caricatures. Much of the story is done in grey-scale that captures the grimness of the society with light uses of reds and yellows. It gives a very “cold war” vibe while also feeling futuristic and very very dystopian. I particularly liked the use of frames, having many small frames with tight angles on Winston to help express the small, fleeting and dangerous spaces the idea of individuality can occupy. Juxtapose this with the large panels of crowds, particularly the Two Minute Hate or other moments that show the masses as threatening.  [image]This is a very eerie and unsettling rendition and for that I quite enjoyed it. There are long passages from the novel threated through the book, which was a bit jarring but does show much visual and visceral the actual text is without the need of images (though, then it almost seems to ask what is the point of a visual adaptation?) which is cool I guess. Though I had just read the book so it felt unnecessary to me. Still, Nesti manages to dazzle and really bring this story to life in a lovely hardbound edition that is quite large and lovely to hold.

This has notably addressed the entertainment industry, with horror stories surfacing of monsters of anywhere from massive wealth like Harvey Weinstein to niche fame like Ryan Adams abusing and harassing women and many have paused to consider how we process the art of monstrous men (such was the title of Claire Dederer’s viral essay, which you can read here). Into the fray comes Eliza Clarks debut novel, Boy Parts, a first person narration chronicling the spiral into abuse and otherwise unhinged behavior of Irina, a strikingly attractive rising star in the realm of fetish photography. Opting to shoot so-called average looking men she finds on the streets to model for her in work that subverts the male gaze and examines ideas of power and sexuality, Irina has snagged a career changing gallery exhibition in London and sets about revisiting the trajectory of her art, triggering memories that show a history of abuse and struggles in an art world where only the strong survive. Meanwhile, her fixation with a shy Tesco cashier and a head full of drugs are amalgamating into a dangerous cocktail. Sharp, darkly humorous and caustically insightful, Boy Parts is a bold maelstrom of sexuality, violence and power hierarchies that is too engaging to turn away from in horror even as it seeps in and shakes you to the core.‘I look at the photos again, the ones I didn't delete. I look at his purple face, his bloody chin and nipple, his swollen cheek. I wonder what the fuck I have to do for people to recognise me as a threat, you know?’First, shoutout to Emma’s  that inspired me to pick this up immediately, I’m so glad I did. Clark manages to make a feverish descent to hell into a thrill ride where we clutch the page like the harness on a roller coaster and spend the whole trip both screaming and laughing. This shakes you around like a rag doll and you love it as you begin to see Boy Parts as your dominant partner and while you are going to get pleasure you are also going to get pain. She takes you down the tracks of her prose so effortlessly, balancing the action of parties, photoshoots and…well, completely unhinged moments that often involve shards of glass, with the softer, introspective times revisiting Irina’s history in the classroom and behind the camera. She captures dialogue and regional accents as if she bottled it up from the air and pinned it to the page where, still fresh and alive, it squirms in discomfort as much as the reader. The sections written as text messages are amusing as well, with drunk misspellings or autocorrect mistakes that felt true to life. There are some laugh out loud lines, such as describing Timothée Chalamet as ‘ that white-bread, absolute fucking baguette of a lad from Call Me by Your Name’ (I texted photos of that page to several friends), and I was obsessed with Irina’s obsession with Lord of the Rings: ‘He eats loudly, reminding me of that bit in The Return of the King (the film) where Denethor is eating cherry tomatoes, and making Pippin sing for him. In this metaphor—allegory?—I guess I’m Pippin, which is strange because I’ve never identified much with the Hobbits before, and I’m actually a little annoyed that this is the position I’m in. Shocked to hear it comes in pints, and wondering if my simple Hobbit songs are good enough for these grand halls and their talking toilets.’Yea, of course I’m going to love a book that rattles off lines like this. Boy Parts is an impressive debut that, considering the subject matter, reads like she just punched out the scariest person in prison on the first day.The book has drawn comparisons with Ottessa Moshfegh’s My Year of Rest and Relaxation as well as American Psycho by Bret Easton Ellis (the latter most notably during a delightfully disturbing scene when sudden violence in a fancy restaurant for extremely wealthy conservatives has people more concerned if the staff will comp their meal for witnessing violence than actually concerned about the violence), though with a woman instead of Bateman. Not unlike Psycho we do see this as a criticism on wealth and consumerism as one of the themes—amusingly, Irina gets termed as a ‘working-class’ artist despite being able to afford fancy universities something she has an uneasy relationship with seeing it as both an insult but not upset it can help open doors for her—and, well, the violence and unreliable narration. Is Irina actually truthful to what she not only tells us, but tells herself as well? Is all of this happening? The book this felt closest to for me, however, is the ideas in Roberto Bolaño’s Distant Star and how art can have moral boundaries that, when crossed, becomes evil. Here we have Irina, a tall, intimidating redhead criticized by her professor, lesbian art icon and former lover, Frank, for having ‘had a contemptuous attitude towards my models. I clearly saw them as interchangeable, disposable objects.’ This is not unlike the depiction of the poet-turned-murderer in Distant Star, who uses actual photos of women he killed as an art exhibit that even distresses his fellow fascists, that he ‘looked down on the world as if he were standing on top of a volcano; he saw you and me and himself from a great height, and, in his eyes, we were all, to be quite frank, pathetic insects.’ If abuse is leading to the photographs Irina takes, is the art somehow tainted by this? And whew, does some alarming things happen to get the shots she wants.‘Consuming a piece of art is two biographies meeting: the biography of the artist that might disrupt the viewing of the art; the biography of the audience member that might shape the viewing of the art.’--Claire Dederer, Monsters: A Fan's DilemmaKey to this book are the gazes into power structures that shatters any rose colored glasses they might try to hide behind. ‘Whether I’m in control or losing it, I’ve always had a power thing,’ Irina admits, and this is central to her art. Clark brings us into the world of fetish art and kink sexualities and explores how those with power over others very often abuse it. The whole absolute power corrupts absolutely maxim may come to mind, though Clark is also careful to show how just because this story is about abuse doesn’t mean that all kink or dom/sub relationships are inherently abusive and harmful. As mentioned earlier, the recent years have been a litany of men in positions of power in the art world being exposed for using this power to assault and silence women, though we also know this has occurred throughout time with big names such as Picasso or Edward Hopper abusing their muses, and Andy Warhol has often been criticized for exploiting those around him. Clark is probing some interesting ideas of power and gender by reversing the gender roles with Irina being the intimidating role using her power to exploit her models. And hit them. ‘What about any of that read as safe, sane or consensual?’ she even admits to herself, yet sort of loves the power over these men. And not just men, but even Flo, her best (only?) friend and former lover that she keeps around to take care of her (okay, I sort of loved Flo, she really meant well and I felt bad for her). Now the idea of reversing gender in this sort of power hierarchy isn’t new—I quite enjoyed Azareen Van der Vliet Oloomi exploring this in Fra Keeler—but I quite liked how this touches on ideas of “woke culture” and how society will overlook abuse if they find a way to look at it as subversive. There is a moment when Flo tries to find a way to look at buying heterosexual, exploitive porn by men into a queer act of disruption where even the lesbian feminist professor can only roll her eyes in embarrassment. Its why books such as In the Dream House by Carmen Maria Machado have been talked about as important for reminding people that abuse can happen even in relationships that we are championing. Like yes, protect queer relationships and let us be considered legal and normal, but also yes abuse can happen in them and we shouldn’t allow people to suffer in silence. ‘and that gets sewn into them young, doesn’t it? Violence.’Irina represents a lot of power abuse, such as how being photographed by her is framed as an honor to these men. Such as the unhoused boy who possibly meets a bad end who should “feel thankful” for a place to stay and a starring role in her art. Clark has a sharp eye for the ways people try to represent themselves and there are some great insights into behavior in this book, and how Irina is able to hone in on it and exploit it. Even Eddie from Tesco, her “muse” in this book (and a lot of this is why muse culture is so toxic and exploitative) admits he comes across like an INCEL and can’t believe someone who looks like Irina would be interested in him. Yet for all the power Irina exhibits over others, there is still the aspect of a patriarchal society she works within and how dangerous it is for women. Men lash out at her and she is often in danger (her works bring out a LOT of bad behavior from the men) and some of the violence is legitimate self-defense. There is also a lot of looking at how men with money can elbow their way into anything despite mediocrity, that there is ‘still this entitled, still this generic, still this wealth of privilege and connections filling a void where there should be talent,’ and when they don’t get what they want they lash out. Often violently.  ‘If we were playing rock, paper, scissors, but it’s camera, toxic masculinity, skull — camera wins’I couldn’t put this book down. And when I had to do so for life reasons, I thought about it the whole time. Boy Parts is a distressing novel, but one that probes really important questions about power, sexuality and violence, and does so in a way that will have you laughing as much as you are cringing. I especially appreciate the ending and that Clark understands the conclusion of themes is vastly more effective than a tidy ending with a full stop as it allows Irina and her shenanigans to play out further in your mind long after the book concludes. The trigger warnings on this would be a mile long and this isn't for the faint of heart, but it is a wickedly well done ride. The writing is sharp and so is the social commentary and I will definitely read anything Eliza Clark puts out next.4.5/5‘Nothing matters, and nothing lasts.

Keegan can do more in a few, quiet pages than most can in a full novel, carefully constructing heartfelt investigations delicately layered with subtle nuance and dialogue so crisp you practically hear it more than read it. Antarctica, her first collection published in 1999 demonstrates Keegan’s skills already swinging strong across a variety of tales full of infidelities, deaths, sexuality and grief populated by flawed, dynamic characters struggling against the pressures of a patriarchy. Though most stories come in around 10 pages, they radiate with life and emotion even beyond the rather muted depictions and feel so full, well crafted and engaging that you’ll swear they must be twice their size. Gorgeous and often rather haunting, Antarctica is not just an impressive debut but a stunning collection overall propelled by fluid writing and crisp storytelling.‘She thought of Antarctica, the snow and ice and the bodies of dead explorers. Then she thought of hell, and then eternity.’Keegan’s writing is so sharp you’ll swear you could cut your finger on it. Like a spider with words as her welcoming web, she grabs the reader with the rather soft writing and astonishing imagery only for them to discover they’re fully trapped in the glory of her creations too late to dodge the emotional blows that sneak up on you. Such is the case with the title story—which makes for one of the finest opening tales I’ve read in a long time—about a woman who heads to the city with the goal of having a brief affair with a stranger. While you have a general unease about the situation, it isn’t until you’ve let your guard down that the ending strikes with such sudden ferocity it practically leaves you gasping for breath. She has such an economical use of words whiles threads ideas back and forth through the tales like a slight of hand trick where you watch in awe then finally realize the trap she has sprung. While these stories often end in surprising ways, it is less a gimmick sort of twist and more a sudden earthquake that you’ve felt coming but never expected to leave the living room of your heart so suddenly rent asunder. Like the tale of the two women in Sisters, one dutiful and one indulgent, having a sudden abrupt turn that returns everything to rest in a surprising but altogether earned and fitting conclusion, or The Singing Cashier which deals with men lustfully preying on vulnerable women and ends with the realization the two sisters had been within the grasps of another evil living down the street from the real-life Fred West murders of young girls. This isn’t to say they are always tidy endings, such as Love in the Tall Grass leaving us with the tension reaching an emotional peak in the most surprising and heartbreaking way.‘It’s always married people who cry at weddings. They know the difference between the vows and the life.’Throughout many of these stories we see the way patriarchal values are harmful and keep women trapped. Though one of the prevailing themes through the collection is that of shaking oneself free of such things, such as in Quare Name for a Boy—an extraordinary story where a young, pregnant woman realizes she can have the baby without continuing with the one-night-stand man she feels nothing for anymore—when the narrator thinks ‘I will not be the woman who shelters her man same as he’s a boy. That part of my people ends with me,’ as if she were a character from fellow Irish writer Eavan Boland’s poetry. Men and Women features a young girl and her mother at the mercy of the father’s moods, though a refusal to give him the satisfaction of their suffering leads to a reckoning. However, the oppressions of patriarchy is shown to not only harm the women but occasionally the men as well, such as in Passport Soup where a father’s grief over the loss of his child is only compounded by his “failures” as a man and provider.‘Together, they will confront their past, the source of all their trouble, and stamp it out. That, at least, is the theory.’Sexuality and infidelity run through many of these crisp tales as well, with Love in the Tall Grass being one of my favorites in the full collection. Keegan’s expertise at symbolism comes at full force here, such as the doctor’s (with whom the narrator has an affair) watch portentously ticking down time (‘irreversibly ticking’), or that she ‘thinks Judas Iscariot a beautiful name’ early in a story that will become about betrayal. Most notable, however, is the final story, The Ginger Rogers Sermon, a story with such an splendidly strong sense of voice and utterly shocking ending to a tale about the budding sexuality of a young girl and being raised around her father’s lumberjack business and the charming giant of a man, Slapper Jim, that she finds herself drawn toward. Speaking of voice, Keegan has such a pitch perfect ear for dialogue. The Irish stories feel so distinctly Irish in the phrasing but I was surprised to find many of the tales take place in the southern United States. Stories such as the rather distressing Ride if You Dare are alive in southern dialect, something Keegan picked up on during her time at Loyola University in New Orleans, Louisiana. ‘That's the way it is in our house, everybody knowing things but pretending they don't.’Keegan is an extraordinary writer and her first collection, Antarctica, is an early promise of the great things to come. With any collection one should expect some highs and lows amongst the stories and this is no different though the highs certainly outnumber the lows. Her writing is so crisp it’s like taking a bite out of a head of lettuce and these stories are so fine tuned and succinct it is nearly miraculous. It is no surprise books like the novella Foster (a favorite of mine) are so concise with maximum emotional resonance when she writes short, short stories like these so eloquently. Antarctica is a gem and I can’t get enough Claire Keegan.4.5/5...more",Notes are private!,7,206,1,"Jul 14, 2023","Jul 14, 2023","Jul 14, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/492459.Antarctica

Those who, like myself, have been dazzled by Keegan’s novellas (I’d rate Foster as my favorite book I read last year) will not be surprised to learn she began her career writing short stories where she refined her seemingly preternatural skills of brief, poetic simplicity that slices straight to an emotional core. So Late in the Day is a sampler plate of sorts, offering three stories from the span of her career that highlights the best of her abilities. The stories collected here offer a much grittier vision than her two novellas and hone in on the struggles of women under a patriarchal society. Keegan excels at crafting a story where the dark shadows of humanity are lurking within stories delivered with idyllic imagery and gorgeous phrases, of people ‘carrying smoothly on, despite the tangle of human conflicts and the knowledge of how everything must end.’ This is an excellent introduction to Keegan’s short stories and a window into the incredible amount of insights and social criticisms she can neatly fold into a tiny space.‘You know what is at the heart of misogyny? When it comes down to it?...it’s simply about not giving…whether it’s not giving us the vote or not giving help with the dishes—it’s all clitched to the same wagon.’The three stories here are well chosen to represent the versatility and grace of Keegan’s work though I wish there were more in this small volume, particularly as only one story was new to me. It begins with the title story that was first printed in The New Yorker in 2022 (I ed the story at length HERE) , and the other two being from her collections Walk the Blue Fields and Antarctica (if you are interested, I ed the latter HERE). But as always, Keegan bewitches the reader with her words. Her sentences feel like you could unpack them and have a lush green field roll forth from the vowels, trees sprouting from each noun, and verbs becoming a sweet spring wind and rain. It feels much like the description of her writer character in the second story:‘She had made the incision in place and time, and infused it with a climate, and longing. There was earth and fire and water on these pages; there was a man and a woman and human loneliness, disappointment.’With such an economy of language she brings the world and characters into our minds as so alive with their fears, frustrations, hopes and dreams.‘‘She thought of Antarctica, the snow and ice and the bodies of dead explorers. Then she thought of hell, and then eternity.’’There is a theme of interpersonal communications between men and women here, often demonstrating how women are objectified, looked down upon or treated as property and how misogyny can be passed down generationally with sons falling into step with the behaviors of their fathers. The title story deals with this rather directly, with Cathal, despite vowing to break the cycle, ending up driving his love away when his fears and fragility get the best of him. Sabrine must reflect him back upon himself in order for him to realize the reality of his behaviors and must of the story deals with the emotional as well as physical labors that burden women that men just assume they should carry.‘‘At least half of men your age just want us to shut up and give you what you want, that you’re spoiled and become contemptible when things don’t go your way.’In many of Keegan’s stories we see how the inability of the men to productively process and address their emotions becomes another emotional burden women must shoulder. Cathals insistence that ‘if things have not ended badly, they have not ended,’ is also a stark reminder that  the most dangerous time for a women is when she leaves her partner, with 75% of all domestic assaults occurring during a separation. Much of this stems from a belief of women as property, which we see in the chilling twist of the final story, Antarctica, where what begins as simple fun for a woman looking for an extramarital good time turns into something nightmarishly sinister. In this story, Keegan does an excellent job of disarming the reader, making you feel the initial unease but then lulling you into a feeling of comfort until the twist strikes. The idea of women seen as property is also represented in the second story, The Long and Painful Death, where there are multiple references to men not wanting women to own land. In her book The Second Sex, French feminist and existentialist philosopher Simone de Beauvoir spends an entire chapter drawing a direct line from property ownership of land to the social assumptions of husbands possessing their wives like legal property in which the woman has no say. In the story, the narrator is living in the former home of Heinrich Böll on a writer’s residency when she is intruded upon by a professor who wishes to see the house. He is overtly dismayed to find a woman residing in Böll’s residence who would spend time baking cakes or enjoying a swim, as if a woman’s leisure between periods of writing is a direct attack on the legacy of Böll. That she is unwed is also certainly seen by him as a slight against all men, and here we can see Keegan approach the idea that unwed women without children who write are seen as frivolous and obscene whereas for a man to do the same is the height of literary genius.Keegan is a master of short stories and, while it would have been nice to see more new work, So Late in the Day is a lovely little collection. This would make an excellent introduction to Keegan and I would highly recommend checking out her full short story collections as well. With so little, Keegan can create so much. 4.5/5...more",Notes are private!,10,234,1,not set,not set,"Jul 14, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/126262032-so-late-in-the-day

Through finely crafted tone he can send a shiver down your spine or instill anxiety through atmosphere alone, often leaving his short tales to haunt you long after you’ve resurfaced from his distressed domains. A literary horror author at heart, Evenson often transports us to sci-fi futures, such as in his newest tale, After the Animal Flesh Beings, examining a post-human future that grapples with the meaning of life even in a world where “life” as we know it has ceased to be. Blasting melancholy through this wasteland of robotic beings scrounging for a purpose under a dying god, Evenson delivers five linked stories that build a portrait of this somber society through cautionary tales that read much like futuristic fables about the “children” the beings have their god craft for them. Evenson is at the height of his skills here, using his glimpses to allow our imaginations to imply a much larger society and navigating us through their muted despair while also building towards some truly haunting moments and images that are sure to linger.‘There are those who believe we were once those animal flesh beings but that, as more and more gleaming children were made, we became such deft mimics as to become gleaming beings ourselves, so as to better resemble our children, so as to blend in.’I really love this lugubrious landscape of robots digging in wreckage for parts that their god will construct into children. There is this sense of resignation to them, that the best is behind them—the people of animal flesh, presumably humans, have finally made the planet inhabitable and taken off into space where there is a fleeting hope they will return someday—and they are trapped in a state of slow decay where even their god is beginning to crumble before them. It can be assumed these beings are some sort of AI with robotic innards, and while they can not actually continue their species, they try to inject some purpose by creating sad children to give them something to care for.‘Our children do not speak, and cannot hear. They can see, usually, and often do respond to gestures. They can be taught simple tasks. They move and walk, but with little of the fluidity with which an adult is imbued. Having been snatched back from the embrace of death, they move jerkily, as if in spasms. Nor do they live nearly as long as we do. Many generations of children we have created might well pass away before we succumb to death ourselves.’It’s all rather unsettling, but best are the few horror stories they tell, such as one of a sort of child serial killer robot removing part for his own dark purposes, or a rather fairy tale deal made with strict conditions and consequences. The pervasive sadness and wasteland atmosphere makes for a rather haunting tone and reminded me a bit of the video game Stray. This is one that sticks with you.‘Why did these animal flesh beings make us? Did they think of us as their children, despite our being made of a different substance entirely? Did they have another purpose for us?’Evenson is always a sure bet for the eerie and After the Animal Flesh Beings certainly delivers. If you’d like, you can read it in full here. I’ve enjoyed how his recent works have a big theme of climate crisis, which we see hitned at here, and are becoming more and more sci-fi infused.

In all fairness to this graphic adaptation, I read this in a world where a perfect visual adaptation already exists from the incredible Henry Selick. I absolutely adore Neil Gaiman’s Coraline (read my  here). The story is a masterful mix of menacing and magical, driving us fearfully along through a story that is ultimately heartwarming and empowering. Coraline Jones is one of my favorite heroines of children’s fiction as well. This adaptation from P. Craig Russell captures the original story quite well in terms of plot, but when it comes to art and atmosphere I found it rather flat and lifeless, missing that dark, gloomy gothic aspect that Selick expertly tapped into and blended up with whimsical grotesqueries. Gaiman must have some trust in him, as they have worked together on several occasions, so perhaps its just me. This is a fun adaptation still that would be perfect for hesitant readers and is just another enjoyable way to revisit Gaiman’s classic tale, but of the various versions this one feels lackluster comparatively.

The colors seem very bland and just aren’t that pleasing of a palette. Nothing really pops, everything feels a bit dull and its almost too bright for the tale. Selick plunged us into a velvety darkness, but nothing in this gives you the feeling of floorboards creaking or eyes watching you from the shadows. I will admit Other Mother is terrifying as she should be but just…could be better?  [image]I mean it’s fine, it’s whatever, it just has a rather 90s vibe but not in a good way.

Such are the concerns in Jenna Clake’s unsettling debut novel, Disturbance, where the unnamed narrator finds the past doesn’t always stay dead. Befriending her teenage neighbor in hopes of freeing her from the abusive trap she sees in the younger girl’s off-and-on-again relationship with a boy who treats her cruelly, the narrator and teenager play at witchcraft to ward off their respective former boyfriends. But instead of expelling him, she is assailed by constant memories of his abuse to the point where her flat itself seems out to get her. Clake’s work as a poet is evident in the way she infuses such emotion and fluidity into her prose that spirals us through this chilling portrait of an abuse survivor. Perhaps the most disturbing aspects of Disturbance is the way it navigates the course of both emotional abuse and all the horrific manipulation, gaslighting and isolating that occurs, the kind that doesn’t leave bruises on the skin but can bruise one’s sense of self and emotional state for years to come. It is an important subject to address as 1 in 3 women experience physical violence by a partner during their lifetime with women age 18 to 24 experiencing it most commonly. Disturbance is a story that reads like a poignant cacophony of images and events that illuminate a very real tragedy that afflicts women all over, and Clake handles the story with grace as we hold our breath in the face of ghosts that haunting the mind that are more fearsome than any apparition could ever be.‘I knew how sinister surprises can be’While Disturbance is a horror story, it is not one in the way you expect. While there are suspenseful moments of things that go bump in the night and a literal monster central to the story, it is more of a psychological bent and the monster dresses in work clothes and hangs out with his buddies at the bar while texting women who aren’t his girlfriend. This can be a very triggering story with all the focus on emotional and physical abuse by an intimate partner (and, by proxy, this  may be because of that and if this is a concern in your own life, there are international resources for help I encourage you to check out) , but this is a horror story that befalls women everywhere. 55% of all homicides against women are committed by an intimate partner and 89% are committed by men they knew. As is shown in the novel, it is not always easy to leave an abusive situation as the most dangerous time is right after leaving a partner. 75% of domestic violence related homicides occur during a separation and there is a 75% increase of violence for at least two years after the separation. Most distressing is homicide by an abusive intimate partner during a separation increases by 500% if the partner has access to a firearm. Not to be disturbing, just that is an important factor to note not just going into this book but to be aware of in society in general. I really enjoyed how much this story occurs in the atmosphere of the everyday. An aspect of horror Stephen King excels at is placing terror in situations that should otherwise seem safe in a horror story—like a sunny afternoon or public place—and Clake deftly captures that vibe. Around our narrator is a seemingly idyllic summer (there are mentions of children laughing while playing with hoses and other warm, summery depictions) and I love that there is a subplot threaded through of neighbors renovating a house and being all excited to show the narrator their updates (which touches on the aspects of social media I’ll discuss in a moment), yet we find her hidden inside her small flat physically ill from anxiety and seeing everything around her as threatening. But are the lights flickering due to a supernatural menace or is the bulb simply burning out? We see how there is a very real PTSD from abusive relationships that reconfigure our perceptions on reality and make a person wary of almost anything. Even Eddie, her new friend from work, who is nothing but affable and supportive, gives her fears she has acted poorly in ways that will make him lash out against her. Eddie is such a sweetheart and I adore him, and I especially appreciate that Clake shows how adult men and women can be supportive and caring of each other in ways that aren’t expressly romantic or even need to lead to romance. ‘I felt like I was living in the stomach of some awful creature.’Central to the story is the narrator’s relationship with Chelsea, the teenage neighbor. When she witnesses Chelsea performing a ritual to ward off her boyfriend during one of the breakups, the narrator decides to investigate witchcraft and try it herself. She falls ill after her attempt and suddenly her living space seems hostile. ‘The flat had a constant aura of an impending visitor,’ she observes and the eerie sounds and flood of memories about her ex-boyfriend makes her ‘worried if he’d died and was haunting me or learned where I lived and cursed the flat.’ But is it witchcraft or are the teen girls she befriends merely playing at witchcraft. I do really love these characters, they feel so real and in their short spaces personify youthful struggles in such an effective way. Chelsea’s boyfriend is indeed a piece of shit but we also have to wonder if the narrator is taking a map of her own abuse and super-imposing it over what she assums is Chelsea’s situation. Iit should be noted, however, that even if a boy isn’t physically violent he can still be abusive and something like trying to make her jealous with other girls or being generally dismissive is not okay either—people can just be bad for you without there having to be any dramatic scar to show.‘I could right things if I tired. I had the power to do that.’It is fascinating to watch the narrator try to find empowerment and always feeling it is the wrong fit. She feels ‘too big’ for the chair in the therapist office which is not unlike feeling too old to hang with Chelsea and Jess. But she craves something that will make her feel in control, hence the attraction to the teen girls fixation with witchcraft. ‘She looked powerful, untouchable,’ she thinks about Jess during one of their spell attempts, ‘and I wanted to believe that I would be to if I did this and it worked.’ I think this plays into how there has been a large resurgence of interest in witchcraft: it is symbolic of women’s empowerment but it also an avenue to feel one can have control over the chaos in life. With the religion of past generations one would pray to ask for assistance whereas with witchcraft you feel you are taking matters into your own hands, which makes you feel powerful and I see how this enhances feelings of self worth. Which is especially enticing to someone with unhealthy struggles with self worth. While the magic may not actually work out here, it sort of functions as the narrator’s first attempt to believe in themselves, and that is cool. I also really appreciated the ways Clake makes you unsure for awhile if this is a book where magic will exist or not, something I recently loved about The Last Tale of the Flower Bride and found effectively used again here.In her memories, we see a narrative of abuse that is sadly altogether too common. He isolates her from her friends by claiming they are mean to him (attacking her for not respecting his past of being bullied when she tries to dispute this), and only allows her to exist in a world he can control with mutual friends who tell her not to hurt him because he is “such a nice guy.” She knows the truth but it is a truth he keeps hidden from the world.‘I felt as if though I had loved with two people: the boyfriend from before we lived together, and the one who appeared the last box came inside, when the front door was closed.’He stays out late, accuses her of causing any bad mood, calls her stupid, and makes her feel she is unbearable and that everything is her fault. We also see one of the biggest move in an abuser’s playbook: DARVO, which stands for deny, attack, reverse victim and offender. He portrays their relationship to her in a way that makes her question her every action and feel she wouldn’t be abused (both emotionally and physically) ‘if I just behaved.’ She has no allies in this situation as he navigates every social moment to portray her as unhinged and their friends nod knowingly when they fight as if he is the victim despite her not even knowing why he is attacking her. And amidst all this, she dare not question the barrage of texts from unknown women, because, as as the great Beyonce sang: ‘whats worst, looking jealous or crazy?’ Because society only seems to allow women to be seen as one or the other in the face of a cheating partner.Another point that should be stressed is this can happen to anyone. It is brushed off in society far too often that it occurs to women who can’t stick up for themselves but this is far from true. I think Trevor Noah said it best when he explained something his mother once said, that abusive men usually don’t ‘[fall] in love with subservient women. He's attracted to independent women. He's like an exotic bird collector, he only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.’ Not recognizing this is how a lot of abuse slips through the cracks or gets dismissed as attention grabbing or lies. We need to do better. You begin to see why the narrator is never named: she doesn’t feel she deserves one even in her own narrative. She assesses every situation as if she is the problem, always second guesses herself, always assumes that in every interaction the other person will likely respond angrily because she is incapable of interacting appropriately. And we have to experience the narrative in this way because of the scars from her abusive relationship. Even her biggest breakthrough revelation ‘he wanted to make me feel unstable and I had let him,’ internalizes blame in the second half. She sees that he was abusive but feels ‘I permitted boundaries to be blurred.’ Which, NO, it is not your fault, he made you feel that way. Clake can truly capture this dilemma and it is more unsettling and sad than any goblin or ghastly ghost could do.‘These exchanges felt rehearsed as though they were replaying scenes from a drama with dialogue that wasn’t real. It was an act that happened many times.’This is a horror novel without needing to resort to the fantastical because monsters live among us and society often manipulates us into giving them the benefit of the doubt. Society is manipulated by them as well, causing us to give ‘himpathy’ to abusers—a term coined by philosopher Kate Manne to denote the excessive sympathy shown toward male perpetrators of sexual violence, especially at the expense of the women who are their victims. Disturbance is indeed a disturbing tale, one where a haunting occurs but it might be less ghosts in the walls but ghosts in the mind. This is an incredible debut, with writing that hits all its marks and keeps a delicate balance of questioning if the occurances are supernatural or not just as much as the narrator herself wonders. Abuse from intimate partners is a real and horrifying issue, and Clake handles the issue quite effectively while highlighting a story of how this occurs and the terrifying lasting effects from it all. Disturbing but ultimately an engaging novel that will have you gripping the pages with distress, Disturbance hits all the high marks it sets for itself.4.5/5...more",Notes are private!,0,111,1,"Jul 11, 2023","Jul 11, 2023","Jul 11, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/62586005-disturbance

Combining playful romantic friction with a narrative of the dark side that lurks under any society that presents itself as a utopia and the dangers of probing the mysteries keeping it hidden, Project Nought is a fast paced and blissfully nuanced tale with twists that keep you guessing and friendships that will melt your heart.  [image]What possibilities will the future hold for us, not only technologically but socially as well? Back in 1996, Ren feared being gay and had to keep it hidden to fit in so there is something really lovely about seeing him feel free to thrive in a very queer-positive community in 2122. This book has a fairly inclusive cast, with almost entirely queer characters and plenty of lovely non-binary representation able to be out in the open and living their lives without anyone even questioning the normality of it. 2122 is a world very much plugged into social media as well, with technology being a large part of their lives in a society that seems to be thriving. At least on the surface. But, as with most sci fi narratives—SURPISE!—there is something sinister going on with the time travel exchange program. What happened to Ren when he first arrived, and what happened to the students they claimed were sent back to their timelines without any memory of their visit to 2122?This story takes a lot of exciting turns and if the start seems a bit confusing, just hold tight and enjoy how your sense of confusion and unease matches that of the characters. Ferudi nails the narrative quite well, with excellent pacing and keeping the tension and mystery high. I also enjoyed how it is a unique take on time travel, one that deals primarily with the effects of the science on society and not trying to get overly into the mechanics. Allowing students to meet people from the past seems great, but at what cost? It also seems to touch on how we tend to have a hindsight bias that makes us sort of infantilize people from the past, and here we see how the supposed honor of being selected to see the future (but not remember it) is supposed to gloss over how traumatic it is and the fact that they are being used more as test subjects than people. But what shines best here is the character dynamics and I really, really loved all these characters. Mars is so energetic and adorable but Phoebe is my fav. The way they all come together and fight for each other is lovely. And most fun of all are the two podcasters who are threaded through the story to comment on the events and provide exposition like a sort of Greek Chorus:  [image]Furedi’s art is a joy to behold as well. She excels at use of color and constructs a lot of the tone and atmosphere through her color palettes. The character designs are really fun too and there is a nice emphasis on their fashion that nods to the looks of the 90s and how that might look in 100 years designing fashion based on those aesthetics. The frame work is great and conveys a lot of action and keeps the story moving. This is just a lovely book in general.  [image]There is sci-fi fun, friendship and romance abound in Project Nought.

It is a tale much pondered over by great thinkers and artists, reconfigured on the stage as political statements addressing a current moment many times through history, and here exists in the always inventive Anne Carson’s “translation” Antigonick. Translation seems loosely applied, as it is more of a metatextual retelling in minimalism, often humorous, beautifully bizarre and explosively emotional. Though it is not just the story that is delightful but this is a gorgeously crafted physical book as well, with handwritten dialogue and abstract art pieces by Bianca Stone (I adored her poetry collection What is Otherwise Infinite) on thin translucent sheets between the text. Carson gives Antigone the Badass Revolutionary Girl Summer she deserves, and I love it. Meant to be read in a single sitting but certainly thought provoking far beyond a single reading, Antigonick is another exquisite example of Carson’s inexhaustible creativity and craft.‘you want us to listen to the sound of what happenswhen everything normalmusicalcarefulconventional or piousis taken away … dear AntigoneI take it as the task of the translatorto forbid that you should ever lose your screams.’Following one of Carson’s most personal and emotional works, Nox, which is a recreation of her scrapbook dealing with the death of her brother, Carson released Antigonick which revisits the grief over the death of a brother. Like Nox, the hardcover volume here also has a nearly handmade appearance and is notable for the strange surreal drawings that appear almost jarringly against the text and make this a dynamic work of art beyond just the text. With the translucent pages, the art and words nearly obfuscate one another, juxtaposing the tale with nearly incongruous symbols superimposed, much like the way various symbolic interpretations of the text and characters have existed almost independently of the original story. The visuals also often appears completely independent of the story, though also occasionally reference the original text, such as the wild horses seem to nudge the metaphor Kreon uses about breaking women that does not appear in Carson’s telling. It is all rather odd and seemingly random, which I find rather charming simply for the oddity of it all and how lovely it is as a book that is also a functional piece of art.The story itself moves at a fast pace—especially considering major events happen in passing of character dialogue I suspect this is one you’d want some general familiarity with the original tale before reading—and constantly cuts directly to the heart of matters with little adornment. It is as if the tale itself is heeding Antigone’s snarky request ‘can we just get this over with?’ But Carson is a poet and extracting vast meaning from the most minimal of linguistic space is something she excels at, building characters with mere lines and bypassing anything that doesn’t feel like it is bestowing climactic-like energy to each scene. Antigone especially is brimming with passion and fury. ‘You are a person in love with the impossible,’ Ismene admonishes Antigone, pleading with her ‘don’t cross the line…girls can’t force their way against men.’ Carson shortcuts right to characterization with choice words, such as how Kreon—cruising around in his “powerboat” as a play on his phrase “ship of State”—is quickly constructed through his list of the day’s verbs (Legislate and Scandalize among them) and nouns (Treason, Death and Mine for instance) like a quick profile. Other fun plays on words is Antigone mentioning she is lonely inside herself, poking at her fate of being sealed alone inside a cave.Antigone is sharp and direct with Kreon, creating a strong rebuke of authoritarian rule where she notes ‘they all think like me / but you’ve nailed their tongues to the floor.’ When the blind prophet, Teiresias, enters he looks to the Chorus instead of Kreon to declare ‘Hail, King of Thebes’ as a reminder the power is in the people and not the King, lest he is a tyrant. Antigone, well aware of her position in history as a figure of rebellion, or as a terrorist, or a feminist symbol, riffs on the uses of herself, such as the play adaptation by Bertolt Brecht set in World War II where Antigone goes ‘the whole play with a door strapped to [her] back’, one she cannot enter, or Jean Anouilh’s 1944 adaptation staged as a symbol of the French resistance. Antigone will quote Hegel via Samuel Beckett, observe Jacques Lacan’s idea of Antigone as ‘between two deaths’, or Judith Butler who finds her ‘the occasion for a new field of the human’ and wrote Antigone's Claim: Kinship Between Life and Death where she observes that Antigone upsets gender traditions through her role that would traditionally be expected to be a man and, with Eurydike’s mention of finding Antigone a therapist, questions if we had taken Antigone instead of Oedipus as the departure of psychoanalysis. It is a rather academic text at heart, and rather playful with its allusions, something the Chorus enjoys as it jokes about Greek Myths and their use as precedent in storytelling:‘Chorus: how is a Greek chorus like a lawyerthey’re both in the business of searching for a precedentfinding an analogylocating a prior exampleso as to be able to saythis terrible thing we’re witnessing now isnot unique you know it happened beforeor something much like it’In a way, this becomes sort of a commentary on translation in general. While one certainly wouldn’t mistake this as a direct translation, much of the aspects, such as the aforementioned historical critiques on the original tale, remind us of things a translator would inevitably be aware of in translating the work. It shows how the book fits into the world and speaks to the society of the time, and how translating requires deciding on word choices that must navigate how you feel best respects the work while still acknowledging it as a piece being told in the present but written long in the past. Carson updates the language to current times, with Antigone feeling rather modern herself with snarky responses such as when Kreon asks if she is the one who touched the body, Antigone spits out ‘BINGO.’ Surely this is not something Sophocles’ Antigone would or could say, but this single word establishes a lot about her character and attitude in a modern context. I suspect level of enjoyment of classics refigured with modern aesthetics (it is clear electricity exists in this version, so it is presumably more modern times) will be something a readers experience will hinge on.Most curious of all the cast is Nick, a silent part that spends the entire play on stage measuring things. Nick comes to bear many meanings, such as a broken off piece of statue or the phrase ‘nick of time,’ and Carson observes the story of Antigone as one very much about timing. Particularly of the timing being too late and Kreon coming to ‘wisdom’ just too late once everyone has died. It is better to learn too late, she implies, than never at all, yet the body count is now high, Kreon has abandoned himself entirely (‘he no more exists than someone who does not exist’) and yet Nick--or time--goes on unbothered, always measuring. ‘I am born for love not hatred.’Always inventive and unique, Anne Carson yet again dazzles in her playfulness with Antigonick. A dizzying little play that Carson directs towards maximum effect with minimal space, it is one to read again and again.4.5/5'But of course there is hope look here comes hope / wandering in / to tickle your feet // Then you notice the soles are on fire.'...more",Notes are private!,0,110,1,not set,not set,"Jul 09, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13305951-antigonick

If ever there is aEven the minor works of Fyodor Dostoevsky have a profound and dynamic psychological inquiry that always reaches deep into my heart. If ever there is a day that feels like a piece of stale toast, Dostoevsky’s writing is butter and jam that soaks in and makes it delicious again. An early work written in 1848, An Honest Thief delivers many of Dostoevsky’s characteristic themes in their early stages in this tale of a kindly man struggling with his fatherly relationship with a man reduced to alcoholism and petty theft. Following his first novel, Poor Folk, Dostoevsky continues with his humanitarian representation of the poorer classes and the way they must survive feeling discarded from society, often with a sort of “found family” such as between lodgers like Astafy Ivanovich and Emelyan here. Heartfelt and redemptive, there is a sentimental sincerity that shines beyond the sadness of the tale and an excellent psychological portrait of custodianship and guilt.  [image]Depiction of An Honest Man by greek painter Photis KontoglouSomething I’ve always quite enjoyed in the short stories of Russian literature is the way the narration is often nested inside another story. Here we have three degrees of separation from the author, opening to a story of the narrator taking in Astafy Ivanovich as a lodger. But when a theft of his coat occurs and Astafy cannot catch the thief, he begins his tale about an—you guessed it!—honest thief that becomes the primary focus of the short work. Dostoevsky is far from the first to employ this nested narrative technique, certainly learning it himself from the works of his major influences, Nikolai Gogol and Alexander Pushkin, who also embedded tales within tales. I enjoy how this style frames tales as secondhand stories and shows how a tale acts upon the world in which it was told or provides context to a character in a larger story. Dostoevsky seems experimenting with it here, and quite successfully so.‘When a man is guilty, you know, sir, he scents trouble far off, like the birds of the air before a storm.’This tale of a guilty conscience feels a precursor to that of Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment, and the “accidental family,” such as that of Astafy and Emelyn, is a theme he would continue to create variations on all the way up to The Adolescent (titled Accidental Family in the Richard Freeborn translation). We see both men suffering with the conscience, Astafy Ivanovich with his conflicting feelings of wanting to cast Emelyn aside ‘like the rubbish you are’ but also sacrificing his own meager share of food, water and money to care for this discarded man and hopefully help him back on his feet. He pushes him towards his own vocation of tailoring, though Emelyn’s shaky hands can’t grasp it. In Emelyn, we have the guilt of having fallen destitute due to his addictions and stealing in order to survive. We see him sleep on the steps in the cold as Astafy threatens he would make him do out of shame for returning home drunk again and even running away for four days over what we later learn is guilt for stealing from Astafy and lying about it. In this way we see how even the poor, even during their harshest moments, still are struggling to be good people in keeping with what Dostoevsky would later write in Crime and Punishment that ‘poverty is not a vice…in poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul.’Alcoholism is a tragic addiction, and it is tragic to see Emelyn suffer from it. Worse, is his suffering from guilt, sitting at the window gazing into nothing nearly motionless for days, and I must confess I’m rather charmed by the phrasing that he ‘moped like an owl.’ We find a parallel to this—and one of the many ways we see Astafy filling the Emelyn role—in the story’s ‘present,’ Astafy Ivanovich sits in the same spot sewing all day on end. One could wonder if his enthusiasm to catch the thief is somehow a desire to chase down the ghost of Emelyn.But to the matter of the title, and the bewilderment of the narrator when told about said honest thief. ‘To my thinking there is no vermin in the world worse than a thief,’ the narrator thinks, ‘another takes what you can spare, but a thief steals the work of your hands, the sweat of your brow, your time.’ Emelyn does steal more than just the expensive pants from Astafy, such as seemingly robbing him of his peace of mind as well as his rations of food and money, but Astafy brushes all that aside to characterize him as honest. Even though he has lied. And, as one should expect with Dostoevsky, there are some biblical references at play here yet again reminding me of this old meme:  [image]First, the return of Emelyn after his three nights in the cold and Astafy’s joy in his return reads much like the Parable of the Prodigal Son. He even means to get a feast for Emelyn, and by feast I mean more bread and onions beyond his usual rationing. But the biggest theme here is the redemption through confession which calls to mind Dismas the Good (or penitent) Thief. Dismas admits to his crimes and calls Jesus innocent as he awaits death crucified himself, such as Emelyn confesses to stealing the pants upon his sudden deathbed. Astafy forgives him as he dies, much as Jesus tells the thief he will go to heaven.It is a short and fairly inconsequential tale in Dostoevksy’s oeuvre, and a sad one at that, but the psychological nature and focus on forgiveness make it a satisfying story nonetheless. His themes are all on display and his writing seeps into you in his characteristic comforting yet thought provoking manner. While not his strongest or more memorable, An Honest Thief is still certainly worth the read.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,0,146,1,"Jul 07, 2023","Jul 07, 2023","Jul 07, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60091760-an-honest-thief

From growing up an only child in a de facto racially segregated Pasadena, California, being raised by a working-class, single mother after her father died when Octavia was 7, to a celebrated and highly decorated novelist, Ibi Zoboi chronicles the life and acheivements of this fantastic author in Star Child. Winner of the Coretta Scott King Award, Star Child is a hybrid biography composed with biographical vignettes and poetry to deliver a multifaceted portrait of the author, exploring her impressive and pioneering literary journey as a Black woman working in a field almost exclusively made up of white men. While the book is aimed at younger readers, it is just as engaging and informative for any age—a sure mark of excellence—and the use of photos from Butler’s archives such as old letters of encouragement to herself with Zoboi’s lovely poetry makes this an essential read for any Butler fan as well as an excellent introduction to an author that will certainly claim your heart.‘A psychologist--She excavated our mindsdug into out collective thoughtsto know what truly makes us allhuman’‘readers of all ages should know that Octavia Estelle Butler was once a little Black girl growing up during the Civil Rights Movement and the Space RaceHer stories merge history, anthropology, sociology, biology, and technology. The biographical speculative poems in Star Child attempt to do the same.’The hybrid form in Star Child is really exciting and interesting, making for a fun and dynamic way to engage with biography or nonfiction in general. It seems only fitting that an author who’s legacy has helped science fiction become more inclusive and inspired generations of writers from all sorts of backgrounds be addressed in an innovative way. I enjoy seeing that poetry has become common in YA or middle grade books, such as novels in verse becoming more common, and I’m glad to see it resonates with readers and help usher in a new generation of poets. While the poetry here is certainly aimed at younger readers, it is quite fun and allows a unique perspective at the ways Butler’s work touches readers as well as a perspective of the world going on around Butler and, as Zoboi writes:‘readers of all ages should know that Octavia Estelle Butler was once a little Black girl growing up during the Civil Rights Movement and the Space Race…Her stories merge history, anthropology, sociology, biology, and technology. The biographical speculative poems in Star Child attempt to do the same.’The poetry incorporates history and science in creative ways, such as the poem Space Race which juxtaposes two columns, the first beginning ‘Bombs in the Sky’ under “Space” and the one under “Race” beginning ‘Bombs on the ground.’ It seems a perfect way to address how Butler’s work interrogated issues of race while also being speculative fiction about alien worlds or even time travel to the past as in Kindred. I especially like this juxtaposition, starting again with Space:If only the torpedoesWould change courseAnd aim for the starsOr Mars,And we would know for sureThat there’d be a hiding placeOr a new homeBeyond the cloudsAnd next to that is Race:If only Jim CrowWould have a change of heartAnd march beside usBraving horses and dogs,And we would know for sureThat there’d be aSafe placeIn our own homesIn our on skinsI learned a lot from this book and while I’ve read many of her works and essays, the most biography I knew previously was from the essays in Bloodchild and Other Stories (ed here) that discussed her finding a space for herself in a white male dominated genre. There are excellent passages on how narratives of women as heroes, especially Black women, were hardly present and how she had to break from the mold of spacemen adventures to create her own. ‘Everything I read that was intended for women seemed boring as hell,’ Butler had said, and she set out to change that. I appreciate how many large chunks of quotes from Butler are incorporated at the start of each biographical vignette, letting Butler tell her own story as much as Zoboi does.‘She leaps into other bodies and mindsTo feel, to know, to empathizeWith us all—like a kindred soul.’The sections on how Butler came to enjoy sci-fi and later write afrouturistic stories are great. ‘I made my own society in the books and in the stories I told myself,’ Butler said. I enjoyed her discussion on how watching the news and not knowing what words meant inspired the imagination, such as hearing of someone being “liquidated” calling to mind them being dissolved in a mixing bowl. ‘Everything was theater for the mind,’ she said. Butler, growing up a Baptist, also found biblical tales as a great source of inspiration. I also loved the mention of Baba, the cocker spaniel that belonged to the employers of Butler’s mother and how Butler credited her interactions with Baba ‘for writing about empathy in her novels, where human being would feel what others are feeling.’ This seems most prominent in Parable of the Sower (ed here). I was happy to learn that Ibi Zoboi got to meet her hero, Octavia Butler, before she tragically passed in 2006 at the age of 58, meeting her before the ceremony where she would win a Nebula Award for Parable of the Talents. Butler inspired countless writers, helped ensure there was a space for Black authors and women in science fiction and left us with a large catalog of incredible books to remember her by and heed her warnings to help shape a brighter future. Star Child is a lovely, innovative biography that celebrates this icon and introduces young children to her life and works. I hope you will be as moved by it as I was.‘I have written books about making the world a better place and how to make humidity more survivable…You can call it save-the-world fiction, but it clearly doesn’t save anything. It just calls people’s attention to the fact that so much needs to be done.’--Octavia Estelle Butler (June 22, 1947 – February 24, 2006)...more",Notes are private!,0,125,1,"Jul 05, 2023","Jul 05, 2023","Jul 05, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57994153-star-child

During his time in the Spanish Civil War, Orwell observed the pervasiveness of propaganda as a pillar upholding authoritarianism, from censored newspapers to lies perpetuated for political convenience and began to fear that ‘the very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world.’ This fear presented itself across the whole of his works during his short life, culminating in his famous 1984 where he warns ‘who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.’ Published in 1949 and written as Orwell was dying from tuberculosis, he didn’t live long to see how 1984 and his dire warnings against authoritarianism would have a lasting effect even to this day, often being used by all sides of the political spectrum as a cultural touchstone. And while this is mostly owing to the broad criticisms showing how any ideology can become oppressive when hungry for power, it also exemplifies his own dread that words will be twisted and quoted as cudgels to fit a desired purpose as truth is washed away. A harrowing story of dystopia, surveillance, manipulation and resistance being crushed underfoot, 1984 still chills today with its themes on collective vs individual identity under totalitarianism and controlling all aspects of reality to eliminate all those who step outside the boundaries of orthodoxy.‘We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it.’When we read sci-fi, words like “prophetic” and “warning” often get applied. 1984 continues to remain relevant due to its warnings against irresponsible use of rhetoric, which almost makes the references to it amusing or ironic. Such as the Apple computer commercial in 1984 that uses the novel for the sake of marketing (and what is “marketing” but a euphemism for propaganda) a product that would lead to all sorts of concerns over government surveillance for which people would quote 1984 in addressing them. I think the term prophetic often frames a book in a way that causes us to consider how close it came true, which seems beside the point because when we look at the ways it didn’t, that often becomes an excuse for delegitimization or ignoring the warning. Born Eric Arthur Blair in Bengal in 1903 and passing in 1950, Orwell’s short life left a lasting legacy from his works like Animal Farm being classroom staples in the US and terms like “Orwellian” being blithely applied to anything that brushes against government use of technology and surveillance. Hardly a political cycle goes by in the US without 1984 coming up. In the US alone in the past decade we saw it returning to the paperback bestseller list under the Trump administration when the term “alternative facts” was being tossed around, and a few years later it was being referenced by the GOP to claim the government was denying an election victory and inventing the January 6th terrorist attack to arrest people. Though with a president making statements like “What you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening,” naturally one is reminded of Orwell writing ‘the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command,’ and we are reminded of the power of literature and how we often turn to great works for guidance during uncertain times, though often, as Orwell warned, using it as propaganda shorn of context. Orwell did live long enough to see the novel used improperly, having to put out a statement almost immediately for those who wished to use the novel as an example against the British Labor Party. ‘My recent novel is NOT an on Socialism or on the British Labor Party (of which I am a supporter),’ he wrote, and an introduction to the book states:‘every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it.’Which becomes a pretty important distinction, as Orwell believed in better form of governing yet also was suspicious of anyone who would seek out power in order to change it as he writes in the novel ‘we know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it.’ I feel 1984 is best read with an openness to nuance and in good faith, which is often glossed over for the sake of political identifying which is, ironically or not, the exact thing he was warning against. Which is to say, call out problems even if it’s your own “side” and don’t create further divide by abusing rhetoric for the sake of scoring quick political points.  I think there is a tendency when trying to score quick political points that things need to have some sort of unassailable pure aim to them. 1984 is critical of any regime that seeks to keep power, but narrowing it to a pointed attack against an opponent without seeing how it might apply to your own political ""team"" (US politics is so much cheering for your ""home team"" than actually hashing out politics, especially lately, though I also find the whole ""both sides"" angle to often be used less for establishing nuance than trying to delegitamize any efforts for progress too, but hell who am I to say I'm just as bad as anyone) is more convenient. But even Orwell himself isn’t a “pure” figure, having been an informant for the British government delivering a list of names of people suspected of communism (the list includes John Steinbeck and many have observed that there is a strong presence of gay people on the list which makes many of Orwell’s rather homophobic comments seem all the more menacing). He also, as A. E. Dyson observed in his book on Orwell, that he ‘had a very English dislike of intellectuals, supposing that anyone willing to wear such a label would be diminished or depraved.’ Which is all neither here nor there, but goes to show how one can create a narrative out of anything, and that is what 1984 taps into.So let’s move on to the novel and head on down to Room 101. As I said earlier, 1984 can be read as a culmination of a lot of his themes and ideas across his short career. Warning of totalitarianism arrives everywhere with Orwell, such as Burmese Days when he describes the town as ‘a stifling, stultifying world…which every word and every thought is censored,’ not unlike 1984 because ‘free speech is unthinkable.’ And one can read in Keep the Aspidistra Flying, with Comstock (a name derived from Common and Stock similarly to how the terms in 1984 are often truncated phrases) bemoaning ‘I’m dead, You’re dead. We’re all dead people in a dead world,’ as a precursor to the pivotal moment when Winston and Jane declare ‘we’re dead’ right before being exposed as having been set up. For Orwell, speech and language is very key. Language itself is fallible and can be morphed to meet many purposes—it’s the medium of poets for a reason—and in 1984 Orwell examines how this can be used to negate truth and establish entirely fictional histories that become generally accepted as a means to upholding power.‘War is peace.Freedom is slavery.Ignorance is strength.’Winston’s job is to rewrite history to fit the purpose of the party. Within his department we find all sorts of nefarious linguistic play designed to control the masses because it is thought that ‘if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.’ We can argue that we see this notion reflected in our modern day, where books exposing history that can be seen as a blemish on the US are banned or dismissed as unpatriotic or trying to rewrite history (the irony in the latter is thick) and many have spoken on the suppression of queer books as an effort to erase the language people need to assess their own identities. What Orwell is looking at is the way language and propaganda is used to control. I enjoy the way he makes creative use of language to compile entire terminologies used by Ingsoc (the party in control that is pretty blatantly a nod to Soviet Russia) to create a propagated history that fits whatever they need, even erasing the history of entire wars to portray other countries as allies and erase the recent memory of them as enemies.  ‘Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.’To step outside the orthodoxy of the Party’s version of history is to become an enemy of the Party and society and find yourself “vaporized” and erased from history. ‘Orthodoxy means not thinking--not needing to think,’ Orwell writes, ‘Orthodoxy is unconsciousness,’ and when the truth we know conflicts with the truth of the Party, it must be edited. ‘Lies,’ writes Rebecca Solnit in her book Orwell's Roses, ‘the assault on language -- were the necessary foundation for all the other assaults.’ Afterall, ‘the first victim of war is truth, goes the old saying, and a perpetual war against truth undergirds all authoritarianisms.’ “Doublespeak” comes into play here, where one can hold conflicting opinions in their mind and just accept them, and the Party finds that fear is a great tool for ensuring willing erasure of truth. ‘Truth is not a statistic,’ Winston argues, claiming that just because the masses agree doesn’t make it true, though over the novel we see how the power to rewrite “truth” can potentially eviscerate anyone who says otherwise until it becomes the only known “truth.” Returning to Rebecca Solnit, she observes:‘To be forced to live with the lies of the powerful is to be forced to live with your own lack of power over the narrative, which in the end can mean lack of power over anything at all. Authoritarians see truth and fact and history as a rival system they must defeat.’It is in this way the Party keeps people subservient. ‘A hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance,’ and Winston, upon reading Goldstein’s book (the book serves as an insert into the narrative that provides a LOT of exposition about the world and its structures as well as being a sort of Marxist-esque handbook, though it only offers the how things came to be and never the why, much to Winston’s interest), Winston realizes that the proles (the working class) are the possible solution. However he realized the proles can only revolt if they become conscious of their conditions and only can become conscious of their conditions if they revolt (not a far cry from Orwell’s own statement ‘we cannot win the war without introducing Socialism, nor establish Socialism without winning the war.’), and worries this may never happen. There is also the issue that a revolution will only put a new Party in power that will inevitably oppress again, just in different ways.  ‘The masses never revolt of their own accord, and they never revolt merely because they are oppressed. Indeed, so long as they are not permitted to have standards of comparison, they never even become aware that they are oppressed.’So without giving anything away because this book is full of surprises (though one may guess if they have read We by Yevgeny Zamyatin, which Orwell “borrows” heavily from—as does Huxley’s Brave New World—and still remains my favorite of the three), across this novel we see a spirit of resistance rise and the forces of power come to meet it with a heavy boot and the power of erasure. While much of the novel focuses on the individual versus the collective, the biggest act of betrayal comes at the end in choosing to protect oneself, the individual, and asking for the harm of others in order to enter the “protection” of the collective Party by erasing any part of oneself outside their orthodoxy. Where once was the belief ‘to die hating them, that was freedom,’ we see ‘in the face of pain there are no heroes’ and fear keeps people in line. Reminding the people of the frailty of being an individual drives them towards compliance. Yet, in another way, we see the collective existing because of the desire of individuals to protect themselves at the expense of everyone else: nobody will revolt out of fear for themselves and in doing so allows the oppression of all to continue. I think this is what Ursula K. Le Guin is getting at when her books look at the need to integrate both the individual and collective by refusing easy binaries and hierarchies. She also, especially in The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia argues that history can never become stagnant and that, like Orwell argues, an revolution will try to uphold power and oppress leading to the necessity of another revolution. While Le Guin sees this as the natural course of history (the double meaning of revolution as a revolt and a constant turning cycling through) Orwell sees this as a constant erosion of truth due to the weaponization of language as propaganda that will inevitably erase reality in place of a false, collective reality where truth is sent to the grave.‘We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.’One might find 1984 to be a rather bleak book, but it is also intended as a warning. There are many minor warnings building up to the larger, main point—such as the paperweight symbolizing a past now inaccessible where art could be beautiful for the sake of beauty, as well as symbolizing the frailty of the individual—and that we must take care to use language responsibly lest we hold the door for open propaganda. We can even do this on an individual level, such as not perpetuating misinformation (funny political memes are easy to share but dilute the severity of problems when we poke fun at, say, the looks or mannerisms of a politician instead of focusing on their policies) and not giving in to easy attacks instead of respecting the nuances. And so that's my rough rant on 1984, a book that lives on for both its relevance and its political convenience and maybe we should all remember that truth is more important than winning an argument or scoring political edgy points. I fail at it too, we all do, but Orwell reminds us to do better. ⅘'A nation of warriors and fanatics, marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting, triumphing, persecuting - three hundred million people all with the same face.'...more",Notes are private!,4,299,1,not set,not set,"Jul 03, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3744438-1984

It’s the book that holds the power, not you.’I love books. I suspect you do, too, seeing as you are here on goodreads reading about books, and I love that for you. ‘Books keep me going,’ admits the shy, young and recently orphaned protagonist in The Cat Who Saved Books, a lovely little novel sure to warm the hearts of bookworms by Sōsuke Natsukawa, and I can confess to the same. And not simply because they are my livelihood, working days in the public library and evenings in a charming, little independent bookstore (I often joke with locals you can’t get a book in this town without going through me), but there have been many times books have quite literally given me the emotional strength to keep going. To keep learning, to keep thinking, to keep believing it’s worth dancing through the absurdity of life and enjoying the beautiful moments. So while the worst I could say about this book is it can be a bit over sentimental and idealistic, it is a sentiment worth getting soppy over and an ideal worth striving for and I spent a few days blissfully exploring the labyrinth along with the characters in their quest to protect the love of books. When teenage Rintaro’s guardian and grandfather passes, he is left alone as proprietor of their second-hand bookstore, something he soon must leave behind to live with a distant aunt. Suddenly Tiger, a magical cat on a mission, appears to whisk Rintaro away on adventures to save books and, in turn, learn he has a strength inside he never knew. Wonderfully translated by Louise Heal Kawai, this is a joy to read and also makes for an excellent reading list with all the nods to older literature, most of which are Western classics. The Cat Who Saved Books is an endlessly charming read, as empowering as it is entertaining while reminding us there are many ways to love reading and that books are worth protecting.‘Human beings don’t live alone, and a book is a way to show them that.’This is a breeze of a read, in both the sense that you can be turning pages hardly noticing the passing of time and that it is like an idyllic breeze blowing over your bibliophile being. In many ways I could see this being sort of like The Alchemist but for book-love, with the way it is pretty endlessly quotable along the life-affirming plotline. I was wary going into it for this reason, as I wasn’t big on Alchemist (wrote about it here) but ended up really enjoying this (it was a birthday gift from my 3 year old, who loves the cover with its lovely art by Yuko Shimizu and would grab it off the shelf and carry around every time she came to see me at the bookstore…a place she definitely assumes is just an extension of her own home and I like to cultivate that). It does tip towards idealism, though many of the “opponents” that Rintaro must face in the various labyrinths do confront him with harsh opinions based in reality that he has to overcome. And he also must learn to overcome himself in ways. Described as a hikikomori—which roughly translates to extreme social withdrawal—we experience Rintaro try to become more of a person in the world, aided not only by his adventures with Tiger but the support from Sayo, the class president who has taken it upon herself to give Rintaro a much needed push.‘Don’t give in to loneliness. You aren’t alone. ’The charm of the characters really help this book sink in. They are a bit generic at times—the shy bookish boy, the overachiever girl, the athlete with an inflated ego—but they really mesh well and drive the story all the same. Tiger the cat is a delight in all his blunt, no-nonsense ways, though unfortunately he is a bit under utilized. Still, they all makes for a rather pleasing read as they come together to support one another. For Rintaro, we see he must accept ‘books can't live your life for you’ and, like the dreamer in White Nights by Fyodor Dostoevsky, must put himself out into the world to truly live.  ‘It’s not true that the more you read, the more you see of the world. No matter how much knowledge you cram into your head, unless you think with your own mind, walk with your own feet, the knowledge you acquire will never be anything more than empty and borrowed.’Books are an excellent tool, but without experiencing life as well as books, we just become ‘an old encyclopaedia, his head stuffed with out-of-date information,’ wasting away on the shelf of our own lives without the lessons being of use to anyone. ‘A book that sits on a shelf is nothing but a bundle of paper. Unless it is opened, a book possessing great power or an epic story is mere scraps of paper. But a book that has been cherished and loved, filled with human thoughts, has been endowed with a soul.’Throughout the book, Rintaro must navigate different labyrinths each with their own book-villain minotaur at the center (one can argue there is a larger, overall labyrinth of himself he is also questing through), though we see how in each the person does truly believe they are doing what is right. We have a publisher that only sells cookie-cutter bestsellers, a man who tries to condense every book to a single sentence to save people time, or a man who keeps books locked away as an aesthetic. ‘Your feelings about a book don’t determine its value,’ he is told, such as when the publisher states ‘in our society it is the banknote that is the arbiter of value.’ The difficulty is there is a lot of truth to what they tell him, but Rinato must remember ‘logic and reason are never the best weapons in an irrational world.’ What matters is loving books. Sure, the average book published today sells less than 300 print copies over its lifetime and 64% of the US sales comes from the Big 5 publishers, but to a book lover, does that make a little known, indie published book that truly touched their heart any less of an impact on them? No. And that’s what matters most. Also, as Ursula K. Le Guin said in her National Book Foundation awards speech we need to ‘know the difference between production of a market commodity and the practice of an art.’There were times this book gets a bit overly precious about books, but the heart is in the right place. Love books the way you love books. Dog ear and underline to your hearts content if that makes you happy despite what the haters say (I personally do it a lot, I think books look all cool and punk and loved that way), make art from your books, keep them in a special place, give them away, collect as many editions of your favorite, have way more than you’ll ever read (or even intend to read), just do you. And there are many ways to enjoy them and I’m not into gatekeeping reading. Don’t let anyone make you feel less of a reader for what you enjoy. Only like graphic novels, GREAT, they are just as valid. Prefer audiobooks? Just as valid as well, listen until your heart is content. Like to read only for easy pleasure? ENJOY! Read only YA books despite being an adult? Dive right in. Only like fantasy? Have a magical time. Only read the classics? Do it up! If a book, any book (that isn’t like…pro genocide or something, I gotta draw a line somewhere) makes you happy, that is what counts. There is some great stuff in here about difficult books though, which the grandfather compares to climbing a mountain:‘“Reading isn’t only for pleasure or entertainment. Sometimes you need to examine the same lines deeply, read the same sentences over again. Sometimes you sit there, head in hands, only progressing at a painstakingly slow pace. And the result of all this hard work and careful study is that suddenly you’re there and your field of vision expands. It’s like finding a great view at the end of a long climbing trail.’Which is all very lovely. I’m reminded of Roberto Bolaño writing about wrestling with the great, dense classics ‘when the great masters struggle against that something, that something that terrifies us all, that something that cows us and spurs us on, amid blood and mortal wounds and stench,’ but that its all worth it because ‘reading is pleasure and happiness to be alive or sadness to be alive and above all it's knowledge and questions. (from 2666).‘What's important is the ability to have empathy for another human being--to be able to feel their pain, to walk alongside them in their suffering.’Though perhaps the biggest power of books is the way it helps us see outside ourselves, to learn and understand not just about the world but each other. There are many studies showing that reading helps grow empathy, part of the reason it is important to read to children to foster empathy and grow emotional intelligence. ‘I think the power of books is that - that they teach us to care about others,’ Rinato discovered, ‘it's a power that gives people courage and also supports them in turn…Empathy - that's the power of books.’ Which is a beautiful sentiment, one that I’d like to just let sit there and flourish. ‘A cherished book will always have a soul. It will come to its reader’s aid in times of crisis,’ Tiger says, and I like to believe this is true.‘Even if you try to destroy a book, it doesn’t disappear that easily. Right now, in places all over the world, people have connections to books.’This is why it is important to protect books. In the US where I am, this is becoming a serious issue with book challenges and bans occurring at rapidly rising rates. In 2022 there were 1,269 challenges against 2,571 different books (I wrote about this extensively here). But we can overcome the hateful (it also reminds us that those wishing to destroy books often truly believe they are doing it for honorable reasons), especially seeing as just 11 people are responsible for 60% of challenges in the US. So protect books, friends. Support your libraries and bookstores. And of course I was going to love a book about a little bookstore that could--I spend all my time in one. I’m writing this from the store right now.

The world opens itself up into lush landscapes teeming with life an‘But how could you live and have no story to tell?’Summer nights are for dreamers. The world opens itself up into lush landscapes teeming with life and the nights, so full of star light and mystery, seem as vast as the aspirations of first time lovers. Anything seems possible amidst the summer nights, as if the afterhours were a doorway that takes you into a fairy tale world where magic and mayhem await you. Such is the feeling permeating Fydor Dostoevsky’ White Nights, an early tale first published in 1848 of a nameless narrator coming to life and love under the white nights of St. Petersburg. ‘I am a dreamer,’ he tells us and embarks on a story that feels as if set in a dreamscape, softly pulling us through the four nights he spends talking with the young Nastenka whom he met sobbing upon a bridge. Over these few days the pair come to know each other fondly, and despite his promise to not fall in love with her as she is engaged to another man, our narrator can’t help but blissfully trip into romantic affection in what seems Doestoevksy’s portrayal and preference of altruistic love. Learning to look and live outward instead of inwardly dreaming, the narrator breaks from isolation and sees that although living towards dreams may go awry, having lived in the world is better than loneliness.‘It was a wonderful night, such a night as is only possible when we are young, dear reader.’I love a good story that takes place over the span of a mere few days, the type that reminds you how life seems to slow down with every moment elevated and vibrating with implied importance when you feel like you’ve stumbled into a narrative within your own life. A handful of days you feel you’ve occupied more than entire months. White Nights excellently embodies this and you feel, as the reader, the feverish excitement of the narrator as if it is running through your own veins and not his; a talent of Dostoevsky’s I first became enamored with long ago while reading Crime and Punishment is his ability to transpose the characters emotions onto you such was the intensity of guilt and anguish I felt alongside Raskolnikov as he sweated in his bed. I was also particularly empathetic to his account of feeling left behind and in a state of a ‘strange anguish,’ finding himself befriending his own city as he wandered the streets aimlessly. I recall a time when I had my own personal loneliness and sadness, spending summer days wandering my own city and finding a particular joy and camaraderie with the landscape one can only enter when out within it walking. The poets have written on this for centuries. Another phenomenon of walking and thinking, especially in summer, is that the whole world feels possible and that around any corner everything might change, fall into place, or trigger a story. And so this tale begins.‘I am a dreamer. I know so little of real life that I just can't help re-living such moments as these in my dreams, for such moments are something I have very rarely experienced.’While perhaps not much occurs in this story, we also feel that it shifts the entirety of the narrators world, he who upon his first conversation with Nastenka admits ‘I will no longer think so badly of myself as I have done at times,’ simply because he had an experience with her. There is a real youthfulness blossoming on every page here with our narrator, somewhere in his twenties but feeling life already leaving him behind, and his loquacity is only matched by his awkwardness. Luckily she find him charming, sharing her own feelings of loneliness spending her days quite literally pinned to her grandmothers dress since the elder woman fears Nastenka will be taken off by a man (a bit on the nose but it works), and is more amused than bemused by his poetic way of rambling. Upon his first explanation of himself she remarks ‘You talk as though you were reading it out of a book.’ Its this sort of inability to temper one’s awkward excitement coupled with a penchant for poetic flourishing that first marks him as a dreamer, but also reminds me of the characters in early Knut Hamsun works, particularly Hunger when the narrator’s romantic prospects are dashed by the self sabotage of his grand speeches. Hunger always recalled Doestoevksy’s narrator from Notes from Underground and in White Nights we see Dostoevsky practicing the sort of long-winded storytelling he would later use for his underground man.‘I don’t know how to be silent when my heart is speaking.’A dreamer, our narrator tells us ‘is not a human being, but a creature of an intermediate sort.’ He lives his life dreaming but never truly living, inventing all sorts of wishes he can play out in his head but never actually having the experiences beyond imagination (perhaps one may see a dreamer as a sort of step-sibling to a reader). He casts himself as the ‘hero’ in his telling, just as in his dreaming, but is nothing but a spectator speculating. And while he has charmed himself with many fantasies of love and lovers, he has never truly known it firsthand and is beginning to regret occupying his time with what amounts to nothing.‘Because at moments like that I start to think that I am incapable of living a proper life, I seem already to have lost any sort of judgment, any apprehension of the real and actual; because after all, I have cursed my very self; because after my nights of fantasy come moments of sobriety which are appalling…after all one matures, outgrows one’s former ideals: they are shattered into dust and fragments; and if you have no other life, it behooves you to construct one from those same fragments.’At least with Nastenka he is experiencing life. She too has a story to tell, one of a man to whom she is promised to be wed upon his return to St. Petersberg yet he has been home a few days and has not come to her. Our dreamer, eager to please and to experience life, agrees to take a letter to him. In his dealings with Nastenka we see a sort of idyllic, altruistic purity to his love, one of a boy who puts her best interests before himself and she with no intent to deceive or use him. It feels very much like high school, doing something for your crush in a tale of unrequited love where, deep down, you know they will never be with you but you do it anyway.  ‘But to imagine that I should bear you a grudge, Nastenka! That I should cast a dark cloud over your serene, untroubled happiness; that by my bitter reproaches I should cause distress to your heart, should poison it with secret remorse and should force it to throb with anguish at the moment of bliss; that I should crush a single one of those tender blossoms which you have twined in your dark tresses when you go with him to the altar…. Oh never, never! May your sky be clear, may your sweet smile be bright and untroubled, and may you be blessed for that moment of blissful happiness which you gave to another, lonely and grateful heart!’It is, perhaps, what a youth would be snickered at by peers and teased for being ‘friend-zoned’, but we see that there is a sincerity here. We also see why the subtitle for this tale is ‘A sentimental story from the diary of a dreamer’ because it is indeed sentimental and tugs heartstrings that reverberate in the tune of nostalgia and young, doomed romance.Of course our young narrator, against her wishes to not fall in love with her, does, but in her grief over the continued absence of her fiancée, she begins to bend her heart towards him as well. Why not, he clearly cares for her. The story takes a twist and we see our dreamer sad but not regretful, because he has experienced life. And life comes with loss as much as love, we just only hope the scales tip more towards sweetness when we tally up our total when the curtain falls for us. We leave the dreamer as he ponders if this one moment of happiness was worth it all.‘My God, a whole moment of happiness! Is that too little for the whole of a man’s life?’Doestoevsky forever holds a special place in my heart. While some authors tear out your heart, tear it to pieces and build you back stronger, Dostoevksy achieves the same results in a different way. He shows you inside your own heart and, in recognizing his words capturing inner feelings your own heart could never have expressed so eloquently, it begins to shake and vibrate in harmony with his ideas until it flies into pieces. Then he puts you back together, wiser and thankful for it. White Nights is a minor work yet it hits so soothingly and with all the bliss of a grand summer’s night. This is one for, as Kermit the Frog once sang, the lovers, the dreamers, and me.5/5‘[A]sk yourself again: what have you done with your best years, then?

Plucking the characters from the Greek story and launching them into a future fraught with political upheaval, the story very closely follows what you would expect with Antigone facing punishment for giving funeral rights to her deceased brother, Polyneikes, after he dies slaying his other brother in an attempt on the iron-fisted rule of their uncle, Kreon. There is a lot going on here, particularly in world building which is rather expansive and effective given the short length of the novella, and while it may often feel like there is just one element too many to properly balance in the framework of a Greek myth retelling, I applaud Roth for a solid effort and attempt. The story rotates between the perspectives of many of the characters, giving a variety of viewpoints and conflicting opinions that helps construct a really dynamic portrait of the events, though it does feel overly stuffed at times. Though while it was occasionally cumbersome, at least Arch-Conspirator is a bold and daring attempt that hits some fantastic moments of political struggles between characters as Antigone’s actions become a catalyst for a possible revolution in dystopian Thebes.‘Seven houses crumbling on a Theban street. One’s got no fire, one’s got no heat. One’s got no water; one’s got no meat.’The primary issue with Arch-Conspirator is that, while having inventive fun with the original tale, it seems like it is trying to do too much at once instead of exploring one theme really well. I love a retelling that really throws you for a loop, but I feel a total resetting of time and place to use the narrative as a modern political commentary was done much more effectively in Home Fire by Kamila Shamsie, which dealt with immigration and the Iraq war. I quite liked that we get to see conflicting opinions and perspectives that self-justify actions, though in Home Fire we spend much more time in these perspectives that allow them to be nuanced instead of such broad strokes as we have here.The world building is excellent but also trying too many things at once. We have a fascinating and terrifying birthing system, with women forced to give birth through State fertility programs that selects the DNA of deceased citizens (there is a library of the dead, basically) and, through gene editing, creates a new life. In this way the people are told souls are reincarnated—Antigone finds this dubious though it is her brothers final wishes to have his soul collected, something Kreon denies him due to his “traitorous” demise—and pregnancies conceived through intercourse without gene editing are considered unnatural and create humans that lack souls. The now deceased Oedipus and Jocasta had their children this way, and so Antigone and her family are not only marked by their parents radical past but considered soulless vessels (Oedipus was a radical who believed ‘Immortality…should be for everyone’ and made the soul collection available to all). There is also the underexplored aspect that the planet is supposedly inhospitable to life now and the radiation is slowly hurting everyone, though a brief mention from Antigone gives the impression this might be partially orchestrated to keep everyone in the city under Kreon’s control.‘What do you think would happen if I allowed a crack in my wall?’While not enough, the perspective from Kreon really works. We see a man who, while doing horrible things, sees himself as making hard decisions that are ultimately good. It is a great reminder that most of the worst evils in the world are done by people convinced it is the right thing to do. How can humans survive without tough control, he feels, and see’s Antigone’s actions as a threat against his rule that could incite public opinion against him. Though, as his son Haemon comments, ‘You don’t want to allow a crack in your wall—but the crack is already there, and I fear this will widen it.’ I enjoyed these conversations the best, especially when the characters are arguing as it shows the situation is much more nuanced than it seems. ‘One man, High Commander or no, doesn’t have the right or the power to declare cruelty to be morality just because something has affected him personally. There is a word for the man who tries…tyrant.’While the revolution brewing is a big driving part of the plot, it feels very under examined and could have easily been expanded for a full length novel. Rare for me to say as I love a short book, but this just needed room for all the elements to breathe more and be explored deeper. It just feels thrown together otherwise with quick mentions on how they interact and inform other decisions instead of truly seeing how each element bleeds into the others. Especially with Antigone’s story having such far reaching consequences.‘For some reason, you talk to people about food shortages, power outages, contaminated water, the government disappearing people—you might as well be speaking another language. But if you tell them their High Commander wants to send a pretty young thing into space to waste away? Suddenly they’re listening.’I love what she is doing, and for the most part I think she is doing it well and doing something really cool with the story, it just never quite came together well enough to fully land. And while I’m certainly of the mind that you can do whatever you want in retellings, I found the ending to be rather lackluster compared to how dramatic and abrupt the story of Antigone usually ends. Once again, I can’t help but compare it to Home Fire which I think really nailed a retelling ending. “And if the election turns out something worse?”Parth leaned forward.“Then at least we would be responsible for our own doom.”Despite some criticisms, Arch-Conspirator is a cool story and a really fun retelling, I only wish I felt it was all able to be more effectively juggled. Which isn’t really Roth’s fault as it would require an absolute master of literature to pull all this off in such a short space while also feeling polished and powerful. It just feels like biting off more than one can chew, though it still isn’t bad. Antigone is a great story and it was fun to see this done in a sci-fi setting.2.5/5...more",Notes are private!,0,106,1,"Jun 28, 2023","Jun 28, 2023","Jun 28, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60795459-arch-conspirator

I sThe earthquake of emotions from first loves often rocks our worlds with such ineffable power it seems only an epic tale can capture the narrative. I suspect this is part of the lasting power of myths as we can find in them a metaphor for our own perilous, emotional quests. In her stunning debut novel, the middle grade The Song of Us, Kate Fussner harnesses the tale of Orpheus and Eurydice into a sapphic, tragic love story between poet Olivia and the musically inclined Eden. Rotating between their perspectives and written in verse, this is a gorgeously told and emotionally charged loose retelling that will charm fans of the myth (it is a perfect time for this retelling with the popularity of Hadestown) yet still stands strong on its own for readers unfamiliar with the tale. Gracefully dealing with themes of families in crisis, struggles with love, despair, identity—such as feeling one must hide their true selves or disappear within a group—and societal pressures, Fussner delivers an exquisite and emotionally intense debut that will certainly reach deep into the hearts of readers of any age.The Song of Us is a love song, its a sad song, it’s an old song, and we’re going to sing it again because the tale of feeling one walking down a path doomed towards failure and choosing to try anyways is something that anyone can empathize with. A former English teacher at a Boston Middle School, Fussner sets this modern Orpheus and Eurydice in a Boston middle school and truly excels at elucidating emotional turmoil the way one fumbles to process it at that age. Our story brings us into the poetic minds of Olivia and Eden, who meet in the poetry club Olivia began with her trans best friend Lexi, and have a brief relationship that will linger in their hearts long after their abrupt break-up. Olivia, who usually prides herself on words, misfires during a moment of jealousy and creates a rift of hurt she will spend the novel trying to overcome. Now she must use words ‘fighting for Eden instead of fighting with Eden.’ While a loose retelling of the myth, the key elements are there and Fussner manages to make them feel fresh, surprising, and comfortably at home and authentic in her modern teenage drama. ‘I have learned more without youthan I thought was possible,learned my heart is biggermy words weakerif they aren’t goingstraight from my heartto you’Even as an adult I was hooked, devouring every page with a hope as if it might turn out this time and riding the intense emotional maelstrom of this sapphic tale of yearning, sorrow and regret. Being a novel in verse really fits the story and allows the characters to express themselves in abstract or otherwise artistic fashion (Fussner even plays with form a few times, which is always exciting and demonstrates the character’s trying to understand themselves from new angles) and also serves as the poems they write over the course of the story. I also appreciate that the fatalistic story touches on how, inevitably, all middle school relationships are likely going to come to an end but at the same time Fussner gives space to respect the fact that these feelings are real and often deeply felt. Having space for oneself is key to this story in many ways, particularly for Eden who doesn’t feel she has space to be herself. Particularly to come out, fearing rejection from peers or from her homophobic father. She fears she is living a false self as she falls in with a popular group of girls—self-dubbed the Crash—and feels peer pressure to kiss boys, experiment with marijuana and alcohol, and participate in their generally Mean Girls behavoirs at school. Through Eden we see the reasons why we build the walls we think will keep us free but end up pushing others away, including the one she truly loved. It also triggers the one request that could bring everything to ruin, where instead of Orpheus not being allowed to look back, Olivia is told she can text but never call or let anyone know they were ever together.It is difficult to process all these conflicting emotions at that age, times being what they are, hard and getting harder all the time as both girls face difficult home life situations as well. Eden’s father is a shell of himself since her mother left and his parenting style is more about being punitive than productive, while Olivia’s mom is suffering from a debilitating depression Olivia dubs the fog. Fussner delicately examines the struggles of dealing with a parent’s mental health while having one's own array of problems in ways that readers will find authentic but also deeply moving. And it also shows how even with all the monsters of society gnashing their teeth, the voice you really have to focus on is the one that howls inside your head, self-gaslighting oneself into feelings of inadequacy. Fussner’s poetic style, which comes at the narrative in exciting ways that dive directly into the emotional core of matters, also plucks each of our heart strings like Orpheus’ lyre reminding us all how bittersweet it is to love and to suffer in love, not just romantically but within families and friend groups as well.‘Because all of thisis for you.All of mehas always beenfor you.’The Song of Us is not just a fantastic debut but just an overall wonderful novel. The retelling feels fresh and fun, wondering if we can beat the myths or if we will see ‘her pulled / like a ghost to a world / unknown.’ As a huge fan of poetry, I loved how central the art was to this book from raising money selling poems to help others fall in love to trying to win back love through a poem that could make you see how the world could be in spite of what it is. If its true what they say, time can mend a broken heart but the roller coaster of emotions on that return journey of healing is a long and lonely path. Art, like poetry and music, can be a great companion during this time and I enjoy the way Fussner demonstrates this in a way that will inspire readers to create their own, all while being a perfect book for someone experiencing the stings of first love. This would be an excellent addition to any classroom library—I recently fulfilled a request at the bookstore for 20 recent novels for a middle school english teacher’s classroom were they took most of my recommendations and this was one of them—and is a beautiful book. Plus, who doesn’t want a queer Greek myth retelling? So we raise our cups to Kate Fussner: a lovely story that handles difficult themes in empowering ways, The Song of Us is a delight. And shoutout to anyone who caught all the Hadestown references in this , I recently went to see it and couldn’t resist.5/5‘There will be other lovesOther mistakes.Both can be true.’...more",Notes are private!,0,110,1,"Jun 27, 2023","Jun 27, 2023","Jun 27, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60121038-the-song-of-us

They didn’t even promise me a happy existence.’If you were to be transported to a fairy tale realm that would best draw out your inner strengths, what would it be? Not unlike the doors in her stories, Seanan McGuire’s novellas blissfully plunges us on magical adventures into mind-bending worlds full of characters it is impossible not to love. After a quick stop at the Moors for a gothic good time in the previous book, Beneath the Sugar Sky—the third installment in the Wayward Children series—brings us back to familiar friends at Eleanor West’s school for children. But not for long, because when Rini comes crashing into the school claiming to be the daughter of the recently murdered Suki and is slowly disappearing because Suki’s death means she wouldn’t have been born (pesky causality), Kade, Christopher, Nadya and newcomer Cora set off on a quest to set things right. This is a wild ride that expands our experiences of the multitude of fantastic worlds children get lost to as we get to visit several of them (and check in on Nancy!) and finally experience the zany joys on a Nonsense world. These books are so heartfelt and fun and McGuire manages to make even a bright candyland into a terrifying realm as we explore the ways people are much more than the assumptions we make about them.‘Children follow the foxes, and open the wardrobes, and peek beneath the bridge. Children climb the walls and fall down the wells and run the razor’s edge of possibility until sometimes, just sometimes, the possible surrenders and shows them the way to go home.’While Down Among the Sticks and Bones might still be my favorite as a stand-alone tale of horror and siblings torn apart, Beneath the Sugar Sky is a raucously fun addition that progresses the tale we left off in the first book. Kade remains my favorite character and to see him in a leadership roll here is a joy. Plus he provides snappy comic relief with some great one liners. McGuire excels at combining terror and wonder along with some laugh-out-loud humor to make these stories an adventure that registers on many levels of sheer enjoyment. ‘Elsewhere was a legend and a lie, until it came looking for you.’This is a fast-paced plot that really hits the ground running from the start…err, well, actually it hits a pond dropping from the sky. Rini does that is. She is vanishing because her mother has died before she had a chance to be born—‘I like existing,’ Rini tells us, completely uninterested in the logic of it all, ‘I'm not ready to unexist just because of stupid causality. I didn't invite stupid causality to my birthday party, so it doesn't get to give me any presents.’—and happens to have an item that can open any door. So beings an epic quest (which might go against school rules) to reunite Suki’s body, bones and soul (‘We’re all puzzle boxes, skeleton and skin, soul and shadow’) that will require the characters to all draw on their unique skills to pull it all off. ‘That's why people shouldn't get too hung up on labels. Sometimes I think that's part of what we do wrong. We try to make things make sense, even when they're never going to.’I enjoy the way McGuire celebrates our differences and what makes us unique, especially aspects that society tends to discriminate against. Newcomer Cora, who narrates this episode, has been fighting the social gaslighting of fatphobia her whole life due to having a larger build, which was a great benefit in her water world. ‘Fatphobia,’ writes philosopher Kate Manne, ‘ tells us our moral, sexual, and intellectual value is determined by our weight. That's absurd; it's deleterious; and it gaslights us,’ and we learn of Cora’s struggles due to other’s perceptions about her despite her being a rather successful athlete. She feels especially anxious over perceptions when they must travel through Suki’s door, which is a world made entirely out of candy.‘Every world gets to make its own rules. Sometimes those rules are going to be impossible. That doesn't make them any less enforceable.’I absolutely loved getting to see how the different worlds function. We’ve heard a lot of the struggles between children who have gone to high logic worlds versus nonsense worlds, so seeing a realm where the rules of logic as we know them simply do not apply is fascinating. And a great subject to mine for humor. We also get to learn a lot about how the doors function, that our world is not the only one feeding into them, and how in some realms the people considered gods might just have been a 12 year old from Brooklyn. This is a marvelous series with a surprise around every corner and the world building keeps getting more nuanced and interesting with each novella.‘We’re whistling through the graveyard to keep ourselves from totally losing our shit.’If I wasn’t before, I am now definitely hooked on these books. They are short enough to read in a few sittings but thought provoking to keep your mind enchanted for days after. These stories are so empowering, with great queer representation—having a trans character as the leader and hero is wonderful—and great social commentary against stereotypes and on supporting one another. I can’t wait to keep going, these just keep getting more exciting and opening new avenues to explore. So open the door to McGuire’s Wayward Children series and buckle up for a wild ride.4/5‘There is kindness in the world, if we know how to look for it.’...more",Notes are private!,0,84,1,"Jun 26, 2023","Jun 26, 2023","Jun 26, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27366528-beneath-the-sugar-sky

We can’t stop now.’If there is any true magic in the world, it is art. In its many mediums, like vibrations of sounds to build a melody, the chess moods of words towards a poem, or the collective brushstrokes to create an image, art captures emotions, narratives and, ultimately, the essence of life in an way that helps us feel more deeply through the abstract imaginings of ideas. While art can be cathartic to create and allow us to open our creative floodgates onto the world, it can also be an arduous task on the soul of an artist concerned about their abilities as a vessel from which beauty can be carried into the world, and such is the struggles of Swiss sculptor and painter Alberto Giacometti in Jame’s Lords A Giacometti Portrait. Chronicling the eighteen days Lord sat as a model for Giacometti for a portrait made with brushes and paints, Lord in turn channels anecdotes of their conversations and his observation on the artist to, in turn, create a portrait of Giacometti in words. Like the way the visuals of a painting is an opening to see into it for so much more, Lord tells us through his book that ‘to see even so little will be to see very much,’ and we are offered what reads like the window into a genius yet self-doubting and tortured artist as he grapples with his techniques ‘to show how things appear to me,’ and ‘explain in visual terms a perception of reality.’ This is a lovely book, one I completed in a single sitting but will certainly turn to again and again for it’s strikingly perceptive looks at artistry and the struggle to create something beautiful.  [image]Giacometti working on his portrait of LordWhat began as a promise of a one-day session becomes a mutli-week companionship as Giacometti refuses to be satisfied with his representation of Lord, reworking the head again and again as he confesses self-doubt and dissatisfaction. He finds each attempt ‘by definition an inadequate semblance of what he visualized as an ultimately tolerable representation of reality,’ and frets over what he sees is an impossibility to truly capture anything or even finish. ‘That’s the terrible thing: the more one works on a picture, the more impossible it becomes to finish it,’ he says at times, other times claiming ‘it’s impossible ever really to finish anything,’ and those who have created art will certainly empathize with his struggles against overworking a piece versus not doing enough. I myself certainly don’t count as an artist though I do spend a lot of time painting with oil pastels and have this struggle, feeling something is not complete or adequate but worrying any additional touches will spoil the frail beauty it does capture. I think of Bob Ross episodes where you are in awe at a striking landscape he has done and then Ross says it needs one more tree and crosses the entire canvas with a thick brush stroke. “Noooooo!” you want to shout, it was perfect, now it’s marred by this additional flourish yet, a few minutes later, you see it has now become the best part of the painting and tied it all together in ways moments ago you couldn’t ever dream imaginable. When people talk about narrative tension, perhaps this is the most pure of them, knowing you should trust Bob Ross to pull it off but feeling as gashed and dashed as the painting looks the moment he adds that new line.‘Giacometti is committed to his work in a particularly intense and total way. The creative compulsion is never wholly absent from him, never leaves him a moment of complete peace.’There is a certain fatalism to Giacometti, seeming rather gloomy and often destroying his work (there is a moment when Lord finds him in the parking lot tearing up a pile of his drawings). And his statements on how he cannot simply move to another part of a painting before completing the head really resonated with me as that is also my struggle with anything I work on. I write these s in one go from the top to the bottom and find the introduction to be the hardest part, but I simply cannot just start working on the body until I finish the intro. To do so always makes the rest feel false to me. It’s like when Giacometti tells Lord ‘everything must come of itself and in its own time. Otherwise, it becomes superficial.’ I read this for my book club and we had a discussion on his complaints about futility and while some found him to be frustrating and thought whiny, I felt it was delivered more as self-deprecating humor and likely said with a half smile and not meant fully serious, the type of jokes that hint at the truth but are softened by being said jokingly. Though that comes as someone who often employs self-deprecating humor as well as a means to grapple with one's own volatile self-reflections. Lord seems to see it as a good window into Giacometti’s feelings about himself as well. ‘This constant expression of self-doubt is neither an affectation nor an appeal for reassurance,’ Lord examines about Giacometti, ‘but simply spontaneous outpouring of his deep feeling of uncertainty as to the ultimate quality of his achievement.’‘[T]he possibility of reproducing exactly by means of brushes and pigment the sensation of vision caused by a particular aspect of reality. This, of course, is by definition an impossibility and yet for that very reason is endlessly enticing and valid.’We see Giacometti discuss art and other artists quite frequently as well, often criticizing Cezanne and Picasso (when asked what period of Picasso’s he likes best, Giacometti curtly replies ‘none’). As to his opinions on his own work he responds:‘I’m the first to think that they’re better than what anyone else does. But then I realize that that has absolutely no relation to what I hope to be able to do, so I conclude that really they’re no good at all.’I found great value in his thoughts on creating. ‘On might imagine,’ he tells Lord, ‘that in order to make a painting it’s simply a question of placing one detail next to another. But that’s not it. That’s not it at all. It’s a question of resting a complete entity all at once.’ He asserts that painting is not photography, and that even photography is capturing an impression of reality as opposed to “being” reality, and that art lies in the representation of the impression. He compares different styles of statue busts arguing in favor of the less perfect representations saying ‘the more you struggle to make it lifelike, the less like life it becomes. But since a work of art is an illusion anyway, if you heighten the illusory quality, then you come closer to the effect of life.’ This is an idea I really appreciate, and feel in fiction is how things like satire and magical realism, for example, often examine great truths through caricatures or distortions of reality to shake up the truth and see it from a fresh angle. Yet we can’t forget Lord in all this, who plays an important role as the model. ‘To be present by helpless, to be involved but removed,’ Lord says ‘made me uneasy,’ and he discusses how a deep relationship between artist and model often forms. I suppose this touches on the idea of the muse, and at times one wonders if the near-refusal to complete the work might be drawing from a desire to keep Lord near for longer. ‘It is often said that artists of great talent are able, and seek, to convey not only the external appearance but also the inner nature of their models,’ Lord writes, and I find this beautiful as it probes the idea that so much more beyond the visual image is contained in a painting.‘Everything must be destroyed. I have to start all over again from zero.’A brief but lasting little memoir on a prolonged session with an artist, A Giacometti Portrait is a blunt little gem of portrait of both artist and model. As well as a lovely look at the act of creating and the ideas that go into it. I will certainly pull this down from my shelf in years to come to revisit some of these fantastic lines, and while it is a book about art many of the ideas can be applied to a variety of life’s pursuits. 4.5/5...more",Notes are private!,1,106,1,"Jun 25, 2023","Jun 25, 2023","Jun 25, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/176943.A_Giacometti_Portrait

While I do have him inked on my r‘I will not and cannot believe that evil is the normal condition of mankind.’I have always loved reading Dostoevsky. While I do have him inked on my right arm, that love for him goes further than just skin deep, and there are so many moments where his writing and ideas seem to fit into the grooves of my brain like a key into a lock, opening up trails of thought where I realize with pleasure “yes, this is exactly what I want to be thinking about and oh how my entire being seems to dance to his rhythm.” Trails of thought like the most lush forest path during blissful early-autumn weather. Because, sure, it can be rather dark, but it is always in a way that gives hope too and pleads for empathy. Such is the case in his 1877 short work The Dream of A Ridiculous Man, a tale of a self-declared ridiculous man (surprise) spiraling into a sense of nihilism. After a brief encounter with a suffering girl, his desire to commit suicide is thwarted by a dream (surprise!) as if it were a Christmas eve with Dickens. Plunging us into a surreal dreamscape of a paradise as it succumbs to corruption and fractures into waring entities valuing individuality over love, and that ‘the consciousness of life is higher than life, the knowledge of the laws of happiness is higher than happiness.’ Described by Mikhail Bakhtin as ‘practically a complete encyclopedia of Dostoevsky’s most important themes,’ this is a brief but intense story delving into many of Dostoevksy’s signature themes such as grappling with nihilism, questioning utopias, and the meaning of suffering.‘I suddenly felt that it made no difference to me whether the world existed or whether nothing existed anywhere at all.’Our narrator begins in a state of ‘terrible anguish,’ finding the world lacking in meaning and already preparing to commit suicide with a gun previously purchased for such an occassion. We can read him not unlike Dostoevsky’s Underground Man, who’s opening self analysis ‘""I am a sick man ... I am a wicked man’ is mirrored by ‘I am a ridiculous person. Now they call me a madman.’ (All quotes taken from my copy using the Constance Garnett translation). The opening spoke strongly to me, for who hasn’t been frustrated by the world and all its absurdities, finding oneself ridiculous for participating in trading our irreplaceable hours of our one wild and precious life to endless labor, or wondering if there is meaning to anything at all. Especially when considering how one’s own demise would be insignificant in the long scheme of things, unless we adopt a solipsistic notion that the world vanishes without us. When he says ‘the more I learned, the more thoroughly I understood that I was ridiculous,’ I couldn’t help but think of this meme and how often learning not only makes you feel the world is absurd but also recognizing how little you know and understand about anything makes you indeed feel ridiculous.  [image]Yet how can one go on in this state of mind, which, as we see here, tends to bend the mind towards suicide-- something he would like to do if he can even see any meaning in doing so: ‘I was so utterly indifferent to everything that I was anxious to wait for the moment when I would not be so indifferent and then kill myself.’His brief encounter with a girl, suffering from some issue he thinks must be related to her mother, he finds his conscience biting him for not aiding her. This is thematic in Dostoevsky’s works, which often are a resistance to ideas of nihilism influenced by his own rejection of the Russian Nihilist Movement during his time. We see a similar issue in Crime and Punishment with Raskolnikov’s resolve towards nihilism shaken by his guilty conscience.‘if I had really decided to do away with myself that night, everything in the world should have been more indifferent to me than ever…It was clear to me that so long as I was still a human being and not a meaningless zero, and till I became a zero, I was alive, and consequently able to suffer, be angry, and feel shame at my actions. Very well. But if, on the other hand, I were going to kill myself in, say, two hours, what did that little girl matter to me and what did I care for shame or anything else in the world?’ Wrestling with his own conscience has him contemplating ideas that he is not as nihilistic as he thinks but how this is a waste if he is about to become nothingness, however the line of thought drags him to sleep.‘Dreams apparently proceed not from reason but from desire, not from the head but from the heart.’I’m really hit or miss on dreams being used as essential to a plot, but Dostoevsky pulls it off quite effectively here. I appreciate the way he almost anticipates this, discussing how his mention of the dream brought ridicule (though this is also tied in with the idea that preaching religion—there is certainly a God element to this as in most of his works—is met with mockery) and that surely he couldn’t have dreamed such vivid details. Well played. The dream brings us to a world that is a sort of paradise or utopia, styled like the Golden Age as in Greek mythology, particularly from Hesiod. But his presence corrupts them as he teaches them to lie and ‘they learned to lie and began to love the lie and knew the beauty of the lie.’ The idea that deceit is a powerful impulse takes over and we see the history of humanity play out as the lie starts a chain reaction of corruption. ‘They began to struggle for separation, for isolation, for individuality, for mine and thine. They began to talk in different languages. They became acquainted with sorrow and loved sorrow; they thirsted for suffering, and said that truth could only be attained through suffering. Then science appeared. As they became wicked they began talking of brotherhood and humanitarianism, and understood those ideas. As they became criminal, they invented justice and drew up whole legal codes in order to observe it, and to ensure their being kept, set up a guillotine. They hardly remembered what they had lost, in fact refused to believe that they had ever been happy and innocent. They even laughed at the possibility of this happiness in the past, and called it a dream.’What stands out is the idea that in their downfall and loss of innocence, they believe knowledge of happiness is greater than happiness. They define existence against suffering, and ideas of humanitarianism or brotherhood exist in opposition to suffering instead of simply living at peace. The irony becomes that they percieve paradise as impossibility, yet the narrator has seen that it is indeed possible. There are some interesting observations here, such as creating different temples of worship for the sake of dividing into faction that deep down know their gods are fiction (which, knowing Dostoevsky, is less a rejection of religion and more a kind of rejection of any religion aside from his as “false gods” sort of deal), as well as the idea of desiring individual rights or a sense of individualism is a root cause of humanity’s downfall.Yet this dream suddenly reverses his nihilism, and upon awakening, he has purpose again. ‘I made up my mind to preach from that very moment and, of course, to go on preaching all my life,’ he says and sees this dream as proof paradise is possible and that the key is empathy, compassion, and unity not just as various groups but encompassing everyone everywhere all at once. We also see, however, that in a world of suffering we also have choice, and that we should choose wisely. The lesson of the shame he felt was that, no, we are not indifferent and should not attempt to be, but should lean into compassion. His final line lets us know he has tracked down the girl and we can see this as the start of his ministry, as it were.‘Sorrow compressed my heart, and I felt I would die, and then... Well, then I woke up.’This tiny tale of a man’s transformation is such a succinct distillation of many of Dostoevsky’s primary themes and characterizations. As always, it is a rebuttal to nihilism, and the characters used to represent the idea are often shown as weak, naive, and hurting those around them due to their insistence on the belief. For a story that begins with suicide, it ends with hope and a call for love, one that is lovely to process regardless of its intended religious aims. Direct and beautifully emotive in its intensity, The Dream of a Ridiculous Man is pure Dostoevsky and a brief but lasting joy. ⅘‘The consciousness of life is higher than life, the knowledge of the laws of happiness is higher than happiness--that is what one must contend against. And I shall. If only everyone wants it, it can be arranged at once.’...more",Notes are private!,18,256,1,not set,not set,"Jun 23, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/329866.The_Dream_of_a_Ridiculous_Man

One to learn by heart.’Young love tosses us upon the waves of our emotions, recontextualizing all we see and dredges up the sunken ships of our inner selves to understand them anew. Such is the case for 16 year old Portuguese student, Raquel, when her fascination for the older, artsy Padalita begins to give way to deeper feelings in Joana Estrela’s Pardalita. A hybrid of visual storytelling with a graphic novel format complemented by stream-of-conscious blocks of prose bestowing just as vivid of imagery, Pardalita is a quiet tale of budding sapphic love that coalesces the small, disparate details into a beautiful portrait of a sexual awakening and coming-of-age. It is both breezy and melancholy—though more along the lines of an overcast day bringing a hushed, calming feeling than sadness—and the loose, simple art helps you just drift along the story as waves of narrative and Raquel’s recollections wash over you. This timidly progressing first awakening to romance aided with an education in classics like Sappho or the tale of Hero and Leander is a lovely little read that nails fragmented storytelling and moves with the pace and mannerisms of life.  [image]Joana Estrela’s use of blocks of prose accompanying the rather free flowing graphic novel might initially seem overly wordy for the medium, though I ended up find many of these sections to be the brightest gems in the book. Written almost like poetry—with flourishes such as listing verb conjugations for key terms in accordance with her homework—these sections capture the spirit of “show don’t tell” just as much as the actual visual artwork. Which is quite lovely in its simplicity and reminds me a bit of Marjane Satrapi’s art like in Persepolis but sparser. The story moves back and forth from the present narrative with Raquel’s reflections on childhood details and other musings, with all these different elements and their juxtapositions amalgamating into something surpassing the sum of its parts. We have, for example, Raquel describing her father having a new girlfriend (who he is to wed) not by telling us directly but listing all the changes to his apartment like noticing him suddenly having an interest in houseplants, or the appearance of an unknown jacket, a pair of slippers, a different brand of milk. ‘I met her later’ she says by way of letting the reader but it all together. Which is a microcosm of the way this whole story is made up of details that tell their own stories through the abstract spaces that unite them all. Even memories of youthful observances come into new meaning (sometimes even beyond Raquel) through the readers awareness of her coming to recognize sapphic desires.  [image]The story is very sweet too. Raquel and her friend Fred join the drama team which allows Raquel to be closer to Pardalita. As she begins to understand what her interest in the artistic girl means about herself, she also stresses over ‘how close I can get to you without raising red flags.’ We also have charming subplots, such as her divorced mother finally learning how to use the internet in order to listen to Rolling Stones music leading to her awakening in social justice activism and organizing. The story is threaded with references to art, such as a poem by Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen that reads in it’s entirety: ‘The muse, the siren / Her song loud and pure’. This succinctly captures so much about the story, such as Raquel’s attraction to Pardalita (she even recites this as one of the first things she ever says to Pardalita) and the powerful simplicity of the book itself.Pardalita was a lovely read that made for an enjoyable sitting in the sun and letting the confusing maelstrom of first awakenings to love wash over me. While the ending is abrupt, I also found that to be perfect as it just feels true. We can theorize what comes next and recognize how these things usually expire, but this story is about the awakening, the first steps, the putting together of the details to stand back and see how each individual brush stroke of life forms a portrait through their collaboration. 4/5  [image]...more",Notes are private!,0,115,1,"Jun 22, 2023","Jun 22, 2023","Jun 22, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/62675030-pardalita

Drop them into surviving a gothic fairy tale world and, well, perhaps the pressure will mold them into either a diamond or a demon. Such is the tale of twin sisters Jacqueline and Jillian in Seanan McGuire’s Down Among the Sticks and Bones, the second book in her Wayward Children series. For a short novel, McGuire deftly develops nuanced characters and her fantasy realm to stunning effect and creates a modern fairy tale teeming with thought provoking themes and lessons. Here we grapple with issues of expectations, of desiring to be who you are and not who others want you to be, and learning ‘that there were a hundred, a thousand, a million different ways to be a girl, and that all of them were valid.’ This is an eerie and heartbreaking tale that functions just as well as a standalone as part of the series and is a devilishly delightful read even when it feels like it is about to cover your mouth so nobody will hear you scream…‘It can be easy, in the end, to forget that children are people, and that people will do what people will do, the consequences be damned.’In the first installment of the series, Every Heart a Doorway, we meet Eleanor West and her home for children who have returned from fairy tales, taking in this fascinating place until a series of grizzly murders occurs and the culprit eventually is brought back to her world with her sister. We learn a lot about these fairy tale worlds, but never experienced them until now. Down Among the Sticks and Bones brings us Jack and Jill’s backstory, from their childhood with misguided parents to the Moors where a doorway they find in the attic delivers them. I quite enjoy how in their world they are divided between a vampire castle belonging to the Master and the giant windmill science lab of Dr. Bleak (clearly inspired by Dr. Frankenstein), making this land more or less a nightmarescape of Lord Byron who inspired both horror characters (and an excuse to direct you to my favorite goodreads  on Lord Byron being an asshole). Continuing a theme from the first, though, we see how the misunderstandings of parents can cause real hurt and harm to children.‘It can be easy, when standing on the lofty shores of adulthood, not to remember that every adult was once a child, with ideas and ambitions of their own…The trouble with denying children the freedom to be themselves—with forcing them into an idea of what they should be, not allowing them to choose their own paths—is that all too often, the one drawing the design knows nothing of the desires of their model.’We also see how social role expectations become divisive. We have Jacqueline, who the parents have decided is the pretty one and is coached into staying clean and always being in fancy dresses. Then there is Jillian who it has been decided is a tomboy, loves mud, and becomes a social outcast at school. The pressures to fulfill their roles drive a rift between them and we see ‘How quickly they grow apart, when there is something to be superior about.’ Which is a shame to see how much society pits people as opposites and instills distrust or rivalry where there should be cooperation and love. It is also how they ‘become the bundle of resentments and contradictions necessary to summon a door to the Moors.’‘One more piece of final, irrefutable proof that adults, in the end, were not and never to be trusted.’The land of the Moors, ‘a place of endless scientific experimentation, of monstrous beauty, and of terrible consequences,’ is an excellent gothic romp. While Jacqueline sees Dr. Bleak as an opportunity to discard the dresses and pristine life she hated and be Jack, Jill sees pleasing the Master, her new “father” as an opportunity to be the daughter her dad wanted. We see how and why the children who eventually end up in West’s home want to return to their fairy tales as they allow them to be who they truly are and loved for it. McGuire excels at embedding really progressive themes in lessons into her stories—the way a good fairy tale does—and one could certainly read much of the book as a trans metaphor and McGuire also offers a queer relationship as well.‘Every choice feeds every choice that comes after, whether we want those choices or no.’I appreciate how the plot moves quickly here, though never feels rushed and manages to be quite textured and nuanced. The world building is extraordinary for such a short book too. But we see how each character’s personalities, particularly Jill and her resentments and desire to be the “good daughter,” put everything on a path to ruin that leads to them being expelled from the world. It shows how the harm we put into the world triggers further harms, and if we were to just let people be who they are and appreciate them for that instead of trying to reshape or cast them aside for not being our socialized idea of them, the world could be a much better place.‘The best beauty was the sort that took some seeking.’A quick book that could certainly work as a standalone, I really enjoyed Down Among the Sticks and Bones and can’t wait to continue this series (I was all ready to dive through them and got distracted by Murderbot, but can you blame me?). McGuire’s themes are always so moving and her storytelling is excellent, with a nearly magical ability to accomplish so much in such a short space of time. And I can’t help but wonder, what fairy tale world would bring out the true you hidden inside?4/5‘Some adventures require nothing more than a willing heart and the ability to trip over the cracks in the world.’...more",Notes are private!,0,114,1,"Jun 21, 2023","Jun 21, 2023","Jun 21, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31450908-down-among-the-sticks-and-bones

Or is our trajectory so strongly determined by forces outside of us that we barely have any agency left. Such is the question in Mary Ventura and the Ninth Kingdom, a story written by Sylvia Plath when she was 20 years old and attending Smith College. It isn’t just the title, which takes its namesake from a high-school friend of Plath’s, that seems to invoke a spirit of epic fantasy, coming-of-age tales as Plath infuses her story with many of the genre elements such as threatening journey and an older mentor figure, all shrouded in menacing mystery. Drenched in a tone of lurking dread as what seems like an innocent train trip in waking reality begins to crumble into something ominously horrific, Mary Ventura and the Ninth Gate is an eerie, fun, and youthful story that displays Plath’s great promise, though also does read more like an artist attempting to discover their style and dressing it up in surreal, surprise twists.‘Everyone has to go away sooner or later.’Following a $500 winning prize from Mademoiselle magazine for her short story Sunday at the Mintons, Plath departed from her realist fiction to a ‘vague symbolic tale,’ as she called it, inspired by her recent love for the art of Giorgio de Chirico. The initial draft was rejected, and Plath would revise it many times, including a reworked version for a religious short story contest with a different ending to make it an allegory for, in Plath’s own words, passing ‘ through the temptation of the material world, grows aware of her own idealism and power to help others, and discovers the City of God.’ As Plath was herself an atheist, she eventually declined to submit it and the story has collected dust in her archives. It was recently published in its original form, which Plath scholars assert is the best version, and it is quite an exciting little story to read that gives early insight into her themes, though on it’s own it isn’t much more than a curio for Plath enthusiasts. Still we see Plath using surrealism to grapple with concepts of mental health struggles and taking agency in one’s life, something that would define further in Esther Greenwood of The Bell Jar.  [image]Giorgio de Chirico, Present and PastStill, it is a fun and unsettling tale, rather Dantean in its approach (Plath had recently read Inferno) with a story of a train passing through stations with increasing foreboding. She does an excellent job at building tone with striking imagery portending doom. The world is described as grey, smokey and eventually frozen over, with violent looking sunsets, lips the color of blood, an interior to the train with wine red colored upholstery where all the goings on of laughter and feasting takes on a tone of near-grotesque. ‘Guilt, the train wheels clucked like round black birds, and guilt, and guilt, and guilt,’ the girl observes, and the shift from regular reality to doom is best encapsulated when ‘adorable brothers across the aisle rapidly devolve into physical violence…blood oozed from a purpling bruise.’ Her use of color is fantastic here. As the journey progresses, the creeping feeling that something is not right takes hold of Mary.What the Ninth Kingdom is exactly we never learn for sure, and Plath does well by allowing her allegory to remain vague and interperetable. Whatever it is, it isn’t good and the woman who becomes Mary’s companion takes on a sort of potential guide—or possibly mentor—role.‘There are no return trips on this line,” the woman said softly. “Once you get to the ninth kingdom, there is no going back. It is the kingdom of negation, of the frozen will. It has many names.’We are all headed towards our deaths and Mary is horrified to see the passengers all laughing and carrying on in ways described with sexual or violent undertones as if the final stop at the Ninth Kingdom isn’t coming. The train is an apt setting as a force of unstoppable motion with a certain destination. ‘They are blind’ she is told, and perhaps we all are looking the other way and enjoying a ride that will end in death which seems a rather pessimistic look but through Plath we often see life simply as suffering. Mary’s pleas to escape are brushed aside and when she protests her parents made her take the trip she is reminded she negated her own agency by allowing them to force her. For all our follies, we could have made other decisions. ‘They just accept it when the time comes,’ the woman says. But perhaps she can find ‘the one assertion of the will remaining’ and escape.The story is certainly open for interpretation and can be read as any means of taking our lives into our own hands and escaping an overwhelming bleakness. Though knowing mere months after writing this Plath had her first suicide attempt does nudge a hindsight reading of the ending plausibly being about simply taking ones own life to espace. Plath has been criticized for using historical tragedies such as the holocaust as metaphors for her own personal struggles, as well as the racism in The Bell Jar, and the repeated mention of the waiter as Black here seems a bit cumbersome though is also one of the several ways she denotes class differences between the passengers and the crew. The train taking them to their doom may be a holocaust reference (there are quick asides about mass arrests and executions) but is used in its own way here, so make of any of that what you will. It does feel like the sort of story one comes up with in college, where the surreal twist “reality isn’t reality at all!” feels much more fresh (this was the 1950s though so perhaps it feels a bit stale after how frequently that was a narrative trick in 1990s films and books) and while it reads like a younger Plath, it still reads quite impressively.Mary Ventura and the Ninth Kingdom is an unearthed nugget of literary history that fans of Sylvia Plath will no doubt love to discover and trace the trajectory of her themes on suffering and women attempting to wrestle back their own agency. While I wouldn’t recommend it as anyone’s first introduction to her, it is still an engaging and thought provoking story for those who aren’t very familiar with Plath as well. Short, surreal, and scorching the reader in dread, this is a fun, eerie little read from the vaults.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,0,96,1,"Jun 17, 2023","Jun 17, 2023","Jun 17, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/42980964-mary-ventura-and-the-ninth-kingdom

Or, if you happen to be the failed poet in Atsushi Nakajima’s classic Japanese tale The Moon Over the Mountain, it remains out of paws reach. The story concerns Li Zheng, who after a quick rise and great promise, left his government job to pursue poetry, failed to achieve success and then suddenly vanished only to appear years later, cursed to be transforming into a tiger. Now I’ve written some shit poetry in my time, but thankfully the consequences weren't to be turned into a tiger. Though with the rising cost of living, maybe the joke is on me? Anyways, I was thrilled to discover Penguin’s new series, Maiden’s Bookshelf, which will combine early 20th century short stories with contemporary artwork, such as the gorgeous and arresting artwork here from nekosuke. I mean, check it out:  [image]This is a brief story, the title story to one of only two collections Atsushi Nakajima published before he tragically died of asthma at the age of 33. Much of his works draw on classical Chinese stories and myths, reinvigorated with a deeply introspective flair. This story, which is also known by the title The Tiger Poet and often read in classrooms, is drawn from the Tang Dynasty. The story reunites Li Zheng with a former friend, Yuan Can, who has nearly been devoured by a tiger after failing to heed the advice of an innkeeper warning of such a man-eating beast. He hears Li Zheng’s tale and the curse that allows him to return human for waning amounts of time before he will finally be all tiger and rage. He suspects the curse was due to his arrogance, pushing away everyone and withdrawing from society to be a poet, yet so overconfident in his natural abilities he failed to seek assistance to sharpen his skills or put any real effort in:‘Out of fear that I might turn out not to be a genius, I hesitated to polish the uncut gemstone of my own potential; but, convinced I had a gift, I was not content to remain in the rough.’I know Ted Lasso told us all to believe in ourselves, but not to the extent that it becomes an arrogance that tears us apart and, in fact, keeps us from our goals. And we also can’t live in constant fear that we will be found out to be an imposture (if you figure out how to do that, please let me know) or fret so much over potentially not being a genius that we never actually create.  [image]He also realizes that his desire to save his poetry is more important to him than even letting his family know what happened to him might also indicate he is an asshole. This is a tale about an artist but you can render it to fit many parts of life and is likely what makes this such a great story for classrooms. Because ‘this arrogant shame was my inner beast: the tiger,’ and if we let our own arrogance get the best of us we too become a beast. And though the fairy tales will have you believe you can kidnap a fair maiden and if she loves you, you get to turn human again I’m going to strongly advise against trying that. Legally, morally, socially, just not a good look.  [image]I love this little hardcover edition and the art is really gorgeous. It feels more in the spirit of the story than actually art depicting the story and often the artwork is apropos of nothing in the text on the page opposite it, but it’s so lovely it hardly matters. And the translation by Asa Yoneda is smooth and highly readable.

Alina Pleskova p‘Wonder is coming back for us, but not yet’This book is so hard hitting I might need to put some ice on my entire essence to recover. Alina Pleskova pummels you with her prose across the course of Toska, perfectly capturing the cocktail of spiraling modern anxieties and dread that we drink to numb ourselves from. With a wry and witty gallows humor that comes with watching what might be the collapse of a neoliberal hellscape all around us, Pleskova examines themes of immigrant identity, queerness and desire in a world where everything is converted into consumerism. Toska is a book that will have you nervously laughing along to hide the sads creeping in as each poem so strikingly shakes us up and makes us feel. The poems twist and dance to a rhythm of modern living, shuffling from topics where at any time ‘some remarkable disruption could arrive in the middle of things’ in their circuitous route of examining truths that manages to avoid feeling overly sporadic. Grim yet gorgeous, I devoured Toska only to realize that it had devoured me.‘All around me, women grip the buoys of their autonomy to stay afloat until personhood washes up on the shores of no nation.’I began reading this in the waiting room of a toddler’s gymnastics class, which somehow feels an ideal setting to have this collection slap you around and push all your buttons on the discomforts of modern living. Pleskova comes out hard with Take Care (read it here), ushering us into a voyage of crushing capitalism, constant anxieties, delivery robots, ‘microdosing Adderall’, in a world where ‘everyone seems too woke or weary for a ruinous type of intimacy’ and ‘luckiest among us score mental health days— / what might, in an alternate timeline / be the ability to simply exist.’ It’s practically a thesis statement of a poem for what the collection will bring, particularly the hard-hitting moments on being from one land in a new land and stuck somewhere between them. The subjects in poems shift just as much as she explores the way identities shift and one person is many things, like Walt Whitman telling us ‘I contain multitudes.’ She perfectly captures the way everything can feel exhausting and overwhelming and how we are all just trying to get by the best we can, or, as she puts it, ‘We’ve each got our own way of keeping / the lights on.’ ‘In adapting to regional customs, / one becomes a citizen of border & bootstrap mythologies,’ Permeating these poems is a poetic investigation of national identities and retaining her Russian heritage while living in the US. ‘The country where I live— / its surveillance of us surveilled by the country I’m from,’ she writes, along with discussions of watching old Soviet animations for ‘secondhand nostalgia,’ feeling pride when ‘when someone compliments my undiluted pronunciation,’ references to Marina Tsvetaeva and an infusion of Slavic folklore. ‘Our people prefer their tea & humor darker,’ she writes in Our People Don’t Believe in Tears , accounting for the style of humor that livens up this collection and binds it to her heritage as well. Though she sums it all up most effectively in the title poem, Toska, where she writes:Cautionary tales about crones& hungry wolves & wicked heartslost, like so much else, in the gapbetween the old world & thisamerikanka, launching immigrantdaughter guilt into the receiverwhile my mother gains tractionin the hatched narrative that she'll diebefore her firstborn's settled.Pleskova also acknowledges how she must ‘regard my debts to our legion,’ looking not only at Russian heritage but also the long history of those for who being queer meant having to hide but fighting so that one day future generations would not have to. ‘To be legible / is a release’ she writes, and I love the beauty of that statement of being able to present openly and finding the freedom in it. This feels especially pertinent reading it during Pride Month in a country where, despite all the incredible gains where queerness is legal and open, there have been many pushbacks and legislation trying to erase all the work and make our identities illegible again. That the quickest way for a book to face a banning is to be a queer or Black author is quite telling.

Just having an unholy place to rest, set all this down.-from Re:ErosYet also we have ‘devotion like the best cure / you can hope to suffer’ and it all seems to bend towards an excavation of the truth that our modern living is so overly stuffed with erasing any part of us that isn’t either being a worker or consumer for the benefit of the rich that the space for processing love and desire is too fragile. Or comes with a price tag. ‘Nothing is free in America— // that’s every first gen’s starting inheritance—but most anything / can become commerce.’ We are all stuck doing the ‘Mental math on what I can afford to enjoy.’ Yet while everything is depicted as rather bleak, there is still the celebration of us all dealing with it as best as we can:Here’s to the rest of us, fixated on cosmic dealings ancient beyond human intervention.

Now, no, it’s not Magic School Bus learning the sciences, but what delights me so much is that his books are learning the arts. The Katie series explores famous paintings (I’ve always loved the one where Katie gets chased through various impressionist paintings and hangs out with the Degas dancers) and the Ella Bella books, such as Ella Bella Ballerina and Swan Lake which was an absolute favorite of my oldest child, explore different famous ballets. This was one I could recite with my eyes closed, though you’ll want to keep them open because of how lovely the artwork is:  [image]Ella Bella meets OdetteNow I have a 3 year old who was SO eager to start doing ballet but this fall was having trouble…staying on task. So my oldest and I spent a few days super prepping her for the next class getting excited about dancing. We showed her Leap!, which once again became a constant rotation in the house, and I dug up the Ella Bella books. This quickly became a favorite (we read it again last night and I once again can probably read it with my eyes closed) and we had her SO pumped up for ballet class, even got there a bit early….only to remember it was the start of Christmas break and there was no class that week. But it was the magical turning point and she has loved class ever since, even had her first recital last weekend. Do I credit Ella Bella? Maybe. But for real, this book is really adorable. In each of the books, Madame Rosa shows the class the music for a famous ballet and when Ella Bella lingers on stage to hear the music more she is transported into the story of the ballet to assist the characters. Here we see her try to scout out for Rothbart, try (and fail) to warn the Prince that it is Odile in disguise, and aid the Prince in defeating Rothbart (this version ends happily ever after--it is for kids).  [image]At the end of each book there is a little history about the ballet, written where it isn’t over a child’s head but almost more aimed at the parent reading it to learn some cool stuff too. I always LOVED when there were information pages at the end of a book as a kid. Ella Bella and Swan Lake is a gorgeously illustrated story that is not only adorable, but enjoyable for both children and the adults reading it. Which is a hard line to straddle as I often feel like many picture books are sort of for the adult and not that engaging for the kid, or are just dumb fun for the kid but annoying as hell to read enthusiastically. James Mayhew always nails it and I’d recommend these or any of the Katie books to art loving parents to share that joy with the young ones in their lives.

Amy Chu andPredating Dracula by 25 years, Sheridan Le Fanu’s chilling and sapphic vampire tale, Carmilla, has survived as a classic of gothic horror. Amy Chu and artist Soo Lee’s gorgeous graphic novel Carmilla: The First Vampire brings us to Chinatown, NYC in 1996 as a sort of modern retelling, drawing on Le Fanu’s text both thematically and as an actual insert to the plot with our heroine, social worker Athena Lo, reading it as part of her investigation. There has been a string of murders in the city and social worker Athena Lo realizes many of them are young, unhoused women that are her clients. With the police seemingly apathetic to the disappearances, Athena takes matters into her own hands at the risk of her life and—once she begins to protect another potential target named Violet who is as strangely alluring as she is manipulative—her relationship. Amplifying the sapphic aspects of the original tale in a new story where Chinese mythology and European folklore collide, Carmilla: The First Vampire is as satisfying for newcomers as well as those familiar with the original tale and makes for a sinisterly seductive read. So come right on in…  [image]This updated tale provides a rather intriguing and dynamic look at concepts of immigrant identity, with Athena being the grandchild of her Chinese grandfather (the grandfather is easily the best character in the book) and facing anti-Asian racism for not being seen as American enough while also feeling overly removed from her Chinese heritage. In this way, the blend of both European vampiric lore as well as Chinese deities and demons functions as a representation of amalgamating identities. There is a real engaging playfulness with the blending of narratives and imagery brought to life by Amy Chu and Soo Lee here, with Lee’s rather lovely artwork (the color palettes are quite striking and eye catching) seamlessly incorporating both a gothic vibe with Chinese artwork while bringing 1996 Chinatown to life. The story, set during the Chinese New Year becoming the Year of the Rat, also plays thematically into the story.  [image]Fans of Sheridan Le Fanu’s story will enjoy the way the novel figures so prominently into the book. When Athena discovers several of the murders occur near a queer night club, Carmilla’s, she steals a copy of the original book to read. Passages of the story are read in the text, as well as quoted by characters, and while those familiar with the story will undoubtedly put together a few key surprises before Athena does it never feels like it detracts from the enjoyment. I really enjoyed the way it remained true to aspects such as the mood swings and being rather sick during the day (assumed to be due to drug use here) or that the Millarca/Carmilla anagram also comes up. I also really appreciated how much this story emphasizes the queer aspects, with many gay, lesbian and trans characters included in the story. It also plays with class aspects a bit, with the vampire victims being unhoused people (instead of peasants) which opens a lot of opportunity for the story to discuss the necessity for society to care more about these people as well as show how quickly someone can suddenly find themselves in a bad situation without a home. As providing avenues and resources for the growing unhoused population plays into a lot of work we do at the library, this is a topic I find very important and I was glad to see it so pronounced and tactfully addressed here.Fans of gothic or monster horror will not want to miss this exciting and eerie modern retelling of Carmilla. The end does come a bit abruptly (as did the original though) and it sort of forces in. subplot at the end which seems to be opening the door for sequels that felt a little unnecessary though would likely feel more at home if this does in fact become a series. But overall I quite enjoyed this. It is a real visual treat (and you don’t even have to suck any blood!) and is quite engaging in the way it mixes folklore for maximum effect.

Through retellings, stories are not only passed along and retained, but often reshaped and reexamined, adding a larger texture and nuance and growing the myths. The Song of Achilles, the debut novel from Madeline Miller, is another in a long tradition of retellings of the Greek myths and zooms in from the large, sweeping epic scale of the Trojan War tales into an intimate and largely interior look at the relationship between Patrocles and Achilles. It is a deeply moving portrait of a lifelong love between the two, traversing the years together from training in the wilderness with Chiron to the violent years in the siege of Troy that immortalized Achilles name even to this day. By reframing the tale through the eyes of an otherwise minor mortal in the vast battle—beautiful in his naïvety, frustrations and hope—Miller reminds us that every life contains a universe of loves and hopes, fears and griefs. Mostly adhering to the tale as you know it, Miller writes in an accessible and engaging prose that plucks each emotional string in your heart as Achilles’ song on the lute does to Patrocles, passing along the tale for a new generation.‘We were like gods at the dawning of the world, & our joy was so bright we could see nothing else but the other.’Retellings fascinate me and I think are a really cool way to honor the traditions of storytelling. In his 1955 publication of The Greek Myths, historian Robert Graves was concerned the classics had gone so far out of popular consciousness that even ‘an educated man’ wasn’t expected to know the references. Yet today Greek mythology continues to exist in pop culture and while many were still writing myth retellings before Miller, the continued popularity of The Song of Achillesstill hitting bestseller lists 12 years after its publication in 2011—and her follow up, Circe has spurred a huge revival in myth retellings (from where I sit right now at the bookstore, there are at least 4 on the New In display from the past few months). Personally, I find this to be exciting as a continuation of oral retellings into printed retellings but people can have strong opinions on versions especially if they liked an older one. This puts Miller in a tricky spot, especially with a debut where there isn’t any goodwill built up in the reader yet. In his book Retelling Stories, Framing Culture, John Stephens says that there is ‘a tendency…to privilege similarity over difference,’ which is a dilemma constructing retellings because deviating from whichever version of a tale someone finds to be their subjective best is met with criticism (look at how upset people still are over Disney dropping the Star Wars Expanded Universe from canon). While Graves might be pleased to know the Greek classics references are even known by children thanks to films like Disney’s Hercules, Rick Riordan’s Percy Jackson series, or countless videogames, we also have to wonder if the strong deviations from the tales in his book would irk him the way Jack Zipes utterly despises any children's films of old fairy tales as diluting the story (I like to think of them as ""versions"" that can lead you to the originals, personally. Like gateway drugs for literature). If I have one criticism of Song of Achilles, it is perhaps that it didn’t change things enough as I really enjoy when authors use retellings as a catalyst for an idea beyond the retelling, such as discussing having an Atlas complex in our own lives as Jeanette Winterson does in Weight. I do feel there is likely a balance on intent, how much is changed, and for what reason, which is why retellings set modern day are given less scrutiny and with this book being as immersed in the idea of just telling the story from a personal perspective, see how it opens it up for more splitting hairs on details. But then again, the Greek myths are not corporate IP and even The Iliad is just an author's interpretation on a long line of oral telling. There is no objective canon, just versions and that is cool so just have fun with it. It’s a mythology of mythologies, do whatever you want and just do it well.I enjoy where Miller deviates and I think the intentions are well accomplished in many places. In Homer, we understand Patrocles to be a strong warrior, not quite the match of Achilles, but certainly more so than he is presented here. Which is where memory and retellings come in. Telling the story from his perspective allows us to see him how he saw himself and in supposed real-time, making the traditional view of him one that was formed because of his story being told long after his death drawing on assumptions from his shared tomb with Achilles. It is not only a retelling, but a shifting of perspectives. We see Odysseus as rather different even between her two books because Patrocles and Circe have different perspectives on him. While perhaps there is an argument to be made this book doesn’t have the same scholarly value as other versions or the source material, I think it resonated with me quite strongly and to me that’s what matters most. But I also don’t find much joy in disliking things and tend to try to open myself to enjoying them so I guess take what I say with a grain of salt.‘He is half of my soul, as the poets say. He will be dead soon, and his honor is all that will remain.’What I’m getting at is my fears of this being too similar and not holding up was instantly abated because I simply loved reading this. It validates its own reason for a retelling because it puts us inside the battle that feels huge around us and not for the purpose of glorifying the strongest of the people killing each other over some rich asshole deciding his wife leaving him was excuse enough for mass murder but to show how love is tested and tortured under such a conflict. Miller points out in an interview that, while ‘Homer tells us what his characters do, he doesn’t tell us much of why they do it,’ and I enjoy the way she dives into the psychology of the why. And, for Patroclus, that why is love. Which I suppose is the best why. Even when you are doing something ill-advised like throwing on some armor to uphold your lover's image and promptly finding yourself pants shittingly dead at the end of Hector’s blade. Because that scene hit me in all the feelings. But for real, have tissues on hand for the last bit of this one. ‘I could recognize him by touch alone, by smell; I would know him blind, by the way his breaths came and his feet struck the earth. I would know him in death, at the end of the world.’This book is endlessly quotable and the overall telling earns the individual lines, making it still fresh with poetry despite being in prose form. I think the love story was successful as it manages to seem subversive in the present without having to actually really be, and doesn’t fall victim to imposing modern moralizing onto historical events. Reading it today when books having queer content are being removed from shelves—or when it first was published in 2011 before the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges US Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage—seems pointed but scholars have argued this sort of relationship, especially amongst nobility, would have not been a scandal and Achilles and Patrocles being lovers doesn’t really raise any eyebrows in the book. Many have previously asserted the pair as lovers, similar with Alexander the Great and Hephaestion, including a nod to it in Plato’s The Symposium (where Miller says she stole the idea). As Miller says:’The idea that Patroclus and Achilles were lovers is quite old…We even have a fragment from a lost tragedy of Aeschylus, where Achilles speaks of his and Patroclus’ “frequent kisses.” There is a lot of support for their relationship in the text of the Iliad itself, though Homer never makes it explicit. For me, the most compelling piece of evidence, aside from the depth of Achilles’ grief, is how he grieves: Achilles refuses to burn Patroclus’ body, insisting instead on keeping the corpse in his tent, where he constantly weeps and embraces it—despite the horrified reactions of those around him. That sense of physical devastation spoke deeply to me of a true and total intimacy between the two men.’The emotional intensity of this scene burns so brightly in the book you could read it on a moonless night. I do enjoy seeing their relationship tested and I think Miller does an interesting job portraying the different paths they take during the conflict with Patroclus opting to be a medic instead of a warrior while Achilles seems misguided using violence as a path to fame. Some of the bits, such as Achilles freeing Briseis, are framed in a way that feel a bit too much like “okay but looks he’s not all bad” though I was fine with having Achilles being morally gray on the darker shade of the spectrum because Patroclus still loving him in spite of his rage and disgust at him was beautiful enough to nod need to sugar coat anything. ‘The never-ending ache of love and sorrow. Perhaps in some other life I could have refused, could have torn my hair and screamed, and made him face his choice alone. But not in this one. He would sail to Troy and I would follow, even into death.’The lesson from Chiron is well baked into the story, that ‘no man is worth more than another, wherever he is from,’ and one can certainly interpret Song of Achilles as an thematically anti-war without being overly heavy handed. Odysseus reminds Patroclus ‘He’s going to Troy to kill men, not rescue them…’ and we know a fall is coming and that the promise of glory on a battlefield is merely manipulation to get young men to lay down their lives for the glory of some king. In The Odyssey, Odysseus speaks with the ghost of Achilles who laments having chosen the quick route to fame and quick route to death than the long, uneventful life, but here I think Miller elegantly constructs a portrait of a young boy who has been so talked up by his fate and by his mother, the sea nymph Thetis (unpopular opinion but I loved Thetis in this, I loved how terrifying Miller made her and her portrayal as symbolic of the cruelty of the gods just stuck the landing for me), that he had the optimistic hubris to think he could have it all. ‘They never let you be famous AND happy,’ Achilles says to Patroclus, insisting ‘I'm going to be the first…because you’re the reason.’ Shit, I got chills just retyping that scene, its this beautiful naivete that you hold in your memory even when he is at his worst and weep for the downfall of the boy Patroclus once knew. And loved. And will love still. ‘I will never leave him,’ he says. That no amount of violence, shame or even the wrath of Agamemnon can bring Achilles down but the loss of his companion reduces him to tears and sets forth the fateful end is telling of the importance of their love to him as well.“There is no law that gods must be fair, Achilles,” Chiron said. “And perhaps it is the greater grief, after all, to be left on earth when another is gone. Do you think?”I could ramble about this book for a long time because it just really moved me and was a joy to read from start to finish. It has the feel of an epic without being epic in length, and Miller blends the romance with the action and political playmaking like an expert bartender ready to get you drunk on her art.The victors write the histories—as the saying goes—and Patroclus is pleading to push aside the ideas of glory in battle to focus on emotional connection as the true lasting glory. This is a very intimate and gorgeous novel that harnesses the power of retellings to create a rather lovely tale to pass along for the next generation and once again have us remember the names of Achilles and Patroclus.3.75/5‘The sorrow was so large it threatened to tear through my skin.

Francisco De La Mora's lovely graphic biography, Frida Kahlo: Her Life, Her Works, Her Home, takes us on an artistic journey through the life of the great artist, from her childhood sheltering the Zapataristas in her parent’s home, her tragic accident that left her bed-ridden for much of her days, her love for husband Diego Rivera, her miscarriages, and her travels to the US and Europe. Known for a folk art style with surreal imagery and arresting portraits, Kahlo’s work is immediately recognizable and often deals with themes of pain and, as described by André Breton, ‘wonderfully situated at the point of intersection between the political (philosophical) line and the artistic line.’ This short graphic novel is a lovely look into her life, illustrated in a style rather reflective of her own, and was a quick but enjoyable read.  [image]Growing up in Detroit, Mi, I had access to a truly amazing art museum, the DIA and was at all times waiting to visit it again. In one of the rooms was a large, 27 panel fresco depicting the Detroit auto industry in celebration of the worker, complete with a lot of rather surreal panels around it such as hands coming out of a mountain. I was enthralled by this—I mean it is huge and you can spin around and look at it for hours—especially so as my father worked for Ford Motor Co. and I saw this mural as celebratory of our family as well as the area I lived and so at a young age I became very interested in the art of Diego Rivera. Now Diego rules, but this fascination very quickly lead me to discover the artwork of Frida Kahlo and there, that was when I realized WOW I love art and this feeling of fascination and vague discomfort yet beauty I saw when I looked at it. I also loved knowing she had lived nearby during her time in the US with Rivera, it was like my first taste of “local pride” I think, even though the pair are usually associated with their home in Mexico (Kahlo and Rivera would live in two separate houses connected by a bridge, which I’ve always found rather lovely as they gave each other space but were never really apart). As a big fan of Kahlo, this of course led me to who I would probably now saw are my favorites, Remedios Varo and Leonora Carrington, but I always think about the amazing work Kahlo did in her short life.   [image]Diego Rivera mural at the Detroit Institute of ArtI enjoyed this little graphic novel and while it was rather brief, it does cover a lot of details about her life and never feels like it is overly shallow but also doesn’t overload you with details and dates. You see the important things and I learned quite a bit I didn’t know. She lived a fascinating life, and while she was hindered by chronic pain she knew many famous people and did incredible things. Being stuck in bed for over a year after the accident on the bus led her to begin painting a lot and many of her works depict pain and herself laying down as she was not very easily mobile, which is tragic as she already had difficulty with mobility during her childhood due to polio. But here we get to see her life with Diego, having Leon Trotsky live in her home when he fled Russia, Frida finding André Breton but thankful he gave her an exhibit in Paris (though she did not enjoy Europe and spent much of her time there in the hospital) and more. The art is done in a rather folk art way (not unlike Kahlo’s) and I enjoy the large frames though some of the looser art in the smaller frames seemed a bit lackluster to me and mostly just isn’t my favorite style. Still, it is quite pleasing and effective.  [image]Frida and DiegoI’ve long loved the works of Frida Kahlo and I hope this book inspires others to discover that same joy for themselves. This book seems more geared to someone still rather new to the artists and hoping to get a look at her biographical information more than those who would already be well-versed in her life but it is still a lovely read for anyone. 3.5/5  [image]...more",Notes are private!,0,118,1,not set,not set,"Jun 09, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/61783881-frida-kahlo

Tutuola’s second novel, this follow-up to The Palm-Wine Drinkard reads in a very similar fashion of meanderingly episodic tales that infuses Yoruba folklore and culture with that of European and Christian colonialism and brings us face to face with the trickery and treachery of ghosts and beasts. Bewilderingly imaginative, this surreal odyssey even inspired David Byrne (of the Talking Heads) and Brian Eno to collaborate on an album of the same name (though Byrne admits neither of them have actually ever read the book and just felt the title ‘seemed to encapsulate what this record was about’). A fun and mind-bending look at traditional folklore all told in a unique voice, My Life in the Bush of Ghosts is an entertaining read, if a bit cumbersome at times, that is surprise after surprise and worth the journey.‘I was too young to know that it was a dreadful bush or it was banned to be entered by any earthly person’Entering the “bush” is no small undertaking in this novel, and across these pages we watch the narrator go from ghost town to ghost town, always having to quickly adapt to the expectations of each place and navigating the oddities therein. Tutuola delivers a cavalcade of creepy, ghostly characters that seem almost if Miyazaki told of a terrifying fever dream. We have ghosts that enter a womb to be born sickly in order to steal the parent’s money they will offer to the gods for the child’s health, ghosts with televisions for hands, bloodthirsty spider beasts, ghostly kings and more in this book where having a multitude of heads or eyes is just something you’ll get used to. Our narrator travels the bush in a sort-of bildungsroman, going through multiple marriages, jobs in various ghost towns, and even having to overthrow his own slave-holding brother.The story and construction of it is very similar to The Palm-Wine Drinkard, with non-traditional phrasing and poetic license with words that add to the surreal nature and destabilize you in Tutuola’s ethereal realm. I found this one to benefit from being more structured than Palm-Wine had been (though it is still more a collection of tales threaded together, and not always in chronological order) though having read this perhaps too soon after I found the former to give off more imaginative enthrallment while this felt like much of the same as I had read already there. Which isn’t a bad thing, and this is still so imaginative and magical but I was thankful it isn’t altogether very long. One thing I really appreciated was the emphasis on music here. There is a lovely notion that music was able to reach a inner memories of childhood wonder that breaks down his brother, but there is also mention of how beautiful music of the ghost realm turns out to actually be a lost boy stuck in a log hunted by a snake. Suffering turned into beauty sort of idea, and how for the realm of ghosts the ideas of right and wrong just does not exist. Something else that I felt really works is the nearly timeless feel to the narrative where often you assume it must be set way in the past but then there are nods to modern (well of the 1950s) technology like phones and televisions. Tutuola is good at destabilizing all your senses as a reader.My Life in the Bush of Ghosts is an eerie, surreal tale that feels much like listening to a collection of stories in the oral tradition, threading an epic odyssey in order to tell multiple stories of different ghosts and other folklore. It is a fascinating look at a realm of the dead, and also confronts issues of christian colonialism and the way it tries to erase indigenous culture and impose conformity. Often violently. It is not the easiest of reads, with rather circuitous storytelling that often feels like overly long lists, but it is also thought provoking and fascinating.

This is especially unfortunate for the body, as he entered a room alone and wound up dead without any evidence of anyone else following him. Buckle up, fellow Space nerds because these books rule and this thrilling installment of the Murderbot Diaries (the 6th book in the series but 5th in the timeline) becomes a whodunit detective tale with a locked room mystery to crack. It is chock full of snarky fun to be had because Murderbot must actually communicate with the humans on Preservation Station who not only don’t trust them but have limited their ability to hack systems and roam free. Just because robots are considered people here doesn’t mean there isn’t prejudice, and also doesn’t mean our charmingly pessimistic narrator wants to be treated like a human. Martha Wells never fails at bringing pure joy, comedy and plenty of high-tension, sci-fi ass kicking and Fugitive Telemetry is another exciting and unstoppably lovable edition to the series.‘Trying to get humans not to touch dangerous things was a full-time job.’I love these stories. I enjoy how this episode sort of zooms in and gives us what seems a lower-stakes, small scale adventure, brought to life in uproarious fashion with Murderbot having to play detective around a bunch of humans who initially hate them. But don’t worry, Murderbot hates them too but will play nice enough so that Dr. Mensah doesn’t get in trouble. We are treated to a lot of chuckles with situation ending such as ‘I know a “fuck off” when I hear one. So I fucked off,’ and awkward accusations against Murderbot for just…being good at what they go. ‘Don’t look at me like that’s my fault. I’m just telling you shit I know.’ As one would expect (and hope) shit eventually hits the fan, tensions get high and there is only one hero to save them all (insert bugle-horns): MURDERBOT blasting through to victory leaving a pile of dead assholes behind them (applause applause!) No but for real, Wells writes action scenes so visually and enthusiastically it might as well be a big blockbuster with a budget larger than most city governments exploding and entertaining you on a theater screen. And I LOVE IT.‘Sometimes you have to look into every possibility, even the dumb ones.’But also PI Murderbot is such a fun trope to play with. It makes perfect sense for what they do anyways and gives a great opportunity for some fantastically curmudgeonly lines and interactions. Fugitive Telemetry also tackles ideas of building trust and earning respect from people who wanted to hate you for who (well, more like “what”) you are. Murderbot does so by being perfect and proving them wrong and not rubbing it in too much, and its all so fun and I was cheering and clapping and dancing and loving the whole damn thing. Seriously, how are these so fun? ‘It had been such a stupid question, I had forgotten not to have an expression.’This story is much more standalone than the rest (which are fairly stand-alone still) and without seeming like it is advancing the overall narrative arch I could see arguments that it feels slightly filler-ish. But nah. It’s too fun and good and who cares, its a great ride. This is another stunner and I’m starting to panic that I only have one book left (well two, when the new one comes out in November).

With a style that is as accessible as it is ponderous and moving, Oliver’s poetry elegantly examines life from the thin barrier between human and wild animal, our companionship with the world, to the confrontation and acceptance of darkness. Her words capture our finite existence in all its wonders and beauty where even ‘a box full of darkness’ can be understood ‘that this, too, was a gift.’ I’ve been reading Oliver for years and every time I think I’ve exhausted her collections for poems that nearly knock me to the floor I discover another and its like the sky opening up and all of the cosmos raining down into my heart. She’s absolutely perfect. Those looking for an in-depth and expansive look at her works should certainly turn to Devotions, a selected poems spanning her entire career from her first collection, No Voyage and Other Poems, published in 1963 when Oliver was only 28, to her final book in 2015, Felicity. Though Oliver passed in 2019 at the age of 83, her poetry will live on and I suspect that as long as poems are being read, she will be a name remembered for generations to come.Don’t HesitateIf you suddenly and unexpectedly feel joy,don’t hesitate. Give in to it. There are plentyof lives and whole towns destroyed or aboutto be. We are not wise, and not very oftenkind. And much can never be redeemed.Still, life has some possibility left. Perhaps thisis its way of fighting back, that sometimessomething happens better than all the richesor power in the world. It could be anything,but very likely you notice it in the instantwhen love begins. Anyway, that’s often the case.Anyway, whatever it is, don’t be afraidof its plenty. Joy is not made to be a crumb.Growing up in Ohio, Oliver said in one of her rare interviews that she ‘felt those first important connections, those first experiences being made with the natural world rather than with the social world.’ Perhaps for this reason much of her poetry uses the natural world as the lens through which she peers into the human heart and mind. At 17, Oliver would befriend Norma, the sister to poet Edna St. Vincent Millay, and spend most of a decade organizing St. Vincent Millay’s papers while working for her estate. She attended Ohio State University and Vassar College without finishing a degree, but once her first collection of poetry came out her career as a poet was well under way and she would later teach while working as a poet-in residence at several colleges before finishing her career as Chair for Distinguished Teaching at Bennington College. Her collections are also highly decorated, winning the Pulitzer Prize for American Primitive as well as the National Book Award for New and Selected Poems While at the St. Vincent Millay estate she would meet Molly Malone Cook, who would become her life-long partner as well as agent until Molly passed in 2005. Molly had previously owned a bookstore where she employed a young John Waters before he became a celebrated filmmaker and the couple maintained a friendship with him for the remainder of their lives. Though my favorite anecdote is that, while working as Mary’s agent, whenever a call came in for her, Molly would just pretend to be her on the phone and eventually editors just came to accept her as the same as actually speaking to Mary.  [image]Molly and Maryto live in this worldyou must be ableto do three thingsto love what is mortal;to hold itagainst your bones knowingyour own life depends on it;and, when the time comes to let it go,to let it go-from, In Blackwater WoodsPart of what has retained Mary Oliver’s popularity is she is so endlessly quotable and her numerous, beloved one-liners come from poems so good its almost a shame to highlight them without the full thing. Social media is full of her little nuggets of brilliance, such as (read full poems in links) ‘Listen – are you breathing just a little, and calling it a life?’ (from Have You Ever Tried to Enter the Long Black Branches?), ‘You only have to let / the soft animal of your body / love what it loves,’ (from Wild Geese), ‘it is a serious thing just to be alive on this fresh morning in the broken world,’ (fromInvitation) or slightly longer quotes such as:‘Instructions for living a life:Pay attention.Be astonished.Tell about it.’(from Sometimes)Though easily her best known quote is ‘Tell me, what is it you plan to do / with your one wild and precious life?’ which makes for perfect closing lines to The Summer Day. While often quoted without the full poem used as an inspirational message, what I love best about this line is that—in context—Oliver has already answered what she would do and that is to walk in the woods. Actually, it is such an amazing poem here is the whole thing:Who made the world?Who made the swan, and the black bear?Who made the grasshopper?This grasshopper, I mean—the one who has flung herself out of the grass,the one who is eating sugar out of my hand,who is moving her jaws back and forth instead of up and down—who is gazing around with her enormous and complicated eyes.Now she lifts her pale forearms and thoroughly washes her face.Now she snaps her wings open, and floats away.I don't know exactly what a prayer is.I do know how to pay attention, how to fall downinto the grass, how to kneel down in the grass,how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,which is what I have been doing all day.Tell me, what else should I have done?Doesn't everything die at last, and too soon?Tell me, what is it you plan to dowith your one wild and precious life?That all is such a perfect expression of what Oliver’s poetry is like. ‘Welcome to the silly, comforting poem,’ Oliver begins her poem Flare which, oddly enough, is also perfect because her poems are SO comforting and uplifting. Even when she is talking about death, which she can manage in a way only Jane Hirshfield can do. Oliver’s prose borders on religious experience without ever being actually religious, or as Alicia Ostriker once wrote, Oliver is ‘among the few American poets who can describe and transmit ecstasy, while retaining a practical awareness of the world as one of predators and prey,’ as well as referring to her as equal to Ralph Waldo Emerson. Mornings at BlackwaterFor years, every morning, I drankfrom Blackwater Pond.It was flavored with oak leaves and also, no doubt,the feet of ducks.And always it assuaged mefrom the dry bowl of the very far past.What I want to say isthat the past is the past,and the present is what your life is,and you are capableof choosing what that will be,darling citizen.So come to the pond,or the river of your imagination,or the harbor of your longing,and put your lips to the world.And liveyour life.The poems are most often calm and thoughtful, echoing a serenity of nature and gazing in wonderment at the marvelous possibilities of existence. Even in poems such as The Kitten, which deals with burning a stillborn kitten, she writes ‘life is infinitely inventive, / saying, what otehr amazements / lie in the dark seed of the earth…’ When we read Oliver, we see life as alive with beauty and are better for it. I wantto think again of dangerous and noble things.I want to be light and frolicsome.I want to be improbable beautiful and afraid of nothing,as though I had wings.(from Starlings in Winter)What also helps make Oliver so popular is her accessibility, something she achieves through a directness without sacrificing depth or lacking in breathtaking poetic phrasing. She is a perfect poet to pass to someone looking for an entryway into the world of poetry, and her focus on life as seen through nature is always easy to identify with. Though her poems are not always nature oriented, and Oliver’s directness can be sharpened to cut as well. Such as this one:Of The EmpireWe will be known as a culture that feared deathand adored power, that tried to vanquish insecurityfor the few and cared little for the penury of themany. We will be known as a culture that taughtand rewarded the amassing of things, that spokelittle if at all about the quality of life forpeople (other people), for dogs, for rivers. Allthe world, in our eyes, they will say, was acommodity. And they will say that this structurewas held together politically, which it was, andthey will say also that our politics was no morethan an apparatus to accommodate the feelings ofthe heart, and that the heart, in those days,was small, and hard, and full of meanness.‘Keep some room in your heart for the unimaginable,’ Oliver wrote, and her poetry is a perfect tool for ensuring that space is kept open. To read Oliver is to approach what must be what some call ‘the Divine,’ and I’ve never once regretted picking up a volume of hers to read. Even her collection all about dogs is nothing but sheer bliss pouring into your heart. It was tragic to lose her in 2019, right around the same time another giant of modern US poetry who also excelled at poetry harnessing the natural word, W.S. Merwin, passed but her words certainly outlive her and most likely even you and I. In her poem When Death Comes, Oliver writes:‘When it's over, I want to say all my lifeI was a bride married to amazement.I was the bridegroom, taking the world into my arms. When it's over, I don't want to wonderif I have made of my life something particular, and real. I don't want to find myself sighing and frightened,or full of argument. I don't want to end up simply having visited this world’I’d like to believe she achieved this and if her poetry is any testament to a life lived, then it was a life well lived. If you haven’t read Mary Oliver before, definitely do so as soon as possible. Even those who don’t usually read poetry tend to love her. Mary Oliver achieved great popularity but also great depth of heart and will live on as one of the greats of our time.5/5Wild GeeseYou do not have to be good.You do not have to walk on your kneesfor a hundred miles through the desert repenting.You only have to let the soft animal of your bodylove what it loves.Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.Meanwhile the world goes on.Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rainare moving across the landscapes,over the prairies and the deep trees,the mountains and the rivers.Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,are heading home again.Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,the world offers itself to your imagination,calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting -over and over announcing your placein the family of things.JourneyOne day you finally knewwhat you had to do, and began,though the voices around youkept shoutingtheir bad advice --though the whole housebegan to trembleand you felt the old tugat your ankles.""Mend my life!""each voice cried.But you didn't stop.You knew what you had to do,though the wind priedwith its stiff fingersat the very foundations,though their melancholywas terrible.It was already lateenough, and a wild night,and the road full of fallenbranches and stones.But little by little,as you left their voice behind,the stars began to burnthrough the sheets of clouds,and there was a new voicewhich you slowlyrecognized as your own,that kept you companyas you strode deeper and deeperinto the world,determined to dothe only thing you could do --determined to savethe only life that you could save....more",Notes are private!,1,205,1,not set,not set,"Jun 06, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34272476-devotions

So why not convince the quiet girl, B. Hawkins, who has a crush on her to tutor her girlfriend for free? But what Regina never expected was that B. is actually Belle, Chloe’s former childhood best friend and feelings start to get complicated in Belle of the Ball, the absolutely adorable sapphic graphic novel from Mari Costa. With plenty of humor, awkward teenage drama and super cute artwork, this love triangle of the perfect popular girl, jock/gamer girl and wallflower team mascot is heartwarming and endlessly charming as it explores being true to yourself and finding your own path.  [image]Usually love triangle tropes seem a bit stressful to me and you always feel bad for someone caught up in it, but Belle of the Ball pulls this one off with flair. The characters are great and Costa manages to depict a lot of nuance in each that makes them really dynamic and easy to have empathy for. Sure, Regina is easy to cast as a bit of a villain in it all, being a bit controlling, narcissistic, and taking advantage of Belle’s feelings, but we also see how Chloe sort of likes someone telling her what to do and truly feel Regina’s stress trying to be the perfect student (does Regina bear some slight vibe resemblances to Regina George? Perhaps!) I love the way everyone sort of stumbles through this story, from Chloe and Belle getting off to a terrible start when Belle asks Regina to the dance thinking she was single and is given a stern threat from Chloe to the way both of them are completely self-conscious and terrified when a half-remembered moment really sparks emotions.  [image]I especially love the focus on the English tutoring here. It makes for some great comedic moments with Chloe being pretty obtuse about not learning it and Belle’s complete frustration with her over it. But what I really enjoyed was the opportunities to show how reading into things—like intentionality in story details or interpretability—in a literary way works and how Belle finally gets a foothold in showing that to Chloe through video games. This is a great way to not only get across to readers how “literary criticism” works, but also shows how video games are legitimate storytelling in a literary sense as well (not that the stigma is the way it was when I was still in high school, but it is cool to see). It also addresses expectations of people in a productive way, showing people are often a lot more underneath the surface than they get typecast in school society as well as how people change over time (the element of Belle as a child only ever wearing princess dresses is really cute too). Also we get a large scene involving a renaissance fair which is GREAT and just a really moving and adorable section of the book.  [image]The art in this is great with extremely expressive characters and the red and black color palette looks wonderful. Costa created a really inclusive cast with a large variety of race and body types. Its just an all around well-constructed graphic novel, with great pacing and plenty of story that earns its ending without feeling like it wraps up too quickly. Costa is also great at playing with familiar tropes but doing them in a fresh way that is engaging and often surprising (another way this toys with ideas of expectations). It does seem to sort of criticize Regina for being so focused on grades and being an overachiever is shown as making her neglectful of Chloe, but it is more just a dynamic of how Regina isn’t as perfect as she wants to believe she is than an actual criticism of being good grade focused. I think teens will really relate to these characters as even as an adult I still found them very relatable and empathetic. Belle of the Ball is a winner of a YA graphic novel that is full of great sapphic romance and positivity. I definitely recommend this one!4.5/5  [image]Chloe, Belle and Regina...more",Notes are private!,0,76,1,"Jun 03, 2023","Jun 05, 2023","Jun 03, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60316957-belle-of-the-ball

A story of somebody drowned, somebody murdered, somebody who died for love.’Spending the days leading up to Hall‘There’s always a story, isn’t there? A story of somebody drowned, somebody murdered, somebody who died for love.’Spending the days leading up to Halloween with Jeanette Winterson’s rather cozy ghost stories was a festive good time that made the season more enjoyable all around. Night Side of the River is a collection of ghost stories that vary from gothic tales of haunted houses and spectral visitations to stories that show modern technology as an expanding frontier for new forms of hauntings. These are all interspersed with insightful and intimate commentary by Winterson for a book where the thrills of these bite-sized narratives are also a vessel to examine ideas of life after death, love, loss and the significant literary qualities of the horror tradition itself. We see how the genre adapted to address the beliefs and existential anxieties of their times, making Winterson’s technology angle another step forward in its evolution. Many of her best themes find their way into these stories and while we only catch glimpses of the inimitable Winterson moments of prose practically flying off the page in astonishing aerobatics with the tales being more plot focused here, it all still charms and chills its way right into your heart. In short, Night Side of the River functions like a ghost tour through the season with Winterson as your knowledgeable guide, directing us to ponder the history and happenings while also ensuring a satisfying and spooky event.‘She understands the advantage the Dead hold over the living; the Dead are not afraid.’I’m quite smitten with these collections of seasonal stories Winterson has embarked on and in many ways this feels akin to her jolly Christmas Days: 12 Stories and 12 Feasts for 12 Days collection. While that book of stories certainly helped make the season bright for me last year, Night Side of the River led me through the dark corridors and stormy atmosphere of Halloween and really brought the holiday to life. I enjoyed the touch that there are 13 ghost stories here, with 13 being a rather spooky number befitting the season much like how the Christmas collection had a story for each of the 12 days of christmas. Sure, they aren’t the strongest of stories Winterson has ever written, but this is easily overlooked because the full effect of the fiction and non-fiction approach to analyzing hauntings is so devilishly pleasant. And while these aren’t always the scariest of stories—I like to term them “cozy horror” here, particularly as they usually have happy endings, though if you want some actually frightening and unsettling Winterson horror I highly recommend The Daylight Gate—that also seems beside the point. Besides, as Winterson says in conversation with The Guardian, ‘I don’t get scared of the dead, it’s the living that scare me. I’m not worried about ghosts – I’d rather spend the night in a haunted house than in Romania with Andrew Tate.’ Overall, the collection invites us to lean in and enjoy this tour through the realm of the dead, not shrink from it.‘I used to believe that life and death were separate states. Now I know that things are liquid, porous; not solid at all.’There is a genuine love for the season and the literary traditions that accompany it that is endlessly infectious and the introduction essay alone is worth the price of admission (you can read an abbreviated version of it HERE in The Paris Review). Winterson looks at the long history of ghost stories and the way they can work as commentary on the general attitudes of the times in which they were created and why they’ve long captivated readers. ‘In spite of Protestant theology, scientific materialism, or the plain fact that there is no empirical proof that anyone has come back from the dead,’ Winterson writes, ‘ghosts have not been evicted from their permanent ancestral home: our imagination.’ This is part of what makes this collection so heartfelt is that it isn’t trying to make any big claims on ghosts—though Winterson does include several stories of hauntings she has experienced—but to ask us to think about what is so interesting about the ideas behind them. She recently addressed this in an interview with NPR:‘I like to play with the form. I thought, well, why not break in as myself and talk about things that have happened to me that I can't explain away? So I was showing that I've got some skin in the game here, that these things have been part of my reality, and I don't understand it. And simply, I have to live with it. And, you know, we're in a world now that's always looking for easy answers, quick-fire solutions. Nobody likes to say, I don't know. And this is a book about saying, I don't know. And when it comes to the supernatural, I think that's the most honest answer.’The book really holds the door open to invite imagination and possibility, and she provides an interesting look at how authors have long done so and helped continuously shape the genre. She writes about The Castle of Otranto in 1764, for example, and how it brought the Gothic atmospheres to ghost stories or Washington Irving’s 1820 tale, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, with ‘themes distinctive to the American Gothic – in particular, the undertow of the land itself, its bloodstained colonisation returning as a series of hauntings.’ Of course she mentions Edgar Allan Poe, as the gambling scene in The Passion with life or death stakes was written as an attempt to write a Poe-like story. She even provides a few of her favorites like M.R. James or Susan Hill’s The Woman in Black and one could make quite a spooky reading list from these pages.I really love her approach to categorizing the stories here, although I do wish Devices—the technology-based stories—were moved to later in the collection as it isn’t the strongest start. But I am particularly fascinated by her choice to include stories addressing Places and People, a distinction on hauntings she addresses in the introduction. We often think of haunted houses traditionally as a haunted space that assails those who enter. However, she looks at authors like Nathaniel Hawthorne bringing in ‘the psychic fractures and guilty disturbances peculiar to the pioneering spirit’ in his fiction it begins to ask ‘are such hauntings from the outside or the inside?’ This is also present in The Turn of the Screw by Henry James where we must ask ‘Is the manipulation a direct haunting? Or does Bly feed off the haunted places in the heads of its inhabitants?’ and Shirley Jackson’s The Haunting of Hill House certainly shows the house more as a mirror reflecting a haunted mind back on itself. So, as the names of these sections suggest, each addresses a different form of haunting. There is the method of ‘you are haunting yourself,’ as the narrator advises herself in the first tale, App-arition, or, as is theorized in The Door (one of my favorites) ‘Maybe that’s what a haunting is: time trapped in the wrong place…haunted place working as a memory store.’ It’s all quite fun.As a side note, I've always the way Stephen Graham Jones offers two distinctions on haunted houses: the Stay Away Houses and the Hungry Houses. ‘Whereas Stay Away Houses just want to be left alone,’ Jones writes, ‘Hungry Houses aren't complete without people to digest for reasons or decades or centuries.’ In these stories Winterson tends towards the Hungry Houses, though this makes sense based on her influences in Poe, James and Jackson and the way a psychological haunting is better geared at examining the genre mechanics.‘To honour you is to live. To love you is to live…I promised you I would live. Not a half-life, not a haunted life, not a shadowlife.’Winterson also includes what she terms “hinge stories” that are printed back to back and offer two different perspectives on the same situation. I really enjoyed this approach to give a more dynamic look at the events but also to address differing ideas on ghosts in general. As one would expect with Winterson, we get some really lovely, philosophical ideas expressed. Such as thoughts on death as an interruption on life and questioning if that interrupts love.‘Death, though, is a different reality. You are dissolved. Into what? Into time, into space, into the leaky container that is me, who will also dissolve into time, into space. No. 80 on the PeriodicTable, you are gone. But before I take up my role as the long-suffering one – the gold-band-wearing survivor who was always there and is still – I am aware that mercury makes possible the extraction of gold from poorer-quality ores. You brought out the best in me.’There are many different depictions of what comes after death here, and a few humorous thoughts such as ‘Who gets to be reunited? Is the Afterlife polyamorous?’ I also enjoy how, for a collection that addresses haunted homes, it also considers the common phrase that death is a sort of “returning home”:‘Home is inside us as well as outside us. An image we hold in our minds. Some people like to say that when we die we are going home. But it’s a strange home. We never visit it, until we do, and when we do, we never return.’Through these stories we see a lot of love and loss, and I enjoy how these themes are the primary focus to examine. The spooky settings make excellent adornment for such investigations and it also asks us to consider what our own thoughts on death and ghosts says about us.‘Truly, technology is going to affect our relationship with death. In theory, no one needs to die. In theory, anyone can be resurrected. We can be our own haunting.’It seems only natural with Winterson that she would take the idea of haunting and look towards the future with it. AI is a topic of interest for Winterson, such as her collection of essays 12 Bytes: How We Got Here. Where We Might Go Next that look at how the technology might impact the way we love and interact or how it gives Mary Shelley’s ideas a new life as she played with in Frankissstein. ‘We have unexpectedly created an opportunity for the dead,’ she writes about concepts like the metaverse and apps that can mimic texting as if from someone you knew now gone and explores how a dead person living on in a virtual world isn’t unlike a haunting. ‘It seems to me like a perfect space for ghosts,’ she says and I will never look at online interactions the same again. Maybe I’m actually a ghost haunting you right now.‘When i am climbing, i understand that gravity exists to protect us from our own lightness of being, just in the same way that time is what shields us from eternity.’I have to say, Night Side of the River was an ideal was to spend spooky season and having new material from Winterson is always a joy. This is charming and insightful and I really enjoyed the way she plays with themes as a way of examining the literary implications and pushing the boundaries of them. She certainly makes you see the phrase ""ghost in the wires"" in a new light here too.

This sapphic tale of princess courtship and fashion in a modern day setting is so adorable and heartwarming that this was me the entire read:  [image]For real though, this is so unbearably cute and comes alive in such gorgeous artwork that can seamlessly shift between realism and comically cartoony to capture the extreme emotions and fun that it is just as lovely to look at as it is to read. Also literally everything is cheese puns. This book has a kinship with The Prince and the Dressmaker that I loved a few years back for the focus on fashion and confronting outdated laws on gender and marriage in a queer tale of disguised identity. Here we follow Lady Camembert who, following the death of her father, must disguise herself as Count Camembert (Cam for short) in order to not lose the family fortune since she is not attracted to men and will not marry one. But she has too much energy to lay low in her new city and everything gets tangled up when she attends a fashion activism event hosted by Princess Brie and the two are instantly drawn to each other.  [image]I loved this, it was a joy from start to finish and has a really great pacing with plenty of story to keep you hooked. Everything is fashion and cheese and it's unstoppably sweet. The secondary characters are wonderful too, especially Zola (short for Gorgonzola) who is a fashion designer finally out of the shadow of her late husband who became famous taking credit for her work. It becomes an intricate web of emotions running high as Cam and Brie fall in love, but Cam is scared of being found out and Brie tends towards elevating drama when upset. It’s ADORABLE though and you’ll be rooting for their sapphic love the whole way through and laughing along with all their mishaps.   [image]The way cheese is persistently involved in all the names and the characters love of grilled cheese actually comes from Deya Muniz’s real life relationship with her wife, and her story following the book is just as cute as the actual graphic novel (she provides some quick cartoon panels to help tell it as well). Muniz’s attention to details in all the outfits is gorgeous and I said AWWWW when I learned the wedding dresses were based off the dresses she and her wife wore at their own wedding. The Princess and the Grilled Cheese Sandwich is a sheer delight and I highly recommend it. 5 out of 5 stars, its perfect.

Which is exactly what has happened in Adrian Tchaikovsky’s darkly comedic One Day All This Will Be Yours, which reads like a snarky companion to books like This Is How You Lose the Time War because there’s plenty of mind-bending multiverse action and a spy vs spy type element where weeks of trying to murder the other in order to stop the future blossoms into a loving friendship or possibly more. As will happen. Tchaikovsky’s books are always a big, charming brain at work and he writes with such wit and whimsy that makes him irresistible, but it’s the humor that really does it for me. It’s a well-needed laugh of often gallows humor to stave off the fear and trembling of Tchaikovsky’s biting look at a future where war has destroyed time. Quite literally. So buckle up, time travelers, because this is a sharp book that will have you rolling as it confronts humanity in all it’s dark, destructive tendencies.‘I am saving the unseen future from interference,’ the narrator tells us from his peaceful farm at the end of time enjoying retirement from the military. ‘We were the time warriors, and we killed time,’ and so our narrator has taken it upon himself to dispose of any other time travelers and ensure the future is as human-less and pristine as possible. By that I mean he literally murders anyone who tries to use time travel (he’s parked himself at the end of time as a sort of trap for them) and then goes back in time and murders their grandparents or some other disaster to ensure time travel won’t be invented in their timeline. ‘They all end up here, because this is the end-time. This is all the time there is. This is the trailing edge of what comes later, after the breach in regular transmissions left by the war. A bottleneck, you understand. You want to fling yourself forwards past the badlands of the war, this is where you end up. And I’ll be waiting for you. Nobody gets by me.’Oh and by “murders them” I mean he feeds them to his pet dinosaur, because if the whole of history is your playground why wouldn’t you tame an Allosaurus for home security? ‘She might be several tons of ravaging therapod dinosaur, but the old girl is also just a big softy; feed her and rub her tummy and she's yours forever.’ So this is all fine and dandy until one day someone shows up and informs him he is their long past ancestor… And their future society is twee bullshit that he must destroy.‘I am the full stop to the sentence that is human history. That's the point.’This book is honestly such a joy and nobody can do it quite like Tchaikovsky. You can feel his intelligence permeate every book but he never comes across as trying too hard or showing off but simply excited to tell you some shit that will blow your mind. And I am here for the mind blowing. He’s also just hysterical. I read this in a single sitting and was dying laughing. There’s so many fun opportunities for jokes here. I mean, he can go anywhere so why not party with some French students right before their big revolution: ‘I teach them the rousing songs from the relevant musical and we bellow it out at the army camped out there, and at the uncaring populace of Paris. And they actually do Hear The People Sing and next morning the entire city's up in arms and I've screwed over history again.’There are some great lines and references that just kill, and just amazing scenarios using historical figures in weird ways including ‘ a rather baffled-looking Tomas de Torquemada, because even the Spanish Inquisition didn't expect this.’ And if fucking around with history is fun solo, imagine how much fun it can be with a friend. Well, if that friend isn’t someone who is just as efficient as murdering and dodging traps as he is and doesn’t get him first. Because this is a race to end the future of mankind and neither side wants to see anyone live, because the people who want humanity to live on turn out to be horribly annoying and live in a utopia that is just as awful as the dystopia of time war. ‘And I feel my heart grow three sizes, because she’s a bitter sociopath, but she’s my bitter sociopath.’While this is technically the second book in a series (Terrible Worlds: Destinations) it can be read totally independent of the others and is more just a thematic look at terrible places on can end up where we realize the scariest thing in the universe is *shocker* humans! And while, sure, this all seems pretty bleak, these books are just so funny and charming you won’t care. One Day All This Will Be Yours is a thrill-ride of dark joy and time traveling murder and Adrian Tchaikovsky is an absolute GEM of a speculative fiction writer. You should definitely drop everything and read at least one. 5/5‘yes, there's a Sphinx out there with my face. I am not proud.

A sea we must wade.We braved the belly of the beast.We've learned that quiet isn't always peace, and the norms and notions of what ""just"" is isn't always justice.And yet the dawn is ours before we knew it.Somehow we do it.Somehow we weathered and witnessed a nation that isn't broken, but simply unfinished.We, the successors of a country and a time where a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president, only to find herself reciting for one.And, yes, we are far from polished, far from pristine, but that doesn't mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect.We are striving to forge our union with purpose.To compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters and conditions of man.And so we lift our gaze, not to what stands between us, but what stands before us.We close the divide because we know to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside.We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another.We seek harm to none and harmony for all.Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true.That even as we grieved, we grew.That even as we hurt, we hoped.That even as we tired, we tried.That we'll forever be tied together, victorious.Not because we will never again know defeat, but because we will never again sow division.Scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree, and no one shall make them afraid.If we're to live up to our own time, then victory won't lie in the blade, but in all the bridges we've made.That is the promise to glade, the hill we climb, if only we dare.It's because being American is more than a pride we inherit.It's the past we step into and how we repair it.We've seen a force that would shatter our nation, rather than share it.Would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy.And this effort very nearly succeeded.But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated.In this truth, in this faith we trust, for while we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us.This is the era of just redemption.We feared at its inception.We did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour.But within it we found the power to author a new chapter, to offer hope and laughter to ourselves.So, while once we asked, how could we possibly prevail over catastrophe, now we assert, how could catastrophe possibly prevail over us?We will not march back to what was, but move to what shall be: a country that is bruised but whole, benevolent but bold, fierce and free.We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation, become the future.Our blunders become their burdens.But one thing is certain.If we merge mercy with might, and might with right, then love becomes our legacy and change our children's birthright.So let us leave behind a country better than the one we were left.Every breath from my bronze-pounded chest, we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one.We will rise from the golden hills of the West.We will rise from the windswept Northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution.We will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the Midwestern states.We will rise from the sun-baked South.We will rebuild, reconcile, and recover.And every known nook of our nation and every corner called our country, our people diverse and beautiful, will emerge battered and beautiful.When day comes, we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid.The new dawn blooms as we free it.For there is always light, if only we're brave enough to see it.If only we're brave enough to be it.If you enjoyed this and are interested in more of her works, I definitely recommend her full collection Call Us What We Carry....more",Notes are private!,0,87,1,not set,not set,"May 31, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56914101-the-hill-we-climb

FollAn epic quest brings us through the ‘bush’ across mythical lands full of nightmares and deadly kingdoms in Amos Tutuola’s The Palm-Wine Drinkard. Following the dangerous adventures of a sort of trickster god—the ‘ father of gods who could do anything in the world’—who drinks palm-wine ‘‘from morning till night and from night till morning’ and seeks to return his deceased and beloved tapster, The Palm-Wine Drinkard reads much like a collection of short stories drawing from African Yoruba folktales, threaded together as stages of the quest much like oral-tradition storytelling. We see the world as fearsome and fantastical, with horrific beasts and unthinkable violence that can strike at any moment, and through a look at the good and evils that can lurk inside anyone, it becomes a story on survival at all costs. The most beautiful man alive is reduced to a moving skull, there are many-eyed beasts that devour you whole, tyrant babies, Written in a unique style with unfamiliar grammar that was much lauded by poets such as Dylan Thomas, Tutuola dazzles with language (and some knockout chapter titles) that destabilizes our grip on reality and plunges the reader headlong into the hellish realms of monsters, mayhem and imperialism. A haunting novel yet, for all the destruction and struggle against the acceptance of death, The Palm-Wine Drinkard captures a spirit of survival showing that even when death is arbitrary and can come in large numbers the community of humanity will find ways to adapt and live on.‘We did not care about death and we did not fear again.’Published in 1952, The Palm-Wine Drinkard was the first African novel to be published in English outside Africa and drew both heavy praise and criticisms. Dylan Thomas was quick to applaud the novel in his  which called it a ‘grisly and bewitching story…nothing is too prodigious or too trivial to put down in this tall, devilish story.’ Yet Nigerian readers were concerned by the Western praise, worried it would embolden European racists to view them as drunks with absurd superstitions and noted that the use of language is not how people actually spoke. This has stood the test of time, however, and negative receptions calling Tutuola a good storyteller but lacking literary merit have been brushed aside to see him as a pioneer of form to tell traditional folktales in exciting ways. ‘""I wrote The Palm-Wine Drinkard for the people of the other countries to read the Yoruba folklores,’ Tutuola said, ‘my purpose of writing is to make other people to understand more about Yoruba people and in fact they have already understood more than ever before.’ It is, admittedly, a bit of a difficult novel that more jumps from tale to tale with the loose connection of simply being encounters on a multi-year journey than a straightforward narrative but it is also imaginative and wondrous when you sink into the groove of the storytelling.It exists in a frightening realm where monsters are everywhere and death is around every corner. We see the dangers of traveling where any territory can be hostile: the “bush” and roads between cities are full of lurking menace and each city has its own set of rules and leaders that are often quite hostile to outsiders. One can be killed at any moment, but luckily for our narrator and his wife they have ‘sold our death’ and ‘lent our fear’—the magical realism elements are delightful in this short book—so they can proceed without worry of dying. Which is good because death is everywhere and one thing they must learn is to constantly adapt to fit the needs of each new place. Quite often we see entire villages destroyed and everyone killed, with the narrator realizing staying in the devastation is untenable and moving on. He must always be quick to adapt to the whims of vengeful rulers or thieves (or giant murderous babies) and his ability to shapeshift feels much like a metaphor for this. But when he turns into a bird don’t go down the Lord of the Rings discourse on why didn’t they just ride the giant eagles to Mordor, just sit back and enjoy the story.Chinua Achebe, another Nigerian author, once described the novel as a commentary on Western consumerism. This crops up often in the story and we see some of the frightening territories functioning as criticisms of colonialism and capitalism. Most notably is the character Give and Take, who certainly takes far more than he gives. When hired to work the fields, Give and Take steals the townspeople's land, much to their annoyance. When the people build an army to defend their land, Give and Take kills everyone in the village and keeps the land. Which, yea, that's a pretty on-the-nose metaphor for colonialism. Tutuola is able to work in the broad metaphors of folktales by also removing any specific era from the novel, making it feel a blend of past and present all at once. Cowrie shells are the primary currency and the novel mostly appears to be prior to much technological use, yet there are also references to various forms of paper currency and bombs and telephones get brief mentions. Such as in my favorite of the tales of a man who is said to be so beautiful ‘if bombers saw him in a town which was to be bombed, they would not throw bombs on his presence, and if they did throw it, the bomb itself would not explode.’ After running off with an important person’s daughter this man is reduced to a skull that hops around, its great fun. Oh also giant murderous babies. Don’t ever forget about the giant murderous babies. I SURE WON’T!Overall, community seems to be a large theme in this narrative. While the epic journey is more or less all for nothing in a way that reminds me of how I (unpopular opinion) actually really enjoyed that aspect in The Last Jedi, we do see that the town is saved at the end and that community will always live on in some form. Even the dead have their own community in Dead Town, where there is a mixture of races living in what I guess is ghostly harmony which feels like a cool jab at racism in the land of the living. This is a tale of survival and ultimately we see that humans will survive in some form enough to live on. The Palm-Wine Drinkard is a bizarre, haunting and surreal (and darkly funny or am I just twisted?) short novel that threads elements of Yoruba folklore into an epic journey narrative. A bit cumbersome but rather linguistically awesome for all its oddities, I will certainly return to read more Tutuola.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,0,105,1,not set,not set,"May 28, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/20431045-the-palm-wine-drinkard

These poems chronicle the destruction of his country, the mass murdering of innocents, and hones in on the omnipresent fears of bombings and soldier-fire amidst a landscape that still arrives in striking beauty in contrast to smoldering wreckage around it. Abu Toha also provides an extraordinary interview after the poems which is worth picking the book up even if just for that, where he discusses his life, art and hopes. There is a resiliency that keeps this harrowing collection afloat, and for all the ways it continuously makes us confront the devastation and violence, it also champions the spirit of survival in the Palestinian people. ‘Don’t ever be surprised / to see a rose shoulder up / among the ruins of the house: / This is how we survived,’ he writes, and that is precisely how this collection feels: a brilliant rose rising up amongst the violence, reminding us to listen, to not turn away and to cherish human life.We Love What We HaveWe love what we have, no matter how little,because if we don’t, everything will be gone. If we don’twe will no longer exist, since there will be nothing here for us.What’s here is something that we are stillbuilding. It’s something we cannot yet see,because we are partof it.Someday soon, this building will stand on its own, while we,we will be the trees that protect it from the fiercewind, the trees that will give shadeto children sleeping inside or playing on swings.Following in the footsteps of Mahmoud Darwish, the “national poet” of Palestine and a major influence on Abu Toha, this collection makes Palestine a land of poetry above all things. He writes in a direct and accessible style bursting forth with arresting imagery and playful language, using his pen to transform indelible tragedies into monuments of prose for all of us to witness and learn from them. His poetry primarily is written in a collective consciousness, using we or us instead of I in many of the poems, creating a landscape of stories. ‘Though we all have very different stories, as Palestineans our stories are the same in many ways,’ he says in the interview at the end of the collection:’I think it’s like we are living in a grave: we are not dead, we are going about our daily business, but in a grave. We are living in place of a dead person. I know that’s contradictory.’Contradictions are a playful aspect of his poetry, and this statement is reminiscent of the conclusion of his poem My City After What Happened Some Time Ago where a people who are already ‘living in a grave’ have a will to survive that cannot be killed and the sound of bombs can wake the dead:In Gaze, some of us cannot completely die.every time a bomb falls, every time shrapnel hits our graves,every time the rubble piles up on our heads,We are awakened from our temporary death.Yet still ‘the fear of dying before living / haunts us while we are still / in our mother’s wombs.’ Abu Toha never lets us go long without reminding us how often it is the children who are killed in the blasts, children that don’t know there is any other life other than living between bombardments. ‘I never realized I was born in a refugee camp because that was just my world,’ he tells us, ‘A fish doesn’t ask its mother why a shark is running after them.’ We are reminded that in war it is the innocent who do the most of the suffering. In The Wound, he recalls seeing the limbless body of a child pulled from a home and writes ‘The houses were not Hamas / The kids were not Hamas / Their clothes and toys were not Hamas / the neighborhood was not Hamas,’ and yet ‘the one who ordered the killing / the one who pressed the button thought / only of Hamas.’ He tells us these stories because those who do not tell of the horrors they witness find them returning forver as nightmares. ‘One function of poetry is to heal the wounds,’ he says, and he does so in a way that will certainly stick with you always. Remembering is important, especially when not only are people are being erased by genocide, but also their memory is being erased politically. Even their own country is denied existing by others, such as when he mentions his application for his US Visa claims his homeland doesn’t exist. ‘Borders are those invented lines drawn with ash on maps and sewn into the ground by bullets,’ he writes. In this way his poems often hold space for what is absent, be it places or people: ‘a child who was shot by an Israeli sniper / or killed during an air raid en route to school. / Her picture stares at the blackboard / while the air sits in her chair.’ As William Hazlitt said ‘Poetry is all that is worth remembering in life,’ and Abu Toha keeps that memory alive.We Deserve a Better DeathWe deserve a better death.Our bodies are disfigured and twisted,embroidered with bullets and shrapnel.Our names are pronounced incorrectlyon the radio and TVOur photos, plastered onto the walls of our buildings,fade and grow pale.The inscriptions on our gravestones disappear,covered in the feces of birds and reptiles.No one waters the trees that give shadeto our graves.The blazing sun has overwhelmedour rotting bodies.There is still a playfulness to these poems despite all the sadness. ‘Come on, it’s my first time being wounded,’ he quips in The Wound, less bravado and more a jab at the absurdity of bravado and war. He writes of F-16s massacring an innocent neighborhood writing ‘They descended from the inferno. Dante hadn’t mentioned them,’ and in another poem talks about pilots adding rubble after a bombing ‘to increase the pilot’s salary’ because ‘on the scale, stones and rebars are heavier / than souls.’ Not that he makes a laughing matter of anything, but what else can one do but laugh in the face of absurdity in death when the alternative is to hear ‘silent walls / and people sobbing / without sound.’ Things You May Find Hidden in My Ear is a collection that will certainly haunt you, but you will be better for it. Abu Toha writes many poems to or in the vein of his predecessors, such as Mahmoud Darwish, Edward Said, and even Audre Lorde, and chronicles the horrors wrought on Gaza to ensure they are remembered and as a method of processing. This is a wonderful little collection, complete with photographs from the author and an interview, and while it will break your heart it will still cast a beautiful glow all the same.5/5‘The words fly out.The poem is free.’...more",Notes are private!,12,229,1,"May 26, 2023","May 26, 2023","May 26, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/59418414-things-you-may-find-hidden-in-my-ear

I even have her tattooed on my left arm. So when I ran across Kyo Maclear’s Virginia Wolf with Virginia Woolf is one of my absolute favorite authors. I even have her tattooed on my left arm. So when I ran across Kyo Maclear’s Virginia Wolf with the stunning artwork from Isabelle Arsenault I knew this was one I had to have. As much for me as for reading to my kid, for whom it became a favorite to have in our bedtime stories collection for a while and inspired a lot of creative art nights together. It is a really cute story with a lot of heart and doesn’t shy away from addressing issues of depression. The story is told from Vanessa Bell as a child discussing when her sister Virginia gets into a sad mood. Virginia once wrote of her relationship with her sister as a companionship like a ‘close conspiracy,’ and I really love the way this story puts the lesser know Vanessa at the center and focuses on her as an artist. The visuals in this are gorgeous and I really like the way Virginia Woolf is depicted as a little wolf in a dress, but what really stands out for me is how it is a great way to discuss issues of depression with young kids in a productive way.   [image]Look at that cute little wolf.In the story, when Virginia has her “wolf” mood, she yells at Vanessa, doesn’t like her usual fun games and wants to be left alone. Vanessa tries to cheer her up but nothing works, and when Virginia tells her she’d like to go to a place called “Bloomsberry” Vanessa is distressed she cannot find it on a map. So she leaves Virgina alone and begins to paint a magical land, eventually inspiring Virginia to come over and join in creating together. By the time they finish, the wolf has transformed back to a little girl. It’s really cute and I enjoy that it shows you can’t just suddenly “fix” someone in a depressive mood but that giving them time and perhaps space to be themselves and be creative can be helpful.  [image]This is a fun story and while you don’t have to have any knowledge of Virginia and Vanessa, those who do will pick up some cute little biographical nods (Thoby gets a brief nod too). I really love the art and my oldest and I have definitely painted murals on walls together inspired by this book. It’s a cute favorite and I’m pleased to see my youngest now enjoys having it read to her as well.

Exit Strategy, the fourth in the Murderbot Diaries series by Martha Wells, is another ass-kicking good time full of sci-fi fun and…well… a lot of ass-kicking. It also brings the loose narrative arc full circle returning Murderbot to aiding Dr. Mensah and the crew from the first novella, All Systems Red, and while Murderbot will tell us ‘I was having an emotion, and I hate that,’ I, too, was having emotions and I was LOVING that. Seriously, when I heard this series about a security robot with free will and intense social anxiety (Tor dot com has a great article you can read here that makes the case for Murderbot also being an expression on autism) was rather emotional and heartwarming I had no idea how true that could possibly be. But for someone who practically as a rule avoids book series like the asshole I am, here I am 4 books down with nothing but eagerness in my heart for more. These books are SO charming and at the end of each book I say “this has been my favorite.” This once again holds true.‘Possibly I was overthinking this. I do that; it’s the anxiety that comes with being a part-organic murderbot. The upside was paranoid attention to detail. The downside was also paranoid attention to detail.’An aspect of the Murderbot series I really enjoy is how much it is setting up meetings that sound like they might run afoul of trouble because even the best laid plans of murderbots and men often go awry or whatever it was Robert Burns said. And we get Murderbot’s snarky commentary the whole way, such as ‘details of what I was designating as Operation Not Actually A Completely Terrible Plan’ or ‘the plan wasn’t a clusterfuck, it was just circling the clusterfuck target zone, getting ready to come in for a landing.’ A chuckle a page this one. Wells is so good at describing action too, and in a way that Murderbot would be able to experience it using all the security cameras at once, but it really struck me reading this one just how visual the books are. ‘The company is like an evil vending machine, you put money in and it does what you want, unless somebody else puts more money in and tells it to stop.’I love how hard this one leans into critiques of corporations and how profit motives inevitably lead to problematic behavior. Like murder! This book perfectly falls into a plot that has been slowly brewing where now Murderbot has to go save old “friends” due to consequences of their own actions. But we get a really great look into the politics of the galaxy and some banger lines like ‘Disinformation, which is the same as lying but for some reason has a different name, is the top tactic in corporate negotiation/warfare.’ Blend this with continuing the narrative on Murderbot grappling with emotions in a way that makes this series about a robot often a series about what it means to be human despite Murderbot’s insistence ‘I don’t want to be human.’‘This was the first time I’d had anything on me that officially labeled me as human. It was weird.I didn’t like it.’If you haven’t checked out Murderbot, I would highly encourage you to suit up in your sci fi armor and dive into All Systems Red. By the time you reach Exit Strategy you’ll be as hooked as Murderbot is to watching Sanctuary Moon (there is an AMAZING little bit about that in here). I love these, can’t wait to keep going!5/5‘The bad thing about having emotions is, you know, OH SHIT WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO ME.’...more",Notes are private!,0,118,1,"May 24, 2023","May 24, 2023","May 24, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/35519109-exit-strategy

The planet was full of people, and they were beautiful and horrible, too.’I’m not crying, you’re crying! Okay fine, it’s me and I don’t care because A Closed and Common Orbit is so unbelievably lovely and plays your heartstrings like Becky Chambers is composing a symphony that will reach out across the whole of the universe and make even the stars hum along in harmony. The second of Becky Camber’s Wayfarers series and, I dare say, possibly even more moving that the first, A Closed and Common Orbit continues to explore Chamber’s highly nuanced universe through the lives, loves, hopes and heartaches of those who who live there. Kicking off right after the end of Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet, we leave the crew of the Wayfarer behind to follow Pepper as she helps the AI Sidra (formerly known in her past reiteration as Lovey) adapt to living in a body-kit. While it may take a moment to adjust and is sad to leave behind the crew you knew and loved from the first, Chamber’s manages to make you love these characters just as deeply as we witness Pepper’s backstory surviving in the wild being raised by an AI and watch Sidra grapple with big existential questions of existence. A Closed and Common Orbit is as deeply intelligent and insightful as it is moving and empathetic, examining ideas of found-family, identity, the horrors beings can inflict upon each other in the name of profits and power and reminding us how life can be tragic yet also terrific.‘There are few better ways to get to know how a species thinks than to learn their art.’Similar to the first novel, Chamber’s exhibits their incredible gift for world building by having the reader experience life amongst the galaxy alongside the everyday people learning through their conversations and interactions instead of exposition. We learn how these species work through their actions, and where the first book gave us a good overview on a lot of species, this one gives us a chance to dive deeper into the social cultures of the Aeluons. Their storytelling style, which is pretty direct and cozy, successfully pulls you into the story and makes you feel a part of the galaxy as well as truly feel for these characters just trying to make a life in such a vast world. These aren’t the royalty or hardened warriors of space opera epic but the average person trying to make ends meet.I love that because we see what it is like to not be the center of attention in a sci-fi universe where accommodating the needs of other species or dealing with the fact that humans are newcomers to the citizenry and viewed as pretty mediocre at best make up a big part of their daily lives. But it also shows how everyone has a story and that the “ordinary” is often just as extraordinary. ‘When I see the ocean, I feel calm. It makes me want to’ – to keep eating candy – ‘to keep going. To keep trying new things. To keep living.’Life can be hard, and while these are the “regular” folks of the universe, we see them grappling with very difficult issues of selfhood and survival. First of all, I LOVE Pepper. At first I thought ‘oh no I miss Kizzy and Jenks too much’ but, you see, Pepper is their good friend and getting to hang out with Pepper is sort of like when you meet the friends of your cool friends and realize hey I love them too! Because of course your cool friends have cool friends that remind you of them a bit. Half the book (it rotates between Pepper’s backstory and Sidra in the present) is how before she named herself Pepper she was Jane 23, a girl bred to be slave labor in a factory until she escaped the obdurate rule of The Mothers by running away into the wasteland. Her story of growing up under the care of Owl, the AI of the abandoned ship Jane grows up in and sets about repairing across the whole of her childhood and teen years. She must learn to survive, building weapons to fight the vicious dogs that roam the land and her only entertainment is a VR game called The Big Bug Crew where she learns much about the galaxy.This whole section gripped me and melted my heart so many times. The dynamic between Owl and Jane is gorgeous but when you connect parts of Pepper to her past…I teared up SEVERAL times. I also love caustic teenage Jane who loves to swear because ‘swearing felt fucking great.’ But Sidra’s tale is just as endearing, and I love the friendship that forms with Tak—an Aeluon that has abandoned academic life to become a tattoo artist.  ‘I love learning. I love history. But there's history in everything. Every building, everybody you talk to. It's not limited to libraries and museums. I think people who spend their lives in school forget that sometimes.’Much of this book, and this series in general, looks at how the intertwined histories of everyone make up a galactic culture that thrives best when everyone is given space to be themselves and value one another. Chambers excels at placing topics from our present day into the sci fi universe and interacting with them in exciting ways that flesh out that universe, such as Tak being the Aeluon “shon” gender, which means Tak switches between reproductive organs and is called he or she depending on the present configuration. And everyone understands and adapts and it’s lovely because honestly it's not hard. We also see how much of the hurt in the universe is from someone trying to lord power over another, or not valuing the existence of another species. For example, Sidra being an AI in a body kit is actually very, very illegal in the galaxy and if caught she will be destroyed, so much of her fears is adapting to “pass” as human and all the existential crises of having to have a self.‘Life is terrifying. None of us have a rule book. None of us know what we're doing here. So, the easiest way to stare reality in the face and not utterly lose your shit is to believe that you have control over it. If you believe you have control, then you believe you're at the top. And if you're at the top, then people who aren't like you... well, they've got to be somewhere lower, right? Every species does this. Does it again and again and again. Doesn't matter if they do it to themselves, or another species, or someone they created.’Fans of Chamber’s other series, the Monk and Robot books, will find a bit of similar philosophical musings as in A Psalm for the Wild-Built. Ideas of being “enough” and that just being yourself is what matters are addressed in ways that just make you feel good inside without seeming preachy or sugarcoating. ‘You are all desperate for purpose, even though you don’t have one. You’re animals, and animals don’t have a purpose. Animals just are… All of your histories are the same, in essence. They’re all stories of animals warring and clashing because you can’t agree on what you’re for, or why you exist.’Sometimes its okay to just exist and create your own meaning and not be tricked into thinking profit or power is more valuable than even a single life of the lowest status living creature. These are books about existing but also co-existing. A Closed and Common Orbit is so lovely and while the end wraps up a bit quick and the final scene feels…rather an abrupt shift that I wish got explored more or lead into more, it is still such a powerful little book. I cannot wait to keep reading these. 4.5/5‘No matter what happens next, she said, ""no matter where we go, we're all going together.’...more",Notes are private!,1,133,1,"May 24, 2023",Jun 2023,"May 24, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/30653753-a-closed-and-common-orbit

Books such a‘In my family, marriages aren’t a beginning, they’re an end.’I should have learned by now not to finish novels while on the desk at work. Books such as this can deliver a swift and sudden gut punch of an ending, leaving you viscerally staggering—a trait I tend to look for in a short novel—and within seconds I’m smiling my customer service voice and resolving a problem that can never compare to the emotional devstation still blooming inside. Empty Wadrobes, Portuguese writer Maria Judite de Carvalho’s 1966 novel, sets its literary teeth to confronting the systemic patriarchal socializations that make women into objects in their own lives, like novelties in a museum or furnishings in the showroom of a man’s life. The story follows Dora Rosário, widowed at a young age by a man ‘whose sole activity’ was ‘being nothing,’ and luckily climbing out of poverty in order to raise her daughter Lisa, as a secret of her past shatters her world and inspires her to reinvent herself. Gorgeously translated by Margaret Jull Costa and told through a narrator seemingly a distance from the story but revealed to be much more emotionally close than expected, Carvalho writes with a sharp wit and dark humor across this quietly devastating novel that becomes an unflinching portrait of patriarchal society where uncomfortable truths are silenced and the lives and dreams of women are suppressed at the mercies of men.‘When he died, Dora found her life transformed into a desert.’ As Kate Zambreno points out in the intro, the domestic setting of Empty Wardrobes only underscores it as a tale of how the political seeps into daily life, with the novel set ‘in the regime of a dictator who weaponized Catholicism and “family values,”’ of Portugal under Salazar. For instance, Dora Rosário’s name means “rosarie,” and she spends her life in memory of her late husband much like one slowly going bead by bead in prayer, remaining largely interior, humble in manners and dress, and most notably, rather compliant. This is a society ruled by men but also one where troubles, taboos, or anything deemed impolite for society is swept under the rug and left to fester. The novel opens recounting the years following the death of Duarte, Dora’s husband, and how the domestic insistence of women to only be homemakers has left her with no job skills and a hungry child is a society that, for all it’s religious gesturing, has no interest in actually helping her. By happy circumstances she is able to find work in an antique shop dubbed The Museum by her and her daughter, Lisa, and affords a manageable lifestyle, yet it is still one of modesty that doesn’t branch beyond caring for work, her daughter, or mother-in-law (she is at all times ‘under the simultaneously suspicious and reticent eye of her mother-in-law’). She is, as the now teenage Lisa says, ‘both ageless and hopeless,’ living her life as if always mourning Duarte, that is until a secret upends everything and she decides to begin anew.‘ You refuse to see that it is the jungle. For you, it’s a paradise that you don’t want to lose.’Feminist existentialist Simone de Beauvoir wrote that while society has always belonged to men ‘none of the reasons given for this have ever seemed sufficient.’ The disconnect between the opportunities and social graces given to men compared to women, much of what upholds patriarchy, are evident from the juxtaposition of Duarte and Dora. While she is an eyesore to those when in need and otherwise completely overlooked (until she begins to lean into a more male-gaze sexualized manner of dress and make-up), Duarte is spoken of as a saint despite having no accomplishments to his name. He spent his days refusing any sort of efforts to climb the social or corporate ladder, not wanting to participate in that world at all. Which, yea, great, but would his insistence of purity be applauded if he were a woman, or would be looked at as a leech or burden the way people look at Dora while she is struggling financially. She is not allowed ‘invisible pedestal on which he had placed himself’ the way a man is. ‘An egotistical Christ,’ Dora thinks of him, ‘a secular, unbelieving Christ who had only come into the world in order to save himself. But save himself from what, from what hell?’ Having social mobility and understanding allows Duarte to choose to see the world as being without predators, but as Dora think ‘ they exist. And while they may not devour us, they devour the food that should be ours.’ For her, optimist is a privilege she cannot have when seeing how at every opportunity those with wealth, power, and social standings ensure those without are decimated. Yet she is socialized to only blame herself:‘“Some people got religion or killed themselves after losing someone, whether that person died or just left them. Dora Rosario, however, didn’t blame anyone else for her misfortune. Only herself. She loathed herself, but not enough to seek relief in death. No, she simply disliked herself, a more modest sentiment.’For her, the world is bleak and she must silently suffer within it. She is ‘a gray woman, slightly bent, lost in a plundered city deserted after the plague,’ without Duarte, though we do see a transfiguration once her past becomes a broken idol, the crumbling producing a shockwave that will inevitably crumble the lives of all the women in the novel. This little book has some jaw-dropping twists, including the final moments where I wanted to shout “fuuuuuuuuuuck” into the void.‘Men’s dominant positions in [society] allows them to be absolute subjects and to make women into absolute objects,’ wrote Mona Chollet in her book on the stigmas against women, In Defense of Witches, echoing the ideas set forth by Beauvoir. One of these ways is that men have positioned themselves so that ‘their decay is not counted against them’ the way it is for women. Or, as retweeted by  Carrie Fisher while facing age-shaming when she appeared in the Star Wars sequels, ‘Men don’t age better than women, they’re just allowed to age.’ It is constantly thrown at the reader that Dora at age 36 is considered old and obsolete. This has even seeped into teenage Lisa who expresses that ‘by the time you’re thirty, it’s all over.’ Contrasted with this is Ernesto, the wealthy lawyer and pedophile who is able to be considered a sort of silver fox and productive member of society in his late 40s. Similarly, an act that could be a image-destroying moment for a woman is nothing by ‘looking around here and there for a little excitement,’ for a socially fixed man.‘At the same time that young women are disadvantaged by age and gender, youth does carry currency, which can be mistaken for power. If you are a woman, however, this currency is not on your terms.’- Tavi GevinsonThere is another aspect here where underaged girls are told they are mature and given access to social standings yet only for the purpose of abuse. ‘ If you can still be considered “mature for your age,” you are not an older person’s equal,’ Tavi Gevinson warns in her extraodinary article on power dynamics, ‘this observation can easily go from an act of respect to license for harm.’ We have Lisa, freshly 17, who is repeatedly characterized by her ‘love of life,’ her ‘ strange ability to turn people and things into glass or even air,’ and her faith in her hopes and dreams to escape the traps laid out for women. To the lecherous eyes of men, particularly men who have amassed wealth for the purpose of hoarding power over others, this becomes a commodity that they wish to hold. Men often mask their insecurities by dating women much younger than them (Leonardo Dicaprio has reduced himself to simply being a living meme about this) to hold onto the fleeting past of youth and because they can manipulate desire and their wealth to groom them into not noticing the glaring power imbalances. A woman who dates a younger man is considered suspect or unflatteringly called a cougar, but for a nearly-50 year old man to sleep with a teenage girl here they get congratulations at the office. This is particularly vile in a socio-religious community where women are preached at to want nothing beyond household duties and servitude to a husband, and readers here are forced to see the horrors coming of youthful dreams snuffed out to be commoditized into a sexual trophy, to be a housewife in a rich man’s home the ways a hunter hangs heads as decor on their walls. As Chollet writes, this is all another way social conditioning of patriarchy ‘locks women into their role as reproducers and disenfranchises them from participation in the world of work.’Ana, the mother-in-law and ‘the main tower of the fortress,’ is often representative of the internalized misogyny that allows these conditions to persist generationally. In The Second Sex, Beauvoir warns against mothers becoming a mouthpiece for patriarchy by conditioning young girls into lives of domestic servitude (though she most effectively demonstrates this in her novella Inseparable), and we find that the most damning moments in Empty Wardrobes are not only condoned but encouraged by Ana. We find this in other ways, too, such as the cult of silence around abuse or tragedy in the family. Aunt Julia has suffered horribly in the past, but nobody mentions it other than ‘that man,’ or ‘the child’ the same way Dora’s own suffering will be ‘that woman.’ Without giving voice to things, even if it isn’t ‘for polite society,’ it robs women the opportunity to speak out against them or use their voice to demand better. One is reminded of the opening to Betty Friedan’s The Feminine Mystique where she describes a wife who ‘was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question—‘Is this all?’’Which is, effectively, how these women become furniture in their own homes and lives. Or as the narrator says ‘I had ceased to be his companion and become, instead, the landscape to which he had grown accustomed.’ Carvalho’s sharp words force us to revile these realities in Empty Wardrobes, and the devastating conclusion will leave the reader seeing the necessity of speaking out against them. As [author:Kate Zambreno|3501330 writes in her intro, this captures ‘the consciousness of so many women familiar yet unknowable, no longer muted, not saturated with sanctimony but alive, alive with rage transmuting disdain into hilarity by sheer force, alive with intense paroxysms of sadness.’ It is a short book but it will certainly leave a hell of a bruise.4.5/5...more",Notes are private!,0,147,1,"May 23, 2023","May 23, 2023","May 23, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/57570055-empty-wardrobes

Feeli‘I’ve lived like a prisoner to my body.’The struggle to fit into idealized beauty standards and expectations puts a lot of pressure on a person. Feeling she needs to be ‘gwai’, a term with no direct English translation ‘but it means good or obedient,’ Val has grown up equating body image with self worth in Victoria Ying’s graphic novel Hungry Ghost. Gorgeously illustrated by Ying as well, this visual narrative examines issues of eating disorders and the pressures of meeting strict familial expectations. Most difficult for Val is her mother’s constant supervision of her food intake and openly fatphobic criticisms that only exacerbate her inner struggles and obsessions with food and calorie counting. This all comes to a head during a tumultuous time of family tragedy, social drama and the rapidly ending final year of high school, making it a story many will find easy to empathize with. It is written as a YA but it could be enjoyed by any readers of any age as the topics are issues that aren’t just teenage issues. It is a quick read, perhaps a bit too brief to fully invest in all the themes, but it is a heartbreaking story that leads towards a place of healing.   [image]First off, the limited color palette and Ying’s character design are stunning. The architectural art is lovely and the characters are quite effectively expressive. The story moves along at a quick pace—it can easily be read in a single sitting—though when the family tragedy strikes it does feel brushed aside too soon and the threads of family grief, friendship struggles, and Val’s eating disorder seem to be overly competing for space. Ying does succeed however by addressing them all through examinations of mental health and has a positive message of overcoming issues, learning to live with difficult parents and to ‘find your own way to be happy. Whatever that means.’ It is a nice lesson to love yourself for you and not due to social or cultural expectations, as Ying says in the afterword. ‘Val is not me, but I was her,’ Ying writes, and this story is a deeply personal look at eating disorders and family dynamics. Studies have shown 13.2% of girls will have suffered from an eating disorder in the US by the age of 20, and Ying handles addressing the issue with sensitivity. There is a lot of fatphobia in the book (view spoiler)[I felt that went under addressed with the argument with her friend (hide spoiler)] and depictions of purging, so approach the novel at your own comfort level. I do enjoy that Ying includes resources at the back of the book or those seeking more information as well.  [image]Hungry Ghosts is a gracefully handled look at mental health and eating disorders and makes for a well-done and accomplished graphic novel. I love the best friend, Jordan, and she deserves all the happiness. I also feel this will be a rather moving read for many and I am glad I read it.4/5  [image]...more",Notes are private!,0,124,1,"May 20, 2023","May 20, 2023","May 20, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60316974-hungry-ghost

Alone With You in the Ether finds Regan and Aldo caught in each other’s gravitational attraction of love, a love that scorches through them and their physical selves to expose their very essences as forces navigating either by emotion or logic. As they come closer together, we must wonder is ‘it love between them or was it need?’ and are they a safe harbor where the other may flourish or will they run to ruin, dashed to pieces on the shoreline of the other. This is, ultimately, a literary romance, one with grit and uncomfortable explorations into themes of mental health, co-dependency, compulsive self-sabotage and the ways the veil of illusion begins to slip as relationships progress and we must decide to crack or embrace that ‘it is perilously wonderful to suffer so sweetly with you.’ These are flawed characters bruising themselves against the world. Told through prose that has passages so ethereally gorgeous it could only exist in service of love and with a dual narrative that threads their lives together, Alone With You in the Ether is a gorgeously interior and intimate portrait of difficult love that we can’t help but dive into even if it is destined to burn us down to ash as Blake’s storytelling beautifully cuts right into the troubled heart of matters as deeply as she cut into the heart of the reader. ‘There would be times, particularly at first, when Regan would attempt to identify the moment things had set themselves on a path to inevitable collision.’Olivie Blake—a pen name of chosen through a name generator—began her career writing fan fiction and self-publishing novels until going viral on social media landed her a book deal with Tor and the recognition she certainly deserves. Best known for her dark academia fantasy series, The Atlas Six, here Blake writes in ways that feel magical without having to be magic beyond the sparks of love but still retains a very academic atmosphere to her characters and settings. Blake brings Chicago alive here, taking us through the streets, the classrooms of the University of Chicago where Aldo teaches and into the absolutely amazing Art Institute where Regan works as docent. I love that museum intensely and the pair having an affection for the Armory there as the place of their first meeting steals my heart.  [image]The Art Institute of ChicagoBlake delivers seemingly effortless storytelling that loops through exciting metafiction techniques, such as a whole host of narrators intruding in on the story in part 1, including an “overzealous Cubs fan,” or “an aging, arthritic man in possession of many books” as well as stage direction details. It ushers us into the narrative with a fun and frenetic cinematic energy. I would have enjoyed it if Blake continued this style more through the book as I missed it, but once the characters are established it instead turns more inward as they attempt to have more of a harness on their own narratives. The perspective rotates between Regan and Aldo, offering both internal and external perspectives on each other creating more dynamic characters but also allowing us to detect inconsistencies that show how a self-image is often a slight fiction. This is particularly true for Regan who ‘ was most comfortable when she was at her falsest. Regan did not enjoy honesty, she hated it, was repulsed by it and by her own truths especially,’ and the way the readers perceptions on Regan morph over the course of the book—and with new revelations on her life—emphasizes the way a person seems always in flux. But most notably, this sashaying of perspectives is like a needle threading the two together until, at the end, we witness them as a seamless whole viewed from the outside with a conversation entirely narrated of he said and she said instead of a duality of perspective.‘Art is something we do to feel human, not because we are’The prose is quite engaging and this is a much faster paced novel than I tend to read so I was gripped the whole way through. Blake aims for grand phrasing of emotions that land quite impactfully and, sure, it may be overwrought at times but that's exactly how obsessive love feels. I love the way it spirals through the stratosphere or seems to be tumbling out of control or even trails off mid-thought because it so lucidly captures untethered emotions (and intrusive thoughts, which are constantly present in this book). There is a musicality to it, but it is like every instrument in a band trying to all take a solo at once in the cacophony of feeling so much you aren’t sure if you can contain it. It is art, pure and simple.‘You wouldn't make love with him, you'd make art.’The premise is rather cute with Aldo and Regan agreeing to have six conversations to see what they learn about each other, something right in Aldo’s wheelhouse as ‘for Aldo, to love something was to study it; to devote every spare thought to understanding it.’ Yet there is a darkness lurking just beneath, something that might not be immediately evident in the blinding glare of meet-cutes and warm infatuation but still casts shadows they choose to find intriguing instead of alarming. Though Blake does capture the way in the falling-hard stage you tend to feel everything reminds you of that person, akin to learning a new word and seeing it everywhere:‘When you learn a new word, you suddenly see it everywhere. The mind comforts itself by believing this to be coincidence but isn’t—it’s ignorance falling away. Your future self will always see what your present self is blind to. This is the problem with mortality, which is in fact a problem of time.’Was their love for each other there even before them, existing out of time? Or is this a romanticized notion that might not be that healthy to cling to? There are clear mental health struggles with both of them, Regan is avoiding prison for white collar crime largely due to her wealthy parents, and both seem to struggle within society due to their own personalities. Plus Regan has a boyfriend, Mark, who can be cruelly perceptive at times despite being stock-market-wealth garbage. Perhaps the easiest to love character is Masso, Aldo’s charming, well-meaning father—a sharp juxtaposition from Regan’s mother who we see as highly judgemental through Regan’s perceptions—though even he warns Aldo that Regan is the type to burn someone up. ‘So this is what it is to love something you cannot control, he thought. It felt precisely like terror.’The adorableness of the first half of the novel begins to give way to doubts and fears, and this makes a good case for how someone cannot be “fixed” by inserting another person into their lives and that emotional high and romantic monomania will eventually return to the difficulties of love. But in the blazing glory of their initial infatuations we see clear into them and the very essence of their beings, with Regan representative of art and Aldo representative of science. It is why they continuously say they love each other’s brains more than any other aspect of one another, they are trying to love the pure consciousness and essence of the other. Their looks, fears and flaws become just as ornamental as the time and art theories of their conversations that point like maps to their underlying feelings, and I find it a rather beautifully bittersweet theme to place art and science together as a romantic couple hoping their union is an eternal, cosmic force that can even bend time to its will. Aldo’s mind approaches life and love like a math problem, and with his bee obsession I just assume glimpsing in his mind is like looking at this book:  [image]OMFG, BEES!: Bees Are So Amazing and You're About to Find Out WhyRegan approaches life on whims of feelings, something she feels stifled by through her (view spoiler)[court-ordered (hide spoiler)] medications (‘even though she hates her feelings, she'd still rather have them than not’) and has a taste for darkness and self-destruction. ‘Art is loss,’ she muses, ‘it’s the fleeting breath of a foregone moment, the intimacy of things undone, the summer season that passes.’ What begins as romantic starts to look like a mental health spiral, and what comes easily at first is now fraught with fear and uncertainty, especially in Regan. ‘Love doesn’t just sit there, like a stone,’ wrote Ursula K. Le Guin, ‘it has to be made,’ and through these trials will Aldo and Regan discover a way to make lasting love or will they burn up in each other’s atmosphere? ‘To love a person was to forfeit the need to place limits on them, and therefore to love was to exist in a constant, paralyzing threat.’Regan is a fascinating character, one who is certainly flawed and can be rather frustrating at times but you want her to learn to love herself for herself and not because someone else does. She chases highs, she is assailed by intrusive thoughts (some violent), she is her own worst enemy and both she and Aldo fear she is using their relationship as a fix instead of truly working on herself. They are difficult characters but they still deserve to feel love and there were fleeting moments I felt this book was akin to Sally Rooney characters. Regan struggles to define herself for herself and even many of the bad-faith representations of her she rages against are mostly invented in her mind (Blake has a brilliant moment of narrative crafting when we discover the argument between Regan and her mother is all staged in her head though proceed to assume her fictionalized words are the truth of how she feels about Aldo and Regan). Her choice to abandon her meds is troubling, though Blake explains in the afterword that it is not meant as ‘perscriptive’ and is largely based on her own experiences and struggles with medication after a bi-polar diagnosis. It does touch close to the romanticization of mental health struggles being a gateway to good art, which is a troubling perspective, though that doesn’t seem the intent. As Jeanette Winterson writes in her memoir ‘creativity is on the side of health – it isn’t the thing that drives us mad; it is the capacity in us that tries to save us from madness.’ Blake does well by having the story reject any quick fix or certainty, showing mental health is a lifelong journey and encouraging therapy and repeated self-assessment to remain both productive and healthy. Though as the narrator notes ‘“healthy” for them will always be a relative term.’ ‘I want you to bet on me, Aldo. I want you to make investments, I want your future.’People who are difficult to love still deserve to be loved, and that is captured so elegantly in Alone With You in the Ether. I really loved this book and had goosebumps at multiple moments, it is very moving and searingly gorgeous at times. I’m not one usually for a romance novel, but this feels rather different than what one would expect. It is certainly a literary work, and all the heady topics of time theory and reflections and analysis of art are handled in accessible yet ponderous ways that are folded productively into the larger themes of the book. This was my first Olivie Blake and I will certainly read others, it is a book without any fantastical elements though still is undeniably magical.4.5/5‘Tell your mind to be kind to you today.’...more",Notes are private!,11,242,1,"May 19, 2023","May 19, 2023","May 19, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61126612-alone-with-you-in-the-ether

When he isn’t farming or engaging in environment‘Remembering who we are, we live in eternity.’Wendell Berry is a sort of folk hero in the US midwest. When he isn’t farming or engaging in environmental activism, he’s penning gorgeous novels and poems, the latter of which have always been a sort of balm on my weary soul. I love to be outdoors in the peace of wild things, to sit on the banks of a stream and read with nothing but the rippling waters as my soundtrack, and this poem captures that feeling so elegantly. I just want to shout it out:The Peace of Wild ThingsWhen despair for the world grows in meand I wake in the night at the least soundin fear of what my life and my children’s lives may be,I go and lie down where the wood drakerests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds.I come into the peace of wild thingswho do not tax their lives with forethoughtof grief. I come into the presence of still water.And I feel above me the day-blind starswaiting with their light. For a timeI rest in the grace of the world, and am free.Likely his most famous poem, and one worth revisiting whenever that despair of the world nips at your heels. Berry is a perfect poet to recommend to people around West Michigan (and I do so often) as he captures the lovelier vibes of this region so well in his works. I once had a person enter the bookstore and was thrilled we had “so many books by his neighbor.” Come to find out they have neighboring farms and he told me how active Berry has always been in local politics and regional environmental protection work. So that was awesome. The Earth and all it’s treasures are a theme that permeate his works which often deal with existing peacefully within nature and cultivating it in a way that we can grow as people while nature grows wild around us. He deals with grief in very moving ways, and his poems are usually uplifting and healing. He is able to discuss love in ways that encompasses both love for one another and for nature so tightly bound together:And when we speak together,love, our words riselike leaves, out of our fallenwords. What we have saidbecomes an earth we live onlike two trees,whose sheddingsenrich each other, makingboth the source of each.There’s a very spiritual aspect to his works that blend with an aim towards social justice, and when Berry wants to be cutting he throws heavy punches:Questionnaire1. How much poison are you willingto eat for the success of the freemarket and global trade? Pleasename your preferred poisons.2. For the sake of goodness, how muchevil are you willing to do?Fill in the following blankswith the names of your favoriteevils and acts of hatred.3. What sacrifices are you preparedto make for culture and civilization?Please list the monuments, shrines,and works of art you wouldmost willingly destroy.4. In the name of patriotism andthe flag, how much of our belovedland are you willing to desecrate?List in the following spacesthe mountains, rivers, towns, farmsyou could most readily do without.5. State briefly the ideas, ideals, or hopes,the energy sources, the kinds of security,for which you would kill a child.Name, please, the children whomyou would be willing to kill. Which, alright man, yea, fuck ‘em up, Berry. He has a series of longer poems titled The Mad Farmer Poems such as the Manifesto: The Mad Farmer Liberation Front with lines like ‘what man / has not encountered he has not destroyed. / Ask the questions that have no answers.’ and sure it’s a bit corny and gets pretty religiously preachy at times but his heart is in the right place and its cool I guess. It is a very West Michigan “cool liberal white Christian” vibe, trust me that’s a thing here but without them we wouldn’t have most of the social justice marches that get organized locally. But anyways here’s another well known Berry poem:Our Real WorkIt may be that when we no longer know what to dowe have come to our real work,and that when we no longer know which way to gowe have come to our real journey.The mind that is not baffled is not employed.The impeded stream is the one that sings.Berry is rather prolific, with many novels and collections of essays. He has a sort of cranky old man vibe he likes to cultivate and it is rather endearing. You hear it in his essays, but you can really feel it in his poems in a way that seems like hanging with your grandfather. I’ve always enjoyed his self-reflection in the poem A Warning to My Readers:Do not think me gentlebecause I speak in praiseof gentleness, or elegantbecause I honor the gracethat keeps this world. I ama man crude as any,gross of speech, intolerant,stubborn, angry, fullof fits and furies. That Imay have spoken wellat times, is not natural.A wonder is what it is.He also can write really succinct poems that say a lot, and for that I really appreciate him. I have a public poetry project where I write poems I love on little paintings I’ve made and I use Berry quite often for that reason (well, and people around here love him. If you ask people in West Michigan who say they like poetry, the most common answer is Mary Oliver but Berry is a close second.To Think of the Life of a ManIn a time that breaksin cutting pieces all around,when men, voicelessagainst thing-ridden men,set themselves on fire, it seemstoo difficult and rareto think of the life of a mangrown whole in the world,at peace and in place.But having thought of itI am beyond the timeI might have sold my handsor sold my voice and mindto the arguments of powerthat go blind againstwhat they would destroy.While it can be a bit corny, I do have a huge soft spot for ole Wendell. Those who tend to enjoy religious-themed poetry will really enjoy him as well, as he has a huge collection of what he calls his Sabbath Poems, which are poems he writes about his walks he takes every sunday, and are often very religious in theme. Berry can capture nature so well, and especially the need to protect it and live sustainably to keep the world nourished and thriving so that we, too, can be nourished and thrive within it. A sweet and healing collection.⅘What We Need is HereHorseback on Sunday morning,harvest over, we taste persimmonand wild grape, sharp sweetof summer's end.

Myth or mouthwe migrants are its mystery.’Marie Ponsot was ‘one of the major poets of her generation,’ wrote fellow poet Marilyn Hacker, and though she didn’t write many volumes of work, Ponsot’s was highly decorated in awards and have left quite a lasting impression on me. Springing: New and Selected Poems is a perfect window into her wondrous words (only missing the poems from her last collection, Easy: Poems from 2009). Ponsot is a master at form, often writing luminous sestinas that pull the reader into surprising territory as the poem progresses. Her wordplay and imagery are always crisp and driving, with many poems that examine philosophical musings, looks at married life, and often focus on women who are otherwise overlooked in society. This is a great collection that I have practically dogeared half the pages, returning again and again to Ponsot’s words which always seem to hit best in the springtime weather such as I am sitting right now.Among WomenWhat women wander?Not many. All. A few.Most would, now & then,& no wonder.Some, and I’m one,Wander sitting still.My small grandmotherBought from every peddlerLess for the ribbons and laceThan for their scentOf sleep where you will,Walk out when you want, chooseYour bread and your company.She warned me, “Have nothing to lose.”She looked fragile but hadHigh blood, runner’s ankles,Could endure, endure.She loved her rooted garden, herGrand children, her onceWild once young man.Women wanderAs best they can.Ponsot published her first collection in 1956 while in Paris though wouldn’t return to poetry until 1981. She spent these years translating childrens books—many of them fairy tales—from French, which I feel reflects well in the way her poetry is rather succinct in imagery. I always found it fascinating that she was friends and mentor to sci-fi writer Samuel R. Delany. She published five volumes of poetry through her life, as well as this selected work and, later, a collected poems, and received many awards such as a National Book Critics Circle Award, the Robert Frost Poetry Award, and the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize among others. I enjoy that Ponsot is able to say a lot in a short amount of space, keeping to a tight form with short lines that flow slow and smooth like a calm river, her imagery catching the sunlight and dazzling you. She can even write very short poems with grace:Bliss and GriefNo oneIs hereRight nowPonsot wrote often about the use of form in poetry and how it can be a tool to guide you, like a blank map for you to fill in as you go along. ‘ What you’re doing is trying to discover,’ she writes, ‘[forms] are not restrictive. They pull things out of you. They help you remember.’ I love the notion that poetry is an act of remembering, that the process of creation is actually on of drawing the poem out of you, where it has always been, and trying to contain the fragile thing in words that will allow it to be held and examined for years to come.Roundstone CoveThe wind rises. The sea snarls in the fogfar from the attentive beaches of childhood—no picnic, no striped chairs, no sand, no sun.Here even by day cliffs obstruct the sun;moonlight miles out mocks this abyss of fog.I walk big-bellied, lost in motherhood,hunched in a shell of coat, a blindered hood.Alone a long time, I remember sun—poor magic effort to undo the fog.Fog hoods me. But the hood of fog is sun.Marie Ponsot is a lovely poet that has left us with stunning words to remember her by. ‘There’s a primitive need for language that works as an instrument of discovery and relief,’ Ponsot wrote about poetry, ‘that can make rich the cold places of our inner worlds with the memorable tunes and dreams poems hold for us.’ There is a dreamlike quality to her writing that prove this true, and her poems often carry the scent of the breeze, the rush of the seas, and the warmth of sun in her words. Springing is a lovely book, one worth having in any collection of poetry.4/5A VisitCome for duty’s sake (as girls do) we watchThe sly very old woman wile away from her piousAnd stagger-blind friend, their daily split of gin.She pours big drinks.

Still in recent memory are the debates over American Dirt, which sparked months of controversy over white authors using another’s cultural narrative as what many considered “trauma porn,” but also over the publisher’s decision to throw incredible amounts of marketing money at this book when immigration stories by authors living within the culture were being passed over for that novel. R.F. Kuang’s Yellowface sinks its teeth into the world of publishing and the discourses on authenticity through the eyes of June Hayward, a white woman who has taken the draft of a Chinese-American woman’s novel and published it as her own. She will forever be haunted by this choice, like a Lady Macbeth of letters haunted by bloodstains in her attempt to usurp the kingdom. It is a perfect follow-up to Babel and the conversations on how language can be a form of colonialism, though this one has no magical elements like the former. Instead, Yellowface reads like a scandal unfolding before your eyes and transfixes the reader with all the sick satisfactions that keep us scrolling through social media debates and keep hot takes. Kuang makes us sit with our discomfort, through an excellent choice of an unreliable narrator, and forces us to confront our own opinions on the matter. With a sharp critique on the commodification and consumption of art in publishing and ing (even Goodreaders are not spared here), a look at online debates, the self-aggrandizing aspects of social media, and the way artists are pitted against each other as if writing was a competitive sport, Kuang’s Yellowface asks big questions on authenticity and identity in a society that has reduced the concepts into marketing metrics.I’ll be honest, I read this book in a single sitting. I could not look away, and Kuang’s writing sweeps you up in it’s conversational cadance. While I’ve enjoyed Kuang’s writing previously, Yellowface feels very polished and matured, the novel reading with the ease and eagerness of a tell-all memoir, which is the framing of the story. As a fictional memoir, it drops a lot of pop culture references to key into a specific time. Kuang’s choice of perspective through June—who rebrands at the request of her publisher as Juniper Song, Song being her middle-name but also nudges readers to think she may have Chinese heritage—is brilliant as it allows us to feel the floor-dropping-out discomfort of becoming the focus of internet rage as well as navigate a vigorous criticism of the publishing industry. Kuang is able to cover issues without moralizing, making the reader sift through alternating opinions that are likely to expose their own assumptions and discomforts, and we must always remember the telling is often guiding us away from judging her and towards everyone else. With a big confession at the center, June can manipulate the reader on smaller issues and in a way it becomes a rather metafictional approach to the way storytelling is just that: fictionalizing stories. Kuang does well by creating a character that isn’t entirely unsympathetic—we need to want to keep reading her take on the events—and hate reading is a shallow effect that evaporates quickly. Not unlike the social media scandals that hit viciously and are forgotten days later. Not that June is innocent, and being disgusted with her is half the fun, but Kuang will force us to consider what exactly it is that disgusts us and what that means in a larger context about art and the commodification of it. We’ve seen these sorts of scandals, such as a personal favorite bizarre tale of Natalie Beach who wrote about being the ghostwriter for Caroline Calloway, or last year’s Who Is the Bad Art Friend? article concerning Sonya Larson and Dawn Dorland where everyone seemed to be too thrilled by the mess to not pick a side. Though the story that seems closest to Yellowface is the one surrounding Kristen Roupenian’s short story Cat Person (you can read it here) which was defended then later attacked when an article revealing the details was taken from a strangers real life, told to the author by the man who was fictionalized in the story as the sex pest and later committed suicide in real life. Twitter was full of well-known authors debating if personal details and stories of others are always fair game, even though the hometown and place of employment of the girl was not changed for the published version (my college roommate later rented the house Roupenian had previously lived in and describes in story). Literary twitter was confronted with a situation about what level of authenticity is appropriate and can someone tell someone else’s story. The way social media fuels a fire is at the heart of this story, with twitter challenging authenticity and morals at all times. Which becomes a tragic interplay at the way authors are demanded to be vulnerable, to seek authenticity and expose their pain for book sales, yet social media loves to exploit personal details and use vulnerabilities as an opening for an attack. ‘dozen, maybe hundreds, maybe thousands of strangers are out there, mining your personal information, worming their ways into your life, looking for ways to mock, humiliate, or worse, endanger you. You come to regret everything you’ve ever shared about yourself…because the trolls will find them.’We’ve all most likely criticized a stranger on social media, sometimes the pile-ups are too fun and humorous to not get a joke in, but Kuang tries to remind us that the targets are real people with real feelings. Sure, June deserves to be exposed and feel bad for what she’s done, but Kuang puts us in her shoes and lets you feel what being a target is like. Because it can come for anyone, even Athena was once the target of harassment, death threats and hacking where she didn’t feel safe all for being called a ‘race traitor’ for dating a white man. ‘In destroying her,’ June narrates the voice of social media, ‘we create an audience we create moral authority for ourselves.’ Such is the nature of social media in the state of a scandal, and all for what? ‘ Allegations get flung left and right, everyone’s reputations are torn down, and when the dust clears, everything remains exactly as it was.’ Nothing changes, but, as we see in the novel, much of this is because someone profits from it. A scandal often turns into book sales (for all the complaints American Dirt was canceled it still remained a bestseller for months) and if you keep selling books you keep getting published. ‘The living are burdened with bodies. They make shadows, footprints.’But lets move to the scandal at hand. Here we have June, who has a tepid friendship with rising literary star Athena Liu. She feels jealous as well as annoyance with Athena, fantasizing how she’d like to ‘ neatly peel her skin off her body like an orange and zip it up over myself,’ something she is soon metaphorically doing when she edits the now deceased Athena’s manuscript: a WW1 novel about Chinese laborers. It starts off innocently enough (or so June claims) being an exercise in editing that she gets so caught up in loving writing again that she passes it off as herself. It is titled The Last Front, is praised for a mosaic storytelling style reminiscent of the film Dunkirk and becomes an instant bestseller. She will spend the novel fiercely defending she has the right to tell this story—sometimes being rewarded such as when speaking at a Chinese American Social Club she is thanked by a man who’s Chinese father fought in the war for making sure their stories are told—yet at the end of the day, this never was her story. And while she can be a great writer, we see she is never able to come up with her own ideas and the ones she have is derivative of other stories. It is a subtle and clever nod to a gap between being a good writer and being a good author or creator (an offer to write for existing IP disgusts her, perhaps because she is confronted by what she doesn’t want to admit is her strength). ‘It all boils down to self-interest…If publishing is rigged, you might as well make sure it's rigged in your favor.’While the marketing grab here is definitely the idea of colonizing another’s work and culture and passing it off as your own (there are many moments for readers to fist bump the novel and say “HAHA take that shit, “Junie””) Kuang makes this a symptom of a larger issue. In her acknowledgements, Kuang states that the novel is a ‘horror story about loneliness in a fiercely competitive industry.’ If your ears perked up at horror story, there are some horror elements late in the novel (though perhaps not enough and it could have been threaded in longer, if I have one complaint it is that the novels episodic feel never quite let individual elements breathe enough and makes the last portion feel a bit like going one step more than needed instead of flowing from the book which would have sidestepped that feeling? Maybe thats just me though). But loneliness does permeate this tale, and we see how authors can feel crushed under the way for-profit publishing makes it a competition who awards winners and losers. One author will get a huge deal and seemingly inexhaustible marketing, while another gets one small print run and no publisher support. Kuang looks at publishing as a rigged enterprise, with a small team of (mostly white) executives deciding what gets sold and more or less deciding what will be a bestseller and informing readers to follow suit. Its not a secret that publishers buy space in chain bookstores or that the Big 5 US publishers are 80% of all publishing revenue. It is a market based on profit, and will be manipulated to ensure profits keep coming.‘This industry is built on silencing us, stomping us into the ground, and hurling money at white people to produce racist stereotypes of us.’To June, however, she sees diversity as a problem, thinking she is passed over for authors like Athena because it looks good. Which, if we look at the publishing market, shows that about 75% of published authors in the US are white and a 2020 study showed 95% of all books published were by white authors the previous year.[image]Now everyone probably remembers 2020 was the year many corporations made pledges to be better at diversity, the publishing industry under extra scrutiny as Black authors and anti-racism books were topping the best sellers and showing there was indeed a market for such books, but lets look at the industry itself. Since then, a recent survey shows only a 1% change in the industry, with it being 83% white and that most non-white hires since 2020 are for marketing positions. Which is using “diversity” as a sales technique again.[image]So what June see’s as a fast-track to success is actually a steep uphill climb. ‘""Do you know how much shit Athena got from this industry?’ a character remarks late in the novel, ‘They marked her as their token, exotic Asian girl. Every time she tried to branch out to new projects, they kept insisting that Asian was her brand, was what her audience expected.’ To be a brand is what publishing reduces identity into is the argument seen in the novel. And, if one is reduced to being a brand of themselves, they are now in market competition. I think of author Brandon Taylor saying identity becomes a marketing pitch, and how Real Life was ed as about identity when he says it was about lonely that happened to have explorations of identity in the book. I'm reminded of the reasons authors pushed against #OwnVoices labels as Becky Albertalli felt forced to come out to ""justify"" her book and others felt boxed in by it.  ‘Do you know what it's like to pitch a book and be told they already have an Asian writer? That they can't put out two minority stories in the same season? That Athena Liu already exists, so you're redundant?’Kuang examines how the idea of being a brand exists in the outskirts of publishing as well. We have the twitter fights where people exist as a self-brand of being antagonists, we have goodreads ers where their brand is taking down popular authors (some lines that may sting are remarks from other authors to not read goodreads and harsh takes are more about feeding ego than worthwhile criticism), and journalists who make a brand at hot takes. However, we have to remember that June is directing us to look at how everyone else is the problem instead of her. So while through her telling many of the critiques are cast as villains, the fictional journalist Adele Sparks-Sato (a nod to Andrea Long Chu as Vartika pointed out) is not wrong when writing that June’s version of Athena’s novel ‘joins novels like The Help and The Good Earth in a long line of what I dub historical exploitation novels: inauthentic stories that use troubled pasts as an entertaining set piece for white entertainment.’‘The appropriation of history, the historicization of the past, the narrativization of society, all of which give the novel its force, include the accumulation and differentiation of social space, space to be used for social purposes.’-Edward Said, Culture and Imperialism There is a good deal of nuance in this book about how the commodification of art is an issue, but also a reminder that we can’t scapegoat our own actions on that entirely. There are some great little jabs in this—Junie Song ordering a Miss Saigon drink only to find it “too sweet” for her tastes—and it does emphasize the problems of representing a different culture from a western lens. As Edward Said wrote ‘the power to narrate, or to block other narratives from forming and emerging is very important to culture and imperialism,’ and argued that literature can be a form of colonialism by establishing a perception of a different culture or geography, and in the editing process of The Last Front we watch June make concessions on the text in order to appeal more to a white reader as requested by her publisher. Yes, she did actually do a great deal of research, and her opinion is the criticisms of cultural issues in the book are ‘exclusive cultural snobbishness and authenticity testing’ that ‘are only a form of gatekeeping,’ though later criticisms of her book are that her misunderstanding of how names or families work, or how her positions on certain issues imply a stance on current Chinese politics that are so beyond her understanding can be harmful. Some readers find it to read as a white-savioir narrative, something we know was manufactured by changing certain characters to be white characters to better fit the market needs. Which also returns us to the idea that art under capitalism will always be in service to profits. Yellowface by R.F. Kuang is a delightful novel with the fierceness of an unfolding scandal that makes us confront many key issues hotly debated in the literary world right now. I enjoyed the nuance here in how it exposes problems from many angles, but does not allow that to be an excuse for bad behavior. Understanding is not the same as condoning here, and it is a page-turning trip watching June dip and dodge as her usurped empire continuously threatens to crash down around her. Kuang writes with confidence and precision and Yellowface makes for an excellent look at the literary world and the commodification of art.4.5/5‘Isn’t that what ghosts do? Howl, moan, make themselves into spectacles? That’s the whole point of a ghost, is it not? Anything to remind you that they’re still there. Anything to keep you from forgetting.’Update: I got to hear R.F. Kuang speak about the book yesterday! She was DELIGHTFUL, discussed why she dislikes how publishing turns identity into marketing metrics, the books Beautiful World, Where Are You, Ferrante's Neapolitan novels and told everyone to read Murderbot. So well spoken, intelligent, and a real wonderful author.[image]...more",Notes are private!,42,1187,1,"May 16, 2023","May 16, 2023","May 16, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59357120-yellowface

The cop is well-‘Most injustices are irreversible, that’s why they’re so unbearable.’A routine stop places a teenage boy at the mercy of a young cop. The cop is well-regarded despite a quick temper, the boy is known for causing trouble. The cop is white, the boy is not. The cop lives, the boy does not. This is a familiar story we see play out on the news all the time, and Nothing is Lost by Cloé Mehdi (translated from the French by Howard Curtis) takes us fifteen years beyond the protests in the wake of a boy, Saïd, being murdered at the hands of a police officer and a judge acquitting the officer. Despite society trying to move on and forget, the boy cannot, his family cannot, and perhaps we all should not. Nothing is Lost examines the long shock wave of repercussions, told in a direct noir-esque style from the perspective of 11-year old Mattia who has been placed in the care of young 20-something Ze after his father—a social worker close to Saïd—committed suicide in a mental hospital following the protests. Through a cast of empathic and struggling characters and a plot driven by a mystery of information withheld from our narrator, Mehdi delivers a moving look at mental health and a sharp condemnation of police brutality and the sociopolitical forces that enable it while examining how, for the lower classes and people of color, ‘justice’ is just a ‘word that no longer means anything if it ever did mean anything.’ ‘When you murder our children with impunity you can’t expect there to be no repercussions.’Mehdi has already made quite a name for herself in France within the noir genre. Nothing Is Lost came out in 2016 (the English translation was published by Europa in 2023) and was highly decorated with awards such as the Polar Student Prize, the Dora Suarez Prize, and the Mystère de la critique Prize among others. I must admit it took me a bit to get into the novel as it starts a bit slow and detached while you gather your bearings on who is who and why anything is happening. I almost abandoned it after setting it down for a few weeks but I am ever so glad I picked it back up because once the pieces start sliding into place this really picks up. As the story gathers velocity and tension, uncovering secrets and creating new ones as it goes, it begins to increase in scope and perspectives until you can feel the weight of the whole community navigating this perilous and politically charged situation. ‘I’m not here as a judge, or a juror, or a lawyer. I’m only a listener. A belated witness.’The noir elements are quite engaging as well. Each character is rather hardened to their situation and while it is a rather bleak emotional landscape—be advised that along with the theme of police brutality and murder there is also frequent discussion of suicide, including an attempt by Mattia when he was 7—there is still a lot of heart. While we don’t have foggy alleyways and action glimpsed only in shadows, everything is still just out of focus behind a fog of disconnect as Mattia is often left out of the loop, knowing there is much more tying the incidents of being followed and the string of break-ins that seem much more like the handiwork of cops than burglars. ‘I’m like a detective in a book,’ Mattia thinks, ‘I’m trying to put all the clues together, but not everybody can do that, and I don’t understand what’s going on.’ While Mattia’s voice seems much older than an 11 year old, having it be from his perspective does allow the novel to be not only a critique of police and the judicial system but how systems from mental health, childcare and education are also failing marginalized and poor communities. ‘The discrepancy between real life and what they force you to listen to all day long in a stifling classroom grabs me by the throat as never before,’ Mattia thinks as checking academic boxes feels very backseat in his life compared to being tailed by potential gangsters and his caregiver’s suicide attempts. Why learn of wars in the past from a comfortable distance, he thinks when ‘they just have to go out on the streets’ to see one in real time.‘Because we’re always alone and we might as well get used to it.’What really makes this novel are the characters, whom you can’t help but growing quickly attached to despite their many flaws and sketchy pasts. There is Ze, Mattia’s caregiver, who reads much like a hero of a Roberto Bolaño novel being a nightwatchman and ‘who’s already killed once and who drowns himself in poetry to avoid thinking about it, the way others drown themselves in alcohol or heroin.’ But what is the truth behind the reason people call Ze a murderer, the incident that got him locked up in the psychiatric ward where he would meet Mattia’s father before his death? We also have his girlfriend Gabriella who has attempted suicide repeatedly and seems a frail rose withering a winter storm. Elsewhere we have Mattia’s sister, Gina, who has ‘inherited from my mother the art of keeping silent about important things, and from my father the art of escaping,’ and reappears at random when not off doing something that seems to be dangerous and driving the action from off-stage.‘The destroyers will rarely be held accountable. Mostly they will receive pensions.’-Ta-Nehisi CoatesThe various character’s connections with the Saïd story, which is the center of gravity around which the elements of the novel spin in orbit, provide some interesting twists that only complicate matters. Saïd’s death is a tragedy, but also just one of many similar instances that get washed away by a judge (throughout the novel we hear several newscasts showing similar incidents are still occuring) and we wonder what is causing a renewed interest in his case with graffiti—‘Justice for Saïd’—appearing around town. Police brutality is a major issue that Mehdi hopes to draw attention to. On average each year ‘the police in France ’kill 15 to 20 people in a population of 70 million’ says Sebastian Roché, author of the book Police de proximité: Nos politiques de sécurité, and a 2020 national report showed that young men of Arab and Black African background are 20 times more likely to be randomly stopped by the police than the rest of the population.   [image]The 2016 death of Adama Traoré in police custody (same year this book was published) sparked protests and was revitalized during the summer of 2020 protests against police brutality that occurred globally. Others such as Amine Bentounsi, Remi Fraisse, Théo Luhaka, Cédric Chouviat were remembered as well as working-class victims of police brutality, most of whom are Black or Arab.   [image]Image: Black Lives Matter protests against police brutality in Paris (top) and Washington DC (bottom) in June 2020At the time I’m writing this, 363 people have been killed by the police in the United States (where I am) since the start of 2023. 2022 was the highest on record with 1,176 killed by cops (1,047 in 2021). Black people were 26% of those killed despite being 13% of the population. Most killings occur during a routine traffic stop or mental health check, with only a third of all US police killings being in response to a possible violent crime (most are unarmed) and an average of 250,000 people are injured during police interactions, with major cities paying out $millions in settlement fees over wrongful injuries a year. Even if someone runs or has a criminal past, it is not reason for a stop to become ‘be a capital offense, rendered without trial, with the officer as judge and executioner,’ as Ta-Nehisi Coates writes in his memoir Between the World and Me. ‘It’s funny, this tendency they have always to strike where they can kill by mistake,’ Mattia muses in the novel, and most often the offending officer is reinstated. All this to say it is necessary that books like Nothing is Lost exist to explore these issues through fiction that resonates so emotionally and puts the reader inside the tragedies. ‘Closing your eyes to what’s going on in the world doesn’t wipe it out.’Something Mehdi does quite effectively is emphasize how these issues are systemic failures. We see how the lower classes are left behind, with gentrified neighborhood leaving many without a place to live, how schools aren’t properly funded to reach all students needs, how criminalization of poor or non-white youth creates a stigma of assumption of them as criminals and a pipeline towards prison without an adequate support network when they get out (an institutional failure that individual organizations are often left to try and assist piecework, with libraries such as my own taking on a lot of the effort to connect people with access to aid for housing and jobs). This was Mattia’s father’s job as a social worker, a job that took a heavy emotional toll on him. And as the novel progresses we must question if his paranoia was schizophrenia as people claimed or a misdiagnosis that directed attention away from the gaslighting done to him by the local police who might have actually been following him and bugging his home. The why is a big question the novel meanders towards. But also we see how the acquitals only embolden the police, with the killer cop here being ‘welcomed so warmly at the station that he ended up telling himself it wasn’t so serious. And the law merely confirmed that feeling…He ended up convincing himself that it really was self-defense, that he’d had no choice.’As Sebastian Roché says, ‘for them the problem doesn't even exist. So that's the heart of the problem. If we don't recognize that it's there, how can we make things better?’ This is a question the characters struggle with all novel long, with Gina being the only to offer any sort of idea that ‘the only solution is to burn it all down.’ One can only guess where this novel is headed with an aim like that. ‘the reason it’s come to this isn’t because a teenager was killed, or even because his murderer wasn’t punished. It’s because nobody spoke up. When a police officer is killed by a delinquent, he’s mourned, salutes are fired in his memory, he’s decorated, and even ministers file past his grave with tears in their eyes. When a delinquent is killed by a police officer, the silence is deafening.’Mehdi hits at the heart of the problem, and it is that these things happen and we are just expected to move on and consider it natural. That State violence is just something we should accept, even when the systems that are supposed to uphold society are faulty and create downward spirals that lead to this. That for many, there is no safety net, and ‘ if you let yourself be swallowed up by the world…if you slip’ not only will nobody catch you but people will contort themselves to convince the world you deserved it through articles written in passive voice and bad-faith rhetoric that upholds State violence and inequity of budgets at the cost of human lives.‘Why should I be afraid of them, I’m afraid of people who kill, and around here the people who kill are cops.’This also becomes a look at how communities who are left behind or ignored have nobody but themselves to save them and must come together. There are protests but, as Gina observes, ‘anyone would have thought it was a civil war, but it was merely one more confrontation on a relentless chessboard where there had been thousands of others.’ There is a particularly striking scene when in the midst of the chaos during a protest being broken up by police she sees it is all taking place in front of a perfume ad declaring the world a beautiful place. We can make it one, Mehdi seems to hint, but it will take communal action and a massive transformation to bring justice back to life. As Maya Schenwar writes in Who Do You Serve, Who Do You Protect? Police Violence and Resistance:‘Our struggle for justice demands much more than any single indictment. It cannot be litigated, legislated or bought into existence. And there is no amount of money that could make up for the lives and human dignity lost to police and state violence against our communities. Instead, if we are to truly honor the magnitude of the injustice, we must commit ourselves to nothing less than the complete transformation of society.’This is a harrowing and gritty novel that forces us to look police brutality directly in the eye. At times it seems a bit much, especially as the extent of a cover-up seems excessive considering how often killings get brushed under the rug even in light of video evidence, but it makes for a tense and compelling read. This is a noir with social justice as the lifeblood keeping the story alive and the reader turning pages and Nothing Is Lost presents an important message we should not look away from.3.75/5‘The next time we see each other there’ll be bars between us, all because a fucking cop lost his cool one day, all because justice only applies to one side, all because they have their own criteria for determining who’s a monster and who isn’t, who’s a murderer and who’s made a forgivable error, to err is human, isn’t it, it is if you’re a cop, it isn’t if you’re a delinquent, so knowing all the facts, choose sides, my friend . . .’...more",Notes are private!,0,118,1,"May 13, 2023","May 13, 2023","May 13, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/90871248-nothing-is-lost

I mean, Toy Story certainly aided in that, though it was rather creepy to think they were hiding their lives from you and gave me a huge guilt-complex about throwing away old toys, but there was also that story about the cupboard that brought toys to life. Would your toys menace you or would they be your friends and aid you on epic adventures? Made Things, the novella from the marvelous Adrian Tchaikovsky, brings us into a Victorian-era-esque fantasy world where two puppets have been brought to life. Coppelia, a Dickens-esque street thief who has escaped the orphanage and is always in the processes of escaping the police, has the ability to bring tiny homunculi to life and together they form a cute and charming team. When a heist for a gollum goes wrong, the three will have to work together and need more than their magic to save them in this page-turner of a story that might be a bit light on plot but excels in fantastical world building and blissful imaginative playfulness. ‘What’s the world coming to?...I remember when this was simple. And now there’s little doll people threatening me with a shave. Fuck me.’This is a cool story and I’ve come to really respect Tchaikovsky for his wit and charm, managing to usually balance funny and heartfelt with gritty darkness and rather deep themes and ideas. While Made Things is certainly on the lighter side for him, it still manages to blow your mind from time to time. Plus he’s always able to write really excellent women leads as well as include a lot of queer representation so naturally into his stories. He’s doing an event at our library this summer (shoutout to Annaka for being the coolest librarian ever and making that happen) so I’ll be on a Tchaikovsky kick for awhile (if you want to attend, let me know and I can make a digital link happen). The world building here is spectacular, being done with only the minimal amount of details needed to imply a much vaster magical world just beyond the pages. The story takes place in the magical city of Loretz and the whole thing feels very British and it’s impossible to read this without implying an accent in your head (especially the cops running about calling Coppelia “moppet” all the time) and that just adds to the fun. This would make a wonderful film (please adapt novellas instead of novels, they work better and you don’t have to cut things out!) and if I had my way it would be done as claymation. It’s just a really cute story with plenty of action and heart.‘This city is ruled by magicians who hoard their magic. The poor are ruled by thieves who hoard gold and what magic they can get. Anything the human girl has can be taken from her.’On the subject of world building, I really enjoyed how much this story gets into the society of Loretz, especially in terms of social class. We have a definite ruling class that oppresses the poorer classes, and within them there is a hierarchy such as the thief lords and their band of petty thieves. Made Things is rather trope-y and straightforward, but he uses tropes in fun and interesting ways to create this magical world. It feels familiar in a good way, the way the best of children’s films or books tend to do and makes me wonder if this would actually have been improved being written more aimed at a younger audience (which is to say, fan of Neil Gaiman would likely enjoy this book and should definitely check out his others). There is also a wonderful excursion through the world of magic and all the different sorts of living puppets. Coppelia is helping them expand their society and this becomes a rather lovely look at found families, the sort you might least expect.Overall, this is quite cute and fun, but a bit light. I'm also very underversed in fantasy so that might play a part in it. Had this been any other author I might have enjoyed this a bit more but I just know Tchaikovsky has more in him and also after a few really excellent novels “in the genre” this just felt more like a palette cleanser than anything. Which is fine, and it works wonderfully as such and I suspect a lot of readers will have a blast with this. I will certainly be reading more Tchaikovsky.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,0,109,1,"May 11, 2023","May 11, 2023","May 11, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/44581532-made-things

But apparently once you start, you can't just stop.’There are few things more blissful than a snarky robot kicking ass, saving the day and being completely annoyed about it the entire time. Blissful enough to earn this series a Hugo at least, and Rogue Protocol, the third installment of the Murderbot Diaries shows Martha Wells just gets better and better. Immediately following the last book, we now find Murderbot caught up in a life-or-death situation when spying on a terraforming group in order to get some dirt on GrayCris Corporation. You know, the company that almost got everyone killed in the first book and seems willing to kill again to keep their illegal activities under wraps. With a new cast of characters for Murderbot to begrudgingly protect and chock full of high-energy sci-fi action, Rogue Protocol is another brilliant chapter in this ongoing tale of a socially awkward security droid with a big heart.‘Who knew being a heartless killing machine would present so many moral dilemmas. (Yes, that was sarcasm.)’After ART from Artificial Condition turned out to be a one-off character, I thought I’d have to continue on with a big ART-shaped hole in my heart. Enter Miki. Miki is about as corny and saccharine as possible so you can only imagine how irritated Murdebot is at all times. It is delightful. Miki calls everyone “friend” and ‘really thought its humans were its friends, because that’s how they treated it,’ which horrifies our snarky hero and makes Murderbot ponder that ‘somewhere there had to be a happy medium between being treated as a terrifying murder machine and being infantilized.’ Add to my glee Murderbot having to constantly save people, including at the beginning acting as security on the transport and breaking up drunken fights and later when shit hits the fan on the terraforming site amidst betrayals (because ‘humans are so fucking unreliable’) and surprise murderous combat units. Through all the action we can count on a good ‘oh for fucks sake,’ from our narrator as well as some amazing fight scenes.‘They were all annoying and deeply inadequate humans, but I didn’t want to kill them. Okay, maybe a little.’I also loved seeing Murderbot be exposed as a SecUnit and get to fall back into that role again. Which they are fine with because ‘I was tired of pretending to be human. I needed a break,’ and it also opens the door for just a ton of action in this book. This book is full of twists, fists, and bullets around every flip of the page and I gleefully rode along. As expected there are also some killer one-liners like ‘There needs to be an error code that means “I received your request but decided to ignore you.”’ and so much personality its hard to believe this is under 200pgs. ‘If you had to take care of humans, it was better to take care of small soft ones who were nice to you and thought you were great because you kept preventing them from being murdered.’Honestly, each time I finish one of these I think they can’t get better and then Wells has pulled it off again. This even has a heartbreaking moment, so, yay. Rogue Protocol—can we talk about how hilariously over the top these titles are, it’s like a rejected James Bond title and I LOVE that about these books—has as many laughs as it does space bullets and I can’t wait to keep reading them. I flat out fucking love these.4.5/5‘If there was one thing good about this situation, it was reinforcing how great my decisions to (a) hack my governor module and (b) escape were.

From the ashes of a kingdom devoured by the mouths of mermaids born to a king and his living myth turned chattel and status symbol to a mysterious cult deep in the forests of the taiga, Khaw sends us shivering along with our mermaid narrator and her companion, a genderless plague doctor where magic and myth buts against morality. Utterly impossible to put down, The Salt Grows Heavy is a ghastly and gruesome tale told in gorgeous, lyrical prose as if from the choirs of hell.For maximum enjoyment, listen to Mermaids by Florence + the Machine along with the .‘[T]here is nothing fair or sweet about this world.’This is not a story for the feint of heart and has teeth as sharp as the mermaids within it. Effectively a sequel to her earlier short story And In Our Daughters, We Find a Voice (you can read it here, though it is included at the end of the book), Khaw delivers an excellent frightfest and dynamic world-building in just 100pgs. It is a violent story, but the telling of it will grab you by the throat and you’ll dare not look away. Khaw writes in such an impressive and vast thematic lexicon that feels as otherworldly as it is grotesque. Some may call it over-written, and I won’t argue despite loving it, though I’d argue against it being indulgent as it is consistent and grants the story such a darkly ornate and threatening atmosphere essential to the tale. It is like a gothic cathedral with the most horrific of gargoyles, sturdy and and awe-inspiring yet ferocious and frightening. I admittedly had to look up a few words, and she uses large or antiquated and numinously-infused terms with a finesse usually associated with Cormac McCarthy. Her phrasing and imagery is darkly dazzling as well, with ‘the night-bruised sea,’ a beseeching boy is described as ‘‘a priest at the death of time, evangelizing for a heaven long crumbled into nostalgia,’ or fear as ‘like a second heart beating itself to death against your temples, like love, like something not unlike love.’ Plus, Khaw can write some truly visceral violence. It would be overly gross if it wasn’t so genuinely poetic.‘There is nothing wrong with being a monster.’The story takes a thematic root in The Little Mermaid and all its variations beyond Hans Christian Andersen’s tale. Told from the perspective of a mermaid, we find her mute as a result of her wedding a prince on his ascent to the throne as in the familiar story, yet here the circumstances are much more sinister. The myths around mermaids, we learn, are ‘lies, all of them. Myths to make my captivity more palatable.’ The story opens where the short story had concluded, with the narrator’s children having been born and gruesomely eaten everyone in the kingdom, save for a lonely plague doctor (I absolutely adore the plague doctor and enjoy the representation of they/them pronouns used for them). She is ‘the mother of monsters,’ and as mythologist Marina Warner points out, monsters in myth are often women. Mermaids, Medusa, harpies, the wicked witch, selkies and more. ‘The idea of a female untamed nature which must be leashed or else will wreak havoc closely reflects mythological heroes’ struggles against monsters,’ she writes in Six Myths of Our Time: Little Angels, Little Monsters, Beautiful Beasts, and More, adding ‘The female form provides the solution in which the essence itself is held; she is passio, and acted upon, the male is actio, the mover.’ The narrator (her name is unpronounceable in human tongues, though treasure having yours still attached) muses on this stating ‘it is always interesting to see how often women are described as ravenous when it is the men who, without exception, take without thought of compensation.’ This is our first glimpse at how the framing of stories upholds a narrative that serves to hold down already oppressed people.‘The stories aren’t entirely wrong, but they’re certainly not right.’According to Roland Barthes a myth is ‘a system of communication…it’s a message,’ and drawing from Barthes, semiotician Daniel Chandler writes in his book, Semiotics for Beginners, ‘Their function is to make dominant cultural and historical values; attitudes and beliefs seem entirely “natural”, “normal”, self-evident, timeless, obvious “common-sense” -and thus objective and “true” reflections of “the way things are”.’ So when our odd couple arrives at the village, having witnessed a murder and led there with the promise witnessing a miracle, they note the behavior and speech of the locals—curiously all children—and that ‘the normalcy rankles. It reeks of rehearsal.’ Stories have been weaponized and are the three “Saints” who rule the village actually benevolent Gods as the children believe, or have they mythologized themself into power? And what are their true intentions, and curiously, what connection do they have with the plague doctor and the scars that line their face? ‘No myth can remain terrifying when you’ve seen it broken and beaten, rendered as toothless as an old crone,’ Khaw writes, and when situations become dire, will our unlikely heroes have to draw the monsters from within to find the monsters that beleaguer them?This is a fascinating and unsettling book, with a tension and creeping dread that gives way to unspeakable horrors and brutality. Yet there is a tender heart beating and bleeding along with it. When Khaw bends her prose towards love, it is with ethereal power that casts out all the shadows and savagery of the story. ‘I would follow them into the demise of the universe where every heaven and each hell is shuttered, and there is nothing of us but motings of wan light, and there is no bodily apparatus with which to express affection, no recourse save to glow weakly in worship until at last, such thing are swallowed too by the dark.That I would love them even then.As long as a moiety of conscious thought persists, I will love them.I will love them to the death of days.’In a matter of 100pgs the readers nerves are tested, fried, and brought to life again and again as Khaw’s prose looks up at you from the page with a wryly devilish grin and licks blood from it’s lips. The ending gets a bit muddied (in kind of a fun way though) but I also love how she just rolls with it and the magical explanations at a few points are too fun to overthink anyways. The Salt Grows Heavy is a sharp tale of body horror and myths at their most violent, but also a charming fairy tale that conquers the darkness and amounts to a page-turning success.4.5/5‘This then is the nature of their immorality: a cruel parasitism, worse than the hunger of the hunt and its teeth.’...more",Notes are private!,1,215,1,"May 09, 2023","May 09, 2023","May 09, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61884779-the-salt-grows-heavy

Ceccoli is a favorite artist, always blending the whimsical with vague sadness and a twinge of darkness, and her artwork is a perfect pair with Duffy’s words. The story follows a mystical being, the Tear Thief, who comes out each night to collect the tears of children to power the light of the moon. Invisible except for in the reflection of water, the Tear Thief makes themselves known to one small girl who has lost her puppy to take her tears of grief--the most valuable tears of all. It is a magical tale carried on waves of melancholy that break upon a rather touching and beautiful shoreline at the conclusion. Another favorite of my oldest child from the days when I would read nightly bedtime stories, this book still has a charm and endearing heart.  [image]I enjoy when stories written for children can deal with heavier subjects like grief or loneliness in ways that aren’t frightening or above a child’s head and allows for conversations about how that is a natural part of being a person and feeling all the feelings. I enjoy how this has some cute world building about how different tears have different values, with the tear thief mostly collecting low-powered tantrum tears from children not wanting to take a bath or go to bed. The art is somber and soft, in bold blue tones that really set the vibe for the story. It is signature Ceccoli, though this feels unique for her, seemingly almost like claymation animation. Its very pretty to look at.  [image]The other day I ed The Girl in The Castle Inside the Museum, also gorgeously illustrated by Ceccoli, and I feel this book gets right what that one attempted to do. There is a similar sadness and loneliness but the story has enough structure to hold its weight instead of briefly pass through you. Duffy’s playful prose is also quite charming and imaginative. It is a cute story, long enough to really sink into but short enough to not exhaust you or your child (including a immediate re-read, which my child often requested). Creative and fun, with a good lesson and plenty of heart, The Tear Thief is a lovely read.⅘  [image]...more",Notes are private!,0,88,1,not set,not set,"May 06, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1322594.The_Tear_Thief

The way the world morphs into a surreal version of itself as it is emptied out and those still awake feel as if they are tripping through the dreams of those at home in their beds. Darkness also strikes anxiety in people at taps at the fear of the unknown, as if anything could materialize or strike from the shadows. Nighttime is a perfect expression of possibility. There are few who can capture the feeling of the otherworldliness that exists in the cracks of waking reality better than Haruki Murakami, and he harnesses his skills in the sublimely surreal After Dark as if it were his Ulysses of the night. Following two strangers brought together by chance over the course of a single evening, After Dark becomes an odyssey alive under the neon lights and nearly-empty spaces of Tokyo where the boundaries of reality seem permeable and the impossible might be possible. A sister who can’t sleep and another that can’t wake, a man with no face, dangerous gangs and equally dangerous strangers, and the staff of bars, love hotels and an all-night jazz practice populate these quiet hours as their stories intertwine. Deceptively simple, Murakami’s themes hide under a layer of ambiguity, glimpsed as they occasionally surface here and there throughout the narrative and come together like a collage while evading concrete form like a dream or the mysterious worlds that lurk adjacent to reality in his novels. With his signature charm, American pop-culture references, jazz, dynamic symbolism, and—of course—a cat, After Dark is one of Murakami’s best and confronts ideas of identity in the face of society, loneliness, and the ways we can unexpectedly slip through ‘open secret entries into darkness’ at any moment.‘Between the time the last train leaves and the first train arrives, the place changes: it's not the same as in daytime.’Between the ages of 18 and 21 when you wanted to be out at night with friends but couldn’t yet go to bars, Denny’s was the place to hang. Which sounds horribly sad in retrospect but upon discovering After Dark begins in a Denny’s as the characters pass into the realm of night, I knew I had to read this (also from reading mj’s wonderful ). My friends and I could always be found in the smoking section with hashbrowns and coffee and it indeed felt like a place where time would bend inexplicably (okay, fine, we were often stoned) and random encounters led to fun conversations. Mari Asai, however, is not interested in random conversation, when she meets the loquacious Takahashi at the start of After Dark yet the chance meeting kicks off a chain of events through the lifecycle of the night. Escaping an odd situation at home, Mari is determined to stay out all night and is led through situations, conversations and existential questions that make a single night feel like an epic voyage. Murakami also shows an incredible empathy between strangers when fate binds them together in unlikely situations, There is a pervasive sense of loneliness to many of the characters we meet, and the night has always seemed the best space to feel lonely with the empty streets and darkened windows seeming like the landscape embodying the emotion. Following several threads through the night that repeatedly separate and collide like a Sally Rooney couple, and told in chapters denoting the time between 11:56 p.m. and 6:52 a.m (a good time period to read the book, to tell the truth) what seems like random events add up to something much more. Oh and this is Murakami so of course it has jazz and a specific song that seems integral to the story. Here we have Curtis Fuller’s Five Spot After Dark, a song that inspires Takahashi to become a musician and hints at the five locations Mari visits on her journey under dark: Denny’s, the Alphaville hotel, the bar, the Skylark, and the park. Murakami excels at symbolism and we have many of his repeated ones here, such as the moon. While two moons let us know we were in the “other” world in 1Q84 here we have a brief reference to a crescent moon in the western sky at dawn. That doesn’t happen, and it is likely not an error on Murakami’s part but an expression of his reality-adjacent realms. Colors, too, are key, and I’ll get to that shortly. But also with Murakami we can’t escape the inevitable conversation that he can be…on the misogynist side or at least fairly creepy in his depictions of women. And yes, the phrase ‘perfectly shaped breasts’ is used far too often in this story, yet at the same time it features a lot of strong, independent women, surprisingly passes the Bechdel test with flying colors and Takahashi exists to support Mari’s emotional journey and not the other way around (he’s the manic-jazz dream boy perhaps?). Not that this is a feminist work or anything but as far as Murakami goes it's at least much less problematic than most. ‘The ground we stand on looks solid enough, but if something happens it can drop right out from under you.’Murakami has a gift for examining the ineffable, expressing it less through words but rather pointing our minds through narratives towards those ideas, and After Dark feels one of his most openly examined expressions of his reality-adjacent realms. They always function as multifaceted metaphors in his fiction, where unreality often becomes a better space to understand the “real” and in a way that dissolves the dichotomy between the two. The novel explores themes of duality and interconnectivity, such as night and day, real and otherworldly, and plenty of foil characters, but the theme is best emphasized in the sisters Mari and Eri Asai and their seemingly opposite personalities as well as the fact that Mari is awake all night while Eri has been in a strange state of sleep for over a month. This is a very cinematic novel, narrated in a way that often calls out the motions a camera shot would make to cover the scenes ‘allowing ourselves to become pure point of view’ as observers to everything. This taps into the interconnectedness and duality as the language of observation seamlessly passes into various characters perspectives or from the “real” into the “unreal” as if a metaphor for how Murakami characters move into these realms in his fiction. This is also expressed by Takahashi:‘In other words, I started seeing it like this: that there really was no such thing as a wall separating their world from mine. Or if there was such a wall, it was probably a flimsy one made of papier-mâché. The second I leaned on it, I’d probably fall right through and end up on the other side.’He isn’t speaking directly on the reality-adjacent realms but the lives of other people (though, existentially, isn’t each person a frame of reality unto themselves and so, kind of an alternate reality in a sense?) and how close we are to each other without knowing it. He is also speaking specifically of criminals—his close proximity to one helping inform this—and why observing trials for law school led to this conclusion in a discussion very reminiscent of Tarrou’s epiphany of solidarity against death in The Plague by Albert Camus. In After Dark many of the ideas are threaded across multiple characters or situations (Mari being asked to think of a happy moment with Eri leads to her telling on to Takahashi for instance) and if we are discussing criminals our mind should naturally land on the mysterious gang member who appears throughout the book. Follow me here. I mentioned color is often symbolic in Murakami, right? The gang member who retrieves the battered sex worker and vows to hunt down her assailant is dressed head to toe in black, and his motorcycle is noted as ‘midnight black.’ This only glimpse into the criminal underworld is a walking symbol of the night, or the darkness that Takahashi says perhaps ‘ has already managed to sneak its way inside of us, and we just haven’t noticed.’ And he appears at random throughout the setting of the novel, at the love hotel, beside the assailant’s cab, and as a disembodied voice over a phone left in a 711—the “otherworld,” the “darkness,” whatever you interpret the “other” to be can reach you anywhere at any time. Speaking of color, look at how telling it is in other characters. We had Mari who is dressed mostly in black except for her fading yellow shoes—a symbol of her fading happiness waning under her frustrated relationship with her sister. At the end of the novel she checks to make sure they are still clear, a sign the journey has ended and she has arrived unscathed. But in her final scene it is noted she has white socks and a white tshirt underneath, further symbolizing that the darkness has not penetrated into her. Mari’s eyes are also said to be a ‘lonely hue,’ reflective of her character. Eri, who is referred to both as Sleeping Beauty and Snow White throughout the novel (read: white) is depicted primarily in black and white: her black hair and the constant reference to pale skin and her room is all blacks and whites. She is also traveling between the real and “unreal” of the mysterious broadcast her body is transported into presumably by the faceless man. This feels adjoining to the Alphaville references, which is the name of the love hotel that we learn may be a reference to the black and white Godard film of the same name in which people are not allowed to feel feelings (Takahashi refers to Eri’s pill popping and other struggles as her being trapped in her own sort of Alphaville). Shirakawa, the lonely IT engineer who beats up the sex worker, who in all greys, and exhibiting loneliness and a general lack of emotion also figuratively places him like a character in the black and white Alphaville. We can even notice silver seeming to be the link between “realities,” with the silver pencil of Shirakawa’s company appearing in both and the silver phone being the link to the symbolic character of the night: the gang member. Further note that the cat Mari feeds and cares for in the park is white, symbolic of her caring nature to the Snow White Eri and the sex worker whom she helps, also described as pale skin and black hair, making her a foil character to Eri as they are both victimized. Shirakawa is essentially the foil to Mari then, giving abuse and detachment (especially to his family) in place of empathy. Similar to the way color is indicative to character and personality, Murakami's attention to light is often his way of expressing a feeling about each location of the novel. The type of lighting is often referenced, from the warm neon of dreamier locations to the sterility of florescent lamps in offices, and the lighting is used to set the tone in many ways. Also we see how light is much more significant in spaces where there is not much of it, as if the rarity of light makes it more special and meaningful in the realm of the night.‘Of what value is a civilization that can't toast a piece of bread as ordered?’Social criticism are also highly thematic here. So much plays into the way society churns people up into objects, into marketing data and consumers, and other symbols of dehumanization. Takahashi speaks of an unstoppable symbolic sea monster, like a massive octopus, that is ‘ 'the nation,' and sometimes it's 'the law,' and sometimes it takes on shapes that are more difficult and dangerous than that.’ He says ‘this creature, this thing doesn't give a damn that I'm me or you're you. In its presence, all human beings lose their names and their faces. We all turn into signs, into numbers.’ It all feels a very strong metaphor of capitalism, of the ways we are faceless data points making up a society. He adds:‘What I mean to say is probably something like this: any single human being, no matter what kind of person he or she may be, is all caught up in the tentacles of this animal like a giant octopus, and is getting sucked into the darkness. You can put any kind of spin on it you like, but you end up with the same unbearable spectacle.’Our lives are churned up into a The Society of the Spectacle, but the aquatic metaphor persists elsewhere too. When Eri wakes up in the stranger “otherworld,” her space is described as being like a fishbowl. She is a spectacle due to her beauty, but it is like being a fish in a tank, isolated and on display. This is further emphasized by her appearing within the tv, not unlike a fishbowl. In the realm of night, we all seem small and faceless, like fish in a fishbowl, ‘in the eyes of society at large, that world of mine is a puny little thing,’ and the water metaphor appears throughout the novel.‘In this world, there are things you can only do alone, and things you can only do with somebody else. It's important to combine the two in just the right amount.’Perhaps, however, there is a brighter side to this observation that, in fact, we are all a small part of a larger society. We can either bemoan this and be violent, like Shirakawa, or choose empathy and cooperation, like Mari. We are each ‘a human being with a different face and mind, and at the same time each is a nameless part of the collective entity,’ Murakami muses in the narration, ‘each is simultaneously a self-contained whole and a mere part.’ What is society but a collection of individuals? Within each is a cosmos of dreams, desires, and fears, each putting up our walls that might be more fragile and thinner than we know. With this realization of another duality in the novel, the cycle completes, day breaks, and life returns. 'I am me and not me.'I love the ambiguities in After Dark, and the way it all reads as highly interpretable. Murakami doesn’t often tie up all loose ends and leaves much to us to decide what it means, allowing the messages of the otherworld to resist definite form because, simply, they are not of this reality but only guideposts towards meaning. ‘No one answers our questions,’ he writes, which is true of much of life, ‘our question marks are sucked, unresisting, into the final darkness and uncompromising silence of the night.’ I tend to enjoy this aspect of his books, it lets the story linger in a haze of mystery and multi-faceted meaning with many of the symbols having a duality to them. The novel feels it reaches a resolution (being more an emotional conclusion than anything having completed the narrative discourse on the themes), but the mystery remains at large, something you can almost grasp the more you look at it but can never quite line all points up in a tidy fashion. After Dark nails a lot of sweet spots for me and is easily one of my favorite of his books, and is fairly succinct as far as he goes. The themes are also teased out in many of his other novels, making them sort of variations on a scale across his oeuvre like a jazz record. After Dark examines the dualities and interconnectedness that we feel deep down as an itch of consciousness, and is a heartfelt and lovely voyage through the surrealness of night showing empathy as a life-raft through it all.4.5/5‘The old temporality is losing its effectiveness and moving into the background. Many people go on mumbling the old words, but in the light of the newly revealed sun, the meanings of words are shifting rapidly and are being renewed.

I’ve always felt a special affinity for garbage truck drivers, often out before society has even begun to rub the sleep from its eyes and laboring away through the waste and discarded fragments of lives. Naturally I was drawn to Bariloche from Andrés Neuman, a novella following the life of garbage collector in Buenos Aires as he works and reflects on the juxtaposition of past and present in his life. ‘The literature of the twenty-first century will belong to Neuman and a few of his blood brothers,’ the late, great Roberto Bolaño said of Andrés Neuman when, as part of the committee, he selected this very book, Bariloche, to be a finalist of the Herralde Prize. Which is about as good a recommendation as any. This short debut put Neuman on the literary map, and deservingly so as it is poetically impressive to the point of feeling like an immersive experience while grappling with feelings of loneliness, guilt and disconnect as our lives take us far from home.‘Demetrio’s transformations: first a sleepwalker, then his trademark indifference, then a reaction calibrated to the morning itself, and then that desperate loquaciousness, an urgency in how he got in and out of the truck or shouted through the window.’‘Nothing in this novel sounds contrived: everything is real, everything is an illusion,’ Bolaño wrote about Bariloche. It is easy to see what he loved about this novella, championing a working class hero across muddied moral choices delivered in language so piercingly beautiful and unique. ‘In it,’ he adds, ‘good readers will find something that can be found only in great literature, the kind written by real poets, a literature that dares to venture into the dark with open eyes and that keeps its eyes open no matter what.’ Neuman uses the malleability of words to transform them into something often surprising, as if the whole toolbelt of language wasn’t enough and he must enlarge the lexicon across the cosmos. His descriptions are fantastic, pushing towards nonsensical yet visceral and vibrant with phrases like ‘anarchic sun,’ ‘drowsiness smeared the pavement,’ a truck undergoing maintenance is said to be disemboweled, and the blinds on his apartment widow is described as ‘, a giant’s heavy lids, revealed a clotted sky.’ The language is gorgeously translated to English by poet Robin Myers and the prose is practically poetry in its own right, showing how often it doesn't much matter what is said but how it is said that make a story great. While this is his fourth to be translated into English, it was his first book, written when he was only 19 making it all the more impressive.‘I filled my room with furtive cigarettes and puzzles.’ Named after the real city in Argentina where the focal character, Demetrio, grew up, the novel has him reflecting on the final summers of his youth, living and loving in the warm and sunny countryside. This is juxtaposed with his life in the city, which feels drab and depressing by contrast. His days are spent in the garbage truck with El Negro, a man who suspects his wife is having an affair and Demetrio must carefully talk around the situation with secret information about who may be sleeping with her. The two pass their days plainly, with their lunch break the only highlight (the episodic nature of the book has them occasionally bring people with them, or attend the funeral of the only other person they see at the restaurant). After work El Negro must go to his second job while Demetrio passes the evening in solitaire putting together a puzzle. But not just any puzzle, they must always be the sunny landscapes of Bariloche.A bolt of lightning cracked across his timeline.’His past comes to us in pieces—like the puzzles he builds—one tiny fragment at a time across the 66 vignettes that serve as chapters. While this is a story that on the surface doesn’t seem much beyond Demetrio interacting with the world and reflections on his life, there are many surprises in store so it is best to read without much knowledge of the plot. An intractable longing for halcyon days and a sense of guilt hang heavy over the sparse story, guilt over his father, guilt over the crushing weight of labor, guilt over his choices. In the past we find beauty and freshness, a first love, a first kiss and he find ‘my whole life has been sort of begging for scraps of that feeling ever since.’ Through Demetrio, we too search our pasts and question what high of our former selves we are still chasing after.‘Demetrio savored the weekend in advance and imagined a kind of contentment only possible on friday afternoon, when leisure is still an unbroken promise.’There is also quite the commentary on the workforce and the dichotomy between rural and city life. The juxtaposition doesn’t put them as opposites, per say, but more disparate ideas that are inevitably intertwined. In the epigraph he quotes John Berger ‘It is thus that the fatigued survive’ from an essay which discusses how labor exhaust the worker to the point where they do not see the ways they are oppressed and if they do, are too drained and cornered to do anything about it. Berger argues we are seduced into work ‘because it is productive [and] produces in man a productive hope’ which gets us by without ever hoping for something greater. We see that reflected in the novel, with Demetrio caught in the slow sadness, or El Negro working two jobs just to survive.‘But rising above all these tiny comforts sounded a final voice, dull and deep, imposing itself, dictating disgust: disgust for himself and the premature night, for yet another Sunday, for feeling such base indifference at the thought of the next morning and El Negro.’A brief, yet haunting little book, Bariloche announced Neuman’s early promise of literary greatness. It carries itself on the back of exquisite prose, slowly putting together the story of a life estranged from home and nearly washed away by work and is such a gorgeous gem I will certainly be back for more of Neuman’s lovely words.⅘...more",Notes are private!,0,111,1,"May 04, 2023","May 04, 2023","May 04, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/63057318-bariloche

The Girl in the Castle Inside the Museum. Brings together the fairy tale sensibilities of Kate Bernheimer and the mesmerizing artwork of Nicoletta Ceccoli, a rather perfect pairing for a somber yet haunting picture book. Ceccoli’s art always blends a sad innocence with a vaguely dark and threatening aura, and it really shines here with the muted colors and MC Escher-esque architecture, but while this tale is told in hushed tones of loneliness and wonderment it comes off as a bit slight. Not that it ever bothered my oldest when they were a young child, as this was a staple at bedtime for awhile. But I mean, look at this lovely art:  [image]As much as my oldest loved it, my youngest seems fairly uninterested though I’ve quite enjoyed rediscovering this quirky and soft book. If you’ve guessed it is about a girl that lives in a castle inside a museum, pat yourself on the back—you are correct! The girl loves all the children looking into her beautiful world, but when they leave for the night she is quite sad and lonely.  [image]The story discusses her dreaming children to play with her, following her into her magical, miniature world in which she seems to be trapped. There isn’t much to go on here, but the writing is rather lovely and poetic. There is a page that has an empty picture frame in the girl’s room and invites you to attach a picture of your child so they can keep her company in the magical world. My oldest LOVED this part and it was adorable to find the photo in there after all these years. So overall, a bit of a light tale, but it hits some great notes. This is one of those picture books that feels more written for the adult reading it than the child hearing it, and while more would have been nice it does still register almost like a poem. Though the balance seems better in The Tear Thief which pairs Ceccoli’s art with the words of poet Carol Ann Duffy. The problem with being a rather weightless tale is sometimes there isn’t enough to ground it, but the art makes it all worth it and it’s a lovely bedtime story for kids who can handle something rather somber.

Myths and stories of ghosts and fairies often arose out of strange happenings science would later explain away, and while often we discover it wasn’t witches that killed the crops or poisoned the town we also sometimes find that nature can be just as frightening as the scapegoated specters. T. Kingfisher’s What Moves the Dead, a fresh and frightening retelling of Edgar Allan Poe’s The Fall of the House of Usher, transforms the gothic horror and decrepit mansion into a tale of ecological and body horror told with a detective narrative flair. The short novel thrives on its gloomy atmosphere and dynamic characters as Kingfisher expands upon the original story with larger context and explanations that enhance the tale without feeling overly revisionist or stuffing a space that didn’t need to be filled. The characters are given more agency and background, such as hailing from a fictional war-torn country where the linguistic features of their language adds an interesting element to understanding the story. Told through an addicting blend of horror and humor, What Moves the Dead is a thrilling gothic mystery running on an engine of amalgamating dread and oppressive atmosphere that shows how sometimes the answer is simply a doorway into new fears.‘This dreadful house. I think I would rather face a line of rifles, even now. At least that’s a human enemy.’To approach a classic from a fresh angle is no small task but What Moves the Dead manages the endeavor without many missteps into gimmickry. Wisely opting away from merely recreating Poe’s language, Kingfisher applies her own sense of voice that is adorned with enough linguistic flourishes from the original tale to read like a respectful tribute in the spirit of Fall of the House of Usher while still being its own thing. As she notes in the afterword, Poe frequently addresses fungi in the original, which becomes the springboard for this version. Kingfisher’s retelling delights through maintaining an oppressive and gothic atmosphere in keeping with the original, delivering the reader into the stuffy halls of Usher’s crumbling mansion and the grimy landscapes around the tarn, populated by putrid smelling mushrooms and hares that the townsfolk believe could be witches. ‘If we ran, then the small child that lives in every soldier’s heart knew that the monsters could get us. So we did not run, but it was a near thing.’The story is altogether frightening, taking on elements of ecological horror as well as body horror. ‘The dead don’t walk,’ becomes a sort of refrain throughout the story, beginning like a mantra to focus on and remain rational before reading more like a spell to ward off the approaching doom. The use of movement (such as the way a face contorts into a disturbing smile) to trigger chills down the reader’s spine is well executed and grants a very visual quality to the short novel, making you feel like another anxious guest along for the ride. There are frequent depictions of the hare’s movement, which gives the impression of a ‘disembodied hand walking along on its fingers, or of living limbs separated from their owners’ among other unsettling behaviors that are also paralleled in Madeline’s nocturnal stumblings and keep the reader feeling like the terror could be lurking all around them. Kingfisher excels at writing motion and creating visual atmospheres, and those talents serve the story well. The house, which is said to ‘breathe nightmares’ is also very strikingly depictedKingfisher’s characters are the real success of the story, however, and given much more agency and personality than in Poe’s original. The narrator, Lieutenant Alex Easton, tells the tale with a lot of sarcasm and humor. Easton’s disdain for American’s, with lines like ‘sometimes it’s hard to know if someone is insulting or just an American,’ works well as a laugh line in tense moments and adds a charming dynamic to the interplay with the American doctor, James Denton, who becomes a rather endearing John Watson-esque side-kick through the story. Add to this the haunting figures of the Usher siblings and a fictional aunt to Beatrix Potter who is herself an illustrator when not performing as an amateur mycologist.‘It's like telling stories at the bar about the worst pain you've ever been in. You laugh andyou brag about it, and it turns the pain into something that will buy you a drink.’The blend of horror and humor keeps the novel moving and feeling like a big horror blockbuster film that becomes an event of thrills beyond merely chills. Laugh lines punctuate the darkest moments, adding a sort of gallows humor that coaxes you into the terror without detracting from it, like nervously stepping through one of those haunted house venues that appear every October.‘There were three veterans at that table, battle-scarred soldiers who had served their countries honorably in more than one war... and all three of us screamed like small children and recoiled in horror.’Reading this book reminded me of being in a theater where everyone shrieks at the appropriate moments and then a trickle of laughter ripples through the audience. Its fun, its infectious, and it keeps you wanting more. Kingfisher does well by keeping this novel short and succinct, with just enough character, exposition and action to not feel sold short.I truly enjoy how language plays a key role in the novel, particularly the Usher’s and narrator’s native language in the fictional country Gallacia where they have 7 sets of pronouns. There is one for God, one for inanimate objects, and gender neutral pronouns like ka/kan or, to denote a child va/van is used. The narrator uses the appropriate pronouns in the text, and the enhanced dexterity of pronouns gives added insight into several key aspects of the story, particularly the ending. It all reads very natural, you’ll hardly notice it after a few pages and it isn’t used that frequently, which I suspect is a subtle dig at recent claims they/them pronouns are confusing despite having always been common usage. Easton is non-binary, using ka/kan pronouns and several times mentions binding kans breasts, and I enjoyed the examination on how in Gallacia all soldiers use the genderless pronouns as a mark of honor and camaraderie where gender roles really have no meaning on a battlefield. ‘This is no place for a delicate lady. I tell you, it’s haunted…’There is special attention to the ways mysterious happenings are explained away into legends and lore of ghosts or witchcraft. While crossing the Mediterranean, Easton was once told the myth that ‘the dead carry lanterns down in the deep’ to explain what another passenger says is likely just bioluminescent plankton. This sort of interplay between ghostly speculation and science is at the heart of the novel and the detective narrative of the novel, much in keeping with Poe’s ‘tales of ratiocination’. In Poe’s classic there is much emphasis on Roderick’s nervous state, something that all the guests at the mansion begin to succumb to themselves and Easton steps through many rational theories, such as the shell-shock they all likely retain, but the reasoning never quite satisfies and the mystery looms large over the novel adding to the eerie tone and granting a mystery narrative quality that pushes you forward to uncover the truth. Is there one thing connecting the hares, Madeline’s illness, Roderick’s nerves, the maid’s suicide, the nightmares and more? Is it a haunting, or is it something that, while more tangible, is also more terrible?What Moves the Dead is a fun romp of a horror novella that manages to become something greater than a mere retelling of Poe or the conglomeration of its horror tropes. The rather exciting climax is admitted a bit over the top, though it fits the tone and tale and the chilling aspects of it that feel earned through Kingfisher slowly and effectively putting the pieces together allow it to land. It truly does expand upon the original in a way that works, and I particularly enjoy how it places the story in a larger social context. There is an excellent thread of social criticisms on the subjugation of women, such as frequent remarks about Madeline’s condition being brushed away with the misogynistic diagnosis of hysteria or old Ms Potter being denied a seat in Royal Mycology Society for being a woman, which is successfully juxtaposed with Easton and the way the Gallacian society is more progressive even just through the way it is encoded in the language. There are some wonderful frights and the eco-horror will have you eyeing mushrooms and hares differently on your next nature walk (also, if you dare, check out the instances of “zombie fungus spiders” that I couldn’t stop thinking about while reading this book). Frightening and frightfully fun, What Moves the Dead is a hit.4/5‘The dead may walk, but I will not walk among them.’...more",Notes are private!,1,24,2,"Nov 02, 2022not set","Nov 02, 2022not set","May 03, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58724626-what-moves-the-dead

This is Aiden’s daily hell, finding no peace once heGrowing up is hard enough without being the punching bag for all the teenage boys in your school. This is Aiden’s daily hell, finding no peace once he has been labeled the gay kid by his classmates and being bullied for being Filipino as well as weight-shamed. Flamer, the debut graphic novel by Mike Curato, is based on his own frustrating experiences in high school and while it is often a brutal story dealing with bullying and the mental health struggles resulting from it, this is also an uplifting reminder that ‘even if all of them were to forsake you, you are enough.’ As frustrating as the bullying is in the novel is the fact that Flamer has once again been one of the most banned or challenged books of the year, being the 4th most challenged in 2022 (see the full list here). Which is a shame (well, and an attack on intellectual freedoms) as this story gives readers a valuable lesson about self acceptance and endurance that doesn’t sugarcoat reality while still offering a lot of hope and heart.  [image]The use of fire in the artwork is wonderfulThis is a story that really hits hard and strikes deep into your heart. While personally it isn’t my favorite art style, I really love the contrast of the black and white with the bright orange and reds of fire that permeate this story. Fire, and the term ‘flamer’, takes on a multitude of meanings, from insults thrown at him, to the idea of damnation. The language in this book is quite rough and very accurately reflects the slurs and abuse of teenage boys from even when I was in high school a decade after this book is set, and conversations on not using language like that wasn’t really mainstream yet. Teachers would ignore slurs against queer students, the word gay was tossed around blithely to mean anything you didn’t like, it was certainly a rough time to be dealing with secret concerns about being bisexual let me tell you. What really struck me was the aspect of Aiden’s internalized guilt as he struggles with acceptance and his Catholicism having taught him that being gay was a sin: ‘I know I'm not gay. Gay boys like other boys. I HATE boys. They are mean and scary, and they're always destroying something or saying something dumb or both. We learned at school how bad homosexuality is. It's a sin. Gay people do bad things. And I'm not a bad person. I try to do good. All the time. So I couldn't be gay.’Having been raised Catholic, this hit home. I’ll never forget watching Star Wars Episode II in theaters and having it very much dawn on me that I wasn’t fully straight every time Obi-Wan came on screen and also the absolute horror of this revelation due to what I’ve been told that meant. Because I sure didn’t feel like a demon. And in that culture it is difficult to know who to even talk to, because it still is an issue that people see as a hard-line. I’ve seen friends lose best friends or their own families from simply coming out. This is a great book for those who need that comfort.Which is why it is appalling this is being banned all over the US, and that is part of a much larger conversation the stories of queer folks and people of color being erased and strategically removing language that allows people to understand and express their identities. It is a constant headline in the US right now, with challenges on the rise, with 2022 being a significant increase:  [image]This comes amongst growing concern over the harrassment against library staff and bomb threats against libraries, and groups openly promoting the use of violence against libraries and schools to achieve their goals. Which on the surface is removing books, but also a deeper impulse of eroding public institutions and harnessing government to override people’s intellectual freedoms and librarianship. Flamer is a frequent target of this due to LGBTQ content, which is frustrating as, in a conversation with PEN America, Mike Curato says that the aim of this book is suicide prevention. He adds: ‘This is a book about telling someone that regardless of how someone may disagree with who you are as a person, you still deserve to be here. There is a place for you, and no one has the right to take that away.’For this purpose, the book includes information on suicide prevention and offers many resources and hotlines. Curato says that a big issue with book challenges and bans of books such as his own is that it perpetuates the culture of shame that this book grapples against. ‘these are experiences that most teenagers go through. Some parents would prefer their children read about uncomfortable topics in a book because it’s a very safe place to learn. They can digest it at their own pace. They can put the book down if they want to. And then I think there are some parents that would rather just uphold a taboo and not talk about anything. And all that does is just perpetuate this cycle of shame.’This is a wonderful book with a lot of hope. Flamer deals with a lot of hard topics, but many will see themselves in it and find comfort there. It is pretty fun, for all the heaviness and bullying, taking place mostly during a boy scouts summer camp and a long summer of self discovery, acceptance and more. A worthwhile read.4.5/5  [image]...more",Notes are private!,0,108,1,not set,not set,"May 02, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/52751434-flamer

Set directly after All Systems Red, we find Murderbot struggling with finding a purpose and having some unanswered questions about their past which launches a new chapter of [cue dramatic action music] mayhem and murderin’! Okay, more like protecting, and begrudgingly so, because for as brutal of an asskicking Murderbot can deliver they mostly just want to ‘sink into my media downloads for a while and pretend I didn't exist.’ With a new set of characters, and a research AI named ART (dubbed the Asshole Research Transport by MBot) that I absolutely adore, Artificial Condition is a smart, savvy sci-fi good time that expands Wells’ imaginative world and raises the stakes even higher. It is a blast.‘I didn’t care what humans were doing to each other as long as I didn’t have to a) stop it or b) clean up after it.’What is so immediately endearing about this series is the way Wells uses a rogue robot to explore what it means to be human. In this second “episode” being human means looking the part as much as acting, and Murderbot does some rather insightful thinking about how our feelings and thoughts are reflected in our movements. Also how they look, which they’ll have to alter—much to their horror. The lines between AI robot and human blur even more in this book with the steps Murderbot takes causing some anxiety and existential ponderings because they make it ‘harder for me to pretend I was not a person.’ Which is a great moment that flips most freewill-AI sci fi stories on their head as MB finds being a person and having to talk about feelings and do all that people-y stuff to be…well, horrifying. There is also a great moment about representation, with Murderbot acknowledging they prefer more unrealistic media shows but also noticing how poorly security units come across in all these shows. ‘You can't tell a story from the point of view of something that you don't think has a point of view,’ they consider. However, ART and Murderbot watching shows together with Mbot annoyed as hell at ART and ART having…well, AI existential breakdowns when the shows get sad—THIS is the sort of thing that I’ll keep coming back for. As Murderbot says ‘They made us smarter. The anxiety and depression were side effects.’ The student told you are “gifted” to being burned out, depressed and directionless pipeline is real, I’ve lived it, and my oh my does this series nudge those feelings. These robots grappling with feelings as well as struggling with realizing they feel feelings is brilliantly delivered and moving. Just a completely empathetic book series and I don’t just mean empathizing with being annoyed you have to stop watching your show and do work.‘the inside of my head had been my own for +33,000 hours and I was used to it now. I wanted to keep me the way I was.’Trust and fear become a major theme in this episode. Murderbot has freedom, but what does that even mean? And how does one accept independence when following orders was all you knew? When Murderbot is ‘97 percent certain this meeting was a trap,’ should they dispute clients or follow along and protect? In examining what it means to be human, logic often gives way. Is it fear, bravery, stupidity? Ultimately we ask what makes humans…well, human.Murderbot can seriously kick ass and so does this series. I’m interested to see how the side plot of discovering their past is going to continue to play out and I loved how much of this book was about respecting and giving agency to the sex bots. I’m fully on board at this point, can we get Murderbot t-shirts? Also thanks to Nataliya and her amazing s, I’ve decided to listen to these on audio and she is correct: Kevin R.

It was a prompt she used that once turned an unruly classroom towards sharp focus and clarity she tells us in her introduction, a question that often brings about surprising answers with a vastness of variety it could fill the cosmos with all the absence we feel in our lives. What Have You Lost? is a lovely anthology that is as heartfelt as it is often heartbreaking, one I find myself taking down from the shelf quite often across the years I’ve owned it. I’m someone that bruises a bit from change, and while I’m always willing and accepting of it, quietly I feel it like a stormy sea tossing me about on existential waves as I try to recenter myself on the map and get my compass bearings straight. ‘Always is nice / to have, but it doesn’t / last long,’ writes poet Peter Heitkamp, and this is something I’ve felt deeply in life. Friends you knew intimately suddenly feel like a pleasant encounter at a train station far behind you, entire interpersonal work-cultures go from the top of your text messages to faded memories you aren’t sure where to put on your shelves once you are a job or two down the line, the funerals start stacking up, the places where you lived and loved are now only glimpsed in rare drive-bys with another person’s memories-in-the-making going on inside the windows, clothes you wore, tv shows you waited all week for the new episode, the person you were, even your own youth is eventually something now lost to the present. This collection brings some great poets such as the editor, Naomi Shihab Nye herself, together and includes some familiar names like Lucille Clifton, June Jordan, Nicanor Parra, Linda Gregg, Rolf Jacobson, and even Holland, Michigan’s (where I live) hometown hero Jack Ridl who just had a reading at my library last week. These poets are joined by many who were new to me and come from all over the world to look at the variety of ways we have lost something and, though gone from us, leaves a lasting (or even fleeting) mark upon our lives.here yet be dragons--Lucille Cliftonso many languages have fallenoff of the edge of the worldinto the dragon’s mouth. somewhere there be monsters whose teethare sharp and sparkle with lostpeople. lost poems. whoamong us can imagine ourselvesunimagined? Whoamong us can speak with so fragiletongue and remain proud?‘The art of losing isn’t hard to master,’ wrote Elizabeth Bishop, though to this Naomi Shihab Nye adds that even so ‘we don’t necessarily find losing any easier to heal from or to comprehend.’ Because of that, this collection is a balm on our weary souls—or sometimes a finger poking the bruise—as we move through coping with loss. Because it comes in so many different varieties. Here we have poems that deal with loss of love, family like parents or children, poems of divorce, but also more abstract concepts like loss of culture, home, homelands or even language (as addressed in the above Clifton poem). Pat Mora discusses how we lose the childhood of our own children and they become teenages: ‘One day they disappear / into their rooms. / Doors and lips shut / and we become strangers / in our own home.’ Or there is Richard Beban tragically reflecting on ‘the day she stopped being / grandma and turned into / that madwoman.’ Though not all issues of loss here are painful or negative, such as Joy Harjo talking about losing one’s fears in I Give You Back:I release you, my beautiful and terriblefear. I release you. You were my belovedand hated twin, but now, I don't know youas myself. I release you with all thepain I would know at the death ofmy children.You are not my blood anymore.Sometimes we lose our old self but find new beginnings, ‘lost again, // where the world begins,’ as John Brandi writes in Wilderness Poem. Which is what makes this such a well-rounded anthology because for all the pain and sorrow, there is still hope and joy.‘You’re free of something you didn’t knowhad a hold of you, like a ghostyou’ve lived with and just found, the haunting over.’--Robert FungeWhen it comes to loss, I always feel literature and especially poetry is a perfect medium for addressing it. Music too. We are able to capture something now gone in words, something we can still find tangible in its abstractness within us. As Jay Bremeyer writes ‘Climb into / this story. / Be remembered!’ This reminds me of that Bright Eyes lyric about putting a painful breakup into ‘a song tied to a melody / and keep you there so you can’t bother me.’ Words are powerful, and the right arrangement of words won’t fill the void but, like the brightest of spotlights, helps you see the chasm, get a sense of the walls and depth, and make it less of a dark place. Thanks poetry, and thank you Naomi Shihab Nye for such a lovely anthology. I love how much heart went into this, especially the little bios of each poet that are so full of love, jokes, and goodwill towards each. This is a healing collection, I would heartily recommend it to everyone.⅘Oh and of course I need to show you all some Jack Ridl.

To tell the truth, I can’t help but imagine Sartre’s lectures as how he was satirically portrayed in Mood Indigo (Michel Gondry’s film adaptation of Boris Vian’s Froth on the Daydream):  [image]Jean-Sol Partre, as he is named in the film, delivers his lecture above adoring fans standing in a smoker’s pipe that moves about the room, everyone hollering like are attending a rock concert as another character scrambles to take notes yelling that the lecture is difficult but worthwhile. I regret to inform you this book is not quite that level of uproarious excitement, but it is still a fascinating and highly intelligent analysis of a rather freeing and optimistic philosophy. ‘[N]o doctrine is more optimistic, since it declares that man’s destiny lies within himself.’ See? If you are looking for great introductory texts to French Existentialism, put this in your pipe and smoke it because it is an apt selection (Simone de Beauvoir’s What is Existentialism? as well). And get your pens ready to underline because I left nary a page unmarked as Sartre has such noteworthy, snappy phrasing (though neurobiologist Steven Rose would argue that Sartre’s writing was ‘more an exercise in political sloganeering than a sustainable philosophical position,’ in his book Lifelines: Biology, Freedom, Determinism) and the book is delivered in a rather welcoming and accessible approach (other than when he’s kind of a pompous ass, but in a cool way?). Unpopular book aesthetic opinion but, yes, I underline books and I write in the margins. I also dog ear them. I can hear some of you shrieking but, personally, I like the practice for when I need some quotes to write (like now) and I think it makes books look all edgy and kind of punk. It’s like you are getting your books tattooed. They’re taking a deep drag off a cigarette and saying in a throaty voice “yea I look rough but it’s because I’ve been loved--love hurts but it makes it all worthwhile.” and you are like woah reign it in a little bit, my friend, but I follow ya I think. Sartre would say you’re actions towards love are what you want to see in all humans and the meaning you have ascribed to life, so already we’ve learned a lesson from this book. Good work us, lets see what other treasure troves of knowledge we can discover! [insert bass-heavy show theme and a cartoon dog saying “Brought to you by PBS!”]‘Man is not only that which he conceives himself to be, but that which he wills himself to be, and since he conceives of himself only after he exists, just as he wills himself to be after being thrown into existence, man is nothing other than what he makes of himself.’You didn’t just scroll by that quote did you? Go back, read it again like it’s the first time. Pretty great stuff, and according to Sartre ‘that is the first principle of existentialism.’ We are learning up a storm in here. So what Sartre really wants to impress upon us is that people define meaning for themselves through their actions, which they are fully responsible for, and that through our action we also define the world. This is the idea that ‘existence precedes essence,’ which means that ‘man first exists’ by coming into the world, encountering themself and then thusly defining themself. To help illustrate, Sartre proposes we imagine a paper knife. Cool man, not a dated reference at all (think “letter opener” if you are struggling). He says that when it is built, it is made around with preconceived ideas of how it will be used, or that ‘production precedes essence.’ Humans, he argues, are the opposite. We ‘exist first,’ that we start fresh and blank and define ourselves through actions. Existentialists reject the idea of people being like a paper knife with god as ‘the artisan’, and following Friedrich Nietzsche stating that ‘god is dead,’ we have to consider the idea of an absence of god. Sartre splits existentialists up between two group, Christian existentialists (he cites Karl Jaspers and Gabriel Marcel) and atheist existentialsts, which he says includes Martin Heidegger and himself.We need to pause a moment because it’s important to note that Heidegger was not into Sartre writing this and did not want to be labeled an existentialist under Sartre’s definition of one. You may have heard about Camus refusing the categorization for his own varied reasons, but Heidegger often not being considered was actually news to me. He didn’t mind Sartre referring to him as an atheist, but rejected the label of existentialist under Sartre’s depiction of it. While both philosophers addressed the concept of Being, a very basic difference is how Heidegger questioned the meaning of Being, whereas Sartre examined different ways of Being in the world. There are many other differences, such as Heidegger argued life exists in a wholeness because of death, which allows for meaning, while Sartre thought this put too much emphasis on death and saw it instead as the endpoint to our ability to give meaning into our lives. About this book, Heidegger said he thinks Sartre ‘stays with metaphysics in oblivion of the truth of Being’ Anyways, where were we? Oh yes, atheist existentialists:‘Atheistic existentialism, of which I am a representative, declares with greater consistency that if God does not exist there is at least one being whose existence comes before its essence, a being which exists before it can be defined by any conception of it. .... He will not be anything until later, and then he will be what he makes of himself…If God does not exist, are we provided with any values or commands that could legitimize our behavior.’ Sartre discusses how existentialism removes any universal code that applies a definite meaning and in its place ‘Man is nothing else but that which he makes of himself.’ We exist ‘only to the extent that he realizes himself, therefore he is nothing more than the sum of his actions, nothing more than his life.’ We are what we do, what we become, and there is no external force or invisible eternal being dictating this in Sartre’s eyes. But this isn’t strictly a dismissal of the possibility of god but merely that ‘if God were to exist, it would make no difference,’ and belief in a god or not is irrelevant when the issue is that people must discover themselves and nobody can save them but themselves. So where Jean-Paul would tell us that we are defined by actions, Jean-Luc would tell us to “make it so.”‘It is a doctrine of action,and it is only in bad faith—in confusing their own despair with ours—that Christians are able to assert that we are “without hope.”’Sartre dispels the common criticisms levied at existentialism as a pessimistic philosophy, arguing that it is the critics who are the true pessimists. He argues that claims existentialism discourages people from actions and only focuses on the darker parts of life is intentionally misunderstanding that ‘only hope resides’ in the actions of an existentialist as it is action creating all meaning. He also refutes that the philosophy rejects responsibility for humanity, saying existentialism is a commitment that each person is ‘responsible for myself and for everyone else,’ that in ‘choosing myself, I choose man’ because when we choose our actions we choose what believe good and believe that reflects what is good for humanity. I see what he’s getting at here, and it’s not my favorite of his points. This will later be important in his discussion on choosing actions that support freedom and freedom for everyone, which I believe Beauvoir does a much better and more detailed discourse on in The Ethics of Ambiguity. More on this in a bit.‘We seek to base our doctrine on truth, not on comforting theories full of hope but without any real foundation.’Still with me? Still learning? Because now we get some key terms! Sartre launches into a discussion on three terms and his definitions for them: anguish, abandonment, and despair. I know, I told you this was an optimistic philosophy but hold on, let’s see what he means by them.Here is his definition for anguish: ‘a man who commits himself, and who realizes that he is not only the individual that he chooses to be, but also a legislator choosing at the same time what humanity as a whole should be, cannot help but be aware of his own full and profound responsibility’We were basically just talking about this, but now with the emphasis on responsibility that what we choose as our actions should be what we believe would be what everyone should also be choosing. He briefly discusses the issue of actions such as Abraham in the Bible via Søren Kierkegaard’s Fear and Trembling and that just because Abraham heard a voice, it was his responsibility because he chose to listen when that voice could have also been a demon or hallucination. We have to own up to our actions, basically, and all actions are our interpretations of symbols and events, but ultimately our choice.Next is abandonment which Sartre explains ‘we merely mean to say that God does not exist, and that we must bear the full consequences of that assertion,’ and that it is ‘we, ourselves, who decide who we are to be.’ Basically everything we’ve been discussing. He cites Fyodor Dostoevsky’s famous line from the The Brothers Karamazov ‘if God is dead, everything is permitted,’ and calls it a starting point of philosophy, though personally I much prefer Beauvoir’s arguments against this asserting life is not a nihilistic free-for-all and existentialism can, in fact, provide an ethic for positive and productive living. Finally we reach despair. Don’t get too excited. Despair means we have to reckon with only what depends on our will. ‘When Descartes said ‘Conquer yourself rather than the world’, what he meant was, at bottom, the same – that we should act without hope.’ Which sounds bleak but basically he’s saying we cant rely on anything outside our control but that this shouldn’t cause us to abandon action because there is no reality except in action. ‘Life is nothing until it is lived.’One of my favorite discussions in this book, however, is his metaphor of a person like a painting, or ‘that moral choice is like constructing a work of art.’ We can’t judge a painting before it has begun or even before it is finished, we don’t know what it is yet to be, and the act of painting is like our actions that define us. ‘We are in the same creative situation.’ he says. ‘What are and morality have in common is creation and invention’ I also enjoy his assertions on how we are ‘obliged to will the freedom of others at the same time as I will my own. I cannot set my own freedom as a goal without also setting the freedom of others as a goal.’ Those who do not will the freedom of others are acting in bad faith (this comes up a lot, and he argues we can judge people who act in bad faith). Though, as I said earlier, this is better addressed in The Ethics of Ambiguity and I would encourage any of you to read that.But finally we reach why he believes existentialism is a humanism, a ‘existential humanism.’ Here’s what he means by that:‘This is humanism because we remind man that there is no legislator other than himself and that he must, in his abandoned state, make his own choices, and also because we show that it is not by turning inward, but by constantly seeking a goal outside of himself in the form of liberation, or of some special achievement, that man will realize himself as truly human.He argues this is different than a definition that all humankind is inherently valuable, and that this is cultish and that because ‘man is constantly in the making,’ there is no defined ‘humankind.’ His definition is that people act towards goals and values outside themselves in order to make something meaningful out of their existence in relation to the world. He calls this humanism because ‘the only universe that exists is…the universe of human subjectivity.’This is an interesting book and a really nice primer for both Sartre’s philosophies and existentialism itself, though I would encourage anyone to also read more than just this as each philosopher had different opinions and often disagreed with each other (there is a great Q&A session in this book that offers some discussions and Sartre getting flustered). I like a lot of what he says, I wish he didn’t gender everything as man, but it was the times and translator, thats what it is. I also quite enjoyed his essay on Albert Camus’ The Stranger, which he says is a great representation of the absurd and is a comical book, as well as compares the writing style to Ernest Hemingway. This is a nice volume with a lot of big ideas to grapple with, though it is a rather accessible introductory book and will make for a nice cozy evening of existentialism. Because it’s about to be Hot Existentialist Summer, you’ve been warned. ⅘‘This is what I mean when I say that man is condemned to be free: condemned, because he did not create himself, yet nonetheless free, because once cast into the world, he is responsible for everything that he does.’...more",Notes are private!,0,186,1,"Apr 28, 2023","Apr 28, 2023","Apr 28, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/51985.Existentialism_is_a_Humanism

Volume 2 picks up mere days after the first with the crew heading into greater and greater dangers with each twist and turn of the plot. This volume feels rather expansive, bringing in more players to this complex political plot of disrupting empires and rescuing princesses. But do the princesses want to be rescued?

Bess and Cass have been fighting in the ring for years, but now Kate has bigger plans and believes the cosmoknights are merely pawns in a game of resources that always manages to stay in the wealthy families and wants to tear them down and expose the games for being a sham. But has anyone ever asked the princesses what they want, and could they do more by resisting from on the throne? It’s a delightfully tangled web with a lot of strong opinions and hard feelings. But there are so many other wonderful moments, from space battles, lots of flashbacks to childhoods, Pan getting bluntly hit on and being oblivious to the whole thing and even a good old fashion bar brawl. This is all brought to life in gorgeous artwork with bright bold colors that portrays the galaxy in diverse aesthetics. What Templer seems best at, however, is noir vibes and I LOVE that.

If you are Murderbot, you’d do a half-ass job at work in order to get back to watching your tv series, and, okay fair, that is a great choice. Welcome to All Systems Red by Martha Wells, a snarky good time of sci fi mystery and action when an expedition team discovers someone is trying to kill off any competition on the planet. But luckily they have Murderbot to protect th--‘in their corner all they had was Murderbot, who just wanted everyone to shut up and leave it alone so it could watch the entertainment feed all day’--erm, okay yea but at least Murderbot will mostly help and do it while being ‘indifferent and vaguely annoyed.’ With which I can TOTALLY EMPATHIZE (sorry to anyone who has ever needed a library card while I was reading a book…I mean, doing important work on my computer). This book also has a fascinating look at emotions and interpersonal interactions, and while an AI feeling emotions and people wondering if they deserve human rights or not may not be a fresh idea, but Wells explores them in interesting and unique ways that does. All Systems Red is a blast, being way more fun and thought provoking than you’d expect from its tiny length and as gripping as Murderbot’s mechanical hands prying open the mouth of some carnivorous alien in order to save the crew. ‘It’s not like I cared about them personally, but it would look bad on my record, and my record was already pretty terrible.’There hasn’t been a robot this badass and heroic since Johnny Five fighting bad guys set to that Bonnie Tyler song. Murderbot (a name they have self-selected, mind you) is a security unit programmed to protect and murder that gets sent out on contract jobs, but as they admit ‘we’re cheaply produced and we suck.’ But still good enough to murder, or discover how to hack their governor and give themself free will.‘I could have become a mass murderer after I hacked my governor module, but then I realized I could access the combined feed of entertainment channels carried on the company satellites. It had been well over 35,000 hours or so since then, with still not much murdering, but probably, I don't know, a little under 35,000 hours of movies, serials, books, plays, and music consumed. As a heartless killing machine, I was a terrible failure.’The narration in this book is just a delight as Murderbot is snarky as fuck and drags their feet through everything despite showing up and being awesome when needed. There are so many great one liners and admissions like ‘I didn’t want to get into how little I pay attention to my job,’ and how much they just sort of don’t care unless they are required too. Good news, without the governor they don’t have to care about anything and ‘you may have noticed that when I do manage to care, I’m a pessimist.’ Wouldn’t have thought I’d relate so hard to a robot killing machine but HERE WE ARE. I love it.‘It took a tremendous effort for me not to rip his arm off, and I’d like that noted for the record, please.’The real spice of this book is all of Murderbot’s internal anxieties over talking with people because on one hand, they have to ensure they don’t reveal they are free from their programming and on the other, they simply don’t want to. ‘I can’t do even the half-assed version of this stupid job if I have to talk to humans,’ because ‘murderbot + actual human = awkwardness.’ This is only made worse by the fact that the team with Murderbot happens to come from a planet that gives AI rights and has an interest in speaking with them, which Murderbot can only register with pure horror. Murderbot happens to have organic human features under the armor and being out of it is a great metaphor on vulnerability as it also ‘humanizes’ them to the humans and makes everything more awkward.‘So, I’m awkward with actual humans. It’s not paranoia about my hacked governor module, and it’s not them; it’s me. I know I’m a horrifying murderbot, and they know it, and it makes both of us nervous, which makes me even more nervous.’I’ve heard several people mention this book seems to nudge at ideas of autism represented by Murderbot, which makes sense and if so it feels like respectful and positive representation. I also love how the book constantly reminds you Murderbot is, in fact, an AI machine with constant precise data (Murderbot will tell you a human paused for 2.4 seconds, for instance) or their system going offline during a fight and leaving you with gaps in the story. It’s all super creative and well done.All the ideas in this book are great and the interpersonal anxieties might steal the show, but the actual plot that carries the ideas is quite excellent as well. ‘These weren’t intrepid galactic explorers,’ Murderbot reminds us when shit hits the fan, ‘they were people who were doing a job and suddenly found themselves in a terrible situation.’ And so we are treated to Murderbot having to save the day—half begrudgingly—and let me tell you did I crack up when they admit all their planning was just based on how they saw things go down in tv shows. It is a fun story with a lot of giggles to be had, and while it does end rather abruptly and feel far too short, it also just feels like a pilot episode establishing character and prepping to launch more. Which there is, the Murderbot Diaries is still going strong with a Hugo Award for best series and another book coming out this year. I think I’ll be catching up for it.So if you enjoy things that are good, All Systems Red is for you. If you enjoy things that suck, well, All Systems Red is still probably for you and its cool, I enjoy things that suck too. Besides, Murderbot admits their system sucks because they are the cheap model. But when it comes down to it, Murderbot has a lot of heart and through this sentient AI, Wells explores the ideas of what it is to be human. It’s all very clever and rather heartwarming. This is a fun story with a lot of laughs and some great ideas at play. I can’t wait to read more.4/5...more",Notes are private!,0,166,1,"Apr 26, 2023","Apr 26, 2023","Apr 26, 2023",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/32758901-all-systems-red

Always reinventing and exploring new territories of literature, the thematically linked, short stories (most only a page or two in length) in Yuri Herrera’s Ten Planets harnesses his abilities to twist conventions or employ language in unexpected ways to produce elusive futures from which the reader feels alien and estranged once we recognize our expectations and ideas on reality might be vaguely incongruous with the existences on the page. It is a brilliant and destabilizing effect, moving through stories that feel adjacent to the whimsicality of Jorge Luis Borges’s philosophical parables blended with the sci-fi noir and paranoia vibes of Philip K. Dick. There are imaginative and threatening scenarios with an apocalypse born from the words ‘everyone is going away’ written on a notecard, an AI house has aims to trap it’s occupants, oppressors reincarnate their oppressed as rats, or people living entire lives under invisibility cloaks, and the characters are just as intriguing from a bored zookeeper in an alien zoo, a multi-limbed writer who works in a ‘story incubator lair’, to a man who can find lost objects using people’s noses as a map. Everything defies convention and while Herrera utilizes sci fi tropes, it is always in unexpected ways to create these little gems that evade easy interpretation and shine like distant stars in the sky: tiny and beautiful but feeling vaguely out of reach.‘When you’re a pestilent creature, the world is no longer pestilent.’Yuri Herrera is a fascinating author who is difficult to pin down, though an attempt at categorization feels beside the point to his works. In an interview with Latin American Literature Today, Herrera said ‘I don’t write thesis novels,’ and while his stories often have socio-political aspects permeating the themes, it is a much more emotional and nebulous center of gravity through which the themes revolve in its orbit. Each of his books has been a departure from the others, and have all been beautifully translated by Lisa Dillman(Signs Preceding the End of the World was winner of the 2016 Best Translated Book Award for Fiction). Ten Planets brings us into the realm of sci-fi, though in ways that are unexpected with each story a fresh surprise and—in keeping with his desire to never be a ‘thesis novel’—without any definitive “meaning” to the tales and images. We are all cosmic explorers in his words, and while it can be rather disorienting (and a bit of a slow read despite the very short length) it is an intriguing voyage.‘And every little iota in his body began covering the endless iotas along the way.’Herrera uses these stories to explore ideas of language, colonialism, and other social issues, though the predominant thread binding these stories is looking at how everything is the sum of infinite moments and actions. Each story looks at the infinitesimal bricks of reality all building together in each life, each gap between lives, and in each choice. Each ‘iota’ or reality. In her translator’s afterword, Dillman is given space to discuss her word choices and ideas behind the work (something I always love and wish publishers would do more often) and discusses Herrera’s use of the word ‘ápice’ which she translates as ‘iota’:‘Words are frequently polysemous, which is to say a single term may have multiple meanings. For example, in addition to the definitions listed above, ápice can also mean both tip (of your tongue, say) and apex (as in geometry: is that a science?). So the same word used several times in Spanish might be rendered many different ways in English…I have chosen to translate ápice as iota in English throughout Ten Planets. Every inch iota of my being felt compelled not to stray from this lexical choice every time an ápice cropped up. In part because it is used in idiosyncratic ways in the Spanish. In part because aside from meaning ""a tiny amount' and being the etymological root of ""jot""), it has, to my ear, a more science-y ring than the other options and as such lends truthiness. But what is more, it refers explicitly to the ninth star in a constellation. It's a space-y word. Stellar in all respects.’Dillman’s marvelous translation skills are really put to the test here as language is also a central theme and words often work in surprising ways here. There is, for instance, the choices she needed to make for certain technology and how the different connotations between tech terms would affect the interpretations. But we also see how much language is essential to culture in these stories and how much that also plays into issues of colonialism. An explorer finds himself suddenly murdered in one story when attempting to communicate as ‘attempting to usurp the person's most intimate of possessions--their unique and inimitable tongue--was interpreted as a heinousact.’ Language is also used against each other in The Conspirators where two different human colonies (both from Earth but from different times) colonize the same planet, with one inevitably becoming the oppressor over the other by appropriating their language. Aspects of social inequalities and how they persist in these future worlds are all over the collection.‘No, the grandiose and definitive could never be defined by the brief and simple and elementary.’There is a fun, Borgesian whimsicality to many of these, most notably Zorg, Author of the Quixote which draws its title from a Borges story and involves an alien writing Dox Quixote. There are some charming ones, one where a character is chasing after an “Earthling” only for us to discover later he means a dog, a gut bacteria becomes sentient in another, or there is a favorite,The Cosmonaut, where a gift for using noses as a map leads to some awkward situations. Herrera has a few stories that tie together, such as the series about explorers looking for the end of the earth and only finding dragons, and even a darkly humorous story written as a User Agreement that nudges towards the anxieties of surveillance capitalism.‘With this Authorization you consent to have any information about your use of the product utilized in but not limited to electoral campaigns, national security, meat product recycling, pharmaceutical experimentation, cosmetics research, psychological warfare, market studies, and collected prose.’Everything is this collection is vaguely hostile, especially when it comes to hierarchies which are always tainted in violence. There are two stories titled The Objects, one of which deals with surveillance technology while the other is a corporate world where the higher up the chain you are, you become an animal higher up the foodchain. These stories are all rather playful and conceptually brilliant, though often rather dark and foreboding as well (The Monster’s Art, for instance, is about quite literally abusing “monster” in order for them to make art from their pain). What is most surprising, perhaps, is how tightly packed these are with Herrera constructing entire realities within the span of what is often two pages.‘Earth must exist for the benefit of something else. Like sustenance. Earth as a host wafer, a tortilla, a cracker traveling through the universe, just awaiting an encounter with the mouth of the creator. and we are what imparts the flavor. Earth, to them, is concrete proof of divine cosmic pleasure.’Philosophical and elusive, Ten Planets is a heady yet enthralling collection. While individual stories often don’t seem like much—a few I finished thinking “wait, what?” but unpacked them over the course of a few days—the amalgamation of ideas becomes a sum greater than its parts. Legacies of violence, oppression, language and cultural barriers, and all sorts of other boundaries become thematically linked as Herrera looks at the ways reality is the sum of tiny details, and it is in those details we find the true stories. Despite it’s short length this one took me a while to get through but it seemed best to only read a few at a time and give the ideas space to blossom in your mind as you grapple with them later. Herrera is an exciting author full of surprises and Ten Planets proves yet again he is a wizard of words.3.5/5‘Everybody knows that the Creator is not a mouth but the eye of a dragon, and that the world is but a blink, a blink, a blink set to happen: now.’...more",Notes are private!,0,97,1,"Apr 25, 2023","Apr 25, 2023","Apr 25, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60784737-ten-planets

Sure it is a bit saccharine, but Henry seems to have found the shortcut to maximum rom-com vibes and while it feels overly stylized to the point it feels more like a marketing campaign for the story than a story it also knows how to thrive on its sweet spots and charms. We even get a name-drop-the-title moment with ‘you are in all of my happiest places.’ This is a story about trust-fund best friends who should probably have attended therapy instead of going on a last-hurrah weekend vacation to one friend’s summer home (that will no longer be theirs since his fourth wife is forcing him to sell it) that becomes a surprise wedding and everyone should be happy. Except Harriet has to be there with Wyn, her ex-fiance, and the pair pretend to still be dating in order to not spoil the mood. Something Henry is know for is strong woman characters with plenty of agency working through the messes of life in a productive way, and I'm glad to see that come across here. Harriet is struggling to balance the self with relationships and it's nice to see that addressed in a book like this. A cute story that sometimes struggles to feel like real people but is ultimately endearing, Henry’s ability to be both a rom-com and contemporary novel all at once proves why she is the Queen of summer beach reads.‘Like even when something beautiful breaks, the making of it still matters.’This book is able to tap into feelings of insecurity and falling in love quite effortlessly and effectively. Rotating between a present and a past (the ""happy place""), Henry stitches together the events that brought us to this fateful and frenzied weekend where Wyn and Harriet are caught up between being sad and pinning for the other. Everything is rather bittersweet and miscommunication seems to rule the day. It's a bit melodramatic and the miscommunications often feel too much like plot devices than authentic communication mishaps, but ultimately this is an enjoyable read. While I enjoyed that Henry let’s this one be sad, the balance between the campy and sad never seems to quite blend. Perhaps everyone just needed a nap and maybe some therapy? And just to actually talk to each other, though Henry does well by having the main “conversation” that needed to happen get built up to quite well. This book and characters remind me a lot of Sally Rooney where there is a frustrating lack of communication which is used as footholds for the plot.Perhaps my trouble was having read Henry’s YA novel A Million Junes before this one which had a lot more depth of character and better dialogue. Or, as Emma put it in our discussion, her YA’s feel much more thoughtful. The biggest hurdle with this book is that the characters do not really talk or act like real people. The quippy dialogue is a bit exhausting and feels like if you are in a room of people all trying to one-up each other with their favorite one-liners from Friends and the whole aspect of the couple having not told anyone when they broke up because it would ruin the perfect sheen of the friend group feels like it would work in a high school setting but amongst late-20-somethings just feels too contrived and weird? The two main characters get pushed along into this and I get it has to happen because it’s the set-up so fine, lets roll with it because it IS fun and the tension is GREAT. It all just sort of seems like there is an element that these characters are quite literally that, characters or perhaps caricatures of themselves in their own lives. What made Alone With You in the Ether so great is that it was a romance that made you go “wait that seems like a mental health issue going on” and then explored that really successfully whereas here it just keeps the plot moving and made me think, wait can we talk about this? These characters feel like they never grew up, and maybe that is the point as they've been so sheltered by privileged lives and lucrative jobs they wear like merit badges, but that is also so much of the underlying problem and I feel like that is more of a story than grown adults being unable to process a scandal-less breakup? We do, however, eventually get to why the break-up occurred and realize Harriet is struggling to be able to be her own person while also wanting to please everyone. I don’t want to come across overly negative here though because Henry has a good grasp on what she’s doing and not only can hit her audience but make them stand up and sing and sit down and cry—this book reads like practiced perfection and honestly good for her.This is an altogether impressive book and what truly makes it work is the ensemble cast. The friend dynamics are great and are honestly more interesting than the relationship (which is mostly just pining and being horny for each other in kind of classic moments like “oops we have to share a bed”). The side characters are kind of a blast too, and I like when Henry sort of leans into her own jokes with a lot of the humor poking fun at the fact that, yea, these are rich kids in a romance book lets make the jokes but also not get too meta about it. While I may have rolled my eyes at some of the dialogue, the meaningful conversations that happen between characters are well done and Henry does an excellent job on building towards things. The end is a bit abrupt and honestly, I wasn’t all that interested in their relationship as they didn’t have much chemistry beyond wanting to have sex and making lofty phrases and besides, the true story it seems like is the survival of this friend group. Which is cool because friend groups very often drift apart and trying to fight against the tide to stay close is a real struggle I think a lot of people feel. Especially when people start getting married or moving away. It’s a decent book, and I’m not blown away but I’m also not disappointed I read it. I really enjoyed that Henry let there be emotions in this and let it get sad in ways I didn’t expect from what is otherwise a fairly breezy beach novel. I think the depth of feelings and the emotional grit is what kept this together and makes it work. On the other hand, the way it is very stylized also makes the characters feel disingenuous when they are supposed to seem emotive but I'm probably just over-thinking that. It would make a good film and probably would have worked better as a graphic novel. Henry attended Hope College, which is right here in my town, and it was hard to get passed realizing every single character felt like people who go to Hope College. Its a vibe, trust me, and its the vibe of this book and she accurately captures that vibe. While a lot of my complaints above are certainly more a “it’s not you it’s me”, I will probably read more by her as I think she is great at what she does.3.5/5‘In every universe, it's you for me.

Hinted at previously, we see the horrifying experience that first brought Erica into the Order of St George after she was the sole survivor of a monster attack similar to the ones we saw her battling against in the earlier volumes. From here we watch her terrifying trial-by-fire initiations into her new role as a monster Hunter, which is somehow at least better than being abandoned to an orphanage full of trauma nobody will believe. This is an excellent edition to the series that offers a creative wealth of world building, finally giving us a better picture of the goings on of the House and the secret society of monster slayers that dwell within.  [image]James Tynion IV excels at creating interesting and intricate scenarios, so this volume gives his best talents a lot of space to thrive as we get a crash course education into the secret society, learning as we go along with Erica. It is pretty cool, and I love how the different masks signify a different purpose in the House. Also we meet Jessica, who brings Erica into the Order and see the origin of the Octopus doll. This offers a nice narrative coupled with the signature amazing (and amazingly violent) artwork, and the series continues to be a dark delight. While they have all been fairly cinematic—with great use of frames that drive the story forward, control the action, and provide ample space for the fairly-text heavy dialogue—this one feels especially ready-for-tv-adaptation, which we are getting on Netflix in 2024.

Except often it feels like that crew is sitting there helping the danger instead of pulling off some heroic Han Solo moves to save the ship. That ship is our Earth, and for decades if feels like the crew, us, have been sitting there like the ‘this is fine’ meme of the dog drinking coffee in a burning house while fossil fuel and securities companies have thrown colossal amounts of money into organizations doing everything from distractionary tactics to put the blame on individuals (BP invented the “carbon footprint” for instance) in order to avoid systemic changes, to outright denying the issue exists. Not Too Late, edited by Rebecca Solnit and Thelma Young Lutunatabua offer a different perspective: while there is much work to be done, while the danger is not only coming but already here, climate activists have made positive progress and if we still have hope we can accomplish more. Because we have to or we face a very different future where many will not survive. Collecting essays and interviews from climate activists around the world, this is an empowering and passionate plea for organizing and holding fast to hope while also being a very educational book on the subject of the climate crisis. Dr Jacquelyn Gill asks us to consider ‘What could we accomplish if we stood together and faced the danger?’ and Mary Annaïse Heglar reminds us that this requires people working together when she asks ‘what if your power in this fight lies not in what you can do as an individual but in your ability to be part of a collective?’ This is a wonderful collection that provides hope in the darkness and is accessible to newcomers to the struggle—as gathering more people to climate activism is essential to its success—while being thought provoking, insightful and educational even to those already invested in the crisis.‘What gives me hope is that human history is full of examples of people across the ages who have risen to face the great challenges of their time and have succeeded. Victory is not the arrival in some promised land; it is the series of imperfect victories along the way that edge us closer to building the critical mass that eventually shifts the status quo.’- Dr Joëlle GergisI’ve always quite enjoyed Rebecca Solnit for approaching rather uncomfortable and dark—but necessary and often urgent—topics in a way that is inspiring and hopeful. She often passes your through the dread but points to a light at the end of the tunnel and reminds you getting there is hopefully possible. Even her discussions on what ‘hope’ means is rather lovely:’ To hope is to accept despair as an emotion but not as an analysis. To recognize that what is unlikely is possible, just as what is likely is not inevitable. To understand that difficult is not the same as impossible. To plan and to accept that the unexpected often disrupts plans--for the better and for the worse. To know the powerful have their weaknesses, and we who are supposed to be weak have great power together, power to change the world, have done so before and will again. To know that the future will be what we make of it in the present. To know that joy can appear in the midst of crisis, and that a crisis is a crossroads.’But we can’t just get caught up in hope, either, as every person in this book reminds us that this is a lot of work, but work that it is imperative we accomplish. ‘This is a message of catastrophe, but it does demand we think transformationally’ Edward R. Carr insists, giving hope that ‘a climate-resilient future is still possible.’ Lutunatabua agrees, adding ‘ The question shouldn't be Will my actions be enough? but Will our actions be enough? This is a communal quest in which everyone can bring their talents…’ Throughout this collection, the theme of community and organizing to work together rings out the loudest. We can’t do this alone, they insist, but offer hope when we work together.Not Too Late collects organizers from all over the world to present their perspectives, such as the Pacific Climate Warriors who remind us to approach the situation with sensitivity to race and culture as well. ‘We were recipients of a white savior narrative that really painted us as folks who really couldn’t tap into our own agency or…inventiveness,’ Fenton Lutunatabua says in an interview with Thelma. It is a reminder how quickly intentions to help can come across in ‘a very condescending way.’ For the 2020 US election I worked as the campaign finance officer for a US House of Representatives campaign (we did not win) and was only one of two staffers for the beginning when we were basically at the drawing board for our platform along with a group we hired that had worked on several West Michigan campaigns. Our candidate was very versed in climate crisis issues and we were frustrated when advised against making that a major platform, showing us data that while climate issues had been on the rise as an “important” issue for voters, the previous election showed a sudden decline and former candidates saying that platform issue hurt them. The theory was that between 2016 and 2018, climate issues were often discussed by a wonderfully inclusive group with many people of color, women and younger people being the forefront and in rural West Michigan, white voters (particularly men) suddenly grew disinterested or distrustful over the issues (we still ran with climate issues on the platform, but still lost). This is a classic example of misogynoir at work. Though don’t be discouraged, as Solnit cites a study showing that while in the US people estimate only 37-43% of people ‘support major climate change mitigation policies,’ actually a 66-80% of people do. PEW Research center also tracks that this is increasing, though there are party line issues:  [image]While the aforementioned issue showed how racism, misogyny and agesim can be an issue involved in climate activism it also demonstrates how, as several chapters here mention, fighting against climate crisis is so intertwined with other liberation or equity movements. As author Adrienne Maree Brown in an interview, the growth in learning and fighting for climate issues in the US and UK has appeared to be adjacent to the #MeToo movement, prison abolition, BLM as people are seeing how structural and systemic oppressions are linked. Also that these systems uphold the same powerful people who perpetrate the various crises. It makes some people dismiss climate activism as just something ‘radical leftists’ support. In her book This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. The Climate, journalist Naomi Klein discusses how many fear climate activism as ‘a trojan horse for socialism’ (a huge issues also discussed in essays on the New Green Deal in her essay collection On Fire: The Case for the Green New Deal) and, as you may have guessed from the title, admits that without major change in economic policies there is no hope for a livable future on Earth. She details how oil or securities companies have help fund the climate-denier movements (weapons manufacturers, she argues, stand to gain in a world where chaos ensues as mass migrations and other disasters occur due to climate disasters) and how this has also created a political divide hindering progress. This is a concern shared by Dr Leah Cardamore Stokes in her chapter:‘When denial became indefensible, the fossil fuel industry started singing a new song: the crisis can’t be solved. Delay paid them in cash. When we hear stories about the harms posed by clean energy technologies, we should take a beat and ask: who profits from telling this story? Too often, the fossil fuel industry is seeding propaganda to make us feel hopeless and defeated. If we delay, they profit.’This is furthered by Professor Farhana Sultana who states that ‘Colonialism haunts the past, present, and future through climate,’ arguing that climate activism must also focus on global equity and be sensitive to cultural and racial issues towards ‘reparative climate equity.’ The idea that climate activism also means creating a better world overall on a variety of issues is rather reassuring. ‘ The question shouldn't be Will my actions be enough? but Will our actions be enough? This is a communal quest in which everyone can bring their talents…’Despite a lot of hard truths and discouragement, this book is endlessly optimistic and rather hopeful to read. There is a chapter detailing the chronology of successes in climate movements, such as the Paris Climate Treaty or the stoppage of oil pipelines by water defenders. This book also reminds you that you are not alone in your worries, that there are many opportunities to help (it gives a great resource list for further reading or joining the fight) and reminds us that the future is still uncertain. Sure, it is very likely that there will be more climate disasters and things will in fact get bad, but we also have the opportunity to mitigate disaster and fight against total destruction. For those looking to learn more, to find a way to move forward or simply need some hope in the darkness, Not Too Late is a lovely collection with a lot of brilliant minds. 4/5‘Change happens gradually, then suddenly.

Smith became the 22nd Poet Laureate of the United States, an honor that was well deserved. Such Color: New and Selected Poems is an incredible overview of Smith’s fabulous career, with her four volumes of poetry— including the Pulitzer Prize winning collection Life on Mars—and a handful of new poems demonstrating the deftness with which she can make the ordinary into something extraordinary or wrestle with the intangible. ‘You want a poem to unsettle something,’ Smith says and her works shake up reality to glimpse the forces working beneath it while also creating poetry out of unexpected places with her erasure poems. Such Color is a lovely testament to the brilliant mind of Tracy K. Smith who has certainly earned her status as an essential US poet.An Old StoryWe were made to understand it would beTerrible. Every small want, every niggling urge,Every hate swollen to a kind of epic wind.  Livid, the land, and ravaged, like a rageful Dream. The worst in us having taken over And broken the rest utterly down.   A long age Passed. When at last we knew how little Would survive us—how little we had mended  Or built that was not now lost—something Large and old awoke. And then our singing Brought on a different manner of weather.  Then animals long believed gone crept down From trees. We took new stock of one another. We wept to be reminded of such color.  For Tracy K. Smith, poetry is about connection. In her memoir, Ordinary Light, she discusses on how poetry is a ‘voice speaking thoughtfully and passionately about what it feels like to be alive,’ and how this can find the common threads that unite us all. ‘One of poetry’s great effects,’ she says in her lecture Staying Human: Poetry in the Age of Technology (watch it here), ‘through its emphasis upon feeling, association, music and image — things we recognize and respond to even before we understand why — is to guide us toward the part of ourselves so deeply buried that it borders upon the collective.’ Poetry can tap into the collective of humanity the way a good rhythm in a song can bring all sorts of people together. It is a way we share experience, learn, grow, or simply have space to be heard, seen and hopefully better understood. ‘Sometimes telling what happened, in whatever way you can, is a means of lightening your burden. It summons others to help you bear the weight of your own story, so that you might finally get out from under it.’ This is something we all need, and I love that Smith’s work aims to emphasize this aspect of poetry.The Weather in SpaceIs God being or pure force? The windOr what commands it? When our lives slowAnd we can hold all that we love, it sprawlsIn our laps like a gangly doll. When the stormKicks up and nothing is ours, we go chasingAfter all we’re certain to lose, so alive—Faces radiant with panic.Smith served as US Poet Laureate from 2017 through 2019 (the honor was then passed to Joy Harjo, another amazing poet) and I’ve always found it fairly amusing she was doing this work during the Trump administration, similar to my amusement of Charles Simic producing anti-war poetry as Poet Laureate during the Bush administration. During this time she toured the country talking poetry, with a particular focus on rural communities through her series American Conversations. She strove to build a ‘bridge between people in cities and university towns, where poetry festivals and reading series are quite common, and those in rural parts of the United States, where such programming doesn’t often reach’ she said, ‘because poems put us in touch with our most powerful memories, feelings, questions and wishes.’ She also released a small but powerful anthology, American Journal, which aimed to capture the American experience through marginalized voices that are often left out of the conversation. ‘The world I return to when the poem is over seems fuller and more comprehensible as a result.’This collection spans Smith’s four volumes, beginning with The Body's Question which won her the Cave Canem prize in 2002 and ending with a batch of new poetry that feels a perfect encapsulation of many of her themes and includes a poem written to musician Otis Redding titled Dock of the Bay. Smith’s references to historical figures and musicians permeates her work, with her Pulitzer Winning collection, Life on Mars, frequently speaking to the musician who penned the song from which the book takes it’s title. ‘That's Bowie / For you: the Pope of Pop, coy as Christ. Like a play / Within a play, he's trademarked twice.’ That particular collection is outstanding, moving through poems about grief and elegies for her father, the Iraq war, and into prospective futures. There are poems about space and telescopes, and I do love a poem that can incorporate science fiction elements such as the poem Sci Fi imagines a utopian world of equality and innovation:There will be no edges, but curves.Clean lines pointing only forward.History, with its hard spine & dog-earedCorners, will be replaced with nuance,Just like the dinosaurs gave wayTo mounds and mounds of ice.Women will still be women, butThe distinction will be empty. Sex,Having outlived every threat, will gratifyOnly the mind, which is where it will exist.For kicks, we’ll dance for ourselvesBefore mirrors studded with golden bulbs.The oldest among us will recognize that glow—But the word sun will have been re-assignedTo the Standard Uranium-Neutralizing deviceFound in households and nursing homes.And yes, we’ll live to be much older, thanksTo popular consensus. Weightless, unhinged,Eons from even our own moon, we’ll driftIn the haze of space, which will be, onceAnd for all, scrutable and safe.Perhaps one of the most moving poems, It & Co. also dives into an essential theme of her work. The poem explores the ‘it’ of her poetry and all the things “it” can be during a period of grieving (both personal and political), with “it” always being in a state of flux with an elusive meaning (you can hear the full poem read by her here):We are a part of It. Not guests.Is It us, or what contains us?How can It be anything but an idea,Something teetering on the spineOf the number i? It is elegantBut coy. It avoids the blunt endsOf our fingers as we point. WeHave gone looking for It everywhere:In Bibles and bandwidth, bloomingLike a wound from the ocean floor.Still, It resists the matter of false vs. real.Unconvinced by our zeal, It is un-Appeasable. It is like some novels:Vast and unreadable.I appreciate the vastness of her works, which also apply to the variety of styles and topics Smith utilizes. The collection Duende includes ”Into the Moonless Night”, written as a play in poetry about teenagers who were kidnapped in Uganda and given as “wives” to rebel commanders and forced to bear their children. In lectures, Smith encourages poets to draw from the world around them, using events but also finding poetry in words that already exist. For example, Smith uses the note found on the body of 9 year old Particio Hilario found dead on the streets in Rio in 1989 as the title of a poem—”I Killed You Because You Didn’t Go to School and Had No Future”—and uses it for a horrific perspective on tragedy. Smith also enjoys mining existing texts to create erasure poems. The collection Wade in the Water is full of them, from actual letters by Black civil war soldiers seeking compensation, or her erasure of the Declaration of Independence.DeclarationHe has sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our peopleHe has plundered our — ravaged our — destroyed the lives of our —taking away our — abolishing our most valuable —and altering fundamentally the Forms of our —In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned forRedress in the most humble terms:…Tracy K.

WeI can still hear the uproar of my university classroom on an early spring evening about a month before our Professor would suddenly vanish forever. We had just asked our her who her favorite philosopher was, and after a few laughed disclaimers she finally said the name: Martin Heidegger. There weren’t many of us, maybe a dozen, and almost entirely insufferable artsy dudes in our flannel shirts and emo haircuts though in my memory we were all mostly a faceless mass revolving around our professor like she was our sun, a sun who at this moment was parrying our complaints that she simply could not pick Heidegger. He was a Nazi, for one, he was practically unreadable, and he slept with all his students for another. Though that another of her favorites was Hannah Arendt seemed to help elucidate why she would have an affinity with Heidegger’s philosophy. The professor gave it back to us: maybe if we had the capacity to understand him we’d like him better, and a conversation about separating art from the artist ensued. Poetry, she said, his writing on poetry and, of course, his important additions to the discourse on language. It was Existentialism, a 400 level class, and I think every one of us was in love with our professor so I can promise I wasn’t the only one who went out and bought this book. She must have been in her late thirties and what I recall most was her enthusiasm for life because the class structure very quickly faded away along with the winter and just became more discussions on life with all of us reading the same texts outside of class. And music. On the first day of class she played us the music video for Bright Eyes - At the Bottom of Everything and had us discuss it in the realm of existentialism. I was thrilled, having long been a Bright Eyes fan at that point, and even the initial groans from classmates faded when it became clear she loved Bright Eyes. Had a classmate previously hated them, that moment transformed them into a fan. Like I said, we were all in love with her. Even the queer ones of us, of which there were a few of us, and became a topic we got to discuss really openly and securely in her class, which at the time felt very radical. Shoutout to the brave student who used the conversation on bad faith and the authentic self to approach the topic. To tease us, she had a framed photo of Heidegger she kept on her desk with a lipstick kiss on the glass. Fine, I made that lipstick part up, though it's certainly better this way. Rather a romanticized visual to focus the imagery than the grumpy face of a third Reich supporter. When she realized we were all over 21 we began assembling at the bar just across from campus, a few of us arriving before her, most of us staying much after her and eventually meeting up for drinks or to play music outside of “class.” But she was the structure, we all came to hear her talk about her ideas on life and love. She had met someone, she hinted. A man who lived in France and had a kid, so certainly uprooting his life to be with her in this midwest college town was out of the question. Go there, we’d tell her. But don’t bring your Heidegger photo. Spring break came and went, and we didn’t get an email to meet at the bar as usual so we shuffled back into the classroom where our lessons were supposed to have been taking place. It was a big building with many floors, and I always found a slight humor that the top floor was the philosophy department as I had this cliched image of all philosophy majors being heavy smokers and trying to look like Camus. Which wasn’t far off the mark for all of us in that class. But as we wheezed into our seats we noticed a new face standing at the head of the class. A young man, bleached blonde hair like a Sugar Rey music video, nervously nodding and smiling. Where is she, we said like a chorus. She would not be returning, we were told. Chaos ensued. What? Why? When? How? Was she in trouble? The teacher, at that point, didn’t know and was so dosed with a cocktail of nervousness and excitement taking over his first college lecture he probably hadn’t even bothered to ask. We ended up really liking him, and a very structured class resumed. I wrote a paper on No Exit by Sartre I’ve always been particularly proud of, but Heidegger never came up again.A few weeks later we got an email. Sorry for the sudden disappearance, she wrote to us. And something about following her heart. Attached was a photo of her and a very studious looking older man beneath the Eiffel Tower. I can’t see the name Heidegger without thinking about this story. This woman who had a classroom wrapped around her finger, most likely having a rough period of mental health but instead of spiraling, she turned it into a corkscrew roll and ascended to follow her heart.

Cosmoknights is a fun sci-fi story surrounding “jousting” tournaments that take place around the galaxy where the winner gets to marry a princess as their reward for victory. Except the rich and royals no longer want to do battle and sponsor athletes to fight in their stead. Enter Bee and Cass, an adorable lesbian couple who fight to win so they can liberate the princesses. With astonishing artwork that brings the futuristic world to life in bright, bold colors, an intriguing sports scenario, charming characters and plenty of action, Cosmoknights is a blast.   [image]If you recall the barrage of memes about space being gay a few years back, you’ll be thrilled to see this graphic novel take up the helm as the perfect narrative expression of those memes. Everything about this is just awesome and it is such a visual thrillride. Having just been completely wowed by Hannah Templer’s artwork in Flung Out of Space, a graphic novel about Patricia Highsmith, I had to check out her work on this series where she writes as well as illustrates. Her world building is a real treat, with a galaxy where these jousting tournaments (which are pretty much just gladiators in badass giant mech suits beating each other up) are a spectacle to the rich in a galaxy of extreme economic inequality and ensures the money all remains cycling between the upper classes and some vague princess economy. The artwork really pops and brings to life amazing visuals in this future that is like a brightly colored noir with sci-fi monarchy imagery with their knight defenders. The colors are incredible and I love all the space shots, especially in contrast from the mundane worlds of the working classes. Templer’s pacing is on point and the action scenes are really effectively depicted and easy to follow, which is often difficult to balance. I was very impressed.  [image]The story follows Pan, a working class girl whos illicit friendship with a princess made her a public enemy after she helped the princess escape off-world to avoid being a prize in these gladiator games. Her family fled the planet and the economy collapsed without the royals to uphold it. After helping Bee and Cass, she follows along and gets caught up in the dangers of their life: smashing the patriarchy with mechsuits in the arena. But are they doing enough? An offer from a trans anarchist to really disrupt the royals might become their new, more dangerous future.

These sorts of stories were so pervasive, it just seemed like if you wanted it bad enough it would happen. Maybe this is why I love books so much, perhaps I have found the door but instead of a pathway through a forest the real escape is a path of words. For those still looking for their door, Every Heart a Doorway by Seanan McGuire is your ticket into a cruel yet marvelous world of wonder with its story that feels so familiar—like a story you feel you should remember from some eroded childhood memory—yet also so fresh and fun. This is the story of Miss West’s home for children who have had their adventures, but now that they have been spat back into our mundane world they struggle to exist in our society, depressed and preoccupied with returning through a door that will likely never open again. ‘We don't teach you how to dwell. We also don't teach you how to forget,’ the kids are told, ‘We teach you how to move on.’ But when a sudden string of murders shocks the house, everything is thrown for a loop and the skills they learned in their individual worlds might come in handy to solve the murders before it is too late. With a fabulous worldbuilding, wit and a lot of charm, Every Heart a Doorway is a dark and delightful fairy tale for adults, a doorway you will certainly want to lose yourself in.‘It was cruel and cold and brutal and beautiful, and I would give anything to go back there.’The creativity of this story is excellent. It is a short book, yet there are vast multidimensional worlds inside, making this book sort of like the Tardis with how miraculously full it feels despite being 170pgs. McGuire doesn’t pad the story with lengthy exposition, giving you just as much as you need in context as events transpire. Basically you learn at the same pace as newcomer, Nancy, who echos the readers confusion or questions making you feel like you are collaborating with her. Which feels very fairytale-esque in general, poking your head into worlds that feel expansive but only getting a small peek. Some children end up in worlds of high logic, some worlds operate through total nonsense. Some are bright and cheery, with rainbows and unicorns, some and dark and violent. The narrative tracks behind Nancy, who has just arrived at the House and was in the Hall of the Dead, learning to stay as still as a statue to impress the Lord of the Dead. Nancy’s story feels very Persephone-adjacent, and McGuire does everything from clever nods to familiar worlds to actually incorporating classic tales into her universe (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is canon, for example, but The Chronicles of Narnia is not and a student is offended by Lewis’ inaccuracies). It’s like a super cut of fairy-tales and I love it.‘Their love wanted to fix her, and refused to see that she wasn’t broken.’ We find that the doors seem to choose children and each seem unique able to survive the type of world they are sucked into (well, at least the kids who have made it home, perhaps many get sucked through and die), though it makes them have difficulties in this world when we return. The book nudges themes of trauma (the magic is real but it is written similarly to issues of repressed memories or other traumatic mental health issues that survivors face) and I found the aspect of parents wanting to be helpful but causing more harm to be well done, with parents who ‘dismissed their memories as delusions, their experiences as fantasy, their lives as some intractable illness.’ You really feel for these poor kids who nobody understands until Eleanor West comes along.‘You want to go back, and so you hold on to the habits you learned while you were traveling, because it's better than admitting the journey's over.’The way the students retain part of their world is painful, or makes them seem very odd, but it also can be helpful. We have Jack (Jacqueline) and Jill for instance, who came back from a horror world of mad scientists and vampires (so basically a nightmare constructed of how much Lord Byron sucked as he inspired both Frankenstein and modern vampires and my rant about Byron is still my favorite thing I’ve written here) has Jack a skilled doctor and coroner that—coupled with Christopher’s knowledge of bones from his skeleton world—gives a fun CSI element to the murder mystery. This book plays with a lot of familiar themes and tropes but in exciting ways that feels fresh with the intermingling of them. Sure, the autopsy part is a bit corny, but it is also just fun and gives a lot of room for worldbuilding and honestly this is a book that if you let it be fun, it is a blast.‘We notice the silence of men. We depend upon the silence of women.’McGuire manages to enact a lot of social commentary right beneath the surface of this story. We have the issues of mental health, not believing survivors, trying to “fix” people in ways that aren’t helpful or without asking them what they actually need, and other issues on the ways we address children. ‘‘boys will be boys’ is a self-fulfilling prophecy,’ the Home’s therapist says when asked why there are so few boys in the co-ed home:‘They’re too loud, on the whole, to be easily misplaced or overlooked; when they disappear from the home, parents send search parties to dredge them out of swamps and drag them away from frog ponds. It’s not innate. It’s learned. But it protects them from the doors, keeps them safe at home. Call it irony, if you like, but we spend so much time waiting for our boys to stray that they never have the opportunity.’It works quite well for the story, which is something McGuire is excellent with. There is also really wonderful representation in this book, with asexual, trans and other queer characters. I love the way Kade (easily my favorite character) realizing they are in fact a boy is folded into their story as the reason they were rejected from the fairy world despite conquoring the goblin King: fairies steal little girls and if he is no longer a girl he must leave. The queer aspects of the book parallel the aspects of parents failing to understand their children, putting the analogy right there for the reader to see. It is well done.‘She was a story, not an epilogue.’What strikes the heart most powerfully in Every Heart a Doorway’ is the resiliency of the characters in a world that makes no sense to them and treats them poorly. The book feels very dark at times as the students are cruel to each other and everyone is suffering. They are learning to move on but there is still hope (extraordinarily small hope) they might return to the Princes and Lords they were promised to. ‘Hope means you keep on holding to things that won't ever be so again, and so you bleed an inch at a time until there's nothing left,’ Sumi say, a girl who mocks those who believe they will ever go back, ‘hope is a knife that can cut through the foundations of the world.’ But have their stories ended or are still ongoing? And who is killing students and why?I should briefly note that this was also my first time doing an audiobook and quite enjoyed the experience. This seemed an apt book for that as well, being all fairy tales and such, as hearing it read seemed to bestow a sort of ""oral tradition""-type reception of the story fitting to its genre. Which was cool, and the reader (Cynthia Hopkins) does great accents and voices. ‘You’re nobody’s doorway but your own, and the only one who gets to tell you how your story ends is you.’While Every Heart a Doorway is just the first step into a larger fantasy epic series, Wayward Children, it also functions perfectly well as a stand-alone. The main problem is resolved with many of the tiny mysteries left to explore later, so you could just read one but upon finishing this you will likely crave the next. The dark whimsicality and mind-bending creativity here is wholly satisfying, and while the book market is a bit saturated with dark academia/magical boarding school novels (this novella came out in 2016, for reference) it still seems unique. There is a kinship of vibes with The School for Good and Evil but for an older audience (while not a YA this works well for teens and adults), as well as shows like Wednesday and The Midnight Club, both of which I have recently enjoyed. This book has a lot of heart and was just a blissful, eerie ride. So if your doorway to a fantasy world hasn’t opened for you yet, open the gates to Eleanor West’s home, Every Heart a Doorway is waiting for you.3.5/5‘Now I know that if you open the right door at the right time, you might finally find a place where you belong.’...more",Notes are private!,0,121,1,"Apr 17, 2023","Apr 17, 2023","Apr 17, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25526296-every-heart-a-doorway

While highly flawed, Patricia Highsmith was a fascinating figure no matter how you look at it, something writer Grace Ellis and illustrator Hannah Templer hone in on for phenomenal results in Flung Out of Space—a graphic novel rendition of the Highsmith’s young life. Chronicling the start of Highsmith’s career writing comic books under pseudonyms as Strangers on a Train was forged through the clicking and clacking of her typewriter through the release of The Price of Salt under the name Claire Morgan (later released under her intended title, Carol, and under her name 1990), this is an interesting and moving look at the author. While slightly fictionalized and condensed, Ellis brings Highsmith to life in a way that, as she writes in the intro, ‘resembles the characters she’s most famous for writing: charismatic sociopaths who are worryingly easy to root for.’ Combined with Templar’s exquisite artwork Flung Out of Space is a visual narrative feast that handles sensitive topics with grace and makes for a gripping story of artistic struggles.  [image]This book blew me away and I devoured it with sheer delight. The art is marvelous, with Templer delivering a very noir-esque 1950s while also nodding to comic book aesthetics. The frames direct the action forward as if to the pulse of pulp fiction and seamlessly transition between the real world and the creative daydreaming of the author, often imposing her creative process on top of the world as she moves through it. The character design is highly expressive, with a vastness of emotional complexity playing out on Highsmith’s face. The writing is crisp and the duo combine their talents for some wonderfully creative and effective storytelling.  [image]Highsmith is a queer icon, with The Price of Salt being a groundbreaking work of lesbian fiction for actually giving the women a mostly-happy ending. But people are complex and flawed—you may be interested to read this article grappling with her legacy and horrific antisemitism and racism—and this book does not shy away from depictions of the rather unfortunate aspects of Highsmith. Ellis provides a really engaging introduction on this, discussing how despite her flaws, Highsmith is still a fundamental part of queer history. She concludes by saying ‘if you read this book and end up conflicted about Highsmith and her legacy: good.’ Yet the book manages to make you at least sympathetic for her as she struggles between multiple jobs, her conflicted feelings between excitement and guilt over her attraction to other women for which she seeks out expensive conversion therapy. Above all it presents her determination to become a successful author who doesn’t just write crime novel, but ‘good books’ that have mystery and crime in them (as she frequently says). We feel her efforts and struggles, and it does make for an endearing story. Also there are some surprises, as I did not know she briefly wrote for Stan Lee under a pseudonym.  [image]Flung Out of Space is a fabulous graphic novel. One need not have any prior knowledge of Highsmith to enjoy it, though you will certainly want to read Carol after this. I had gotten really into her short stories back in college and now I definitely want to read more of her books.

Hemingway’s lean and direct style seems perfect for a graphic novel adaptation and here we have Jason Novak (who you may recognize from The New Yorker, Paris Review, Harpers or the Believer) try his hand at it with In His Time: The Early Stories of Ernest Hemingway. As he writes in the introduction about Hemingway’s originals, ‘any one of them taken alone might be better classified as a prose poem; it is only when read together that they achieve a cohesion as 'stories',’ and through simple black and white art Novak attempts to capture that cohesive feel through the collage of loose stories. The stories tend to revolve around bullfighting and war, with what are presumably recurring characters and lots and lots of death. It is a cool attempt, and certainly an excellent collectors item or gift idea for the big Hemingway fans in your life, though it left me rather underwhelmed and seems almost too weightless to carry these already slender stories.   [image]Personally it is not an art style that does much for me, so bear that in mind as it may be just your thing, but where I could see a Hemingway story coming to life through added visual emotion and resonance, Novak aims for a reduction and sparseness that leaves almost nothing to grab ahold of. The images are almost too loose to really convey any emotion, the characters are hardly expressive and it just felt flat to me.  [image]That said, it is cool to see these stories come to life visually and I appreciate the artistic intent. ‘I'd even say that my drawings bear the same flavor of truth as Hemingway's sentences,’ Novak writes in his introduction, ’they are not overtly sophisticated, but it took me thousands of hours of practice before they started to look so honest.’ I respect his notion too that the lack of much detail is in keeping with Hemingway’s iceberg theory so that is cool too. I definitely respect the intent though for myself personally, as a graphic novel it seemed a bit lifeless.

But there was once a real bloodthirsty monster living in a castle in Romania. He remained in his tower for twenty-four years. While Dracula chose specific victims, this other monster chose to be evil and cruel . . .’In December 1989, the Christmas Revolution brought about the end of dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu’s rule and 42 years of communism in Romania. Under strict austerity measures that left many impoverished and starving, a lack of free speech with constant terror of informers or the brutal Securitate (secret police), and a cult of personality to the leader that kept much of their suffering unreported outside Romania, the Romanian people came together to fight for freedom as many communist governments in Eastern Europe fell. I Will Betray You by Ruta Sepetys is a fantastic YA historical fiction surrounding the events of Romania being the last country to remove their dictator—and the only to do so violently. It follows Cristian, a teenage boy who’s life is turned upside down when he is blackmailed into becoming an informer and asked to spy on the teenage son of the US diplomat who’s apartment Cristian’s mother cleans (so kind of like Normal People except instead of fucking each other they fuck each other over). Determined to outsmart even the secret police, Cristian has a plan to get his story of the truth about Romania out of the country but betrayal lurks behind every corner. A tense, claustrophobic novel where ‘there is no such thing as a ‘confidant’,’ and widespread suffering emanates from every page, I Will Betray You’s punchy writing and shocking twists will have you flipping pages as if Cristian’s survival depends on you to keep reading.  [image]Romanian demonstrators gather in front of the Communist Party headquarters in Bucharest, Dec 22, 1989In I Must Betray You, Sepetys depicts a country under harsh oppression, a country few knew anything about and champions the spirit of hope and resistance kept alive in the hearts of the people. This was a fascinating novel that covered a period of history I knew very little about and deftly folds the educational aspects into a pot-boiler of a novel where the tension accrues with tremendous intensity. There are many mysteries at the heart of this tale and danger at every corner, keeping you and Cristian constantly on your toes wondering who could be betraying who and Cristian must learn the harsh reality that ‘when betraying others, we often betray ourselves.' It is written in very short chapters, most of which end on a cliff-hanger or with a right-hook of a surprise line that makes this very easy to plow through quickly, the tension keeping you yearning for more. I quite enjoyed this and it felt like something you’d read for a class in middle or high school and actually be glad to have assigned reading homework and I could see this working very successfully in a classroom. It does sort of fall into the historical fiction tendency to have its characters interact with almost too many aspects of a historical event, but it does so in a way that gives you a broader portrait of what was happening at the time.‘Mistrust is a form of terror. The regime pits us against one another. We can’t join together in solidarity because we never know whom we can trust or who might be an informer.’The novel does an excellent job of depicting the crushing mistrust and anxieties of living under such a system, where 1 in every 10 people living in the country was an informer as Sepetys says in her afterword. We feel this pressure at all times in the book and Sepetys has a clever method of sprinkling “classified documents” throughout the text that reveal an unknown informer is watching everything Cristian does, and this added layer of dramatic irony increases our stress watching Cristian knowing he isn’t being as secretive as he thinks. The stress is great for everyone, with one boy even having a break down in class and confessing he is an informer, and as the story progresses Cristian finds that he might not be the only one in his own family.‘And thats when it hit me:The teacher must be an informer. He informed on the students. The school director was an informer. He informed on the teachers. The secretary was an informer. She informed on the school director. Luca was an informer. He informed on me. I was an informer. I informed on Americans.’I am reminded of that Modest Mouse song with the lyrics ‘Everyone's a voyeurist / They're watching me watch them watch me right now’ and even in their own homes these characters have to whisper for fear their homes might be bugged. It is an excellent depiction of how control can work by effectively turning everyone against each other to use the uncertainty of fear to keep people in line. It is terrifying.‘And I noticed something. Choice.Options. The characters in foreign movies had both.We had no choice.’Where there are any choices in the novel, it tends to be between a rock and a hard place. Anything from the West is contraband, though people seem to find ways to acquire and hide them (trading cigarettes—kents—is one way, though these are needed for anything from bribes to simply getting a dentist to numb your gums for a tooth extraction) and it provides a window into the outside world that seems so strange to Cristian. Trying a coke for the first time feels like ‘a revolution on my tongue’ and his one wish is to try a banana. When he sees a clip of American teenager while at the Diplomat’s house he is surprised they don’t all lunge for the bowl of fruit, until it hits him that they have no need to lunge for the fruit because it is plentiful. It works well to show the reasoning Ceaușescu cut them off from the rest of the world so they wouldn’t even be aware what they were missing. Writing to a teen audience in the US, this is a reminder of the privileges one has without even realizing it, or as Cristian says we usually don’t appreciate or recognize the good things in life until they are gone.  [image]Ceaușescu (center) at Disneyland, a photo seen by Cristian in the novel.This gets into Ceaușescu’s cult of personality and the manipulation of an entire country. He has also hoodwinked world leaders, with the US even supporting him. We learn of children’s groups to promote submission to the state, like Falcons of the Fatherland beginning at age 4. Abortion is highly illegal and women are considered property of the State, with tax breaks for having large families and awards if you have 5 or 10. A new generation raised not knowing any differently and an aging generation with their speech suppressed is a catalyst for control, especially when anything from beyond the borders is taught to be dangerous and simply seeing something without reporting it is reason enough for imprisonment. Discovering the truth feels like ultimate betrayal. Luckily for Cristian he has his grandfather, his Bunu, who speaks against the regime and teaches Cristian to fight back and hope. ‘Words are weapons.’Perhaps my favorite aspect of the novel is the way words are a major form of resistance. ‘They steal our power by making us believe we don’t have any,’ Bunu teaches him, ‘but words and creative phrases—they have power, Cristian. Explore that power in your mind.’ Cristian keeps a diary full of observations and poetry, a diary that would be a death sentence if the secret police ever found it, and hopes to get it to the Diplomat as a way for the US to learn the truth about Romania. A journal with lines like ‘If communism is Paradise, why do we need barriers, walls, and laws to keep people from escaping?’ In a world where speech can lead to death, it is also speech that can lead to freedom, and Sepetys captures this in such an empowering and inspiring way.‘DO YOU HEAR ME? RECITING JOKES,LAUGHING TO HIDE TEARS OF TRUTH THAT WE ARE DENIED THE PRESENT WITH EMPTY PROMISES OF AN EMPTIER FUTURE.’This is an excellent novel, and while being a YA it is just as engaging and informative for adults. It is an harrowing look at the Romanian Revolution and events leading up to it, such as Romania’s star Olympic gymnast Nadia Comăneci defecting, and the surrounding countries fighting for freedom. It becomes a powerful lesson on solidarity, organizing and uprising, recognizing ‘this is bigger than the ‘I’ or the ‘me.’ This must be ‘we.’’ The slow-burn tension building first half of the book explodes to a dramatic conclusion, full of violence and bravery, making this a very exciting but heart wrenching novel and there are some incredible twists. Plus there is an adorable blossoming romance between Cristian and Lilliana which adds a tender sweetness to the tale. Ultimately, I Will Betray You becomes a book about surveillance and betrayal with a reminder that not knowing the full story can be deadly, and sometimes we never know all the truth until far too late. A gripping thriller full of important history, I Will Betray You is quite the impressive page-turner.4.5/5  [image]‘Romanians were joining in hand and heart.

Poetry has always been an importanNational Poetry Month is a great opportunity to discover new poets and anthologies are a wonderful avenue to do so. Poetry has always been an important part of the publishing house Farrar, Straus and Giroux (FSG), a wonderful publisher known for their international collection of authors. Begun in 1946, FSG has boasted a highly decorated list of writers with 25 of them having been Nobel Prize recipients. The FSG Poetry Anthology chronicles the over 120 poets they’ve brought to the world, organizing the collection by decade and for their poem selection ‘we’ve tried to select work that is perhaps less familiar yet nevertheless characteristic of the writer: renewed discoveries to hold up to the light again.’ No doubt their repertoire of poets is impressive, with many notables found in this volume such as Louise Glück, Seamus Heaney, C.K. Williams, Derek Walcott, Frank Bidart, Grace Paley, Elizabeth Bishop, Adam Zagajewski, John Ashbery, Pablo Neruda and many, many more. It is a wonderful colelction that offers a snapshot of the publisher and an excellent assortment of poems to touch your heart, mind and soul.Love- Daniel NadlerLove,the skeleton of a ship on the seabedtakes water as its fleshand maybe schools of fishas momentary sails. A single pearllost to a currentcan become to ita navigable star.Just yesterday I wrote a  for another anthology (read it here) and discussed the ideas around what is poetry and found this volume also includes a lot of poetry addressing the question. I was delighted by this one, which was published with the quote by James Schuyler: ‘I hate Christmas / but I hate people who hate / Christmas even more,’ and I felt it certainly adds a valuable perspective on the conversation. Take a look:What Was Poetry?-John KoetheNo one really knew, though everyone knew what it should be;And now it's just a way of being famous on a small scale.It was supposed to be significant for its own sake,Though that was never entirely true: human feelingsGot in the way, for while it was possible to remain unmovedIn the face of all that language, no one really wanted to:They wanted to talk about it, to explain what it had let them see,As though the world were incomplete before poetry filled it in.And now there's nothing left to see: oh, poems come and goAnd everyone complains about them, but, where there used to beArguments there's just appreciation and indifference,Measured praise that's followed by forgetting. I'm as badAs anyone: instead of reading I reread, instead of seeingI remember, and instead of letting silence have its sayI fill it up with talk, as if the last word might be anything else.And yet despite all this it matters. Sometimes in the midstOf this long preparation for death that initial solitude returnsAnd the world seems actual and alive, as it assumes its opposite.I think the truest thoughts are always second thoughts,But who am I kidding, other than myself? I hope there'sSomeone, that it casts its spell beyond the small cone of lightHovering over my desk, and that what started out one nightSo long ago in silence doesn't end that way. I fantasizeI can hear it somewhere in the realm of possibility,But only now and then, in intervals between breaths.I love this. ‘And yet despite all this it matter.’ I always loved the way Roberto Bolaño addressed art as something that was the most important aspect of life and celebrating artistic communities while also lampooning them. For him, it sometimes seems that art matters because it almost doesn’t and that it is our love for it, the ways it keeps us going in hard times, that does make it matter. ‘Only poetry isn’t shit,’ he wrote. This is a lovely collection because it reminds us that poetry isn’t shit, that poetry can matter, that poetry can reach inside us and make our very essence of being dance to its rhythms and be moved or marred by its words. Poetry captures life in the abstract, makes a single moment into an epic, bestows our thoughts, fears, loves, hopes and dreams into a carefully chosen package of words and transmits them to the world, often lasting longer than the poets themselves. Poetry feels like a path to immortality, like a rallying cry, like a soothing hug, like a voice that could echo through the cosmos or barely be heard in a silent room. Poetry is a landscape I love to live in, forever changing.Afternoons and Early Evenings-Louise GlückThe beautiful golden days when you were soon to be dyingbut could still enter into random conversations with strangers,random but also deliberate, so impressions of the worldwere still forming and changing you,and the city was at its most radiant, uncrowded in summerthough by then everything was happening more slowlyboutiques, restaurants, a little wine shop with a striped awning,once a cat was sleeping in the doorway;it was cool there, in the shadows, and I thoughtI would like to sleep like that again, to have in my mindnot one thought. And later we would eat polpo and saganaki,the waiter cutting leaves of oregano into a saucer of oil-What was it, six o'clock? So when we left it was still lightand everything could be seen for what it was,and then you got in the car-Where did you go next, after those days,where although you could not speak you were not lost?This is a lovely collection and the assortment of poets is fantastic. It really draws from a variety of cultures and places and captures 75 years of excellent works, carefully sorted into this collection. Now the last anthology I just ed did have such a phenomenal introduction and page layout that I preferred (as well as more poems) but this one is also a valuable collection. I would have liked to learn a bit more about the publisher though. Yet, for an anthology of poems where the only theme is the publisher, this is quite well done.

Auden once offered that it ‘might be defined as the clear expression of mixed feelings.’ Since 1972, the nonprofit publisher Copper Canyon Press has been a valuable space for an incredible list of poets to bring their work out into the world, and the vast catalog of nearly 700 volumes of poetry in 50 years demonstrates how versatile poetry can be and, as Executive Editor Michael Wiegers writes in his introduction, proof that ‘the great pool of poetry is inexhaustible.’ Wiegers asks us to stop and consider what exactly is poetry. ‘I believe this is not an intellectual argument but rather an elusive evolution toward empathy and connection,’ he writes, ‘yet there is no singularity to what constitutes this art form. For all the different styles, aesthetics, opinions, and assertions, we engage in common experiences whenever we read or hear a poem.’ This is best examined by flipping through the pages of this incredible anthology, A House Called Tomorrow,’ which celebrates 50 years of poetry under Copper Canyon Press. With a fabulous introduction by executive editor Michael Wiegers and an amazing overview of the publisher’s history, this is a wonderful anthology that gives us the past and present and reminds us of the power and possibilities of poetry.‘And so poetry is not a shopping list, a casual disquisition on the colors of the sky, a soporific daydream, or bumper sticker sloganeering. Poetry is a political action undertaken for the sake of information, the faith, the exorcism, and the lyrical invention, that telling the truth makes possible. Poetry means taking control of the language of your life. Good poems can interdict a suicide, rescue a love affair, and build a revolution in which speaking and listening to somebody becomes the first and last purpose to every social encounter.’-June JordanCopper Canyon Press has been home to some of the biggest names in US poetry, like former US Poet Laureate W.S. Merwin, or Pulitzer Prize winners Natalie Díaz and Jericho Brown, also Denise Levertov, Carolyn Forché, Ocean Vuong, Arthur Sze, Ursula K. Le Guin, Victoria Chang, Paisley Rekdal, the English translations of Nobel Prize winners Pablo Neruda and Tomas Tranströmer, my favorite poet Lucille Clifton and so many more. You’ll find a poem from every collection the publisher ever put out here, which is a really fun way to discover new poets and writers while also paying tribute to this lovely nonprofit bringing us amazing art. Speaking of, the cover was designed by Erika Blumenfeld, the artist in residence for NASA (which rules that NASA even has an artist in residence) who used an ink brush to put a stroke of 24 karat gold onto paper in the shape of a meteor. Not many of them, it’s true-Gregory OrrNot many of them, it’s true,But certain poemsIn an uncertain world—The ones we cling to: They bring us backAlways to the belovedWhom we thought we’d lost. As surely as if the wordsLed her by the hand,Brought him before us.Certain poemsIn an uncertain world.This is a cool collection and it was also a really fascinating history of the publisher itself. ‘We’re small, but we punch above our weight when it comes to the poetry field,’ Wiegers says. I thought it was neat to learn they provided space for Graywolf Press—another incredible nonprofit publisher—to start up and shared a building together. His thoughts on being a nonprofit that helps fund poetry programs to grow the community was insightful as well:‘Being a nonprofit arts organization, much like an art museum, wherein we’re curating poetry, rather than curating exhibits – our exhibits would be our books, of course, – that’s allowed us to sustain this focus and publish some of the most significant poets of the latter half of the 20th century and the first quarter of the 21st century.’ It was interesting to read how the publisher began to get more notoriety publishing many collections that went on to win major awards, and made efforts to a more inclusive catalog to ensure more voices are represented and to reach more readers. In his introduction, which is worth picking up this anthology for on its one, Wiegers discusses the history of poetry publishing in the US, emphasizing that ‘poetry was central to their efforts to elevate BIPOC, queer, and countercultural voices.’ Look at Akwaeke Emezi discussing ‘when i last came out i called myself free,’ and the other amazing poems in here on identity or queerness. Poetry is often an act of resistance and many incredible poems have come from oppressed or otherwise marginalized communities finding a way to use their voice and deliver a message. Think of the Russian poets who met in secret to memorize each other’s poems to ensure their survival under Stalin when a poem could land you in prison or lead to your execution (much like Bulgakov’s famous saying ‘manuscripts don’t burn’). I think of Juan Gelman writing ‘my verses like bullets firing at death,’ in the face of the 30,000 people “disappeared” by the military junta in 1970’s Argentina, or the speech from Salman Rushdie where he said ‘A poem cannot stop a bullet. A novel can’t defuse a bomb. But we are not helpless. We can sing the truth and name the liars.’ Words being a radical act is something poetry is well equipped to harness and keep the human spirit alive like a torch refusing to burn out in a storm.won't you celebrate with mewhat i have shaped intoa kind of life? i had no model.born in babylonboth nonwhite and womanwhat did i see to be except myself?i made it uphere on this bridge betweenstarshine and clay,my one hand holding tightmy other hand; come celebratewith me that everydaysomething has tried to kill meand has failed.-Lucille Clifton I enjoyed that the selection process for this collection came from a collaborative work of requests from readers, the Board, and the poets themselves. While it isn’t exactly cohesive aside from being a Copper Canyon Press published poem, it does make for a really cool range of work. You have everything here, like poems that can devastate in just a few words:Separation-W.S. MerwinYour absence has gone through meLike thread through a needle.Everything I do is stitched with its color.Or longer poems that deal in the more political, such as this signature and much-anthologized poem from Jericho Brown’s Pulitzer Prize winning collection The Tradition:Bullet PointsI will not shoot myselfIn the head, and I will not shoot myselfIn the back, and I will not hang myselfWith a trashbag, and if I do, I promise you, I will not do itIn a police car while handcuffedOr in the jail cell of a townI only know the name ofBecause I have to drive through itTo get home.

He took Me from us and left my body, which is, No matter what we've been taught, Greater than the settlementA city can pay a mother to stop crying,And more beautiful than the new bulletFished from the folds of my brain.There are poems that will fill you with joy, or sadness, but often with hope. There are even some excellent translations:There Is a Light in Me-Anna ŚwirWhether in daytime or in nighttimeI always carry insidea light.In the middle of noise and turmoilI carry silence.AlwaysI carry light and silence.There’s honestly something for everyone in here, and it does make a great introduction to contemporary poetry for those who are still combing the field finding poets that work for them. All in all it is an amazing testament to this wonderful publisher.Who says a poem must stick to the theme?Poetry is certainly lost on him.Poetry and painting share a single goal-clean freshness and effortless skill.-Su Tung-p'oSo if you are new to poetry or a long-invested fan of the art, A House Called Tomorrow is a fantastic anthology.

What’s to-day, my fine fellow goodreader? Christmas day? Humbug, nay! Today is the day I ramble to you about Albert Camus’ The Fall! Come, You there! What’s to-day, my fine fellow goodreader? Christmas day? Humbug, nay! Today is the day I ramble to you about Albert Camus’ The Fall! Come, come, get yourself a drink. I’m buying. You know, The Fall, the one where Clamence monologues to a stranger at a bar for days on end—he must enjoy it as he returns again and again while also accompanying Clamence on walks—and he implicates all of humanity in a story that surrounds someone leaping from a bridge. What’s that? Angels getting wings when a bell rings? No no no, Clamence not Clarence, and a totally different bridge, different vibes. And there are no angels here, mon cher, and one of the many ‘falls’ that make up the titular The Fall is a fall from one’s own grace in recognition of your own flaws and guilt over actions. Or even your inactions. Happy stuff, eh? Drink up, and now where were we? Ah yes, Albert Camus, 1956, still riding the high of his celebrated novels and war hero status from his time in the French resistance, though this tale takes us far from his home in Paris or the Algeria of to a bar in Amsterdam curiously named Mexico City. You are asking me why Amsterdam? Well, the canals of course! They make rings around the city and if ‘Amsterdam's concentric canals resemble the circles of hell,’ Clamence says, this bar would be ‘ in the last circle,’ This fall for which our narrator monologues parallels a descent into hell a la Dante Alighieri. But now you must ask yourself, is Clamence our Virgil or perhaps the devil himself? Considered to be a highly personal and described by Jean-Paul Sartre as ‘perhaps the most beautiful and the least understood’ of Camus’ works, The Fall is a brilliant plunge into existential quandaries on ethical living, judgment, freedom and more as our narrator weaves his tale towards the shocking heart of the matter.  [image]There, you see, the circles of AmsterdamWhat’s that, mon ami? Who is Clamence? Oh yes, yes, I suppose I should start with him. Jean-Baptiste Clamence—the name a reference to John the Baptist I’m sure you understand, though the goodness of John is in direct contrast to the goodness of our narrator, you shall see, though the only person putting his head of a platter is himself—was a lawyer. A good one, you see, he lets us know how much he helped those in need and was an ideal humanitarian. His earlier monologues—the course of the book is several days of conversation, but don’t worry I won’t keep you that long. But please, order another drink on me in the meantime—but early on he appears entirely self-satisfied. He lists his accomplishments in sports, career and women, and assures you he is a good person. People who go on and on about being a good person are always actually good people, right? Oh you disagree? Well surely his litany of good deeds can—wait, whats that? You mean to tell me that good deeds are inherently selfish in at least some form? The egoism vs altruism debate?Ah yes, Knut Hamsun discusses this well in Mysteries, that the recognition or even simply feeling good about oneself is a reward and he thereby questions if there can be any truly selfless acts. ‘I admitted only superiorities in me and this explained my good will and serenity,’ our narrator here admits, ‘when I was concerned with others, I was so out of pure condescension, in utter freedom, and all the credit went to me: my self-esteem would go up a degree.’ Well surely this puts some light on his earlier statements about how he ‘never felt comfortable except in lofty surroundings. Even in the details of daily life, I need to feel above.’ Perhaps this isn’t just building height, though a high apartment is a status symbol, and more an indication of his need to feel superior. ‘That's the way man is, cher monsieur,’ he says, ‘he has two faces: he can't love without self-love.’‘I was always bursting with vanity. I, I, I is the refrain of my whole life, which could be heard in everything I said.’’So now we are getting to it, the pristine veneer he presents of his life begins to show cracks, slowly spidering like a windshield once a stone has struck it. Clamence notices it as well, and several events in his life make him pause and reflect on himself. Hearing a distant laughter unsettles him, and not just from a sense of FOMO. His confessional monologue details a fight with a motorcyclist and a bridge suicide where he regrettably did not act and the weight of these memories are like a stone around his ankle that precipitates his plunge through the personal circles of existential hell. The bridge incident will haunt him, even in leisurely moments upon a cruise, and is the moment that all the book revolves around, caught up in its gravitational pull not unlike the way the beach murder is the center to his earlier novel, The Stranger.‘I used to advertise my loyalty and I don't believe there is a single person I loved that I didn't eventually betray.’Now some critics have derived this to be, in part, a criticism of Jean-Paul Sartre and the Paris leftists. Oliver Gloag writes in his Albert Camus: A Short Introduction—an excellent and succinct work of criticism I shall lend you if you like after our drinks—that Camus saw that they ‘spoke of helping others but did not concretely help them.’ Many others have seen this book on the whole as Camus’ own self-criticism as well. Have you seen a photo of Camus, mon cher? Surely Clamence’s athletic description of himself could produce a striking portrait of the author in the mind's eye. Rumor has it the bridge scene mimics the suicide of his own wife, Francine, which he alluded to in a letter to his lover, the actress María Casares. Yes, my friend, Camus had many lovers under Francine’s nose, in fact the car accident that took his life was on a trip to where his three mistresses had all received letters from him announcing three different dates of arrival to ensure he had time with them all. Camus’s less than flattering thoughts on women as expressed in his diaries, Gloag tells us, are shared by Clamence himself who finds women a bore aside from intercourse and admits he lies to them to get them into bed.‘We have no need of God to create guilt or to punish. Our fellow men are enough, with our help.’Not awesome I know, nor is him blithely using his wife’s own suicide attempt, but thats The Fall for you. We are all guilty in some way, but who are we to judge? ‘Today we are always as ready to judge as we are to fornicate,’ Clamence says, something that still strikes a chord in our day where online outrage offers swift and widespread condemnation and a snarky judgment is a sure-fire way to increased clicks to boost social media metrics. I’m a social media person myself by trade, studied it and all, and outrage marketing is a powerful persuasionary route. I told you our narrator was a lawyer but can you guess what he is now? No, he’s not an art thief, good guess though as the dubious possession of the van Eyck painting (it is a true story that this painting was stolen) does work to double his connection with John the Baptist featured in the painting with his finger pointed towards God, a great juxtaposition with the depiction of the narrator pointing towards a chaotic empty sky devoid of God: ‘When all is said and done, that’s really what I am, having taken refuge in a desert of stones, fogs, and stagnant waters – an empty prophet for shabby times, Elijah without a messiah, choked with fever and alcohol, my back up against this moldy door, my finger raised toward a threatening sky, showering imprecations on lawless men who cannot endure any judgment.’More on the existential absence of God in a book on judgment in a moment, but our narrator here describes himself as a judge-penitent. What is that? Well, its ambiguous, and linguistic ambiguity is much of the way this novel thrives and is Clamence’s charm: ‘You know what charm is: a way of getting the answer yes without having asked any clear question.’ David R. Ellison asserts in his essay on the novel that it can be read as a ‘textually complex reading’ on The Rebel, so there is an interesting juxtaposition from his statement that ‘only clear language, the simple word, can save us from this death,’ with Clamence’s labyrinthian monologues here full of ambiguous language and inauthentic self-indulgence. Sorry? Yes, the judge-penitent. Well, essentially, he is a penitent because he is confessing his sins (quite literally in the monologue) but also a judge because, well, he wants to judge you. And he’s going to, he’s going to implicate the whole of humanity. The judge-penitent gets a sense of power from judging others, and is something Camus accused Sartre of being, feeling people like this were dangerous as they could quickly rationalize themselves into committing the same atrocities as Stalin. ‘People hasten to judge in order not to be judged themselves.’Remember the laughter we spoke of earlier, the one that unsettled him so much? It was laughter that made him think of judgment and those who pass it with sadistic glee. Admitting himself a sinner, he realizes laughter is his own way ‘of silencing the laughter, of avoiding judgment personally.’ Laughter is his escape, and if we must imagine Sisyphus happy then perhaps we should also imagine him laughing. Maybe making lewd jokes about rolling his balls. No, don’t cheers me for that. ‘Don’t wait for the Last Judgment,’ he says, ‘it takes place every day’ and this is a true tragedy. Camus was against judgment as he often saw it as absurd, such as the way he wrote about it in Reflections on the Guillotine:‘To assert in any case that a man must be absolutely cut off from society because he is absolutely evil amounts to saying that society is absolutely good, and no-one in his right mind will believe this today.’What does Clamence say about god you ask? Well, for starters, he tells us ‘God’s sole usefulness would be to guarantee innocence,’ but he also believes there is no innocence in this world so thereby no need for a god. And with no god, it is humanity that must do the judging. ‘But to be happy it is essential not to be too concerned with others,’ he says of his solution to be happy and feel superior, ‘consequently, there is no escape. Happy and judged, or absolved and wretched.’ This is why the penitent part is also important though, because by confessing he is absolved, though this reminds me of when people talk about saying sorry isn’t enough and need to see it reflected in our actions. We must act, not just judge or engage in self-flagellation to avoid actual action. Follow? Here, I’ll order one last round.‘We are all exceptional cases. We all want to appeal against something! Each of us insists on being innocent at all cost, even if he has to accuse the whole human race and heaven itself.’I’m sure I’ve exhausted you, but I must reiterate that The Fall is a marvelous novel. Elusive and complex, it is an excellent look in the mirror at our own guilt and the ways we flail about trying to understand what to do with it. It is a novel that uses much religious symbolism (you see the dove fly about the novel, for instance) and language to construct this very existential discourse. Laughter may be the best medicine, they say, but here it is a strategic plan to obtain power and superiority, laughing and judging all the way. An absolutely outstanding novel, all intricately woven in under 150pgs. Thank you for you time, I’ll pay our tab, and no I won’t judge you. Or will I…5/5‘We are odd, wretched creatures, and if we merely look back over our lives, there’s no lack of occasions to amaze and horrify ourselves.’...more",Notes are private!,13,285,1,"Apr 11, 2023","Apr 11, 2023","Apr 11, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11991.The_Fall

The novel is practically an immersive experience in a sci-fi galaxy so well constructed and narrated that it feels very lived-in, and by the novels end you feel as if you are a part of the crew, having spent so much time amongst the endlessly lovable cast of characters. This is enhanced as, while most sci-fi epics put us with the elite heroes, the chosen few upon which the fate of a galaxy rests, Chambers lets us see how the average citizen of their Galactic Commons lives, loves, works and dreams. ‘The people we remember are the ones who decided how our maps should be drawn. Nobody remembers who built the roads,’ yet Chambers creates a blissful drama full of life aboard a ship that does just that: builds “roads” between planets across space. Often described as “cozy sci-fi”—an apt description if there is any—this first book of the Wayfarers plunges us into an exciting cosmos to live amongst the regular folks and look at how a universe of multiple species would feasibly coexist and is an excellent exploration on themes of cooperation, plurality, friendship, and identity while also a condemnation of war and power. In short, this book is a universe unto itself.In epic space films we often see entire ships or planets destroyed and just move along, death on such a large scale it becomes that Stalin quote about one death a tragedy, a million a statistic. Long Way to a Small Angry Planet zooms in to the individual level and shows how for the regular person caught up in these cosmic struggles just a single death could be a universe of grief. It brings us to the level of what goes on with the Red Shirts in Star Trek, the transport crews in Star Wars, the regular staff in Dune, a crew full of non-combatants just trying to live their life in the universe. I love this crew. I can’t help it after feeling their kinship, engaging with their struggles, and watching them learn and love with each other. We are brought aboard the Wayfarer along with Rosemary, a young woman with a new identity fleeing a mysterious past and welcomed in to their crew. I’d tell you about them all, but I’d rather you get to meet them for yourselves. It’s been a few days since I finished the book and I rather miss them, so say hello for me.‘Perhaps the ache of homesickness was a fair price to pay for having so many good people in her life.’What really grabs me about this book is the emphasis on how to make the universe work, even just aboard a ship staffed by a variety of different species. Details like Aandrisk-friendly cups to accommodate a lack of lips or other alterations and safety procedures for ease of access on ships for certain species, discussions on cultural or species differences or examples of interspecies frustrations due to them, and even a sort of sci-fi racism is present (the term “lizard” is a massive slur). Working a DEI committee for a library and often thinking on accommodation and equity I really enjoyed how much attention to these ideas Chambers includes as a brilliant way of making the world feel real and lived-in. Communication is key to much of this, such as language barriers and attempting to ‘not judge other species by your own social norms,’ even a interesting discussion on how the human language is biased against reptilian species (‘cold blooded’ having negative connotations, etc). ‘Feelings are relative. And at the root, they’re all the same, even if they grow from different experiences and exist on different scales.’This applies to cultural aspects too, and Chambers includes exceptional drama with trying to decide the “right” thing to do when there is a clash in cultural beliefs. ‘This is so fucking Human of you,’ Captain Ashby is told at a critical moment, ‘Lie back and let the galaxy do whatever it wants, because you’re too guilty about how badly you fucked up your own species to ever take the initiative.’There are interesting discussions, such as Sissix finding it strange humans view a baby dying as more tragic than an adult (a baby has not accomplished anything while an adult has and has knowledge that could be passed on is the Aandrisk perspective), there is a species that finds taking anything more than you need to be not only wasteful but immoral, and the variations of sexuality and family structures is fascinating (Aandrisks have a “hatch-family” and a “feather-family” for instance, with the chosen family being more important than biological). It all makes for a great commentary on our own times and the need to accommodate plurality, something that is under political attack in the US from which Chambers wrote this novel. It is in the novel as well, with the uneasy alliance with the Toremi—a warmongering species thats inclusion into the Galactic Commons (GC) drives the main plot points—further frustrated by their rejection of plurality and belief in full consensus (they see the universe is complex patterns but reject multiple interpretations being allowed to co-exist). ‘You Humans really do cripple yourselves with your belief that you all think in unique ways.’I enjoyed how it is mentioned Corbin, who is white, is a rarity and almost all humans are people of color which feels akin to the sci-fi futures of Ursula K. Le Guin who usually applies a wide racial cast and has stated her lack of white people in the future is because ‘why wouldn’t they still be either a minority, or just swallowed up in the larger colored gene pool, in the future?.’ That is certainly present here, with other nods to Le Guin including the nod to the galactic communication device being called the “ansible,” a tech from her books. The humans here have come from our Earth, which is now unlivable due to human destruction and wars (I enjoyed the digs at cults like the highly xenophobic Gaiaists wanted to abandon the galaxy and return to Earth or the Survivalists who reject technology or vaccines wanting a human surpremacist society) but in this future amongst the stars they are fairly mediocre and not exactly highly respected. They are viewed as too emotional, weak and fragile, and there is a comedic moment when characters playing an old human game (chess) joke at how human games used to be about conquest but in the present the idea of humans being conquerors is laughable. ‘The only reason Humans stopped killing each other to the extent that you used to, I think, is because your planet died before you could finish the job,’ we are told. It is a good warning in a book largely about cooperation.‘No good can come from a species at war with itself,’ Chambers writes, and this hits at a major theme in the novel. We have the humans, but also the tragic history of the Grum and why they are going extinct after years of developing more and more lethal technology to kill each other in horrific fashion in their wars. There is an excellent political narrative in this book and while it mostly exists in the background, the repercussions of it constantly arise and often harm the regular people just doing their jobs and living their lives despite it being so much larger and beyond them. ‘The thing is, a lot of laws are stupid, too, and they don't always keep people out of danger,’ we are told, and often we see how the politics of the galaxy is far more about feeding the powerful than protecting the people. Ownership of resources drives much of the politics and becomes an excellent commentary on our own global politics as it is the future’s politics. A rich person selling weapons to both sides of a war for personal gain (a narrative threaded through the newscasts) is decried as wrong and punished, but a government doing the same thing is “business as usual” and rewarded with power. And people die for these power struggles while being hardly a blip on the news.World building is a strong gift for Chambers and, like many Le Guin novels, this reads like a sociological exploration of a galaxy via a cozy narrative. It is incredibly well constructed and while she throws a multitude of in-world terms at you, she excels at putting them in contexts for you to learn them without having to explain them. By the end of the book what sounds like gibberish to an outsider is perfectly understandable to the reader. It is accomplished without much exposition either, having passages that are “historical texts” or essays that provide context and much of the explaining is done via conversations between regular people in the ways regular people would talk about events. It allows you to experience and learn on the ground level instead of being lectured, and it really works. You feel like you exist in their world, its quite impressive. The book is also rather episodic while following a fairly basic narrative forward, giving you cool windows of insight to the galaxy through short, contained narratives inside the larger one. This is a very character driven story and one in which discovering or being true to your identity while also being part of the larger world is a major theme. This can be tricky in a dangerous universe full of corruption.‘You are capable of anything. Good or bad. You always have been, and you always will be. Given the right push, you, too, could do horrible things. That darkness exists within all of us.’It is also about rising above all that, and doing the right thing. It is about exploring what it means to live and feel and coexist. Things are frightening but ‘scared means we want to live,’ as Kizzy says, and pushing on despite fear and struggles is key to being alive. What really drives the point home in a cool way is how two of the moments that most humanize the characters involves characters not considered “people” in the galaxy (like a clone, or an AI), and the biggest moment of grief allows for a tragic but beautiful look at love in a sci-fi future.‘A black hole is a perfect place to contemplate death.’Honestly I could go on and on about this book forever. It isn’t one for everyone, and if action or a strong plot is what you seek, perhaps look elsewhere. But for a gorgeous, lived-in universe full of fascinating characters and a look at how that would feasibly work, this is an absolute gem. It’s cozy, its comforting, its often hilarious and touching, but it also critiques society, war and the power structures that make war and societal suffering happen. We see how the average person is so small and fragile against the scope of political struggles of the rich and we see how it is the average person that becomes expendable pawns in their games. But most of all, we see how being alive is a joy when you can share it with others, even sharing pain and fear, and great things can happen when we try to work together. Love is the message here, and we have interspecies romantic love and familial love, both of which are necessary and good. It’s so charming. A Long Way to a Small Angry Planet was a burst of sunshine in my life, and I hated finishing it because I just want to sail the stars with that crew. Come aboard, there is much to see.5/5‘You're Rosemary Harper. You chose that name because the old one didn't fit anymore. So you had to break a few laws to de it. Big fucking deal.

As a kid there were many variations on what you could repeat in a mirror to make a ghost appear—though also the rumor was that it would murder you so who knows why we tried—which was always good sleepover fun. But what if it worked and you did summon a demon? These poltergeist possibilities bring about a spooky and zany good time in Ojja-Wojja from author/illustrator team Magdalene Visaggio and Jenn St-Onge, a ‘horror-mystery, or whatever’ as the cover reads. Middle-school best friends Valentine and Lanie are big fans of the occult and spend their days obsessing over their fandoms while trying to dodge school bully Andrea. Valentine having autism and Lanie being a trans girl mark them out as targets for Andrea’s scorn but the girls have each other and their small group of misfits that help keep their town fun and weird. Though when they unleash a demon that turns their regular bully into a supernatural creature hellbent on destruction, it’s going to take a lot of bravery and friendship to save the town. This quirky and witty graphic novel is a roaring good time spiced with changing narrative styles, fourth-wall breaking and flashback, and the eye-catching art and wonderfully inclusive cast make this an adorably endearing read.   [image]Watch out for demons!My 7th grader proclaimed this as one of their new favorite books and I can totally see why. This has all the great hallmarks of a middle grade read that feels like an after-school halloween Special while still managing to be just as charming to read in adulthood. This book just has so much personality and feels more like hanging out with a bubbly friend than reading a book. Valentine (Val) is just a joy, breaking into different narrative styles to better capture how she processes events by mimicking things like magical anime, detective shows or space-operas. It’s just cute and fun and totally how your mind works as a fun, creative kid:  [image]The story does an excellent job of looking at autism, with Val frequently trying to explain how she sees the world and tries to navigate events where she recognizes she can’t read people or situations the way others might. It also is a very sensitive depiction of trans teenagers, with Val being endlessly supportive of Lanie who is still trying to figure out her sexuality and be allowed to embrace who they are. This is a wonderfully inclusive graphic novel, with the artist depicting a good variety of body types and skin colors, and skillfully folding scoliosis and autism into the narrative in believable ways. The art is wonderful in general, able to switch gears to meet the needs of the narrative, and bolsters the humor quite well. For a horror story, this is quite funny.  [image]The story is great too, and I love how much it hones in on an urban legend where nobody quite remembers enough of the details so it's wildly different depending on who you ask. It also deals with the legacy of small town bigotry, with the demon supposedly having been summoned in the past to ward off witches and anyone that didn’t fit their “perfect” white, christian (but not Catholics!) community. It ties this well to the present where bully Andrea is possessed and builds an army of bullies to eradicate the misfits. This story does a good job of playing into the demon using insecurities for power, and in a way this feels a lot like what Blackwater tried to do, except, you know…done successfully. Also shoutout to libraries being important as a place of research and guidance!  [image]The Ojja-Wojja is such a cute, creepy graphic novel that really scared its way into my heart. It is a bit over-the-top and silly, with the bully story being a bit much at times but it does fit the sort of middle-school aimed narrative it is geared for and reminds me of 90s sitcoms aimed for the same age range. This whole thing is just rather endearing and heartfelt while managing to be a fun level of creepy as well. This is certainly aimed at the younger end of the YA spectrum but the mystery is fun, the friendship is super cute, the art is wonderful and it was a lovely little read.4/5  [image]...more",Notes are private!,0,54,1,"Apr 10, 2023","Apr 10, 2023","Apr 10, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61281732-the-ojja-wojja

Lumbering across the landscape like a plotline, there is a flattening of social class in these confined spaces carrying strangers from one place to another. Each person is a mystery to the others and the simple act of traveling makes us wonder where are they going or, perhaps, what are they running from? Spanning 9,289 kilometers, the Trans-Siberian Railway is the world’s largest rail system and an ideal setting for a literary thriller which French author Maylis de Kerangal brings to life in her tense novella Eastbound. Twenty year old Aliocha, having been unable to swindle or seduce his way out of Russian military service, is desperate to desert and finds unlikely aid in Hélène, a French woman with her own reasons for running away from Siberia. Across beautiful landscapes the odd pair are stressed and tested by language barriers and the threat of detection, as Kerangal’s gorgeous prose piles words upon words with a frenetic energy building tension to a fever pitch. Eastbound will have you holding your breath and frantically flipping pages as this miniature drama of a hunted deserted plays out against the immensity of the ‘raw, wild, empty’ natural world.  [image]The Trans-Siberian Railway passing Lake Baikal.’For a short novel, Eastbound is an absolute feast of tone and tension. We find our characters moving with trepidation through ‘deserted corridors like gaping holes that snatch at them’, passed the threatening gazes of young conscripts spilling across the train in drunkenness and debauchery, and all is overseen by the big and beastly Sergeant Letchov, ‘sly as a threat,’ always cursing out violence and vitriol or threatening murder into his cellphone at his mistress. It transforms the hallowed history of the railway into an ominous and grimy space of confinement that feels even more restrictive juxtaposed with the vastness of the beautiful landscapes passing outside, the ‘woolly mauve wilderness,’ the ‘chasm and the sanctuary.’ Its all swathed in tension that feels like it might tear your sanity apart at any moment ‘as though the real was tearing apart under the pressure of a faint but immutable deviation, something far bigger, far stronger than it.’ I adore the way her prose stacks up with long, winding sentences like the words are a line of train cars being pulled around the contours of the novel.‘ She’s helping me, yes, but she doesn’t trust me.’Aliosha wants off this train. Unable to avoid conscription, his usually meek manners make him a target for the hazing and violence rumored to happen in the barracks and he has no desire for military life. After he is beaten by other conscripts, he is determined to flee. His tepid relationship with Hélène, a foreigner riding in a sleeper cabin further up the train, forms through a wordless connection neither quite understand, completely unromantic yet bound by an ineffable mutual understanding they are both people wanting to flee. Even she can only guess at her own motivations, and often regrets them while still determined to help.‘ this sordid scenario where she gave herself the lucky draw, proclaimed herself the hero, the stranger who descends from the sky, saves you and then slips away, ready to rack up self-convincing statements – I did my utmost, I did all that I could – all the while knowing she’s incapable of believing it: the worm of guilt is already lodging itself in her gut.’While the action is more centered around Aliocha, it is Hélène who draws the most interesting existential probings of the novel. She who has just fled from a Russian lover she describes as ‘magnificent’ and has been deeply in love with but sometimes wonders if the attractions was because he was ‘from the forbidden country.’ When he is sent to work in Siberia, he finds himself reunited with his heritage and enamored by it while she feels ‘out of place, out of her own climate, her language, blind and deaf she would say over and over, laughing, and alone.’ The reasons for her departure are a mystery even she is trying to fully understand, making for a perfect scenario for this partnership of desertion.   [image]Trans-Siberian Railway Route, with our characters heading to VladivostokLanguage is key to Eastbound, and the layer of translation—brilliantly executed by Jessica Moore—seems to actually enhance the experience. The text is seasons with Russian or French words left untranslated that emphasize the language barrier between Aliocha and Hélène, and there are frequent passages that unpack the elements of culture inside language. There is a marvelous moment where her Russian lover leaves a voicemail and his descriptions of the textures of language bring to mind the textures of the landscape: ‘You must be near Irkutsk by this time and, strangely, I like knowing you are that city--the ""a"" dark and deep, nearly a closed ""0,"" the warm vibration of the ""r”, rolled in the base of his throat; my love, soon you will see Baikal, make sure you leave the door of the compartment open, you can see the lake from the corridor for a full half hour, make sure you don't miss it, it's a treasure for the Russians, the country's pearl, but for me, for us, the men of Siberia, it's simply the sea--the labials that linger, the dentals that collide, the light hiss of saliva under the upper lip--yes, I said ""us, the men of Siberia,"" I'm rediscovering my country, Hélène, and I am happy…’Brilliantly, Kerangal makes identity, language and landscape all seem to mold into one, something that is always an undercurrent in this tale of desertion and the ways characters are fleeing situations incongruent with their identities.As much as Eastbound is a thriller—the gripping conclusion had me at the edge of my seat as the story teeters on the precipice of chaos and disaster—it is also a deeply introspective novella and a loving examination of the natural world within which all our epics in miniature unfold. Maylis de Kerangal is an exquisite writer that excels at tone while also training her prose upon the story like a documentarist chronicling the events. Eastbound is a short, faced paced thrill ride across Russia and I will most certainly embark on other journeys through Maylis de Kerangal’s literary landscapes again.4.5/5‘ the dawn raising up the forest at full tilt, lifting each trunk to vertical, the bluish underbrush perforated by rays charged with a carnal light, the taiga like a magnetic cloth, modulated to infinity by the new thickness of the air.’...more",Notes are private!,16,154,1,"Apr 08, 2023","Apr 08, 2023","Apr 08, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/61953755-eastbound

Horror stirs things up inside you, makes you feel unsafe, lets fear fill in the cracks splintering in your mind and that can be a trill when contained as a story (or an actual nightmare if you are the story). The Closet, while not being traditionally “scary”, hits these vibes but instead of getting that nervous thrill from the discomfort—and wow is this an uncomfortable book—it’s just tragic and upsetting. Sure, it’s a monster-in-my-closet tale but the focus is constantly stolen away from 4 year old Jamie experiencing heart breaking trauma and instead focused on Thom, his absolute dogshit dad who is so “woe is me” he can’t even fathom that his son’s trauma is anything but another frustration affecting Thom. The framing is clever as it only enhances the realization of how much Thom can’t see beyond himself. Which makes this an interesting book because it is actually quite well done but the stories powerful efficacy instills such disgust and frustration, I mean you want to slap Thom and tell him he’s a self-centered, pathetic fuck as much as literally everyone else in the story does. But it’s what makes it so real, so upsetting, so painfully accurate on how people who are their own worst enemy can’t escape their own mindset that the world is closing in around them and recognize it’s their own hand strangling them. Sometimes the scariest monsters aren’t the shadows behind a door or the approach of beastly footsteps in the forest, but ourselves. And, as is the true tragedy in these situations where children are involved, it’s the children who suffer worst.  [image]Correct. Fuck you, ThomThis book is a well made tragedy that you just want to shake off yourself. It’s so effective but it’s just like, what do I do with this other than be sad as shit? And to try and recognize moments so you don’t allow yourself to become the monster I guess. Like Something Is Killing the Children, we see how kids are the most vulnerable and suffer the greatest, but here everything is so drained of anything actually fun in the story that its just a punch to the face and not much else. The art is fantastic though, especially the monster scenes, and can really capture moments of terror but what is does best is set an uneasy tone that spills from the page and into the reader, leaving you shivering in the bleakness of it all.  [image]I think this is an effective comic as the target audience will likely recognize Thom in their lives. He’s pathetic but you also get a sense of why he is the way he is, not that it condones anything. Hes not dealing well with no longer being the fun young adult and allowing himself to wallow which pushes people away instead of dealing with it. The scene where his old friend calls him out is amazing. But overall it’s just sad because kids are trapped in situations like this where the people who can help them are the ones ignoring them and causing the trauma to begin with (the origin of the monster is cleverly done). It does sort of cast aside any attempt to deal with manifestations from trauma by having Thom fail to contact any psychological help and just…poor Jamie, god this book is just so sad. And there are moments where you can tell Thom just can’t control himself and grow up, so in a way because an adult won’t relinquish their childhood they drain the actual child of their own.  [image]Get his ass.This was well done but just left me feeling down and not any better for having read it. But it is effective and some of you may get a lot out of this. I think this is the end of it, I mean it makes a solid final point, but if not I won’t be continuing.2.5/5...more",Notes are private!,0,71,1,not set,not set,"Apr 07, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/61241169-the-closet

I’m glad I did as it made an excellent companion for my disaster of bumped flights, awkward layovers and maintenance delays yesterday, allowing me to finish the book in one day and bask in its humorously peaceful tone amid my turbulence ridden flights. One Out of Two explores the theme of identical twins switching places as the aging Gamal sisters add a bit of spice to their life away from their seamstress business and rotate dating the same man. Yet the reprieve of romantic bliss can only lead to trouble as life never stands still and their ‘long and difficult compromise’ to share everything will inevitably lead to trouble and jealousy. Written in gorgeous, rhythmic prose (wonderfully translated by Katherine Silver) and full of sharp imagery and symbolism, this is a slight and silly but overall charming little tale of sisterly mischief run amok.‘Daniel Sada is undoubtedly writing some of the most ambitious works in the Spanish language,’ Bolaño also noted, and in here we see the prose prance in a rather rhythmic fashion, aided with a rather liberal use of colons that punctuates and directs the writing in a way you can practically hear aloud through the reading of it. It is a short novel at 100pgs, and even then a rather slim storyline that is enlarged on a grandiose scale through his exploration of details. At times it can seem a cloying level of minutia, though the efficacy of his imagery and the surprising lightness of the narrative makes the details come alive instead of bog it down, like those highly detailed still-life paintings that you’d swear are photography. There’s a charming folkiness to the story, with clever observations and killer lines like ‘destiny is nothing but a trickster demon’ that steers us with excitement and whimsy through what would be an altogether unsurprising story in lesser hands. Silver does an excellent job with the translation that captures the uniqueness of phrases that provide the lovely tone to the tale, such as when the sister—through luck of the draw—attends a wedding while the other works and says she ‘danced all night with a slender man of interesting age.’ Interesting phrasing indeed, and it all rolls off the page and through your mind quite tenderly.The story itself follows Gloria and Constitución Gamal, identical twins (save for an easily hidden birthmark on one shoulder) from their youth, suddenly orphaned when their parents are decapitated in a mass car wreck and buried in a mass grave—through their teenage years living with an aunt and her many children, to finally growing into old age running a bustling seamstress business. They pride themselves on their indistinguishable sameness, deciding everything will be shared between them. ‘individualism,’ Sada writes, ‘is nothing but amorphous vanity,’ so they continue this pact even when one begins to date a man, Oscar, ‘deceiving him, not out of treachery but rather sisterhood.’ It’s a silly scandalous story and that spends most of the prose examining the comic proportions of their sameness and status in the town due to their quirkiness.‘They were like two excessively celebrated actresses whose eccentricities people find a way to forgive. What would be seen as a defect in anybody else was in them a mere peculiarity.’To avoid the townsfolk sticking their noses in and ruining the game, they put up a sign that becomes stuff of local legend: We are busy professionals. Restrict your conversation to the business at hand. Please do not disturb us for no reason. Sincerely: The Gamal Sisters. Naturally, affections for a third party throw unity awry, and it all becomes a fun little romp, exploring ideas of multiple lives attempting complete congruence and how this affects issues of fairness, jealousy, and is otherwises tested by human emotions. Is their sameness a sense of freedom, and they once thought, or a curse, and is there a way to grow uniquely instead of similarly as they enter older age.‘Because in the long run, love would cease to be what dreams dictate and turn instead into insipid bread, intrepid monotony, and in the end and forevermore: subjugated love.’A low-stakes tale that comes alive as local gossip, One Out of Two is a pleasant enough novel that takes its time enjoying itself. It makes insightful symbolism out of sewing and bean sorting and the imagery really dazzles. The translation is lovely, and while it cannot ever retain the full meter and lyricism of the original, it still manages to deliver a bouncing and buoyant prose that dances in your mind. It never quite has enough grit to really grip you, but it successfully charms and doesn’t overstay its welcome. A nice little book, I’ll certainly want to be reading more Daniel Sada.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,0,81,1,"Apr 06, 2023","Apr 06, 2023","Apr 06, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/23637528-one-out-of-two

Eliot, ‘not with a bang but a whimper.’ Unfortunately this is how the end feels for volume 2 of The Nice House on the Lake even despite an actual bang! ripping through the narrative (okay, actually a “blam!” but you get the idea). It’s a wildly inventive and complex sci-fi horror though it often feels like there are too many moving parts to balance out and the plot during this second volume feels like it’s searching for a way toward the ending as much as the characters are. It is visually stunning and seems ripe for a live action adaptation, which honestly might be a better medium as the text-heavy frames can get a bit cumbersome and here it is sometimes a bit tricky to keep the characters straight. Though this falters much in the way a tv series often does by needing to fill more space than the plot requires so it occasionally feels either overstuffed or floundering along certain character plot lines to fill time while other ones play out. But also, despite the claim it was only going to be a 12 issue story, it doesn’t actually end and will continue on for another season likely since it is rather profitable. Still, this has a lot of thrills and chills and it is impossible to put down as we watch the characters being manipulated while struggling to understand the reality they are trapped in.  [image] The story doesn’t definitively end but mostly reveals major secrets, wrap up some primary threads, and then wiggle it’s way out from under a conclusion with the aim of starting another story arc. Which is fine, it’s a fun world to explore but it’s also a bit frustrating as there is a lot of great potential and amazing elements that feel dulled by the need to continuously draw it out. The first half feels like it loses a lot of the energy the first volume worked so well to build, with Walter having manipulated the group’s memory in order to now be trapped with them while Nora is locked away for knowing too much. It becomes a lesson that controlling others never works out positively and Walter finds that under his simulated realities the group’s motivations aren’t as easily directed as he’d hoped. Without knowing the world ended or having high stakes, they don’t feel grateful for the haven he built, which is somehow less satisfactory to him than their revulsion and horror at him in the first volume.This is, admittedly, a fun story that has a lot of heart to it. Walter is an interesting character and we really feel his struggle, though still empathize more with the others who we unfortunately only really know in their context to Walter and never quite get to know as themselves much. I do enjoy how much this series is sort of a critique on millennial friend groups and culture, with some wry and subtle digs that amuse me, and the group dynamic really works though sometimes it’s tough to know who is who. Overall I wanted to like this more than I did and despite some pretty mind blowing ideas and explanations, I think this is where I’ll drop out of the series while still very eager to read his other works, particularly continuing Something is Killing the Children. Not a bad series, but the cumbersome and clunky aspects can drag the otherwise imaginative and creepy fun.2.5/5...more",Notes are private!,0,56,1,Apr 2023,Apr 2023,"Apr 01, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/61022102-the-nice-house-on-the-lake-vol-2

To suck blood? No, her friend replied, to walk in sunlight. Fledgling by Octavia BWhat do vampires want most, Octavia Butler was asked by her friend. To suck blood? No, her friend replied, to walk in sunlight. Fledgling by Octavia Butler provides a solution for these vampiric woes, inspired by her friend’s question and written during an escape from the grit and darkness she had to occupy while writing the Earthseed books (the first, Parable of the Sower is an absolute knock-out of a novel). One of only two stand-alone novels—though her notes show an intention to have written more—Fledgling is playfully subversive in its approach to themes like racism and free-will, while defying expectations and denying the readymade lore around vampires. It is classic Butler in the form of a vampire novel. It all begins with a rebirth: Shori awakens wounded in a cave without any memory of her past and must learn to navigate the society of the vampires (the Ina) while tending her flock of humans made obedient by sucking their blood (symbionts) and resisting the violence against her by other vampire families. Will she continue the legacy and traditions of her people? Who has murdered her family and why do they want to stop her? These questions and more drive the novel alongside Butler’s fascinating worldbuilding, though it can get fairly exposition heavy and the dialogue occasionally feels rather stilted. Still, Fledgling is a fun, imaginative story with important undercurrents that bestows a fresh vampire to the genre who is both a woman and Black while grappling with issues both historic and current around the social struggles of this intersectional identity. Fledgling is as much a thriller and vampire mystery as it is a book of ethical questions. We have Shori with superhuman powers, genetically altered, fighting against an unknown enemy that has massacred her family while also having to learn about her own society all over again without having her memory. It is a lot of fun at times, with super speed, healing powers, and a super sense of smell (though this felt a bit eye rolling at times, such as her smelling a helicopter before she could hear it or smelling week-old gunfire through the smoldering ruins of a village…its a big ask even for those willing to suspend disbelief for the sci-fi fun). The story eventually becomes a court room drama of sorts, with a massive vampire trial where the jury must hold powerful families with important legacies accountable while further murders are taking place during the trial like some sort of gothic John Grisham novel. It’s a fun read, and while some of it didn’t quite land for me, it does hit it’s marks in terms of thematic intent.‘That is the most unromantic declaration of love I've ever heard. Or is that what you're saying? Do you love me, Shori, or do I just taste good?’Butler has a knack for subverting expectations and genre tropes. There are really insightful themes here, cleverly folded into the worldbuilding while still speaking directly to our own reality. Most predominantly here we see her evade the readymade vampire world, creating her own lore such as long lives instead undead, an ability to heal themselves and being a genetic species instead of biting folks to create more. Theres a humorous approach here, with Wright (the first person Shori encounters who takes her in) finding all his internet research on vampires to be fairly useless and when Shori touches a crucifix with no results he says ‘well there goes that theory.’ What I really enjoy here is the way Shori being Black is sort of a superpower, allowing her to be in the sun when other Ina cannot. There are interesting reversals of power here, with Shori as a Black girl appearing to be around the age of 10 having power over the white adults, such as 23 year old Wright who is her primary sexual partner after first discovering her naked and confused beside the road in the start of the book. Butler aims for discomfort with sex scenes involving what appears to be a child (and while she is still not fully mature in her own species is significantly older than Wright), and even though the power imbalance is inverted it still recalls horrors of slavery where young slave girls were sexually assaulted by the adult overseers. ‘She’s shown herself to be a weirdly ethical little thing most of the time.’In Fledgling, a vampire’s bite does not kill or turn the victim, but instead gives the vampire nourishment while the act itself gives an intensely satisfying feeling to the bitten, something hinted to be a nearly-sexual gratification, that brings them under her power in a symbiotic relationship (thus these humans are referred to as symbionts). It brings up a lot of questions about free will such as if these symbionts truly have agency over their decisions to remain with the Ina they serve and even commune communities like the Gordon’s might only give the impression of equality while still being a master/slave hierarchy beneath the clever marketing. Couple this with the fact that the symbionts are also used for sexual practice until an Ina is able to mate with one of their own and this seems…well ethically questionable to say the least (meanwhile Wright is concerned about possible pedophilia with his irresistible eroticism towards what appears to be a 10 year old, like I said, Butler wants to make you cringe and does so successfully). Much of this novel feels referential to the Antebellum South, and the dynamics with the symbionts reminds me of the ways people used to try to paint the relationship between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings as consensual love when she was still quite literally a slave owned by him. Butler nudges topics like this in many ways, interestingly enough in a situation where it is the Black “child” having ownership over white adults. Yet this also is used to explore ideas of families, too. All in all, it is a fascinating society Butler creates, one I wish could have been explored in more depth (a historian promises Shori a deep dive that never happens on page) but I suppose this was intended to be fleshed out more in further stories that unfortunately never appeared due to Butler’s unfortunate early death at 58 during the prime of her writing career.‘If we found the people who had murdered both my male and female families, I wanted to kill them, had to kill them. How else could I keep my new family safe?’Racism is also constantly present throughout Fledgling, with a sort of speciesism being a metaphor for it but also found hiding behind facades of classism as well. The latter aspect is a sullen reminder for the ways race and class are often tied. While Shori seems to serve as a bridge between many communities—vampire and human as well as race—it is her genetic altering that made her Black for which she is targeted by those who want to retain a “purity” in the vampire line. It is literally white supremacy from many Ina with their ‘grotesquely albino’ skin color. And, like in our own societies, we see how many Ina see this going on and some actively participate in the violence, some look the other way, and a few stand-up at their own peril. It becomes a big issue during the trial (which like, for a big trial over murder they sure just let people come and go as they please) portion of the book, as well as the ethics behind using symbionts for murder like creating tiny proxy-wars with them. I really do enjoy a lot of the ideas behind this book and many I wished could have been explored even greater. It starts off as a pretty fast-paced novel but begins to really lag in the second half, particularly during the trial. This section is very dialogue heavy, which is cool and explores a lot of the world but unfortunately much of the dialogue felt a bit stilted. It is serviceable to the plot but sometimes just felt very flat. Also I found there to be a void of tension in areas that could have really provided a good grit to the story, such as how Wright just…instantly accepts Shori is a vampire and goes with it. Everyone seems to just agree and go along far too simply in this book (partly due to Shori’s influence from the bites), though this was something I noticed as well in Kindred where the boyfriend immediately is all believing she is time traveling without her even having to try much to convince him. The ending feels a bit flat, though at the same time it seems to be the right way to end the story, I guess I just came away wanting more having seen Butler display far better writing and snappier plots in other novels. Which isn’t to say Fledgling is a bad book, and there are many ways in which Butler can really affect the reader.Racism is a gross and unfortunate evil and Butler very cleverly addresses it even in the vampire world of Fledgling, a book that thrives on some excellent subversive approaches to its ideas. Anyone looking for a unique take on the genre will certainly enjoy this, as Butler’s imagination shines bright here as in all her works. Not my favorite I’ve read by her but still an exciting novel all the same.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,0,135,1,"Mar 31, 2023","Mar 31, 2023","Mar 31, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60568491-fledgling

When the closest of Walter’s friends from his various friend’s circles through his life all come together for a weekend getaway in a gorgeous lakefront mansion, this question never even crossed their minds…Until it happens. The Nice House on the Lake from writer and artist duo James Tynion IV and Werther Dell'Edera (of Something is Killing the Children fame) is a tense horror survival graphic novel across two volumes (this first one collects issues 1-6) as a household of people must face the end of the world and their own slipping sanity in a house that may be either a haven or twisted prison. The artwork is stunning and gritty, though the frames are very text-heavy and the plot plods forward through the gloomy tone, though there are plenty of big reveals and endlessly growing tension to keep it gripping enough (having just come off their other series this felt a bit flat in comparison). With elements of sci-fi and horror, and a simulated-multimedia approach with transcripts, chat logs, emails and notebooks to aid the story, this is a big visual thrillride that could use a bit of a push but is enjoyable in all the density of backstory and though the number of characters (shoutout for queer and trans rep) can get a bit cumbersome they are all juggled pretty successfully. Who, and maybe more importantly what is Walter, how are they trapped in the house and is there a way out, what is happening outside the world and what are these strange puzzles are all questions that drive this story through its chilling twists and turns.  [image]Something I enjoy about James Tynion IV is he aims to be very unsettling and hits you were it hurts, such as knowing everyone you’ve ever known or loved died in an absolutely horrific and gruesome apocalypse (Anderson Cooper gets singled out as someone who literally melts on live tv). In both series of his I’ve read now the art does not shirk away from depicting the most horrible things you can image. Like this:(view spoiler)[[image]Yup. (hide spoiler)]Coming out in 2021, it was interesting to see the pandemic briefly alluded to, though reading it in 2023 it was difficult to not compare the opening of the book to the film Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery as both have an extremely similar, mysterious set-up (and oddly both have someone working on a Democratic Party campaign). There are A LOT of characters, but this guide came in handy:  [image]This was interesting to read directly after plowing through three volumes of Something is Killing… in a weekend. The two are quite different in tone, while both being horror, and this one is less fun and boisterous but more atmospheric and tense. While the art is fantastic in both, I prefer his art style in Something and this one can sometimes be hard to tell characters apart but also things being fairly obscured is part of the intent. Walter is very similar to the boy in the first arc of Something, and not just that both are drawn fairly similar with their big glasses you never see through but both have an element where in high school they were encouraged to ask their best friend to be their boyfriend, were rejected, and still maintain a friendship that is making them awkward. Comparatively though, this one felt a big of a slog, starting strong and ending strong, but sort of languishing in the middle (though Dave being goofy is pretty charming). Each issue being told in what appears to be a present set decently into the future where they all seem like battle hardened dystopia vets leads me to think this is only going to get epic.There are a lot of questions to unravel still, like if their code names and symbols mean anything, what is the house exactly and if the world can be saved, and I suspect it is too early to really “rate” the series but I am having a lot of fun. If he can stick the landing I bet I will love this and overlook my few critiques, I just hope it doesn’t fall apart. It’s pretty high stakes and I am hooked though not as much as his other series.

The Greek myths are some of the most lasting tales—often because the stories contain themes that still ring true today as social metaphors—though, as Natalie Hayne’s novel Stone Blind observes, how much of the tales of great heroes are sanitized towards glory due to their status as victors over what we’ve been told are monsters. ‘This particular monster is assaulted, abused and vilified. And yet, as the story is always told, she is the one you should fear,’ write Haynes at the start of the novel, drawing the tale of Medusa to the center of the narrative, ‘We’ll see about that.’ Told through an assortment of narrators such as humans, gods and even inanimate objects, Haynes deftly reconfigures a variety of Greek myths into one long and multi-faceted story with Medusa acting like a center of gravity pulling the disparate tales into a contextual orbit. Though, for a book about Medusa, we find her only minimally present, focusing more on the voices and actions of those around her—most notably Perseus and Athene—and how they act upon her as if it were a meta-narrative expression on how someone is pushed aside and othered even in their own story. Like trying to tell about your day to a group of louder people who are less listening and more waiting for a moment to interject and tell about themselves and manufacturing relevance. Written with great humor, wry wit and sharp insights, Hayne’s Stone Blind is an engaging retelling that functions as internal commentary on the original tales that readers will certainly connect to social discussions of the present day and reminds us why the Greek myths have lived on in relevance for centuries. ‘And the monster? Who is she? She is what happens when someone cannot be saved.’I had a blast with this novel, which was longlisted for the 2023 Women’s Prize and truly stands out even during a time when the market seems saturated with myth retellings. I’d like to thank Andrea for her incredible  that had me racing to the shelves to pick this one up. Hayne’s extensive experience in the world of comedy really helps this story shine. She has performed stand-up, been a regular guest on BBC comedy shows and even has her own podcast, Natalie Haynes Stands Up for the Classics and her sense of humor combined with extensive knowledge of the myths maks for a delighftul read with snarky, snappy dialogue (I love Hera berating Zeus) and sardonic charm that keeps the story emotionally buoyant even in the darkest moments. Unpopular opinion alert but I think I prefer her to Madeline Miller, which isn’t a slight on Miller who I find fantastic and can write soaringly gorgeous sentences but there is just such a jubilant upholstery to this story and a wide-reaching scope of tales that I was utterly enamored the whole way through. But first, let’s talk about Medusa as a symbol for a moment.‘Who decides what is a monster?’ ‘I don’t know,’ said Medusa. ‘Men, I suppose.’I was apprehensive at first as the tale of Medusa is much beloved and she has become such a multi-dimensional symbol that has morphed through the ages, but Haynes manages to be a worthwhile and insightful addition to the Medusa commentary that feels fresh, fun and faithful to the spirit of her source material (much of the tales here are adaptations of Ovid’s Metamorphoses and, sorry Pegasus fans, but the winged horse is absent from this tale). Medusa, a name that became synonymous with monster, has been depicted in history both as a hideous beast and a great beauty even with her snake hair and lethal gaze. As is common with the myths, multiple versions exist and key figures can take on different meanings (Joseph Campbell has even postulated the story of Perseus beheading Medusa is a quasi-historical metaphor of an actual invasion). With myths we often have archetypal analysis, such as Sigmund Freud who wrote in his posthumously published Das Medusenhaupt (Medusa's Head) that beheading equated to castration and ‘the terror of Medusa is thus a terror of castration that is linked to the sight of something…the female genitals, probably those of an adult, surrounded by hair, and essentially those of his mother.’ As one expects with Freud, the turning of men into stone is an erection metaphor in his eyes and he thus interprets Medusa as secondary in her own story to center men.‘In Western culture, strong women have historically been imagined as threats requiring male conquest and control, and Medusa herself has long been the go-to figure for those seeking to demonize female authority.’- Elizabeth Johnston, The Original ‘Nasty Woman’Medusa has since been reclaimed as a feminist symbol, particularly one of women’s rage and associated with pushing back against toxic masculinity and sexual assault. Athene punished Medusa for having been raped by Poseidon under a statue of Athene, which has always felt quite wrong even with the excuse that she couldn’t punish Posioden and took it out on Medusa (there are many essays on internalized misogyny that cite this tale, as you can imagine). Following the depictions of Medusa as a monster came images that symbolized her as a sort of femme fatale, though we still see Medusa as an object pursued by men and her head as a weapon to be used by men. As a rebuttal to Freud, and as commentary on how Medusa is objectified, acted upon, never given her own agency, Hélène Cixous writes in The Laugh of the Medusa that ‘A woman without a body, dumb, blind…is reduced to being the servant of the militant male, his shadow.’ 20th century looks at Medusa have addressed the issue of how a beautiful woman will be objectified, and woman with rightful anger is considered a monster. It is no surprise she has become a symbol of rage against the patriarchy, such as the head of Medusa in Stone Blind saying ‘I feel like becoming the monster he made.’‘Men will tell you that Gorgons are monsters, but men are fools. They cannot comprehend any beauty beyond what they can see. And what they see is a tiny part of what there is.’While she is a small part of the story, the Medusa aspects speak volumes about these issues. We have Perseus, who is given a delightfully unflattering depiction in this novel, who ‘ thinks anyone who is not like him is a monster…and any monster needs killing.’ Though Haynes gives us a very different look at Medusa and the Gorgon, showing a loving family of sisters who raise Medusa from infancy and care for one another. Perhaps the heart of the novel rests in conversation between Perseus, Hermes and Athene (who resent having to aid him in his quest and find him to be insufferable):‘Why would anyone love a monster?' asked Perseus.'Who are you to decide who is worthy of love?' said Hermes.'I mean, I wasn't...''And who are you to decide who is a monster?' added the messenger god.The novel also asks the question ‘Can a monster be beautiful if it is still terrifying?’ offering the possible answer that ‘perhaps it depends on how you experience fear and judge beauty.’ We see Medusa as kind, suffering bravely and refusing to use her lethal gaze because she would never want to harm a living thing.‘Would it kill you to be sympathetic about someone who isn't as fortunate as you are? Would it?’ There is the irony that of all the characters the one considered the monster is perhaps the most loving and kind, especially in juxtaposition with the gods who are shown as cruel, callous, and only concerned about themselves. We see them looking down on mortals as ‘a bad of meat…useless,’ and ‘so prone to anxiety and haste.’ They use mortals for whatever they want, sex, war, entertainment, etc. and care nothing for them. Even time is meaningless to them and this remove from the feelings and finite lives of mortals makes them unable to truly care about anything. Though my favorite passage of the book is the Nereids ranting about the irresponsible behavior of mortals: ‘Mortals have a word for this kind of arrogance…the word is hubris. And while I am al in favour of using precision to describe something, might I suggest that you would be better off not doing something so dangerous so often that you need a specific wordfor it? Perhaps develop your self-control, rather than your vocabulary.’Of all the characters, however, Perseus is the most monstrous. Depicted as ‘extraordinarily petty,’ as a ‘coward’ who ‘doesn’t learn anything. He takes easy shortcuts whenever they’re offered and gives up when they aren’t’ and his entire hero story is one the gods made happen for him and all he did was develop a taste for senseless murder and cruelty. ‘He saw Medusa as a monster and he sees Stenno and Euryale as the same,’ we are told, showing how his prejudices make him more a monster than the one he murders without much justification, ‘all he hears is danger from this creature that wishes him harm. He doesn't hear sorrow or loss.’ And if the argument he is doing it all to protect his mother is to be made, Cassiope points out he abandoned his mother’s needs the moment he heard a lovely woman crying out in help. He only cares about what gives him glory. And if there is a tendency towards glorifying Perseus in tellings of the myth it may be a good example of what Kate Manne terms himpathy: ‘ the excessive sympathy shown toward male perpetrators’ especially at the expense of women. This undue preference is what helps gatekeep and uphold patriarchy by policing the actions of women while giving abusive men a pass. ‘Perseus…has no interest in the well being of any creature if it impedes his desire to do whatever he wants. He is a vicious little thug and the sooner you grasp that, and stop thinking of him as a brave boy hero, the closer you’ll be to understanding what actually happened.’Which is all uproarious fun here and he is quite easy to hate. Literally everyone in the book does, except maybe his father, Zeus, though Zeus can’t even remember his name and only appreciates him for the glory his actions bestow on Zeus by proxy. Plus we have the whole aspect that his deed was cowardly, beheading the weakest of the Gorgons while she was sleeping. ‘He will try to claim there was a battle,’ we are told, ‘but there is no battle to be had between an armed man and a sleeping girl. Don’t forget’Though outside of the Medusa story this book is also a wild ride. We have so many tales coming together as if parts of a giant puzzle and we see how hard feelings and betrayals carry over from one tale to the next. We get the story of Andromeda, the funny moments of an axe splitting Zeus’ head to birth Athene, the story of Hephaestus, the contest between Athene and Poseidon over patronage of Athens and so much more. It is a blissful trip through myths told in such an infectiously readable way. And I adore the variety of voices that tell the stories, most of them in a rather snarky fashion. There are some fun ones, like the head of Medusa insisting on being the more reliable narrator ‘because I am not a lying deceitful hateful vicious murderer,’ the Athens contest told in braggadocio by an Olive tree, or even a reed formed as the first flute by Athene to recreate the shriek made by the Gogron Euryale when finding Medusa’s murder. This is such a fun book that feels like a giant epic despite being an actually pretty quick read.‘No one could help being afraid of something. And being afraid of dying must be especially awful, because there was no hope of avoiding it.’I found Stone Blind to be a fantastic journey through Greek mythology with a lot of important insights and commentary. It also happens to be a humorous and endlessly engaging telling that combines many stories to give a wonderfully vast look at the characters and their actions. Haynes is a joy to read and Stone Blind is a new favorite of mine to recommend for those looking for a good myth retelling. But above all, it is a good reminder to be wary of what we call monsters and question who it really gives power to and why. And then wonder why, in all this, it is not Perseus who is called the real monster. This is a brilliant recontextualization of Medusa and Perseus full of heart and wit.4.5/5‘Come on.

You are charged with a human life, first helpless and pure, which can be a daunting task. Looking at the world around you and the amalgamation of daily headlines full of terror, trauma and tragedy, the care and keeping of a child you hope to usher into the world with grace and understanding seems especially frightening, not to mention the existential questions about having brought someone into this world seemingly so full of sorrow. This is precisely what Clint Smith captures so harrowingly true in his new poetry collection Above Ground, juxtaposing the tenderness and trials of parenthood with the chaos of the world around us. Opening with adorable epigraphs from his two children about wanting to be the sun or a ladybug, we move through gorgeously poetic expressions of the thankfulness for the sweet ‘ moments that I know I’ll miss / when they are gone,’ with family legacy and tradition, the happy and sad moments, all melting your heart without ever becoming saccharine and still feeling the weight of the world closing in around you. Here in his second collection, and following his non-fiction work in How the Word Is Passed: A Reckoning with the History of Slavery Across America, Smith reads as a confident poet with an acute sense of social struggles both historical and current and presents—almost as if responding to a child’s questions about where do we come from and what will become of us—and delivers an image of modern parenthood that many will recognize and with which anyone can empathize. ‘We spend lifetimes looking at history to findthe most extraordinary things, when sometimesthey are right in front of us.’Everyone hears about how much it changes you, your prioritizes, your thoughts and worries, and all the other cliches parents talk about and before it happens to you its easy to dismiss that. But if it you do become a parent, you realize that these things are often true, but usually in a way that seeps into you and seems ineffable. Luckily we have poetry, a wonderful way to still definite the shape these elusive feelings and there are so many moments here where I thought “yes, Clint Smith, wow, yes thats it exactly. I love his poem about discussing poetry with his child, telling them poetry is in them and ‘searching for something to tell you / that you are what you have always been to me.’ There were many moments here where I’d smile and nod, knowing all too well what he is saying. Like this one:Ode to Those First Fifteen Minutes After the Kids Are Finally AsleepPraise the couch that welcomes you back into its embraceas it does every night around this time. Praise the loosecereal that crunches beneath your weight, the whole-graingolden dust that now shimmers on the backside of your pants.Praise the cushion, the one in the middle that sinks like a lifeboatleaking air, and the ottoman covered in crayon stains that youhave now accepted as aesthetic. Praise your knees, and the eveningrespite they receive from a day of choo-choo-training along the carpetwith two eager passengers in tow. Praise the silence, oh the silence,how it washes over you like a warm bedsheet. Praise the wallsfor the way they stand there and don't ask for anything.Praise the seduction of slumber that tiptoes across your eyelids,the way it tempts you to curl up right there and drift awayeven though it's only 7:30 p.m. Praise the phone you scroll throughwithout even realizing that you're scrolling, praise the videoyou scroll past of the man teaching his dog how to dance merengue,praise the way it makes you laugh the way someone laughswhen they are so tired they don't know if they will ever standup again. Praise the toys scattered across the floor, and the way youwonder if it might be okay to just leave them there for now,since you know tomorrow they will end up there again.Above Ground presents modern parenthood in such gloriously accurate and probing ways, keeping one eye on the kids and another on the horizon for the dangers lurking everywhere. The opening poem, All at Once, represents this so well, sending us through a spiral of threats (war, climate change, funerals, fires) an other news with moments like ‘a child takes their first steps and tumbles into a father’s arm.’ It is a reminder of what we face in daily life, the good and the bad, pondering how ‘the river that gives us water to drink is the same one that might wash us away.’ Which is what works so well in this collection, how poems of parenting like zoom preschool, accepting a leaf as a precious gift because it looks ‘like a star’, childhood fascinations with dinosaurs or space, or going to the beach can juxtaposed on the page with poems like The New York Times Reports That 200 Civilians Have Just Been Killed by U.S. Military Air Strikes, or poems on the lasting trauma of slavery. ‘The soft hum of history spinsOn its tilted axis. A cavalcade of ghost shipsWash their hands of all they carried.’The past is always still lingering in the present here, with family legacy always nearby. They appear when least expected too. A conversation about the ossicones on the head of a giraffe, his child’s favorite animal for the day and that they ‘don’t do much of anything but exist / as an heirloom passed down from ancestors’ brings us to all ponder all ‘the things that continue to make us / who we are long after / they have served our purpose.’ Poems like Roots explores seeing a grandfather in the mannerisms of a child, or Across Generations explores hoping to end generational trauma, ‘of men attempting / to unlearn the anger of their father’s / tongues, the heat in their hands.’ Family is presented as the whole spectrum of ancestors and future generations:‘When I look at you, it’s like I am seeing everythingthat came before, all the people I lovewho once lived but who are no longer living,all of the history that has brought you here to me.’The movement of history is constantly felt in Smith’s poetry, with the legacy of slavery, or even more recent struggles and dangers to Black lives, with Colin Kaepernick making an appearance in a poem. There is the movement of people, by slave ship, by diaspora, and even a poem on Pangea where the stanzas look like the plates moving away from each other (Smith occasionally uses inventive forms, like the Pangea poem or a poem about a Black boy executed in the electric chair written to form the shape of a chair). Though this collection is not all gloom and trauma, and is, ultimately, hopeful. The connections of the past are also shown in the connection he feels with his children, their dreams his dreams, their pains and fears also his:‘You, little one, are not attached to my body,you are neither a limb nor a slice of skin,but you are part of me in ways I am stilldiscovering, and when you are hurt, I feelyour distress spread through every cell in me.I experience your wounds as if they were my own’While this collection is from Clint Smith’s perspective and centers fatherhood for the most part, he does not erase or downplay his wife’s importance, which was quite lovely to see. I especially liked the poem Gold Stars where he discusses how ‘it’s not that I don’t want people to tell me // I’m doing a good job it's just that I’m praised for the sorts / of things no one ever thanks my wife for.’ Which is a real thing for sure. There was a few years where I was a single parent of a young child, which is a lot of living constantly in survival mode especially when you don’t have much disposable income and are working multiple jobs. But I noticed this often, all the smiles and praise to just be a dad out with a young girl doing normal things or having fun, as if it was some success story to not be a shitty dad while single mothers, on the other hand, get intense scrutiny, criticism and scorn from society at every turn. It made me start to notice things even in friends that really bothered me, like when a man says they are ‘on babysitter duty’ when its literally just watching the kids like a dad should do. Or how often divorced dads are the “fun” parent while the mom takes the bulk of the work. Dr. Kate Manne's essay collection Entitled: How Male Privilege Hurts Women has a really insightful chapter on this and the way women’s domestic labor is often invisible to society despite higher demands on it. I’m glad Clint Smith addresses this because the inequity around parenting is staggering. Above Ground is a really lovely collection that straddles the personal with a larger scope of society and history. Clint Smith writes in very straightforward but affecting prose that navigates parenthood is such a charming and familiar way, steering the reader through the tumultuousness of society and struggles before nestling us down into bed, his words like a lullaby helping us feel soft and warm in the tenderness of his poetry. I’ll leave you with one of the best poems I’ve read so far this year.5/5What People Say“We Have Made It Through Worse Before”all I hear is the wind slapping against the gravestonesof those who did not make it, those who did notsurvive to see the confetti fall from the sky, those whodid not live to watch the parade roll down the street.I have grown accustomed to a lifetime of aphorismsmeant to assuage my fears, pithy sayings meant toconvey that everything ends up fine in the end.

Get ready, this is a The long, arduous history of how the Statue of Liberty came to be is one of my favorite bizarre and comical art history stories. Get ready, this is a wild ride:So we always hear about how it was some gift to the US from France as a peace offering, but this is a stretch and in fact nobody even really wanted it at first. The artist, Frédéric-Auguste Bartholdi, was really into Egyptian pyramids and had this idea that he, too, would create a lasting work of art to put him in the history books with the Wonders of the World. So he cornered the Khedive—leader of Egypt—at the 1867 World Fair in Paris and told him the idea. Egypt was not interested and said “nah, man, we already spent too much on this canal” Upset and unsure what to do, a friend of his said that Americans have some historical moments coming up (anniversary of the Revolution) and they’ll buy anything. So he did a pretty basic reworking of the original design, made the statue the likeness of his mother, changed the name from “Egypt Carrying the Light to Asia” to “Liberty Enlightening the World” and brought that to America in 1871.Bartholdi traveled the country pitching his idea but nobody cared, so he went back to France and started on it anyway with his friend Edouard de Laboulaye who pitched the idea of making it a French American monument as some vague unity statement. Laboulaye was really into the history of the American Civil War and wanted to commemorate emancipation as a blatant insult to the Confederates who he openly insulted in his letters, so in 1875 he pitched the idea to the French government and raised $250,000 to begin. The idea was they’d make the statue and then con the US into funding the base for it when they’d inevitably just dump the statue here and say “you’re welcome, now display my unsolicited art!”. Legendary move, I respect that.  [image]Construction of the project over timeIn 1876 they brought the right hand with the torch to Philadelphia to build excitement for the project (because they were short on money). Once again, nobody cared. New Yorkers were all “what the hell is this!? We don’t want this.” and Bartholdi was like “I’m not paying to take this home, I’ll just leave it in Philly and when the project is done they will get it. It’s going to be the next Wonder of the World and you’ll be sorry!” New Yorkers hated the idea of Philly one upping them so they resignedly took the torch to Madison Square and hoped for the best.  [image]Now that they were stuck with part of a statue they didn’t want, Bartholdi informed New York he was out of money and they’d need to raise some so he could finish (clever, right?). So NYC started trying to raise money, selling miniature figurines of what they assumed the final product would look like. Poet Emma Lazarus wrote “The New Colossus,” and read it at a fundraising art exhibition in 1883, her words would then become the famous words on the statue two decades later. But they still didn’t raise enough.There was actually a fair amount of resistance to the project in the US. The primary reason against it was that the US was weary of France, still fresh off their revolution. The wealthy thought an icon from France that represented a “peasant woman” would inspire the working class to overthrow their oppressors like in France. But also Religious leaders spoke out against it as pagan imagery and that women should not be idolized (my eyes can’t roll hard enough). Basically, the people with the money to fund it were not interested.Here comes a really wild part. When they ran out of funds in 1884, Joseph Pulitzer—famous newspaper guy—was like “you need money, I need to sell newspapers, I got an idea”. On March 16, 1885 he published an ad marketing it as a working class struggle and that if anyone donated ANY sum to the project, their name would appear in his newspaper:’It is not a gift from the millionaires of France to the millionaires of America, but a gift of the whole people of France to the whole people of America.’125,000 people donated, most $1 or less, and raised $100,000 in 5 months. All of these people then subscribed to his newspaper to see their name, making him the most successful newspaper at the time [see also: a socialist pastor invented the Pledge of Allegiance as a marketing campaign to sell newspapers in 1891.]  [image]Finally the statue came to the US in 1885 in 350 pieces. The Women’s Suffrage Movement >protested the unveiling, rightfully pointing out it was an insult to have a statue of a woman represent liberty in a country that didn’t allow women the Right to vote. Bartholdi’s daughter was one of only two women in attendance for the ceremony while protestors drowned out the President’s speech and threw trash at the crowd. There was supposed to be a parade of boats so the Suffragists chartered a boat and crashed it into the procession, then held up banners condemning the statue.   [image]The statue is still a center of protests, such as Therese Patricia Okoumou climbing the statue on the 4th of July, 2018 to protest the cruel separation of migrant families by ICEBut this story still gets even better. Nobody knew what to do with the statue. Ulysses S Grant tried to turn it into a lighthouse, very much against the wishes of Bartholdi. The bulb wasn’t strong enough to see it, so that was scrapped. Then Thomas Edison wanted to put a giant phonograph in the head and make the mouth open at a certain time of day to deliver “patriotic messages”. Once again Bartholdi was annoyed and embarrassed and luckily this super creepy idea never happened. When the copper turned green he wanted to fix it up but New York was like “nah we like it green.” After this he gave up on having anything else to do with the statue. Later, the US would build a small replica and give it to France as a “thank you.” France said “why would we want this?” and stuck it in the middle of the Seine where it still sits.

Ellis Island from French author, filmmaker and Oulipo member George Perecs (translated here by Harry Mathews) is a hybrid text ‘attempting to give palpable form / to what those sixteen million individual stories were’ and its lasting legacy as what he calls ‘the ultimate place of exile.’ Through prose, poetry, lists, data and literary quotations, Perec’s constructs a piercing gaze at this ‘non-place’ where millions arrived after grueling journeys to go from ‘emigrants into immigrants.’ My own family passed through here, leaving Poland as the Piatkiewicz family and reemerging as Penkevich like many of the examples of names being changed at whim Perec describes.

It’s a quick read at just over 50 pages followed by an equally impressive afterword by Mónica de la Torre for the 2021 reissue. She provides an interesting history of the book, written in conjunction with a documentary Perec worked on about Ellis Island and featured much of this text as a voice-over narration, as well as tying this history of immigration to issues surrounding it in the present during the COVID pandemic. ‘Why are we telling these / stories? what did we come / here to find? what did we / come here to ask?’ Perec writes, examining the island in a state of ruin as people began to convert it into a tourist location, and how the legacy is converted into a different experience for the new and future generations.‘What had been for the others a placeof trials and uncertainties has become for them a placeof recollection, a pivot of the connections that identifythem with their history.We learn the long history of the island, going from military fort to an immigration center with light restrictions (2% of people were turned away, which is still a lot of lives) that overtime increased with literacy tests and other exclusionary laws before eventually—in what feels very much indicative of the US—being converted into a detention center for a while. He also observes how this “golden door” was not the dreamland promised with many immigrants facing harsh xenophobia, low wages and poor housing opportunities, saying they learned quickly the streets they heard had been paved with gold were not for them to travel upon but only labor through the bricklaying. ‘The point is not to have pity, but understanding,’ Perec writes, and he delivers his examination with great power and empathy, exploring the past and these people’s lives, and it makes for a very moving read.  [image]‘ we were sure of having resoundingly evokedthe two words that lie at the very heart of this long venture:two intangible, precarious, weak, fugitive words that keependlessly refracting each other’s wavering light and whosenamesare wandering and hope.’Ellis Island from Perec is a great little book in a beautiful reissue, and a highly recommended little look at history. It is a great reminder that the United States is made up of people from all over and will (and should) continue to be so, and that the complaints that people need to “come in legally” like “their ancestors did” is not anywhere close of a one-to-one comparison of immigration restrictions now and the time of Ellis Island.

This gore galore horror fest is so packed with tension and intrigue that you won’t care that it keeps you up at night because you’ll be wanting that time to keep reading anyways. Not for the faint of heart, but certainly for those who love a good scare or an awesome heroine who is eternally over everyone’s shit. The children of Archer’s Peak, Wisconsin are going missing, or being found is mass killings horrifically dismembered, and nobody seems to know what is going on. Or ever care that much. Enter Erica Slaughter, a mysterious woman with insight and a plan. This is the first volume of the ongoing, Eisner Award Winning series from James Tynion IV and stunningly illustrated by Werther Dell'Edera and a lot happens here. It will ultimately leave you with more questions than answers as it sets up the series—and the answers you do get only lead to larger questions and greater terrors—and this is an unsettling thrillride of monsters, murder and fun.I went into this expecting monster horror and that is exactly what I received, and though the aspect of a monster hunter connected to some strange secret (and possibly alien or supernatural?) organizations wasn’t what I anticipated, I am very eager to find out what is going on here. This only teases a larger story with details like Erica’s talking octopus doll and a mysterious person on the phone and it will certainly make you want to rush right out for the next installment. Erica rules too, always looking about with big eyes that are effectively drawn to imply that she has seen some shit. Like really distressing shit and a lot of it. Which…well, she has!  [image]By the time this is over, you too will have seen some horrifying shit! Get ready! Be advised that the violence in this is pretty much entirely children, which can be extra distressing. The gore is pretty well done, but everything about this is visually stunning. It plays with some classic tropes in creative ways like vigilante justice attempts gone wrong and snarky (half drunk) coroners saying wow yes that is gruesome and is just full of mystery, surprises and interesting characters I’m excited to follow. By the end it turns into some fun action that is more thrills than chills but is certainly building to something complex and exciting I can’t wait to read more....more",Notes are private!,0,96,1,"Mar 25, 2023","Mar 25, 2023","Mar 25, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/52757827-something-is-killing-the-children-vol-1

I mean, children’s fiction and media can be really effective at bestowing a meaningful lesson that doesn’t answer it full but helps you feel good about living with the questions of what it is, so I figured we must at least be almost there. Yet here we are! Something I’ve always enjoyed about existentialism—aside from having been a cool word to use in college to give the impression maybe something useful was bouncing around in my mind (doubtful)—is that it approaches these questions in a highly personal and subjective way and empowers us to see our role in creating meaning around us. What is Existentialism from the great Simone de Beauvoir collects two essays, the titular one (which is only 8pgs long) and her first-published essay, the 1944 Pyrrhus and Cinéas. Much like, what is the meaning of life, turns out what existentialism is can also tough to define. Eschewing a direct answer, something she says she often let people down by denying it could be succinctly summarized, Beauvoir’s first essay focuses on what it isn’t, how to approach and offers helpful signposts towards an answer, while the second dives further into many of the themes that would come to define her work. Together they form a wonderful introduction into ideas of existentialism, examining ideas on how our task is ‘to fashion the world by giving it a meaning,’ as well as the journey to ascribing meaning in a world where our lives our finite and the journey never ending.‘It is possible for man to snatch the world from the darkness of absurdity.’I love Beauvoir, I find her to be really uplifting, inspiring and optimistic, the final one something many find surprising as existentialism often gets mistaken as a rather gloomy outlook. Which is what she contends against in the brief opening essay, examining why there is so much disconcertion and backlash against it during the time of her writing. ‘Symbolic logic, for example, never incited such passionate disputes.’ Part of the misunderstanding, she asserts, is inherent in the error ‘believing that existentialism can be concentrated in one or two immediately efficient, simple expressions.’ She compares it to mathematics or physics theories where it is accessible only to the initiated, and isn’t some pop-psychology trend but built on a long road of philosophical thought that it itself continues. She posits that the way existentialism is so easily expressed through novels and plays as well as theoretical treatises also bothers people and leads them to believe it might not be a philosophy at all.But what is it? She first discusses what it is not, being not a social phenomenon or political movement, not a trick to ‘winning a game,’ and though it has social repercussions it is not a social theory. It is not interior or exterior but: ‘strives to hold both ends of the chain at the same time, surpassing the interior-exterior, subjective-objective opposition. It postulates the value of the individual as the source and reason for being [raison d’être]...yet it admits that the individual has reality only through his engagement in the world. It affirms that the will of free being is sufficient for the accomplishment of freedom, yet it also states that this will can posit itself only by struggling against the obstacles and the oppressions that limit the concrete possibilities of man.’Now that sounds like a speech you’d give to get a sports team worked up to win, but if that sports team was going to write an essay on free will or something. But must critically, she reminds us that good and evil is not a guaranteed, definitive moral code and ‘existentialism rejects the notion of ready-made values whose affirmation precedes human judgement,’ something she would expand upon greatly in The Ethics of Ambiguity.An more in-depth introduction to existenialist thought comes in the second essay, Pyrrhus and Cinéas, which probes questions such as what is the point of anything, something I say at least once a day at work. It begins with the story of the titular characters where, in response to Pyrrhus’ long list of goals (unfortunately goals to colonize people…), Cinéas asks what he will do then. The response, to finally rest, makes Cinéas then question why he doesn’t just rest now instead of going through all the struggles and efforts to arrive at the same thing. While Cinéas is often seen as the wiser, Beauvoir says, she finds Pyrrhus to be an example of authentic living. He sets out to accomplish goals, to have action, and exposes the truth that goals are always continuing, something will always transcend the former goal. ‘The paradox of the human condition is that every end can be surpassed, and yet, the project defines the end as an end,’ she writes. The path to finding meaning is, in its own way, a compass for meaning in itself.‘From the top of the hill I look at the path travelled, and the entire path is present in the joy of my success. The walk gives the rest its worth, and my thirst gives the glass of water its worth. A whole past comes together in the moment of enjoyment.’This is an excellent essay that addresses many themes to be picked up again in The Ethics of Ambiguity and shows Beauvoir first approaching themes that she would elucidate through her entire life. The final section of that book explores the ideas that freedom consists of aiming itself towards freedom, and that we always continue onward, goals always advancing, such as how a painter never 'finishes' art, but continues a conversation forward to the future. Human transcendence has the problem that we can never truly fulfill something, due to our finite lifespan, but play a transitory part in it.Using Candide’s statement that he will simply tend his own garden, we can look at the world as our garden and something we must cultivate and engage with as a way of giving it meaning.She also looks at many other issues on how meaning or ethics can be addressed and for what purpose do we do anything. Under a religious belief, God would determine what is good or bad, and we would be called by God to do things and must, therefore, do them. She brings up Fear and Trembling and The Castle as examples that question this, and the problem how we can determine when the false prophets would also claim to be the messiah. She also looks at issues of violence, and our responsibility to each other. How can we act in a way that enhances freedom, that cultivates our garden. This essay is a good representation of what she says in the first that these aren’t isolated ideas and draw on the works of others, with this drawing examples and arguments from many great minds before her.What is Existentialism? doesn’t have all the answers, but nobody does and that’s half the fun. This does serve as an excellent introduction to existentialism as well as the works of Simone de Beauvoir, who has certainly become my favorite of the group.

No Snagged this at the library because the art is gorgeous, and while non-resolution, surreal tales appeal to me this feels unfortunately half-baked. No pun intended but Celeste does have the vibe of college-years stoner bro headtrip book. Like, this is the sort of book where its college and after the blunt rotation finished and everyone is half-melting into the futon or floor watching Koyaanisqatsi, the guy in a Dead Kennedys shirt who only drinks whiskey neat would carefully pass to you saying “check this fuckin’ shit, my dude” regardless of your gender then make the hand gestures around his head for “mind-blown” while also making that fizzly, explosion noise with his mouth. Which isn’t a criticism, I mean I was there and it was great. And I think I accidentally pocketed your lighter when we split my last Parliament, my bad. It’s a book you watch other people read and prompt discussion, half because you want someone to explain it to you and half because…well, what the hell was that all? Author/artist I.N.J. Culbard pretty solidly fulfills this genre of “what the hell?” with this graphic novel of three separate but vaguely thematically linked plot lines that refuse easy answers but explore ideas of isolation, self-doubt, and other “is this the meaning of life?”-type ideas. By the end as it sort of fades away leaving far more questions than answers—which, admittedly, is kind of awesome and captures the destabilizing effects of the book—it just feels like not enough and rather rushed while also feeling cumbersome for juggling too much and never quite doing one thing well enough.  [image]Three tales, three lives, but not quite a holy trinity of successThis book has a lot of potential and I think there is certainly an audience for it. I probably would have thought this was great at one point, especially how disquieting it is as it forces you to confront some fairly uncomfortable things and leaves you without much closure that could serve as a blanket to comfort your mind. But it just falls short, particularly with the writing in general. The gist is that three people in different parts of the world, after having been “visited” by a purple petal blown on the wind, find themselves suddenly alone in a world where everyone has vanished. One is some sort of government agent, left alone as he receives a distressing call about his wife, another is a young woman on a subway being teased for her albinism, and the third is a punk, Asian man possibly in the process of hanging himself. Each story starts to spin in wild directions when they discover they aren’t fully alone: the maybe-FBI guy finds a kidnapped man in a car trunk who may have murdered his wife, the woman finds another woman and they confront their fears before tearing around town nude and drinking champagne, and the third…well he fights demons with a man that has a birds head (sorry but Zoe Thorogood pulled this look off more successfully) and it just gets kind of stupid but cool and violent? In a world where Seinfeld showed how seemingly effortlessly four plots could break away while still commingling on a weekly basis, these three launch beautifully and then stumble about. I wish it had just done one well instead of trying three middling stories. There’s some cool themes going on, such as how in a moment of isolation one must confront themselves in a deep manner and think about their actions, and the art is fantastic, but it just feels undercooked with the ingredients stubbornly refusing to blend. You know when someone is like oh the cookies are a bit gooey and you think, hell yea I love a good gooey cookie but then you bite it and taste raw egg and think oh no this is just nowhere near ready and kind of politely choke it down before discarding the rest? No, just me? Well it felt like that to me.   [image]At this point I stopped saying “what the hell?” and just rolled with it.But returning to my first, bad metaphor, it’s just very college bro kind of eye rolling. It reads like it really wants you to be impressed and talk about how it’s this amazing artistic expression that “nobody gets it and thats why they don’t like it” kind of thing. But like, I don’t know, I’m calling a bluff here. I bet it does have this cool, abstract meaning that the artist envisions and I believe there’s a lot behind it but it wasn’t expressed in a way that is worth more than some head nods and “mind-blown” reactions before moving on. None of the plot lines feel fully realized enough, even in the spirit of their surrealism, to really land and it doesn’t have enough to support it’s own weight. It aims for edgy and achieves that I guess, but not in a great way? The woman’s plotline feels a bit fetishized, the way you can see college stoner bro telling it like “yea, dude, the two hot chicks are alone on earth so they become lesbians and they just run around naked” which is great and all and I do love a queer storyline, but it feels less like repping the queer community and more like a fetishization of queer women for the male gaze (none of the men get naked…unless you count the lopsided old guy who bends over naked to show an eyeball grow out of his asshole…). This came out in 2014 and I had a moment today thinking about how, while the publishing industry still has a long way to go, queer representation has improved in a decade especially having queer voices telling their stories in a way that feels empowering instead of exploitive.  [image]I will admit I loved the art. I loved the character designs, the colors are great and I really loved the long series of panels—and full page spreads—of space that set a fantastic tone of our almost undetectable tininess in the grand scheme of the cosmos. I.N.J. Culbard (who is Ian Culbard as he sometimes publishes under) has done some cool stuff, adapting several classics like H.G. Wells, The King in Yellow and art for The Picture of Dorian Gray: A Graphic Novel, all of which feel like influences or kindred spirits to this surrealistic nightmare tale. This just never quite came together and while I like books thats leave you to grapple with existential horrors and unresolved questions, I think I’d rather just move on glad I experienced it but without much interest in pursuing it any further. But maybe you will love this, and I’d love that for you, and I think it’s cool that somewhere out there DK shirt dude is drinking his whiskey neat, having his mind blown and can’t wait to show it to a friend.

[image]Charley with Nobel Winning author John SteinbeckIf you are like me, you will recognize the impulse of wanderlust. John Steinbeck felt this too, opening his book Travels With Charley with a humorous reflection on how people always told him his wanderlust would be cured with old age but, at 58 when he set out with his dog, Charley, this hadn’t seemed to abate even a little. ‘Perhaps my greatest wisdom is the knowledge that I do not know,’ he writes, and so he sets off to see what he does not yet know of the land and the people in it. While the book is usually thought of as a travelog, Steinbeck’s thoughts and reflections on his journey through the ‘new America of the 1960’s becomes more an intimate portrait of the writer himself and his thoughts on loneliness, travel, the country in a state of change and, ultimately, himself. It is a lovely little book, full of Steinbeck’s signature charm and wit, and while it is a gaze at an era now gone, it is still a meaningful and beautifully introspective read.‘I was born lost and take no pleasure in being found.’For those with the traveling spirit, this is practically a book of meditations with hardly a page that goes by without one sentence worth underlining or committing to memory. When I first read this, I was going through a huge Steinbeck phase in college and getting out on the road was something always on my mind. And itinerary whenever the opportunity presented itself. There are some gorgeous reflections on taking journeys to be found here: ‘Once a journey is designed, equipped, and put in process, a new factor enters and takes over. A trip, a safari, an exploration, is an entity, different from all other journeys. It has personality, temperament, individuality, uniqueness. A journey is a person in itself; no two are alike. And all plans, safeguards, policing, and coercion are fruitless. We find after years of struggle that we do not take a trip; a trip takes us. Tour masters, schedules, reservations, brass-bound and inevitable, dash themselves to wreckage on the personality of the trip. Only when this is recognized can the blown-in-the glass bum relax and go along with it. Only then do the frustrations fall away. In this a journey is like marriage. The certain way to be wrong is to think you control it.’Through the book we ride along shotgun with Charley on our lap (good boy) and experience the states with him as he passes through. ‘I find out of long experience that I admire all nations and hate all governments,’ he says in typical old-Steinbeck fashion, ‘and nowhere is my natural anarchism more aroused than at national borders.’ Steinbeck longs for freedom and while he admits the natural impulse at an older age is to resist change, he has set out to see it and meet it. Unfortunately it has been discovered that some details are fabricated, or embellished, and some of the people he meets along the way are caricatures or composites, but the story is ‘true enough’ and if you feel it in your heart, it might as well be true. I came to Steinbeck through his fiction that always felt like a truer understanding of life than most things I’d known anyways, so whatever.‘One goes, not so much to see but to tell afterward.’Whether you have a love for travel, an appreciate of Steinbeck, or just need a good book that will make you feel nice inside, Travels for Charley is a winner.4.5/5‘People don’t take trips—trips take people.’...more",Notes are private!,2,232,1,not set,not set,"Mar 22, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41061633-travels-with-charley

The Many Deaths of Laila Starr is a visual treat and emotional ride. Author Ram V. and artist Felipe Andrade deliver this incredible story set in Mumbai, playing with Hindu mythology through characters that are fun and comical enough to keep the otherwise heavy, existential themes of the graphic novel from dipping into melodrama. Plus it is absolutely gorgeous to look at, with a sharp art style brought to life in heaping doses of arrestingly bright color palettes. When Death (visually represented as Kali finds herself laid off because a boy has been born that will put an end to death, she is sent to live a mortal life and decides she must kill him to allow death to continue. We follow Death as she finds herself without a purpose and living through several of her own deaths, and through this immortal being grappling with the emotions of those with a finite lifespan we must ultimately confront the question if death itself does have a purpose in life.  [image]Told across five issues, The Many Deaths of Laila Starr has an engaging, episodic narrative with each issue comprising its own arc within a larger story. In each we see Laila brought back to life, with longer gaps of years between each death, and engaging with Darius (the boy destined to end death) at different phases of his life. Having been unable to kill him as a baby, and dying herself in the escape, Laila begins to contemplate existence and in each arc—aided by some fascinating characters like a funeral bird who ferries souls from death, a talking cigarette, or a Chinese temple—we discover more ideas on the meaning of life in a reality where we know it must come to and end. It is rather amusing seeing Death, already in the stolen body of Laila, continuously meet an abrupt and tragic end and have to start over again.  [image]The story mercifully manages to avoid seeming overly cliched or pop-self-helpy, with so rather moving lines and messages from ‘to be witnessed by someone else and to be remembered when you are gone, these are the things that belong to mortals,’ or ‘I’ve just learned today that those are different things…dying and going away forever.’ The story is zany with plenty of dark humor to keep it upbeat as it moves along at a rather fast pace, but it is still quite ponderous and lovely. As much as it bends your thoughts towards ideas of death and destruction, it also celebrates life and is a surprisingly comforting read. Plus it is a joy to look at, this is worth it for the bold and colorful art alone.  [image]This was one where I though I knew where it was going but was surprised to see the rather clever and moving twists in it. This is a book that keeps you on your toes and keeps your mind working. It’s a lovely reminder that death doesn’t have to be such a gloomy concept and makes you think about outlooks that could create more death-positivity. This is such a fun book, it’ll make you laugh, it’ll blow your mind, and it’ll also hit you deeply in the feelings. My only minor complaint is the font is occasionally hard to read.

Here Alyson becomes Alvita, an outspoken Jamaican-born English woman in her 50s full of life and wit, with her tale set during the time of Queen Nanny of the Maroons in Jamaica. A surprisingly faithful adaptation that feels at home in the modern world and while Smith herself says she is merely ‘hiding in the folds of [Chaucer’s] garment,’ her work here is extraordinary and this is just as exciting for those unfamiliar with the tale as those who have studied it at length. And, for the lucky few, it is even being performed on stage, having done a sold-out run at the Kiln—a theater Smith grew up with—and now making a U.S. premiere.  [image]Alvita (played by Clare Perkins) w/ 3 of her former husbandsI’ve not read many plays but this was an absolute delightful way to spend an evening reading it with a drink (in keeping with the play itself, a boozy experience is certainly recommended). Much like the way the Wife’s Prologue—which, in keeping with the original, is much longer than the Tale and serves as wonderful character study of Alvira who ‘has been that bitch since 1986’—the story behind the play is just as interesting as the play itself. According to Smith, this came about when a miscommunication with the press announced to the world that she had written a play (she intended at most a monologue for the London Borough of Culture’s 2020 program celebrating Brent), with Smith finding out the whole of the internet was eagerly anticipating it when she got off a plane to a slew of congratulatory emails. Not wanting to disappoint, she actually did it and, honestly, it’s amazing. She was even awarded the 2022 Critics Circle Theatre Award for Most Promising Playwright for the play.This is just so much fun though. She writes entirely in ten syllable lines delivered in rhymed couplets, like Chaucer, and I enjoyed the way speakers will blend into each other to complete the 10-syllable lines. While it is written in modern English, the language is sprinkled with diction and colloquialisms, with the variety of accents intended to create a ‘tapestry’ of international sisterhood of women. This is full of fantastic word-play and lots of puns, most of them sexual ('You don't get something for nutting' ba-dum, ching). It's really lyrical and flows so well ‘and sing without ever actually becoming music.’The message is primarily the same here, with an emphasis on not being ruled by men, and there are some laugh-out-loud moments here. I was amused by her update that the abusive, fifth husband becomes a raging misogynist who collects stories about women being “evil” after reading Jordan Peterson (Alvira tears up his copy). Though many of the examples given remain the same, such as Ovid’s tale of King Midas. Smith’s stage direction is wonderful and makes for a very visual read—I imagine this is fantastic on stage. It is set in a bar, with Smith herself a character, and the patrons all play the various roles in Alivra’s prologue and tale, from the husbands, to a church service going on ‘in a separate reality,’ to characters like Nelson Mandela, Black Jesus and Socrates. The whole this is hilarious and punchy, though as Smith says, Alvira isn’t written to be a mouthpiece for modern feminist issues, she is existing on her own while not caring what other people think and remains quite true to Alyson.A quick but joyful read, The Wife of Willesden is a fantastic retelling of The Wife of Bath that keeps Chaucer’s spirit alive in modern day London. I really want to see this on stage, though Smith’s writing is so engaging I feel like I’ve already seen it as her words danced through my head. This edition contains both Smith's play and the Chaucer original text so you can compare the two. Highly recommended, even if you are not a theater-type person. The story is familiar with a few surprises, and overall it is a really fun time.

People get on, people disembark and—if we are going to get allegorical about it—the various stations are sort of like the events in life that become a hinge between Before and After. ‘Why has everything been ruined,’ various characters ask almost as a refrain in Natalia Ginzberg’s 1961 novel Voices in the Evening, a post-war story set in an Italian town straining with the heavy burdens and debris of the past as it tries to reroute towards the horizons of the future. The novel follows Elsa as she navigates the local society and her mother’s own gossip-ridden narratives, but is also an examination of the local factory owning De Francisci family and how their lives are interwoven with the history of the town to create an abstract portrait of Italian society fractured by the weight of fascism and war. Translated by D.M. Low, Ginzberg writes with lucid precision to create this striking collage of lives scrutinizing how both internal and external forces have connected or isolated them. Here we see the truths on how ‘happiness,’ as one of the brothers states, ‘is like water; one only realizes it when it has run away,’ as Ginzberg brilliantly unburies the ineffable feelings these characters try to hide deep within themselves.‘There are so many sad things in life. Why read novels? Is not life a novel?’There is always that question whether the You of today is someone the You of your childhood would have been proud of. I mean, beyond that kid me would definitely tear the aux cord away from me now, it has always seemed like a disingenuous question that discounts the myriad of ways our priorities, interests and avenues of action are constantly reconfigured by the world around us as well as our own internal conversations with ourselves. Unless you grew up to become an astronaut, can child-You really understand the way life is about compromising with the hand you are dealt and making concessions to be able to fight another day? This notion is at the heart of Voices in the Evening, following a family through an amazingly patchworked narrative—presumably recounted to us by Elsa—that juxtaposes the idealisms and eagerness of their youth with the wreckage of the past strewn about in their present. We often first encounter the character through their aftermath before learning their story, like a ghost of the past lingering translucently over the rubble—Nebbia, for instance, is first introduced through the details of his murder during the war much before we see the happiness of his youth as a central figure in friendship (and one instance of failed lover) to most of the De Francisci family.Perhaps most interesting is Purillo, as his story most dredges up the uncomfortable aftermath of the war as people must pick up the pieces and reconnect as a community with the knowledge that some of their neighbors were fascists and others were resistors (like the sister Raffaella who holed up in the mountains and was a communist). This is an intriguing examination considering Ginzberg’s own husband was executed by the fascists, as here we first learn of Purillo for his role as a fascist before discovering a very different impression of him as he appears as a warm and supportive figure in the lives of his family members. Purillo was an adopted son to Balotta (his nickname meaning ‘little ball’ for his stout features), the socialist patriach of the De Francisci family and factory owner. Despite having reservations over Purillo, he does inevitably give him control of the factory. There is an uncomfortable idea never voiced but always hanging over the narrative as we see Purillo, admittedly a fascist, having kept the town afloat during the war because his party alignment allowed the factory to continue running and also gave him information that saved Balotta’s life. What makes Voices in the Evening so compelling is the messiness of lives as well as the moral complexities of characters.‘How a place can get one down!’In the present, the baggage of the past is a heavy burden to carry. But the past is also only accessible through memory, often tainted in nostalgia that delivers an inaccurate replication of reality and spurs a homesickness for a time and place that only half existed, made worse by the chasm wrought by the destructive recent past of fascism and war that has completely upended society. Character’s like Elsa’s mother seem to resign themselves to golden age nostalgia and exist in a present constructed more on gossip than hard truths (amusingly she often refers to Elsa’s friends as the ‘little Bottiglia girls’ despite them all now being in their early 30s seemingly as an indication she can’t let go of the past). But for others, the past is more like a haunting, such as it is for the youngest De Francisci brother Tommasino with whom Elsa has been carrying on a clandestine relationship:‘It has a weight of lead, with all its dead. This village of ours, it just get me down; it is so small, a handful of houses. I can never free myself from it, I cannot forget it.’Even if he were to escape from it he knows it will continue to haunt him. While modern novels seem to often hit on themes of generational trauma, I quite enjoyed the way Ginzberg explored the way trauma can send shockwaves through a singular generation. Here the failings of life and love have a traumatic resonance on those around them, such as Vincenzino’s failed marriage reading like a warning to the younger people around him. It is another example of the ways an event reshapes society and culture, with the fallout of these lives shattering faith in even things like the institution of marriage. ‘I have taken to driving my thoughts underground,’ Tommasino says about trying to navigate a society that still attempts to uphold the norms of the past in a present currently in shambles, and Ginzberg makes us consider the cost of silence weighed against the standards of society.‘Ginzburg did not overdramatise the war in her writing, but sought to integrate it into daily life,’ Colm Tóibín writes in his introduction, ‘it seemed part of normality until it came close and then it tore the lives of her characters asunder.’ This is a wonderfully psychological novel where Ginzberg asks us to consider the ways a communal past can oppress the present as we struggle to find our bearings to move forward. In the forward she tells us the characters and places are fiction but adds ‘I am sorry to say this having loved them as though they were real,’ and one of her greatest strengths in this novel is presenting these characters as so lifelike upon the page that by the end of the novel the reader, too, will have known them as if they were real. Voices in the Evening is a small but heavy novel, asking us if we can ever escape the past and forcing us to consider the concessions we make in life in order to keep living it. A powerful book.4.5/5‘We have brought it to the light and it is dead, and we shall never recover it any more.’...more",Notes are private!,0,131,1,"Mar 19, 2023","Mar 19, 2023","Mar 19, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58287209-voices-in-the-evening

They had become quite popular so the wait time was a bit long, but she’d send me in and head around the block to what at the time was a locally owned small grocery store to use the wait time productively. Thinking back, this set-up was very much the dying era of my parent’s childhood still holding on. Though in the same shopping square as this grocery was a independent video rental, a Tubby subs and a vacuum repair/sports card shop, so without knowing it was also representative of my own generations dying era.

Just after finishing up the edits foI can’t think of a better St. Patrick’s Day tribute than to pause and think about poet Eavan Boland for a moment. Just after finishing up the edits for what would be her final book of poetry, this volume titled The Historians, Boland passed away in April 2020. ‘In the end,’ she wrote in one of my favorite poems of hers, Anna Liffey, ‘Everything that burdened and distinguished me / Will be lost in this: I was a voice.’ And what a voice she was, blending memory and history with wave after wave of brilliant verse that championed the struggles of women while carrying the rhythm of Irish history. It is strange to think of this as a posthumous collection, and I’ll never forget learning of her passing. It was a few weeks into the 2020 Stay at Home period and I remember her death hitting me quite hard out of nowhere so I took my dog on a long, long walk where I spent much of it thinking about poetry and the first time I set foot in Ireland, a copy of her A Poet's Dublin one of the only things I had in my bag for the trip. So now when I think of Ireland, I always think of Boland. And I’d like to kick off this  with some lines from the poem in here, For a Poet Who Died Young,’ as, while she was 75 when she passed, reading it makes me think of her:Your words helped me live.I was younger then. Your ghost is still young.Is still dead,Your words disturbed my earth. They changed my mind.Whatever a dead poet could have I wish for you.But a living womanis what you should have been. So many years laterforgive the fact my words unlike yoursoffer little comfort and less peace.Boland is selling herself short in the end here because wow do her words always hit so well. There is a New Collected Poems poems from 2005 that I highly recommend though it is badly in need of updating (same with the wonderful New Selected Poems from 2013) as Boland continued putting out hit after hit after those, like A Woman Without a Country: Poems and this, her final work. She published her first collection while still a student, and went on to teach in many prestigious literature departments such as Trinity College in Dublin where I was visiting my partner, and also was the editor for the amazing Poetry Ireland Review. She’s fantastic. ComplicitWhen we were young we praised Saint Brigid's Dayas if we gave her credit forthe end of our island winter.I used to think it was our innocence.Now I think we were the AngelusI heard when I was still at boarding school,listening at the window, the music of a bellacting on the air, collectinglilac, ozone, light from the water--each element eliciting meaningfor the other, each arriving atmy windowsill. Inseparable. Complicit.Like many of her collections, the ideas of memory and history come together with personal stories here, and The Historians looks at the women of the past, from activists to her own grandmother, as a way to rethink about Irish history. ‘Silence was a story, I thought, / on its own and all to itself,’ she writes, and Boland has always ensured the voices of women would not go silent in the halls of history. The final section of the book is one longer poem, Our Future Will Become the Past of Other Women, which had been by United Nations to honor the centenary of women exercising their right to vote in Ireland in 1918.Our future will becomeThe past of other women.Our island that was onceSettled and removed on the edge Of Europe is now a bridgeTo the world.It is a lovely poetic monument to the women, who’s names are listed in the poem to remember that they ‘vote in the shadow of their past / They vote in the light of what will be / Their new nation.’ Boland also remembers moments of her own life, stitching it into the history she creates around her, and some of my favorite passages are her remembering her own act of poetry, such as in Three Crafts:On wild nights when the trees are getting readyTo become memories of themselvesNo one will remember I rememberstumbling into this art when I was young.How often I wrote late at night hopingas window latches broke loose and the windrose and undid all the leaves that what I wrotemight be capable of learning froman ocean cadence. Its fall, its rise and fall.This is a lovely, intimate collection, moving from poems of St Stephens Green, to lamplighters ‘leaving behind him / the gift of shadows,’ a poem about a library in 1964, and always a love letter to Ireland. Perhaps the best is the titular poem, which I’ll post in full as I believe it speaks for itself and is, certainly, the heart of this collection and one that will grace the pages of any selected poetry collections of Boland that will likely come about. She was an incredible poet, one of my favorites, and this was a lovely, final farewell.The HistoriansSay the word history: I seeyour mother, mine.The light sober, the summer well over,an east wind dandling leaves, rain stirring at the kerb.Their hands are full of words.One of them holds your father’s journal with its notewritten on the day you were born.The other my small rhymed scratchings, my fervent letters.Before the poem ends,they will have burned them all.Now say the word again.

It will come as no surprise that there was a hostile reception, though it was ed positively in many magazines, received a second printing almost immediately, and quickly came to the US and was translated into French. Mary delivers a strong rallying cry for the education of women and sharp criticisms of social norms that oppress women and coach them into submission, ideas that would resonate through the ages and inspire generations of feminist thought that would expand upon them. This includes her own daughter, famed author Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley who also shocked the world releasing Frankenstein at the age of 18, and many of her ideas about women given the space for their own financial mobility feel like prototypes for Simone de Beauvoir’s arguments in The Second Sex. Sharp, witty, and full of fiery intensity, A Vindication of the Rights of Women (published here as The Feminist Papers) is an excellent historical document on the fight for women’s liberation and still remains an engrossing read today.‘It is time to effect a revolution in female manners - time to restore to them their lost dignity - and make them, as a part of the human species, labour by reforming themselves to reform the world. It is time to separate unchangeable morals from local manners.’A Vindication of the Rights of Women may well be one of the earliest feminist manifestos, though the term “feminism” was not coined for another century. This novel-length manifesto may feel dated in many ways—I mean it was 1792 so don’t expect the nuance of modern discourse around gender—yet also reads as impressively ahead of it’s time. She knows her audience, though, and couches much of her arguments in religious contexts seeing as her readers would likely be religious and, in an appeal for reason, writes in a context that reason was bestowed and decreed by God. Similarly, acknowledging that men would largely be reading this, much of it is addressed diretly to the men of her time to urge them to be active in undoing the shackles of patriarchal rule and acknowledge that their actions are what have lead to the oppression and mistreatment of women. In this way, she also counteracts many typical responses against women’s liberation, namely that even with equality women would still be “lesser” than men. ‘Let men prove this, and I shall grant that woman only exists for man,’ she writes, arguing that without being given the opportunity to see what happens under a more equal society their argument is meaningless conjecture. She writes ‘there is little reason to fear that women will acquire too much courage or fortitude,’ in response to the slippery-slope claims that giving women financial agency or a space in the workforce outside the home would cause them to become ‘too masculine’ or become oppressors themselves. To any fearmongering against women’s equality, she proclaims ‘what a weak barrier is truth when it stands in the way of an hypothesis!’ and calls for space for women instead of neglecting it by assuming the worst.‘I do not wish them [women] to have power over men; but over themselves.’The key to her manifesto is the establishment of a National Education system that gives equal opportunities and access to men and women. The argument is that if education allowed men to thrive, women would also thrive under greater enlightenment. This was written in response to a report by Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord which has called for women to only receive a “domestic education,” something she saw as society ensuring women would have no agency beyond the duties of a housewife. Wollstonecraft argues that without proper enrichment in the sciences, the scope of women’s interest will never extend beyond superficial household issues and the gatekeeping of education is also gatekeeping them from fulfillment in a larger society. Her statement that without a proper education women will be ‘dependent on the novelist for amusement,’ a nice jab at the men of letters (also hilarious considering her own daughter’s success as a writer later on) but implying that women will have no scope of the world beyond the entertainment of fiction, or in modern parlance, saying they will want nothing beyond sitting and watching bad tv.This manifesto does mostly to serve the needs of a middle class in its critique of the wealthy ruling class. She writes that ‘after the age of nine, girls and boys, intended for domestic employments, or mechanical trades, ought to be removed to other schools, and receive instruction, in some measure appropriated to the destination of each individual,’ so the poorer working class will still be given some education but expected to remain laborers. This isn’t a perfect manifesto that achieves Fannie Lou Hamer’ statement that ‘nobody's free until everybody's free,’ but all the same this was radically progressive for its time.‘My own sex, I hope, will excuse me, if I treat them like rational creatures, instead of flattering their fascinating graces, and viewing them as if they were in a state of perpetual childhood, unable to stand alone.’I really enjoyed the way Wollstonecraft dissects society to show how the belief of women as lesser and submissive to men is something coached by social norms and is essentially a self-fulfilling prophecy dictated by patriarchal rule. As society is ruled from the top down in terms of wealth, so too is society ruled with regard to gender under an assumption that men are more capable and deserving of ruling. She looks at the way the treatment of women, such as the lack of access to education or employment, leaves them with no social agency or mobility and thus, in resignation, become the very thing men wish them to be. ‘All the sacred rights of humanity are violated by insisting on blind obedience,’ she writes, insisting women stop allowing themselves to be pigeonholed into these roles.This extends to topics such as marriage, and while she admits there isn’t much opportunity for women without being married, urges women to not allow themselves to become a slave to their husband. She says how men act like tyrants in marriage and that there in no reason for it to be an institution of oppression, something Beauvoir would expand upon greatly in The Second Sex charting how possession of women became equated with possession of property as another way that equality was denied simply by seeming ridiculous in a society where women were dehumanized as objects.‘It is vain to expect virtue from women till they are in some degree independent of men.’In a society where reason and virtue is valued, Mary Wollstonecraft argues that without the access to education and equality for women, than it is all meaningless signaling. A Vindication of the Rights of Women remains a sharp, insightful text and excellent look at the early wave-making of feminist thought that would grow and gain power and force over generations. It is certainly not perfect, and reads rather dated (it can also be assumed women’s rights likely just meant white women) but is still quite interesting. This was an excellent read for Women’s History Month, and while it is a bit of a denser read, it is still quite accessible and interesting. Mary Wollstonecraft helped light a fuse that continues in the fight for women’s rights and a more just, equitable society.4/5‘Make them free, and they will quickly become wise and virtuous, as men become more so; for the improvement must be mutual, or the justice which one half of the human race are obliged to submit to, retorting on their oppressors, the virtue of man will be worm-eaten by the insect whom he keeps under his feet.’...more",Notes are private!,0,144,1,"Mar 16, 2023","Mar 16, 2023","Mar 16, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40996910-the-feminist-papers

Yea, probably? Weird question, sorry, why would I ask that. Oh, it’s because everything Thorogood does is so goddamn engrossing that I just want to shout about it to everyone. Which I have been doing at the bookstore anytime someone so much as glances at the graphic novel section. But for real, The Impending Blindness of Billie Scott from Zoe Thorogood is a delight. We follow runaway artist Billie who, on the cusp of their big break with a gallery showing, is the victim of random violence that leaves her going blind. With only weeks before her eyesight is gone, she sets out to make 10 portraits and keep her artistic dreams alive, facing the cruelty of living on the streets but having meaningful conversations and making lasting friends along the way. This is a moving story, with lots of ups and downs and emotional grit that really sinks its claws into you. Like the way a cat will climb up your leg and you think “ow!” but then “aw” because it snuggles up in your lap and you love cats. This book is like if that cat was art, all brought to life through Thorogood’s incredible artwork and humor.   [image]There is so much to love here. The characters are so endearing, and not just the socially anxious artist Billie who is so easy to love and empathize with, but this features some fantastic side characters like Arthur, determined to embrace the failures of his past and directing it towards help others, and of course Rachel West, unhoused but determined to become a music star and buy back the coffee shop her deceased dad once owned. I really appreciated the empathetic approach to unhoused people. This is a really empowering story with a lot of lovely things to say about art, determination, that your ‘work does not define you,’ and it is also a beautiful plea to keep creating. It is a moving look at the power of art juxtaposed with the hardships of life and a reminder that kindness and support helps those around you flourish. It also has such a cute story of friendship that blossoms into something more. Yay!  [image]The cast of characters via Billie Scott’s artworkBut we need to talk about Thorogood’s art, because it is extraordinary. I love the muted palette here, with highlights of just dull reds, yellow and blue on ink drawings that have a really gritty vibe and brings the urban settings to life. Her character designs are wonderful, which is key for a book about painting portraits. I mean, this feels so much like existing in an artist’s mind and works, something you feel very aware of at all times in a good way. Thorogood has great dialogue too, and for a book that can have fairly text-heavy panels, it never feels like too much and larger, full-page cells make dynamic use of the space, directing your eyes to swirl down the page following the dialogue in a really creative and engaging way. It is also very self-conscious in a way that is effective and charming—this book has so much personality. I love the publication as an oversized book, it really lets you plunge into the artwork and just feels cool as hell to hold. Like, hell yes I’m reading this amazing graphic novel, and you should too. Plus she can break into some excellent surreal nightmares here, something that she captures quite well in her later book, It's Lonely at the Centre of the Earth.  [image]Creepy coolI can’t recommend The Impending Blindness of Billie Scott enough and was very impressed and moved by it. Sure, there’s probably some criticism to make but fuck that because this is just too great. I also highly recommend It's Lonely at the Centre of the Earth, which feels like a more matured art direction but not in a way where this doesn’t feel mature, that book just does magic with visual storytelling. Thorogood is spot of with pacing, the use of frames really pushes the story along but gives it room to breathe, and it is just a visual extravaganza. Read all the Thorogood, I’m very excited to follow her career.

Yet still she can’t help but cry.’Some moments in history send shockwaves across decades, some so violent it is more like shrapnel that still hurts long after. The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are such events, killing an estimated between 129,000 and 226,000 people and casting a long shadow through time of our destructive capabilities. Maki Kashimada’s Love at Six Thousand Degrees, the title referencing the ground temperature when the bomb exploded over the city, spirals through existential wounds at both a personal and national level as an unnamed woman plagued by visions of a mushroom cloud suddenly leaves her husband and young child to visit the city of Nagasaki. There she meets a young man with whom she has an affair based on their mutual suffering. Winner of the Yukio Mishima Prize, and inspired by Marguerite Duras’s screenplay for the extraordinary 1959 French New Wave film Hiroshima, Mon Amour with which this story has many parallels, this is a story of losing oneself in order to try and find yourself. Teeming with dynamic symbolism and eluding simple interpretation, Love at Six Thousand Degrees is a brief but complex story of memory and overcoming personal pains colliding with each other while being tossed on the waves of generational trauma.‘Close your eyes. Pretend to be one more corpse belonging to this land.’I love when books seem to serendipitously find us. I had just watched Hiroshima, Mon Amour and was scrolling upcoming Europa translations when I discovered this was to be released a week away. Fresh from loving the film that inspired it, I absolutely HAD to read it. Those familiar with the film will notice thematic and stylistic similarities here. Taking place in Nagasaki instead of Hiroshima, this is also a story of a love affair though instead of a married French woman and Japanese man, it is a married Japanese mother and a half Russian, half Japanese young man (said to be around university age). There is also a key death in the woman’s past that makes up a major part of the narrative, but Love at Six Thousand Degrees stands strongly as it’s own story and those unfamiliar with the movie will not feel slighted (though I highly recommend seeing it). Some of the dialogue reminds me of the cadence of film as well, especially early on as the pair collaborate to tell of their traumas, often with the other making assumptions and telling it to them as a way of creating their biography. Kashimada creates a very stylized novel that may rub some readers as cumbersome, though I found that so much of the style and themes inform each other. The dialogue style here represents the way the ‘contour that define’ them are melting away and their shared passive nature is blending into one. ‘You and me, we can be like anyone. It’s always the other person who decides who we are,’ they say, acknowledging that they are both passive people, ‘we don’t have the power to resist, even if resisting would be what’s best for them too.’ More on that in a bit, however.  [image]The statue in Nagasaki Peace Park, which figures into the novel.’The story, which begins on August 9th, the anniversary of the bombing of Nagasaki (her trip concludes on the 15th: the anniversary announcing surrender) proceeds less as a linear tale but as spiraling through repetition of several primary ideas, events, and themes. It is like someone trying to talk through something, knowing there is something there and turning the ideas over and over until the truth falls out. Everything feels highly symbolic yet also obfuscated leading her to think ‘It isn’t meaningless. No, it’s filled with too many meanings. Those meanings keep rolling over each other in turns, never settling,’ and acknowledging that there is too much going on in everything to affix a specific meaning as ‘if you decide on just one meaning, you deny everything else.’ Which applies to much of the novel itself, and there are countless lines that scream out multifaceted symbolism that I found myself constantly underlining for both the beauty of the sentences (translated by Haydn Trowell) and to return to as I attempted to unravel each theme.‘When my brother died, the existence in which we had so blindly believed died with him. My brother died and I lived.’While one thread is the bombing of Nagasaki and how that reverberates through generations, the woman has her own personal moment of death: the suicide of her alcoholic brother. His loss has shaken up her world, one that was built entirely around him as coached by her mother who she knows loved the brother much more than her. Even her impression of herself was reflected to her through her brother:‘My brother has always been the person on the other side of the mirror. My perception of myself has always been relative to how I see him. I look at my brother first, and then by comparing myself against him, I know myself. That was how my mother taught me to perceive myself.’Living life without a defined sense of self, she lives a bad faith existence allowing men to define her—which is often sexual, abusive and for their pleasure instead of hers. ‘I manage to survive day-to-day by giving a false sense of order to the disorder, by lulling myself into a momentary sense of security. By relying on a man whom I may or may not even like. Being out with men makes her feel queasy and uncomfortable (there is a brief moment hinting at repressed queer possibilities), but it allows a sense of self. She eventually marries a man who is understanding and gives her space, but she still feels unfulfilled and haunted by visions of a mushroom cloud. This leads to looking at the youth, who also allows himself to be pushed around and defined by her. She is cruel to him and though they sleep together, it isn’t very satisfying, with her frustrated by his lack of being forceful with her. However, it gives her a release. ‘The boundaries between them had disappeared. Two bodies reduced to one. Not life, but death. Not even love. Merely a process of amalgamation.’ By losing herself, perhaps she is able to better see and define herself for herself.‘My past is rootless. My impressions change from one to the next. No sooner do they summon joy than they turn to pain. No sooner do they seem comfortably pale than they become blindingly vivid.’One of the most interesting stylistic choices is the way the narrative goes back and forth between third and first person. This shows the interplay of public and private personas and touches on how the woman is attempting to see outside herself and find herself as separate from her brother. Having wanted to be an author, she talks about how she would write a novel that was just like her, though not sure if her life was worth writing about. ‘I watch my own story from the outside, like a spectator,’ she thinks, ‘remarking that it seems indifferent to persuasion. Wondering who the author is.’ In this way she can read herself like a book, and while the interpretation is available, the actual novel is vague on if this is metafictional or not.‘Joy and sorrow are both different kinds of suffering.’The youth is an interesting character as well, given to weeping and low sense of self. His mixed heritage is part of his lack of having a definitive self (‘In Russia, they say I have yellow skin. In Japan, people say I’m white. Even I wonder what color my face is.’) but his history of embarrassment and harassment over his skin disorder has also stunted his emotional growth. I found this aspect to hit very close to home as when I was young I began to get a terrible rash that doctors didn’t seem to understand. After several years of testing, it was determined it was from ultraviolet light and I was made to wear sunscreen at all times. So here I was in elementary, pale as pale can be and my hards, arms and neck occasionally blooming with a red rash that itched so much I’d wake up covered in blood from scratching in my sleep. It isn’t bad now, I wear sunscreen only during normal times to wear it and only occasionally get it on my arms, but it really shaped my perspective of myself as a kid that I was some hideous deformed monster. So I TOTALLY vibe with this character on that, and enjoyed that aspect of the book as I hadn’t thought about this in years and was able to positively mull over it. But I’m getting carried away. The youth is a complex symbol in this book, one of his many features being the way the woman compares his body to Nagasaki itself with both his body and the city being the sites where she has traveled to degrade and find herself:‘Is it a human body that I’m devouring? Really? Isn’t it this state of being, this land…Nagasaki? It’s Nagasaki that I’m devouring. And you, no one, you…are Nagasaki…Maybe I’ll dismantle you. Maybe then I’ll find meaning.’She contines to compare him to the statues of saints destroyed in the bombing, the ones they see at the Urakami Cathedral, saying his parts are perhaps piled up in some intentional way. ‘But I can’t understand their meaning. I call that state Nagasaki. And that state is you.’  [image]The Urakami Cathedral and the statue of Mary.The church and the statues are highly symbolic in the story, with the statue of Mary with the eyes missing being both an idea of hollowness but somehow subverting meaninglessness to be a vague symbol just out of reach. Being Japanese Orthodox herself, Kashimada infuses that and Russian Orthodox (via the youth) into the novel. The youth, not just an expression of Nagasaki itself, starts to take on a Christlike symbolism, covered in frankincense, holding her back from a cliff (paralleling her brother jumping from a ledge to his death with nobody there to stop him), and beggars and dogs flock to him. Yet he is also the idea of Sainthood representing the Holy Fool which Kashimada examines in the novel, and his kindness to the woman in the face of her cruelty shows ‘the forgiveness of a Holy Fool.’ She has him read the resurrection of Lazarus to her, citing Sonya reading it to Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment as the turning point where he turns himself in. ‘She had come here to witness death, to attune herself to it.’Resurrection becomes a major theme, both of the self and the city from destruction. But memory is key too: ‘If one has truly forgotten, if one’s memory is a blank canvas, from where comes that stubborn urge to paint over all traces of violence? From where arises that unconscious power of discernment that allows one not only to erase violence, but also to hide it from others?’It all begins to spiral into the zones of discomfort we must confront in order to grow, and we see how history and mass devastation can flatten victims into one yet also how the woman wishes to find a sense of individuality from it all. The novel seems to make the case that something can be more than one thing, using the etymology of passion as an example: ‘the word passion was somehow derived from suffering? I wonder how that happened. Is a passionate person someone who has suffered? Maybe passions are a form of injury?’ ‘There is a book in my mind, its pages in disarray. I don't know my own ending yet.’While occasionally a bit cumbersome and the repetition and cycles of trauma-addressing make for a slower going read (for 127pgs this felt much longer), Love at Six Thousand Degrees is quite a intelligent novel that contains multitudes all deftly interwoven. Kashimada addresses how giving voice to our suffering allows us to better understand and process it, and that we can have a resurrection of the self after our own destruction. While it may be a bit opaque, it is one that rewards rereading and slowing down to mull things over, and a brilliant collage of ideas comes to light. Worthwhile.3.5/5‘Faces. Faces. Faces.

Oliver Gloag’s work on Albert Camus here is commendable, blending analysis of Camus’ works with an overview of his life. Gloag, a professor of French studies at UNCA, has often witten on the topics of Camus and Sartre and there stances towards imperialism and colonialism (You can read his collection of articles on them for the magazine Jacobin here), which allows for some really interesting critical looks at Camus through this lens. Much of this book deals with Camus via the ways he interacted with the society and politics around him, starting with his youth in Algeria, his time under the occupation of Paris where worked as editor-in-chief for Combat as part of the French resistance, and moving through his relationship with Jean-Paul Sartre and their arguments over Marxism and the Algerian Revolution, to his untimely death in a car accident at the age of 46. Here's a brief overview of what Gloag has to say.The usual biographical elements are here, with Gloag focusing a lot of Camus’ journalism and the interplay of his actions and philosophies. While I would have enjoyed more engagement with his novels and plays, they are still covered quite well as a general overview with some really interesting analysis on the pieces individually as well as a collective Camus oeuvre. This has me really eager to read his unfinished, final novel The First Man as Gloag analyzes it as being the most concise expression of Camus’ works and a key to understanding him. I enjoyed the was he threaded Camus’ thoughts on absurdity through his analysis of his works and there is a great deal devoted to Camus’ theories on resistance. Having just finished The Plague I was quite interested to read his takes on it, which Gloag seems fairly critical of (he argues that if it is an allegory it is not successful as such as it takes away the agency of those who committed evils) and transitions this well into a discussion of The Rebel.Everyone has their own level of comfort with separating art from the artist, so do as you will, and Gloag does tend to tie the two pretty closely together. He focuses a lot of Camus’ journalism, which I found fascinating as I knew very little about it, and gets a lot into how Sartre and Camus sparred over topics like the USSR, an explanation on why Camus did not consider himself an existentialist, and his disagreements with other French philosophers on political issues. Reading any biography of people who tend to be idolized will always open up some disappointments, and I was not surprised but disappointed to read that Camus did not think highly of Simone de Beauvoir’s works (particularly The Second Sex, which he claimed embarrassed French men and Gloag writes that Camus was hostile to feminism in general). Gloag discusses Camus’ womanizing as well, writing that it was said the best way to reach Camus was to contact his wife, Francine, and ask her for the address of his current mistress (something printed in the press that embarrassed his wife though the two remained married until his death), asserting that this is likely why Camus wrote an essay in defense of Don Juan. He also sent his three mistresses each a letter with a different date of arrival for the journey during which he died in a car accident. There is a lot spent at the end on Camus’ position on the Algerian Revolution, with Gloag stating that his works championing the spirit of rebellion did not extend to Algerian independence. He notes Camus either ignored or wrote vague, inaccurate lines in his articles about the mass killings of Algerians by French authorities stating ‘perhaps Camus was aware that widespread knowledge of these state-sponsered crimes would destroy credibility of France’s image as a benevolent and enlightened empire.’ Gloag writes about Camus and the revolution at length in this article, and Camus’ stance is still rather controversial (and understandably so). Camus would agree to a partially independent Algeria, one still reliant on France, but never full freedom, which is rather frustrating and Gloag points to his works to highlight Camus' stances as hypocritical. Gloag centers this as a major reason for his fallout with Sartre, along with Camus denouncing communism (Sartre’s own support of the Soviet Union remains controversial as well). Camus biographer Elizabeth Hawes would write that Camus maintains more of a mythic status in the US due to what she says is less engagement and understanding with Algerian and French politics, writing ‘There was a lot of the mythic to Camus. He was great looking, and he was heroic, and there was the resistance, he was the outsider.’ For those interested, The Meursault Investigation by Kamel Daoud offers a really interesting look at Camus and the legacy of The Stranger (it is written from the POV of the brother to the unnamed man killed by Meursault) as well as frustrations with the aftermath of the revolution. All-in-all this is a fairly solid overview of Albert Camus that examines the many complexities of the man. It is critical, but fairly so, and while it spends more time on his social and political engagement than on his books, this is to be expected. I do enjoy these short introductions as a general overview, but then always wish they were more in depth despite knowing they won’t be going in, but this does point you in the direction of topic of interest that have certainly been covered elsewhere....more",Notes are private!,0,94,1,not set,not set,"Mar 13, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/45356640-albert-camus

For Laura Marris, this was extra unsettling as she first caught wind of it spreading while in the city of Oran doing research for a new translation of Albert Camus’ famous novel about the city of Oran under lockdown from a deadly disease, the aptly titled La Peste, or The Plague. Traveling with Laura was Alice Kaplan, who was teaching the novel at Yale, neither yet aware ‘how much more immersed we were going to become.’ Together they have written States of Plague: Reading Albert Camus in a Pandemic, which features rotating essays between Laura Marris and Alice Kaplan to discuss The Plague on aspects including the use of language and the interplay of past and present that also captures the ‘moments where the written and the real collide.’ Deeply engaging and intellectually stimulating, this would appeal to academic interests as well as those with a general interest in Camus, making for an excellent overview of his life and his literary efforts in general, and was an absolute joy to read alongside the novel.The sections from Laura Marris tend to focus most on Camus’ use of language as well as her thoughts on translating the novel and her reasons for many of the choices. It was also interesting to hear about how this was basically her pandemic project, translating a fictional account of what was basically going on around her in real time. She discusses how she tried to avoid making it feel couched in the language of the current pandemic (scourge instead of pandemic, serum instead of vaccine, etc) and be as faithful to Camus’ intentions as possible. A big aspect is her focus on his use of restraint in the book and all the implications, which I have written on at length here in ing the book for those who are interested. By holding back the dazzle for a moment,’ she writes about how the restraint goes beyond the themes and into the experience of reading as well, ‘a writer can let someone look directly through the page, at the part of the world that hurts.’ She also discusses how it plays into so many of his larger literary and philosophical ideas. As he wrote in ‘‘Through style, the creative effort reconstructs the world, and always with the same slight distortion that is the mark of both art and protest…Art is an impossible demand given expression and form.’For Camus, the book was about achieving that reconstruction of life. Discussing Camus’ own experience with tuberculosis, she analyzes the novel as a way of capturing how ‘his own struggles with illness made him confront his own mortality.’ I also enjoyed her segments on Tarrou, who she calls her favorite character (he is mine as well) and how he not only breaks her heart but Riuex’s as well. She points out that she points out, at the end, it is through Tarrou that Riuex recognizes most that the plague isn’t just some abstract idea they are fighting but concrete and violent and that ‘a plague can never be an abstraction when it takes human lives’ But also her discussion on how ‘Tarrou has to teach the hardest lesson: insignificance is a gateway into human life, and it’s also a gateway out.’ In this way she examines how little narratives within the narrative, such as the man Tarrou chronicles who spits on cats, are seemingly insignificant but also make up for the reality of life. That every individual life matters and has a story to tell, then tying this to his pursuit against death.Alice Kaplan also has much to say about Tarrou, with her chapters addressing Camus’ world and personal history and passing it through the novel and into discussions of our modern pandemic. Kaplan discusses how Tarrou represents a major theme of Camus about social responsibility as a form of protest. Quoting an analysis of the novel by Jacqueline Rose, she shows how Camus believes we are all responsible for one another:‘the plague will continue to crawl out of the woodwork—out of bedrooms, cellars, trunks, handkerchiefs and old papers—as long as human subjects do not question the cruelty and injustice of their social arrangements. We are all accountable for the ills of the world.’I greatly enjoyed the segments that discuss our current issues in relation to the novel, though felt that there could have been a lot more of that. Having been written while it was all ongoing, though, I suppose not enough had been sorted out. I would love to see a book that does address this directly however. Though she does discuss how much separation was a major theme of the novel, originally intended to be titled ‘Les Séparés’, or The Separated Ones, and looks at how Zoom and other technology allowed people to be connected still, though as a pale imitation of actually being together.Her chapters are quite interesting, discussing a lot of history about Camus and how it relates to the book. Mme Rieux, for instance, is based on Camus’ own mother. He had transcribed a conversation he had with his mother at the outbreak of WWII, and that conversation appears in the novel nearly verbatim, only substituting the word “war” for the word “plague. Another interesting thing I learned was that the refugee camps in Oran following the Spanish Civil War were the basis of the camps for the sick in the novel. She discusses much of Camus’ ideas of revolution and protest, though also that he did not support the Algerian Revolution which is quite disappointing. She does paint Camus as a complex figure, and I enjoyed learning a lot here. It could be said there is a bit of idolization of Camus here, which was quite noticeable reading it alongside Albert Camus: A Very Short Introduction which often feels rather antagonistic towards him, but it never seems saccharine or misguided in glossing over anything.States of Plague is a fascinating read that offers a lot of insight, both textual and historical. I enjoyed the writings by both authors here (I really loved Marris’ essays on translation best, but I am biased) and I would encourage anyone who has read The Plague to give this a read. It is a bit short but it is certainly a wealth of knowledge, like having taken a college course on the novel itself.

We’ve got that now so we can keep going I guess, but I found something endearing in the way I’ve struggled to being this  of The Plague by Albert Camus where in it’s story there is a character who spends the duration trying to perfect the first sentence of his novel. He wants a sentence that will have editors crying ‘hats off, gentleman’ and in his pursuit of the perfect sentence he finds himself beginning again and again in perpetuity. Those familiar with Camus’ The Myth of Sisyphus will recognize his penchant for the absurdity for endlessly starting over, something the journalist Rambert observes about life under the titular plague in the novel: ‘it consists of starting over.’ And so goes the Sisyphian cycle of each day the same as the last in the Algerian city of Oran while quarantined with rampant plague, as the collective actions of key people attempt to fight against the surmounting death totals that strike and kill individuals seeming at random to the point where all feels absurd and hope is what you make it. Originally published in 1947, The Plague is widely regarded as an allegorical look at the Nazi occupation of Paris where Camus worked for the underground resistance as a journalist, though to read it now in a post-2020 world full of COVID is a starling experience that hits close to home. But there is no better time to read it than now in it’s recently retranslated form, brilliantly accomplished by Laura Marris, and feel Camus’ words resonate all the louder through an unsettling familiarity. A philosophical perspective (Camus refused the label of existentialist) on the human condition in the face of oppressive evil and a rallying call for collective resistance, this eerily prescient novel makes for an oddly comforting and darkly infectious read.This book has lasting power not only for the subject matter but the ways Camus approaches them. There are an excellent cast of characters: the overburdened Dr. Rieux; the mysterious Jean Tarrou; Grand, the government clerk endlessly working death toll figures and his first sentence; the journalist Rambert and more. Their actions fighting the plague together make for a book that has been hotly discussed for decades with so much to consider like the ideas behind stylistic choices, the allegorical implications, the philosophical questions on death, god, and even Camus’ own life in relation. It is fascinating to run our current issues through the lens of Camus’ tale, and as Alice Yaeger Kaplan writes in States of Plague: Reading Albert Camus in a Pandemic, a book co-written with rotating essays from her and translator Laura Marris, ‘Camus allegorized war as plague, but plague, too, can be deployed as a political allegory.’ Examining the interplay of the two has made The Plague a fascinating read that is as striking today as ever before. ‘Stagnation was the order of the day, several hundred-thousand people kept on stagnating through never-ending weeks.’There are moments reading The Plague where, had I gone in with no knowledge of the book, author or the year it was written, it would have read like a parody of the year 2020. There are so many little tidbits that made me laugh, roll my eyes, or cringe at the sheer familiarity of it. Talks of underlying conditions, a hoax to hurt business, faith over fear, the first to be caught breaking restrictions being an official who wrote them, empty streets, protests, the list goes on. I spent 2020 in Michigan where we didn’t have much of a ‘lockdown,’ especially not compared to Oran in this novel, but the passages of empty streets, empty skies, and endless longing resonated hard. ‘There is nothing less spectacular than a scourge,’ Camus writes, ‘the terrible days of plague didn’t appear as tall flames, sumptuous and cruel, but rather as an endless stagnation.’ While I personally had been very busy and productive during that time, it captures a feeling heard all over the world. In some ways reading The Plague today makes one feel nothing ever changes, human behavior in times of crisis is rather predictable, and while Camus’ allegory reads as hauntingly familiar, it never makes you despair and his hope for humanity burns bright in the dark.Following his work The Stranger, which was centered on the ‘I’, here we have the voice of ‘we’, as Camus captures ‘collective trauma rather than individual struggle,’ to remind that ‘the scourge concerns everyone.’ Laura Marris does an excellent job with the translation, delivering a fluid work that is highly readable but also capturing Camus’ intent behind his stylistic choices. Marris says she avoided using current phrasings to keep the novel separate from the 2020 events, like serum instead of vaccine, but it is most noted through the restraint intended in his language. For example, while Marris has translated ‘il fallait recommencer’ as ‘they must begin again,’ the original translation from Stuart Gilbert has ‘they must set their shoulders to the wheel again.’ While this does sort of recall images of Sisyphus, Marris writes in the translation notes that Gilbert’s translation came under post-WWII bravado and added a sense of heroism throughout the book but ‘real hope, for Camus, isn’t heroic,’ she says ‘it’s quiet and necessary and it hurts.’‘There is no heroism in any of this. It's about honesty.’The Plague's narrator rejects ideas of heroism and seeks to ‘put heroism in the secondary role it deserves.’ Camus uses this to show that it isn’t individual heroism but collective resistance that gives hope. ‘There is a plague, we must defend ourselves,’ Dr Rieux remarks, emphasizing that resistance should be the natural response. To put emphasis on heroism has negative consequences the narrator warns:’this way, you allow people to suppose that honorable actions have such high value because they are rare, and that wickedness and indifference are much more frequent drivers behind human actions…The evil in this world almost always comes from ignorance, and goodwill can do as much damage as wickedness if it's not well informed.’French literary professor Oliver Gloag criticizes the allegory of fascism as it removes ‘all agency from history’ those committing evil. Which is a fair point and I tend to prefer Alba Amoia’s perspective in her book on Camus that this novel is more an expression on ‘a paradigm of man’s ability, through individual choice, to mitigate the evils endemic in the human condition.’ Which complements Gloag’s notion that the plague is more a symbol through which Camus explores his concept of revolt best expressed in The Rebel. Akin to Hannah Arendt writings on the mundanities of evil, Camus shows that resistance is the only reasonable choice, and while those who are passive are (in Arendt’s & Tarrou’s perspectives) thereby part of the evil they allow, this is not always necessarily wickedness as much as ignorance. ‘[T]he most desperate vice comes from the person who is ignorant but believes he knows everything.’ In a book where plague fatigue sets in, where people begin to protest the authorities confining them more than the plague killing them, or lash out at the doctor for not having enough pity as if that would save anyone, Camus shows how this is counter to the spirit of resistance and thusly welcoming evil. In this way, too, it seems a stern warning against misinformation and how ignorance can be just as dangerous as wickedness.‘All human sorrow came from not keeping language clear.’The above quote is key to his narrative style in, though critics have deemed it ‘rigorously and studiously unbeautiful’. As Tarrou says that ‘clear speech and action,’ is critical to preventing the loss of life, ‘the narrator has stuck to objectivity in order to betray nothing, and above all, to remain true to himself.’ Especially today where the way we market an idea tends to carry more weight than the validity or truth behind an idea, clarity is key when chronicling a history, as is remaining objective and removing emotion lest it be ‘thrilling with the evils of spectacle.’ Words are something people got hung on too (how often we saw this in 2020, like semantic debates or misunderstanding that science is testing theories and shifts direction with new information), hence when pressed by his colleagues early on about what measures to take, Rieux responds ‘I don’t care about the phrasing…we shouldn’t act as if half the city isn’t at risk of being killed, because then it will be.’ Sometimes it is more about the spirit than the semantics. Camus received heavy criticism for this style from Jean-Paul Sartre and Roland Barthes, the latter he wrote a letter hoping to clear up what he believed was a misinterpretation of the novel by Barthes, ending it with assurances that he has utmost respect for Barthes.However, there is another aspect to the style that speaks volumes about the ideas underlying the novel. In the end we discover the narrator is (view spoiler)[Dr. Rieux (hide spoiler)] who sets out to be an ‘objective witness’. This chronicle of the history of the plague is a response to the ‘long series of similar scenes, repeated indefinitely’ (the most Sisyphean character of the novel would be Rieux and his daily grind fighting against a plague that always wins the battle over each individual life) that allows humanity to have the victors perspective on the past. But, in the face of absurdity, perhaps it is something more. In his notebooks, Camus wrote:‘[T]here is no other objection to the totalitarian attitude than the religious or moral objection. If this world is meaningless then they are right. I do not accept that they are right. Therefore…it is on us to create God. He is not the creator. That is all of Christianity's history. Because we have only one way to create God and that is to become God.’The narrator is, in effect, becoming God. Camus long fought against god-like authorities, and placing a human as the omniscient narrator usurps the authority of god, placing our destinies in the hands of humans. Rieux believes in the work of people and as the plague seemed an absurd, unpredictable, force of nature he must counter, he ‘believed he was on the true path, fighting against creation.’ As he explains to Tarrou:‘Since the order of the world is ruled by death, perhaps it’s better for God if we don’t believe in him and if we fight against death with all our might, without raising our eyes to the heavens where he keeps silent.’He is a doctor and to put all in God’s hands would be to deny his own purpose against the onslaught of death. ‘The absurd is born of this confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world,’ Camus wrote in Sisyphus, and Rieux must resign himself to live on even in the face of absurdity.The question of God looms large in this novel, particularly as God’s existence would imply God allowed all the suffering. In one of the more existential discourses in the book, Dr. Rieux and Jesuit priest Father Paneloux witness the painful death of an innocent child. Paneloux, a symbol of organized religion, moves from having seen the plague as God’s retribution against sinners to preaching that there is no picking and choosing what aspects of religion you believe and which you don’t: an all or nothing, and either/or. His acceptance of it all comes moments before his untimely death due to the plague. Rieux, on the other hand, states ‘I will refuse until death to love that creation where children are tortured,’ and his only moment of outward anger in the entire book is directed at Paneloux following the child’s death. Camus positions Rieux as defender of innocence and views the church as being too silent.‘This epidemic doesn’t teach me anything new, except the need to fight by your side.’This is not an easy novel, probing the darkness of death in many ways, but Camus always looks for the light. Tarrou is another figure who represents Camus’ own existential forays into morality and mortality as he has fled his past and aims to be a secular saint making his life’s work fighting against death. His particular calling came when realizing the horrors of the death penalty, knowing his father—a judge—passed these sentences, and coming to understand that any silence in the face of it is complicity in these murders. Many of these ideas reflect Camus’ own ideas, which he wrote as Reflections on the Guillotine alongside a similar argument for the abolition of the death penalty by Arthur Koestler. Rieux and Tarrou make a perfect pairing, two men fighting against death, not bothering with a belief in God, battling exhaustion and chance to hopefully keep as many people alive before it is their turn to return to the soil.‘The dying clutching at the living with a mixture of legitimate hate and stupid hope.’The horrors of the plague permeate every page. It is interesting to see it set in Oran, Algeria, which represents a reversal of Camus own life where he returned to Paris under occupation while his wife remained in Algeria. Here, Rieux’s wife leaves Algeria while he stays under occupation. Perhaps it is also, Laura Marris theorizes, because Oran represents an isolated city, ‘a city with it’s back to the sea,’ as Camus wrote in his essay on Algeria in Summer. Isolation and separations are major themes here, with Rambert spending the bulk of the novel trying to flee the city for his wife, only to end up in a Kafkaesque labyrinth of being passed from smuggler to smuggler and delayed again and again before opting to stay and fight. What works quite well is the way Camus triggers historical memory of plagues with his descriptions, recalling the great plagues of history (and now, our own current pandemic). The plague begins with rats coming to the surface to die, which he wrote based on a description of rat plagues by Adrien Proust, the father of great French writer Marcel Proust. As Marris writes in States of Plague, ‘it must have pleased Camus, who felt shut out by the literary opulence of Proust’s milieu, to turn the Proustian teacake into a dead rat,’ done by utilizing Proust’s own family. The Plague was a divisive novel, being a huge commercial success while also facing strong criticisms. The arguments over the book sometimes feel like the political debates over the 2020 pandemic itself. In The Cambridge Companion to Camus, Margaret E. Gray argues the narrator as an oppressor silencing individualism the same as the plague silenced it’s victims, ‘privileging the collective over the personal' and weaponizing the government against the people. Which is an argument that was used frequently against any preventative measures such as masks. Which is interesting to see play out with this book, which is not without criticism. For a novel set in Algeria, there aren’t really any Algerians in the story and are instead the background people it is implied are dying in higher amounts in the poorer districts that were ‘more crowded or less comfortable’ (this, along with the high deaths in jails there also recalls issues of our recent pandemic). But women, too, are notably absent. Literally in most cases such as the various wives outside the quarantine, who’s only role is to wait for their men to come, or Rieux’s mostly silent mother only serving as his housekeeper, which isn’t a great depiction either. It is unfortunate to note that Camus spoke out against feminism, and particularly railed against Simone de Beauvoir’s The Second Sex, which he said humiliated the French male. Not great.There is so much to say about this imperfect yet rather impressive novel. When Camus died, William Faulkner wrote his obituary saying ‘When the door shut for him he had already written on this side of it that which every artist who also carries through life with him that one same foreknowledge and hatred of death, is hoping to do: I was here.’ Camus’s The Plauge, likely amongst the best books I'll read all year, reads like all of humanity with fists in the air proudly saying ‘I was here.’5/5‘When you see the suffering and the pain it brings, you'd have to be crazy, blind, or cowardly to resign yourself to the plague.’...more",Notes are private!,0,334,1,"Mar 07, 2023","Mar 07, 2023","Mar 07, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57088641-the-plague

But when an actual crane comes to stay, usurping her father’s role as her tapestry artist mother falls deeply in love and spends all day in the studio or in bed with the crane neglecting her children, and with no money or food coming in, things begin to get desperate and our narrator must take action. A sinister and subversive modern retelling of the Japanese myth Tsuru Nyōbō (The Crane Wife), Kelly Barnhill weaves her own magic in this deeply layer, eerie tale where grim realities of generational trauma and domestic abuse collide with the powers of art and myth making for a delightfully dark read.There are variations on the original folktale, but the basis is that a farmer marries a crane disguised as a woman who then uses her own feathers to weave beautiful tapestries which the farmer sells and becomes rich. But he is never happy, always demanding more and more, unaware his wife—who grows thinner by the day and does not allow him to watch her weave—is actually a crane. The story is of interest to the father, who tells our narrator this story as he is on his deathbed, seeing as his wife is herself a weaver and he explains the long history of weavers in myths around the world being able to change fate with the single pull of a thread. But ‘why a crane?’ he wonders of the folktale:‘Cranes are mean. Cruel, you know? Just ask any frog or fish in the pond. A crane is a predator just like any other predator-sneaky, and opportunistic. Not one of them would have the patience for weaving, or for beauty for its own sake. A crane would make someone else do it for him. A mouse maybe. Or a beautiful spider. He'd work it nearly to death, and then he'd eat it.’This may prove darkly portentous in Barnhill’s retelling, where the cruel animalistic behavior of the crane is also metaphorical for abuse. Barnhill’s tale hinges on the believability that the mother is dating a literal crane and, wonder upon wonders, she pulls it off beautifully. A Newbery Medal Winner for her absolutely stunning junior fiction novel, The Girl Who Drank the Moon, Barnhill has an incredible capacity for infusing childlike wonderment and whimsy into dark adult fiction that makes this novel work so successfully. While aimed at an adult audience, this is a story that would likely register equally well with anyone from teenagers on, having a sort of timeless and broad appeal much like folktales themselves. ‘I was nothing like my mother. I was everything like my mother. Both at the same time.’Generational trauma is at the heart of this story, with the narrator hearing the long legacy of hard fathers and vanished women on the family farm. The mother explains it very plainly, insisting on it as literal fact despite the narrator questioning if this was just a metaphor:“On the farm,” she said quietly, “mothers fly away like migrating birds. And fathers die too young. This is why farmers have daughters. To keep things going in the meantime, until it’s our time to grow wings. Go soaring away across the sky.”What a legacy to have to live up to, especially in a town where her family is the source of gossip with more believable tales of her grandmother hopping a train to become strung out on drugs. All tales the mother dismisses as the typical misogynistic response to the inherent magic of women, yet she herself has not flown away in keeping with the timeline of farm mothers taking flight when their children reach the age of 5. Instead she weaves tapestries, which the daughter sells online under the fake name “Bruce. ‘My mother’s tapestries contained multitudes,’ she tells us of her mother’s artwork that has moved people to tears or break out in song, ‘her method of gathering materials was as haphazard and serendipitous as the way she lived the rest of her life…each item was stitched into the story.’ Barnhill nests the idea of creating narratives into her own story, reminding us that ‘art exists to transcend, transfix, and transform.’ This is a lovely sentiment, enlarged all the more considering The Crane Husband is itself transcending and transforming a familiar tale into a modern context about family and trauma.‘No one person owned the farm. No one walked the farm. The farm belonged to machines and shareholders. No one loved it anymore. No one was tied to it anymore.’The family legacy with the farm has been severed, however, as the family had to sell it off decade ago. ‘There was no farm anymore to fly from,’ the narrator considers, wondering if this is why their mother hasn’t followed the family tradition of flying away, ‘how can you run from your birthright when your birthright is gone?’ The farm now belonged to a conglomerate of stock-holders living far away and the rows and rows of corn are no longer tended by the hands of laborers and run entirely by machines. Drones police the skies while automated plows tend the fields, with living people only arriving once a year for a share-holder meeting to ‘pretend that they were still connected to the land.’ This dystopian farm setting probes fears of humans put out of work by machines, but also is representative of a world where magic and myths are fading such as the legacy of women transforming into birds. ‘Even birds weren’t allowed,’ we are told and the sky is entirely empty aside from the drones keeping anyone away, drones with sharp blades that could slice up a crane if it flew across the field, or the mysterious naked man that one night appeared in their barn bleeding from a run-in with the drones.Barnhill also employs this lifeless farm as an expression of climate change. We see the industrialization of the farm leaving behind ‘the plowed-up remains of coyotes and foxes and birds littering the fields,’ while the drones are ‘devouring the world with their eyes.’ There is an unsettling tone built through menacing depictions of the natural world, the sky always oppressively empty, and even the stars are ‘so bright and sharp it hurt to look at.’ Spring seems to come earlier each year to this midwest town and ‘soon, people said, there would be no winter at all.’ As the methods of old, the storytelling of old, begins to vanish along with the mythology they carry, so too does the world as it is replaced by heartless machines and algorithms.‘How can anyone survive that kind of love?’The abuse of the planet is mirrored in the abusive relationships in the story. The mother tells of her father being a ‘hard’ man, of the ways he beat his wife until she finally flew away. This opens a cycle of excusing abuse, with the mother frequently bruised after encounters with brief lover. The gashes left on her body from the crane’s beak and talons during their time in bed (oh yes, Barnhill goes there) she dismisses as natural—he is a wild animal after all—which implies that she views the bruises from being hit during the night by what must be a man in the house as just the natural way of things as well. This harkens back to the original tale in which the man becomes abusive as his mysterious wife doesn’t produce enough art fast enough for him, and we see the mother deteriorating as she struggles to achieve a tapestry that satisfies the crane. Like the crane wife growing thinner as she uses up her feathers, the mother grows thinner without nourishment and the children go hungry. Yet she doesn’t seem to notice or care. ‘You can’t live on love, Mom,’ the daughter admonishes her, ‘it’s not possible.’‘She was a flash of downy white, leaving the farm behind. Feathers and wings and all. And sky for days.’Kelly Barnhill pulls off a nearly miraculous narrative here, stitching reality, myth, art and the power of storytelling into her own startling tapestry. The story moves slowly but engagingly, weaving the past and present together towards a shocking but well-earned climax that is certain to satisfy. Even at its most unsettling, Barnhill’s prose proves oddly comforting, seducing the reader forward with a rather dreamlike cadence full of striking imagery and rolling phrasing, even when the dreamlike nature becomes a waking nightmare. The characters are quite endearing too, from the narrator dodging Social Services to care for her charming little brother, to even the sinister crane who is handled with such expertise as to really bring his scenes to life regardless of how outlandish they would otherwise seem. Everything feels very natural, everything is expertly balanced, tight and taut across this 120pg novella, and Barnhill’s history working in children’s literature comes alive making this a fairy tale for adults that reads with a charm rarely felt beyond being an actual child reading the finest of imaginative junior fiction. I'm told the story bears resemblance to her previous novel, When Women Were Dragons, though here it is working as a retelling and done in a slight amount of space. The Crane Husband is a massive success and an unnerving foray into abuse and myth that has like left its feather in my heart and mind where they will stay for a long, long time.4.5/5‘I could make it beautiful.

Still not a shocker he argues that he never meant it to mean anything about trans people, just the idea of it, as if someone's existence is just jolly fun for a spirited debate by those completely outside the situation. But that’s his goal, because now it’s a debate over semantics where either he means violence, or he just simply meant that trans people should not be welcome or accommodated in society which isn’t actually any better and he will get the screen time he craves because of it. It’s a classic example of crybullying for edgy points where this podcaster knows damn well that he nudged the language of genocide so he can smugly act innocent but ensure the message was delivered all the same. Which is the lesson he wants to teach with Speechless, a book that, while attempting to show how knowing the rules, buzzwords and cherry-picked research can create word games that seem to make a point, crumbles under its own weight from lack of critical thinking in actual application. Knowing the terms and using rhetoric productively are two different things. This is the equivalent of the person in a classroom who spends a great deal of time arguing technicalities that are essentially meaningless instead of actually doing an assignment and insisting they get a good grade, which amounts to not much other than edgelord posturing. This whole book is just mediocrity screaming through a bullhorn. Sure, there is a great deal of supposed research here, but it is more about framing a useful narrative than adherence to reality. Which, in his defense, is part of the point I suppose, as a major point he sobs about is that “leftists” control language to achieve their purpose, but his understanding of language seems very narrow and neglects that language is not a precise tool but is instead a very malleable system of signifiers that naturally adapt. It’s as if poetry or fiction are complete strangers to his worldview. A primary purpose for his work is to uphold christian mythology and to assert that people must push out anything in society that isn’t moving towards Christian theocracy. So, here’s another episode of I Read It So You Don’t Have To.The groundwork of this book is his argument that free speech absolutism is just not realistic and that all societies have engaged in censorship or suppression of some form. For the most part this segment and arguments are well constructed, it does start to get pretty authoritarian when he calls for embracing censorship. This book is certainly written with a conservative audience in mind, though not all right-wingers as libertarians are also under attack from him (this book, I assume, is a call to move to the upper right of the political compass). He attacks Republicans who believe in a neutral public square where all opinions should be heard (he uses the term RINO often, and this book does include a lot of in-group specific terminology) as having opened the door for what he believes to be social ills, which is primarily any sort of inclusivity or pluralism in society. Knowles isn't against censorship, just that he thinks the ways speech is curtailed in the US is faulty and it all sort of boils down to he thinks that accommodating views other than conservative Christianity is to blame. The basis of the aspects of controlling words is he talks about making really tricky semantic choices so you can get a message across while washing your hands like Pontius Pilot. Basically crybully your way through arguments acting super elitist. It's not great, and he pretty openly preaches that the point is to be divisive through manipulation of words. It's the type of person that will constantly try to re-contextualize any argument to fit their needs. Wittgenstein once said an argument is only worthwhile if it is two people digging the same hole from both sides to seek truth together, Knowles falls under a category of attention seeking that Wittgenstein stresses are not people worth taking seriously.Also, people like Knowles who love to cite 1984 in opposition against leftists know he said about that very book 'every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it,' and was loud and proud about being a socialist, right? Moving on, there is just a lot of really bad faith stuff here. It’s not worth reading and it’s not even particularly interesting. He spends a lot of time denying that institutionalized racism exists by citing the popularity of Ta-Nehisi Coates, because apparently in his mind if Black people can win the National Book Award then racism must have been solved? He also talks about how rape isn’t a problem on campus because Botswana (why Botswana? Is it supposed to just imply Black people?) has more sexual assaults, then picks four examples of retracted sexual assault statements to insist that most women (he frequently uses the antiquated term ‘strumpet’ which probably hasn’t been used since The Big Lebowski) make up claims for attention. This is the sort of rhetoric that makes it harder on those who are victims to speak up and holds an umbrella for abusers. Couple this with his statement that drinking and college go hand-in-hand so if you are passed out drunk it is your own fault for being assaulted. Gross, dude. Sounds like Knowles is the problem here.There’s a whole bunch of sobbing about cancel culture despite being in support of censorship of anyone on the left. But he doesn't mean canceling like the cops murdering Fred Hampton to silence him but more just people saying mean things on twitter they disagree with, and a lot of claims about social media “suppressing” voices and being shady. Which like, yea, social media are for-profit businesses, does he honestly expect them to not be? It’s just odd his argument is that leftists are trying to be make everyone Marxist but apparently also to blame for capitalism doing what it does? Like, of course content moderation is a thing on a social media site that is funded by advertising. Not great but what does anyone honestly expect? Also he really harps on a “war on christmas” and I have no clue what the fuck that even means. He lives in the US, where its the biggest retail season of the year. Nobody is trying to end christmas lol But the key issue is that Knowles' ideas wallow in their own inconsistencies because manipulation is the goal instead of realistically useful rhetoric. He attempts to discredit ideas on the basis that academic institutions cannot be trusted and are marxist, yet then cites Princeton (an academic institution) saying the 1619 Project has inconsistencies as a reason to dismiss the entirety of it. He also uses faulty sources or single, highly debatable ones, as sweeping ""evidence"" against larger ideas. He is a person that knows rules of logic but is not interested in using them to construct his own arguments, only weaponizing them against any others, knowing them well enough to be manipulative about it. OH but he also blames Derrida for ruining language but then admits he’s never read Derrida. But it gets into some weird stuff where like, apparently phenomenology is an attack against US republicans? I don’t think Husserl was thinking about Donald Trump, sorry bruh. A lot of the philosophy of language in this book is, like everything else, rather selected for what is useful and anything else is apparently atheist propaganda. This guy really goes out of your way to let you know he dislikes anyone who is non-Christian (but only hyper specific types of Christian) but he really hates atheists. He also believed there is a definitive and fixed moral code, something philosophy Simone De Beauvoir and Sartre really drove home as being nonsensical and useless in the face of reality.Knowles sums it all up when he writes ‘all cultures have standards, so conservatives should try to suppress the Left and its organizations.’ So he’s not against “cancel culture,” just against any pushback on what he thinks and openly supports silencing critics. What he means by the Left is a complete mystery in this book as the term seems to be a placeholder for anyone who disagrees with him. Except for Republicans who believe in an equal public square, he hates them too and blames them for the most part. Knowles comes across as a bitter rhetorical regurgitator riding the coattails of people like Ben Shapiro (another podcaster who is relatively known in small corners of the internet) desperate for attention. He is pedantic to a fault, stuffing his sentences with as many big terms as possible less as an appeal to academia but more in a showy way to insist on himself. He spends a lot of space saying things like 'Political correctness has left us speechless, but the right to speak means nothing to those who have nothing to say,' which is just utterly fucking meaningless and sounds like something people wrote as a Myspace status in 2005 to sound smart but just meant that they were currently getting high in their mom's minivan. Every aspect of the book and the writing gives the appearance of being dense despite rather shallow thinking. Anyways, a main theme is that free speech absolutists are wrong and that it has paved the way for marxism and atheism. Strict evangelical moralism, he argues, is the only way forward and he even goes so far to deny that Christianity incorporated aspects of paganism and that it is false that Christmas incorporates aspects of other beliefs. Which is a weird claim to make.But this whole book is awkward and ends up nothing more than smug edgelord static. Even those who might agree with him are probably better off looking elsewhere as this is pretty useless rhetoric on topics that aren't fresh and is more about being seen for an opinion than having one that is useful. Not that I agree with any of it, but even in an effort of fairness it's still garbage. He also offers little to no advice at what to actually do if these are the opinions you hold (even saying 'I have intentionally avoided precisely what [people] ought to say...I will not attempt to tack on a new conservative governing philosophy.'). It is just a lot of empty rhetoric. Still I'm sure there will be people hooting and hollering over this mess, but at the end of the day I'm really not into this and can't wait to forget he exists....more",Notes are private!,0,107,1,not set,not set,"Mar 05, 2023",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/55385983-speechless

Door in the Mountain, a new and selected poems collection of her work between 1965-2003, is an incredible voyage through the former New York State Poet’s impressive worlds of words. There is a hushed reverence to her poetry, which moves with incredible calm and grace and then strike with incredible sharpness, all within an very dreamlike cadence and overall vibe. Often quite short, her poems avoid excess and are highly calibrated and precise, her words delivered as if on the edge of a knife. Door in the Moutain, titled from one of her most well-loved poems, is a dreamy, poetic feast and gorgeous testimony of her amazing vision.Door in the MountainNever ran this hard through the valleynever ate so many stars I was carrying a dead deertied on to my neck and shouldersdeer legs hanging in front of meheavy on my chestPeople are not wantingto let me inDoor in the mountainlet me inValentine, who passed in 2021, had a marvelous career having been named the New York State Poet Laureate in 2008, winning the National Book Award in 2004 (for this very collection), was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, taught a graduate program at Columbia and was a Distinguished Poet-in-Residence at Drew’s University. Her first collection of poetry, Dream Barker and Other Poems, won the Yale Series of Younger Poets Award in 1965 and she went on to publish more than a dozen volumes during her lifetime as well as translations of Osip Mandelstam and Marina Tsvetaeva, publishing Dark Elderberry Branch: Poems of Marina Tsvetaeva as a project along with another favorite poet of mine, Ilya Kaminsky. She often cited Sylvia Plath as a huge inspiration to the start of her writing career, though another major influence was her dreams, something rather detectable the the overall feel of her works. She once went on record saying ‘My dreams were very important to me right in the beginning. I had a teacher in college who said ‘You could write from your dreams’ and that was like being given a bag full of gold.’ I really love the dreamlike quality of her works, though I find she works best in her shorter poems. Not that the long ones are lacking but it is highly impressive how much emotional weight she can put in just a few lines, such as a personal favorite, My Words to You:My words to you are the stitches in a scarf I don’t want to finish maybe it will come to be a blanket or a net to hold you here  love not gone anywhereValentine is often very soothing, being able to deal with both the personal and the political with ease and a calm vision. Though what is there to say that could ever match what the poet Adrienne Rich wrote of her works:’Looking into a Jean Valentine poem is like looking into a lake: you can see your own outline, and the shapes of the upper world, reflected among rocks, underwater life, glint of lost bottles, drifted leaves. The known and familiar become one with the mysterious and half-wild, at the place where consciousness and the subliminal meet. This is a poetry of the highest order, because it lets us into spaces and meanings we couldn’t approach in any other way.’This sums Valentine up so well. She’s a poet who was able to bring her entire being into a poem, having told her students that the poetry she likes best is when it is evident it is written by ‘someone who is just going to go to the absolute end of their rope for this thing.’ In such a short amount of space, Valentine is always able to make words come so alive.( from Sanctuary)Not listening. Now. Not watching. Safe inside my own skin.To die, not having listened. Not having asked ... To have scattered life.Yes I know: the thread you have to keep finding, over again, to follow it back to life; I know. Impossible, sometimes.Door in the Mountain is a wonderful way to introduce yourself to this fantastic poet. It is, as one would expect, a great offering of the most notable poems from the duration of her career, poems that feel so very personal and intimate yet have an incredible universality to them. She is also quite accessible, making them poems that are easy and welcoming to enter, but the layers of feeling and her extraordinary way with words will have you wanting to nestle within the poems for a long time, coming back time and time again. An amazing poet and an amazing collection.4.5/5For Loveyou leapt sometimesyou walked away sometimesthat time on the phone youcouldn’t get your breathI leapt but couldn’t get to youI caught the brow that bid the deadI caught the bough that hidI’m, you know, still here,tulip, resin, temporary—...more",Notes are private!,0,91,1,"Mar 04, 2023","Mar 04, 2023","Mar 04, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/508192.Door_in_the_Mountain

Infusing Irish myth with a story about a family processing grief, Song of the Sea is a beautiful story that comes alive through some of the finest animation I have ever seen, making complete sense to create a graphic novel edition just to look at the jaw-dropping artwork. I mean look how pretty this is:  [image]This is a really moving story, one that follows a sibling rivalry into a deep sibling bonding and friendship as the older brother, Ben, must protect his mute sister, Saoirse, as she discovers she is a selkie and unlocks a whimsical but threatening mythological world. Saoirse must free the faerie creatures of Irish myth from the Celtic goddess Macha, which forms a really lovely theme of magic and myth returning to the natural world as Ireland is moving towards an industrialized global economy in the early 90s. At the heard of this story, however, is processing grief after the death of the mother. ‘People, especially children, still need a way to think around loss,’ film director Tomm Moore says about the story, and this is a gorgeous tale in a minor key that addresses these issues in a very heartfelt manner.   [image]This graphic novel doesn’t add much and is basically a frame-by-frame of the film, but it captures how gorgeous the art is. The character design is rather simple and geometrical but they still manage to convey an incredible amount of emotion. I love the textures to the world and how spherical everything is, with curved lines making all the landscape flow like waves. Using a watercolor-like style also captures, according to the production team, the wetness of the Irish landscapes while being rather dreamlike and fantastical. What I love best is the use of light in the artwork, which really pops. As I said, there’s not much to this beyond being the movie in book format, but Samuel Sattin (who adapted this) does make lovely use of the space on the page:  [image]One bonus to this book, however, is an additional Irish folktake told at the end of the book. The story follows a couple who raise a roan as a child, but must eventually watch it return to the sea. It is a cute little story and the artwork is delightful.  [image]This is a wonderful book for anyone who loves the film and it is a great way to revisit the story and enjoy the world renowned animation. I love this movie, and my 3 year old's middle name, Saoirse, definitely was inspired by this movie.

It is something like dream logic, which I suppose‘Happiness makes you become what you hate.’The landscapes of love have their own unique inner-logic. It is something like dream logic, which I suppose I should say is more a lack of rational logic, something that is often baffling and incongruous from the outside but while within it makes complete sense. It's the leaps in logic that tell you dumping your entire bank account and selling off anything you can to get a passport and flight across the ocean for a weekend is totally normal (I stand by it), or, as happens here in Keiran Goddard’s Hourglass, find it romantic and sexy to have your partner ‘push a bit of chewed-up potato into my mouth as if I were a baby bird.’ Goddard has a gift at mining the private moments of relationships, be it with a lover or yourself, and exposing how humorous it is outside the present internal emotion while still retaining the reverence for that internal emotion. Hourglass uses humor to probe the depths of the heart and the discomfort of modern living and loving, appearing almost like prose poetry in a sparse stream-of-consciousness style of singular sentences spaced out across the page in vignettes to embody a particular moment. It is a tale as old as time: boy meets girl, boy and girl dance a romance, boy loses girl and must cope with the loss while finding a way to keep on living, yet Goddard’s sardonic humor (there’s nearly a stand-up comedian delivery to it all) and wit keep it fresh and highly relatable while still feeling very personal. Like any relationship that has come to a close, this is a heartfelt, eccentric blend of comedy and sorrow that is perhaps a bit overly meandering and stuffed despite the short length and slender prose, yet Goddard’s insights makes for a worthwhile fling with Hourglass.‘We are trying to make a home. But you are considerably better at it than I am.’This is a very quirky story made all the more offbeat with the staccato style of singular sentences spaced out and leaping from idea to idea that feels like my ADHD brain and has earned comparisons to Jenny Offill, though the very internet and millennial style humor, irony and clear attempts to be relatable reminded me most of Patricia Lockwood’s No One is Talking About This. Another who comes to mind is Max Porter, particularly in the ways this book deals with a sensitive person who dislikes the toxic masculinities that many men present but also can’t quite figure out how to exist in a world while being so vulnerable. It’s a quick read, smacking you with ideas one after another and rotating fists of funny and sad which leaves you emotionally drained by the end. In a good way.The narrator is clearly intelligent, with that sort of overly academic humor that cuts right to the philosophical heart of issues, and it is amusing to watch him rant at society. This is the type of person that makes acute observations and bold remarks such as ‘I convinced myself that stock phrases were fascist and that we all had a duty to unpetrify the language,’ and the type that masks discomfort with drinking too much and humor, the combination of which makes him stand-offish when drunk and arguing things laced with contempt like ‘the poetry of Keats isn’t factual, but only an idiot would say it isn’t true.’ This is the type of person I definitely know, and (shamefully) sometimes am, so uhh… Goddard, what's up with all these personal attacks, mate? When not working an after-hours stockroom shift at a bookstore, he contemplates writing a book on why he hates cars and pens op-eds almost nobody publishes with Very Online style titles—a running gag through the book is to punctuate an idea with the headline he would write about the subject complete with the word count in parentheses—such as The Climate Crisis Has Taken That Most Banal Conversa­tional Topic—the Weather—and Injected It With a Constant Undercurrent of Looming Existential Dread, LOL! or even Maybe the Real Price of Oil Was the Friends We Made Along the Way! (4,004 words). The latter is his first publication and the doorway into the relationship central to the novel:‘ It was you. You published it. You paid me seventy-five pounds and in response I spent the rest of my life loving you.’The story is written to a ‘you,’ which is understood as the woman in the failed relationship he is recounting and makes this read much like a letter to her trying to understand it all. But the perspective doesn’t always hold up contextually, though instead of seeming like a flaw it feels like it welcomes YOU the reader to embody the addressed you and I like to think of this as a love affair between Goddard and me, the reader. Sexy, right? Getting all into each other’s vulnerable grey matter. But anyways, what unfolds is some rather beautiful reminiscing on love always tinged in a prevailing sadness being told from a present where these memories are now draining of color and curling at the edges like old photographs in a shoebox that is disconsolating to look at but you can’t quite throw away (but definitely need to if you get in another relationship, don’t keep those things, nobody wants to find that). There are some lovely phrases though here that embody the excitement and terror of a fresh relationship quite well, such as:‘That time, the second time you came, we went from bar to bar to bar. It made the city feel smaller. Like a map we were folding to the size of a stamp. We were good at that. We could have fit and entire universe inside a matchbox.’Goddard is good at capturing ineffable sadness as well with observations that allow reality to drain away the magic yet still shimmer in the prose like: ‘There were no stars when we left the bar. The sky looked like the inside of a cheap tent.’ It also gets into some embarrassing and gross shit with admissions like ‘I ate one of the hair balls once. Just a small one. It tasted like you. Like the sheer fucking stun of you.’ Yet in these moments, with a delivery like a stand-up comedian, we see just how much the illogic of the logic of love is a pervasive and fulfilling emotion. It’s private and beautiful because we are all gross anyways and Hourglass is most successful when addressing being vulnerable, accepting we are gross, being weird, being open to hurt and then, being vulnerable enough to look inward and move on.‘I start walking to work, remembering how loving you has changed everything. How love snuck through the city and repainted it when we weren’t paying attention.’The later segments of the novel are morose, with the humor laughed out with a bit of a bite to it. We sit in the narrator’s head while he tries and fails to be a person, we see him berate a child he thinks is stealing his can of beans only for him to be a Boy Scout there to help bag (okay that part is billed as sad but the delivery is so funny). A woman once tells the narrator living with him ‘is like living with the sad ghost of a failed comedian,’ and we witness him haunt himself over the course of five years since the breakup. Her line is a perfect metaphor for this book, which, while funny and well-done, has that sort of not-quite-there feel that comedy films that try too hard to also be sad and moralizing relationship dramas. Not that Goddard seems like he is trying too hard, quite the opposite this rolls out like a beautiful new baby as natural and naked as can be, but it does just seem like it should be a pre-scandal Louis C.K. movie of him being sad and vulgar through the dying embers of a relationship, which would probably not have been as good as this book but you get the vibe. It gets uncomfortable, which is well done and makes a good point. We see how he is his own undoing, the ways his drinking and constant need to be ironically humorous or hating things can make him difficult to be around. As someone who can’t seem to ever shut off their mind (look at the length of these s, sorry everyone), seeing him rant about how its sad both the Flintstones and the Jetsons are depressing because we can’t imagine a past or future that isn’t just a nuclear family arguing about chores and how much she just does not want to hear it because being with someone like that all the time is exhausting. I feel attacked but I appreciate it, and I enjoy that Goddard doesn’t make this a whole ‘you gotta change your life and your ways you fucking loser’ but more of a reminder we have to carry on and maybe do it in a less self-inflicting and self-destructive way but don’t lose the spark of who you are.How much is too much? the narrator asks near the end a few times. Which, unfortunately, is also the question I had about what I felt over the book while reading it. Because it is short and a easy read to speed through, but it also felt anfractuous and too much for the style. There’s something to be said that this type of living and approach to the world isn’t enough to build a life on, which is embodied by the way the book is almost too weightless to drape it’s musings over. There are a lot of really great elements but they don’t necessarily blend and sometimes it feels like even in a less is more style narrative, less would have been more and could have allowed a greater focus. ‘But beyond hating work generally, I also hate my work specifically.’That said I LOVED how much he peppered in social criticism, particularly about work and how a capitalist society adds so much friction to a life it is hard to live and love effectively with all that beating you up every day. It is a laugh line but when he yells ‘it’s that I think that the very idea of a work ethic is a quasi-theological injunction historically leveraged against the working class in order to drive labour intensification on behalf of capital!’ at his employer, I felt that. When not being a poet or penning this first novel, Goddard develops research of worker’s rights and speaks on issues of the future of work, automation and unionism. The moments where this makes it into the book (like the factory he briefly works at where all they do is unpackage items only to repackage them again in order to say they were made in the UK) are some of the highest points and the humor aimed at social critiques are wonderful. It also really endears me to Goddard.‘Me, not yet brave enough to feel joy.’This is a novel I wanted to enjoy more than I did, but I also don’t think there is anything really wrong with it, it just didn’t land with me that well. Sorry, Goddard, I actually really respect the hell out of you and this book for what it’s worth. You are hilarious too. It’s an uncomfortable book, but it uses that discomfort to shed the layers of life and really look inside us all and the ways we live and love. This is, above all, a book about being vulnerable and I like how much the narrator is really a vulnerable, sensitive person and the ways they are nervous about showing this to the world drives others away. The irony of that is really tragic but true and, in Hourglass it is made beautiful. This is an oddball of a book, but one that I think people should read and will likely get a lot out of. Funny, sad, zany, biting, witty and certainly gorgeously written, Hourglass captures matters of the heart under the duress of having to all be people interacting with other people quiet elegantly and effectively.3.5/5‘A conclusion.

It uplifts, it hurts, it sends us ricocheting with one another across exist‘Love was a country he knew nothing about.’Where would we be without love? It uplifts, it hurts, it sends us ricocheting with one another across existence, and we all grapple with consuming or being consumed by one another in its name as we struggle to apply our love with that of another. ‘Love takes off the masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within,’ James Baldwin wrote in his nonfiction work, The Fire Next Time, and the duality of understanding or being understood with the fear of being truly perceived drives much of Another Country, a striking portrait of the ways society informs our collisions of love that we all use as a method of chipping away at ourselves to discover our identities. It tells the stories of a group of young people living in Greenwich Village in the 70s, ‘all equal in misery, confusion, and despair,, as they inflict one another with themselves in emotional and sexual relations. At the heart of this is Rufus, a Black musician who’s relationship with the white Leona exposes the struggles of being Black in America, and the reverberations of his life are constantly felt against the lives of his friends, family and former lovers in searing portrait of the obfuscations of being human in a world with obdurate social enforcement on the ways we can love. There is tragedy in the miscommunications of love, worst when it is an unrequited love affair with a world which, instead of love, shows only scorn back through society to those who are Black or queer. Brilliant and impossible to put down, feelings at once a quick read and a hefty psychological investigation into gendered interactions and racism, Another Country tackles the ineffable sadness and hunger of finding oneself in the chaos of human relations.‘Terrifying, that the loss of intimacy with one person results in the freezing over of the world, and the loss of oneself! And terrifying that the terms of love are so rigorous, its checks and liberties so tightly bound together.’James Baldwin can WRITE. I mean, this is a 400pg book that breezes by from the way his prose grabs you by the heart and makes it beat to its rhythm, driving you like a bassline across the story in which his characters seem so alive on the page that you begin to wonder if they are your friends as well. The writing moves like jazz. He has heavily punctuated sentences where the commas and dashes drive the writing forward like a drum beat, propelling the reader through melodies of struggle and understanding but also bringing the city to life, thrumming along to the beat. The locations become characters in their own right: New York reads as a violent cacophony of hectic lives, Harlem rolls out as ‘sexual excitement, with danger, like a promise, waiting,’ whereas France vibes calm and slow through the novel. While reading this it felt akin to the writing and psychological narratives of Fyodor Dostoevsky, something I felt justified in when Baldwin name drops him multiple times in the first half, but the book engulfs you with it’s world and makes you feel like you are there engaging and complicit in all the uncomfortable glory of it’s story. Plus there are passages that just read with such intensity, life a fever dream of insight taking flight in his prose, with waves of emotion and scorching critiques of love such as: ‘There was only the leap and the rending and the terror and the surrender. And the terror: which all seemed to begin and end and begin again—forever—in a cavern behind the eye. And whatever stalked there saw, and spread the news of what it saw throughout to entire kingdom of whomever, though the eye itself might perish. What order could prevail against so grim a privacy? And yet, without order, of what value was the mystery? Order. Order. Set thine house in order. He sipped his whiskey…Baldwin can transport you through the stratosphere with philosophical musings then abruptly return you to the mundanities of life with expertise, playing your mind like a jazz horn then returning you to sipping your drink watching it all unfold. Baldwin has a lot to say, and despite the decades that have elapsed since this first went to print, it is all just as relevant today.‘It’s not possible to forget anybody you’ve destroyed.’Love is often used in metaphors about being consumed. Think of phrases like ‘loves burning flame,’ or the idea of giving oneself to another. As we see in Another Country, each person’s ideas of love is unique, and the ways we brush up against one another with our individual aims of love often hurts those we love most. Love is dropping your armor and being most vulnerable, opening up to the possibility of hurt. Baldwin shows this is just part of love, such as when Cass says to her husband, Richard‘you and I have hurt each other—many times. Sometimes we didn’t mean to and sometimes we did. And wasn’t it because—just because—we loved—love—each other?’Love is shown as both creation and destruction, a dual imagery not unlike the way waves are used in the novel: the black waves of destruction Rufus hallucinates compared to the way Eric says Yves' voice washed over him in soothing waves. But, tragically, all the loves of the novel find friction in the variances each person tries to love the other. Cass, for instance, feels like housekeeper ignored by Richard who spends all his time working, but for Richard working to provide is how he feels he should show love (this is getting into some Five Love Language territory, but you see what I mean). These aren’t portraits of problematic people per say—though they are all problematic and hurt and betray each other—but merely people as people are with all their flaws, fears, foibles and failures. It is quite moving and Baldwin embodies individual perspectives across race and gender with extraordinary dexterity that truly brings them to life.‘His life, passions, trials, loves, were, at worst, filth, and, at best, disease in the eyes of the world, and crimes in the eyes of his countrymen.’Often we see that external forces are also acting upon the characters, adding friction to already perilous affairs. When Rufus and Leona first get together, there is an immediate air of distaste aimed at them when they go out into public for being a mixed race couple. ‘[Rufus] has not thought at all about this world and its power to hate and destroy,’ and this unease seeps into him, making him react violently with rage and jealousy at Leona, or picking fights with any white man he perceives to be looking down on him. Similarly we see how being queer is equally looked down upon, and the intersection of Black and queer only exponentially raises the ire of society. This novel does contain a lot of domestic abuse and toxic masculinity, be forewarned, yet Baldwin refrains from passing judgment on his characters and never directs the reader to either. Instead, everyone is handled sympathetically, allowing you to see the social forces that back them into corners. Baldwin never negates their actions with the causes as understanding does not mean condoning, but he does pull back the psychological curtains to see the forces at work which understandably lead to so much suffering, rage and insecurity.‘And what were these terrors? They were buried beneath the impossible language of the time, lived underground where nearly all of the time's true feeling spitefully and incessantly fermented. ’They say society in the US is a melting pot, but it is more of a violent blender with blades that hack away. Being Black is to be in danger in the America, Baldwin argues, and we see how even some of the well-meaning white characters fail to understand it. We have Jane who weaponizes her whiteness and, when shouting of her white womanhood feeling threatened by a Black man, causes a bar fight nearly killing Rufus and Vivaldo. Cass must even explain that, sure, bad things happen to everyone ‘but they didn’t happen to you because you are white,’ she tells Richard, but the troubles and gatekeeping that befalls Rufus ‘happens because they are colored. And that makes a difference.’ The racism, faced by Baldwin as well causing him to leave the US to live in France where he wrote this book, is seen as a function of US society that keeps Black people down on purpose while claiming to be the land of opportunity. As Ida says to Cass: ‘They keep you here because you’re black, the filthy, white cock suckers, while they go around jerking themselves off with all that jazz about the land of the free and the home of the brave. And they want you to jerk yourself off with that same music, too, only, leep your distance.’Ida calls bullshit on the whole proclamation of freedom in the US, looking at all the progress only to be held back (such as Jim Crow laws) and recognizes freedom means White Only. But everyone must playact otherwise, causing a lot of ambiguity and despair in their own identity having to support a system hellbent on destroying them. In a novel where a search for identity often trips over self-hatred and internalized racism or homophobia, we see Rufus act in ways his sister Ida criticizes as avoiding being Black as if out of shame. Even Vivaldo says he only paid attention to Leona because she was white, something that is reversed later when Vivaldo considers that his relationship with Ida might be because she was not white…that she would not dare despise him.’This is key in Vivaldo, who also recognizes that he may have hated Rufus for being Black and his close friendship compensated for it. Vivaldi who lived in Harlem, who hung with the Black crowd. We see in a way that he uses Black people and Black culture as a way to find his identity, but as a white man he is consuming something not for him in a way that is used to prop him up. In modern context he is the well-enough-off college kid who lives in the poor districts of a big city for the excitement and edginess, knows all the right inclusivity terms, curates his social media to be all about productive allyship and social justice, but at the end of the day is using it all less to prop up the communities he claims to love but to convince himself he is good and doing good. Not to only drag Vivaldo, who is certainly my favorite character of the bunch. I love the whole rivalry between him and Richard, Richard who is publishing a book Vivaldo finds underwhelming while struggling to write his own—he realizes he does not understand his characters enough to make them act correctly for the story which metaphor’s his own lack of understanding of himself keeping him in a hiatus of emotional growth. But society at large is also acting against them in ways beyond racism and homophobia, though these are products of the larger forces. Society crushes some in order to uphold others, divides by class, consumes the poor in factories and workshops to benefit the owner class. ‘People don't have any mercy. They tear you limb from limb, in the name of love. Then, when you're dead, when they've killed you by what they made you go through, they say you didn't have any character. They weep big, bitter tears - not for you. For themselves, because they've lost their toy.’How is one to love and thrive under these conditions? All the expectations, social stigmas, rules and regulations on how to love befall these fledgling relationships and send everyone on a crash course.‘How can you live if you can’t love? And how can you live if you do.’Each character hurts the others and is hurt in return with a whole tangled web of affairs and lies. They all want to be understood, but being understood means giving yourself away to someone. To be known, truly known, is to be vulnerable and is frightening. Jealousy occurs from this insecurity, jealousy that threatens every relationship in the book and sends us towards the tumultuous climax of affairs and tears. ‘Love does not begin and end the way we think,’ Baldwin wrote years later, ‘love is a battle, love is a war, love is a growing up.’ And that is what we see, these characters growing up and being forged in the flames of their own missteps. I’m beginning to think,’ Cass says near the end of the novel, ‘that growing just means learning more and more about anguish.’ By the end everyone has had their share of anguish, but the future is uncertain and possibilities are vast.Another Country is an absolutely outstanding novel that flows to the beat of life and never shirks from the grit and pain of living. These characters are remarkable and we watch them all struggle to understand one another, seeing each other's existence as if it were a foreign country. This was my first Baldwin, and I am sorry I haven’t read him before but will certainly continue to do so as I was blown away. There is such power and passion here, so much empathy for the characters even in their darkest moments, and despite all the suffering under the cold sun of the novel, it fills your heart. Baldwin tackles racism and homophobia head on, shouts back at the world with an intensity of words and desire for justice and delivers a story that will shake you to the core. Nothing but awe for Another Country.5/5‘Terrifying, that the loss of intimacy with one person result in the freezing over of the world, and the loss of oneself!

Women are cautioned to remain chaste and obedient, to not stray from the path, and often are a prize for heroic men rather than having their own power and glory. Gilman’s graphic novel collection, Other Ever Afters: New Queer Fairy Tales, is full of beautifully illustrated and clever tales that overturn patriarchy and power to give queer women the agency over their destinies. This charming collection captures the spirit of fairy tales, being full of menace and magic while delivering heartfelt morals and while categorized as a YA collection it is sure to appeal to adults just as well. Full of delightful twists that subvert expectations and speak to power, this is a wonderful and gorgeous book.  [image]Gilman created many of these for 24-Hour Comic Day and while each tale is a standalone there are overarching themes and messages that come alive with them all bound together in one volume (the Goose Girl central to the story of the same name does make an appearance later in the collection to show her plan has been successful). The art is warm and whimsical, with an innocent childlike flair that still manages to portray the implied violence and darkness and I quite enjoy her colored pencil style illustrations. Plus there is a lovely effort for inclusivity in terms of race and body types showing queer women in a wonderful variety and it was really great to see a trans narrative included. And its all just a joy to look at honestly.  [image]The variety of stories is well done too and there are some great twists at the ends of several stories that caught me by surprise. Things are not always what they seem here, and in quite welcome ways. While every story is a queer they don’t ever dwell in issues of homophobia and tend towards speaking out against power or finding community, love, and agency in a world where this is often denied to them. I particularly enjoyed one in which a kingdom is given to the people in order to uplift all. There is a great point about how kingdoms and power structures tend to devour girls for their benefit but with acts of resistance ‘may we live to see it starve.’ The stories have a lot of darkness. but these tales are ultimately kind, empowering and rather adorable.  [image]There are a wonderful blend of eerie, cute, and subversive.’The original tales in Other Ever Afters will leave you feeling good inside and with a smile on your face. They are a bit short, but they capture the fairy tale vibe quite successfully. As always with collections of stories, some hit harder than others, but overall this was a charming, worthwhile read that celebrates finding agency, subverting power and patriarchy to empower all, and embracing sapphic love. A gem of a graphic novel and a happily ever after.4/5  [image]...more",Notes are private!,0,89,1,"Feb 26, 2023","Feb 26, 2023","Feb 26, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59776461-other-ever-afters

Anthologies are always a great way to learn new poets and poems and have a wonderful index of works that revolve around various themes, something to reach for when the words to express a situation fail you but you know that, somewhere, a poet has put a net of words around the ineffable. Pádraig Ó. Tuama’s Poetry Unbound: 50 poems to Open Your World goes one step further, providing a close reading of each of the 50 poems found within, with personal insights and stories that catch the gusts of beauty in the poems and soar to their own spectacular heights. As the epigraph from Christian Wiman says ‘we go to poetry for one reason, so that we might more fully inhabit our lives and the world in which we live them,’ Tuama provides us with poems to better inhabit our own feelings with these ‘fifty little doors to open up the world.’ One thing I feel strongly about is poetry’s unique ability for the speaker to really reach inside the reader and help us see the world through the abstraction of their words, to better understand, better empathize, better feel the vastness of the world and that each person in it is a living story on their own unique trajectory. As Winman says, if we better inhibit our lives and our world ‘we might be less apt to destroy both,’ and the selection of poets and poems found in this book are finely tuned towards such an endeavour. Drawing mostly from current poets, the selections here all become a balm on a weary soul and are an incredible group of writers. We have poets like current US Poet Laureate Ada Limon, or former Poet Laureate Tracy K. Smith, as well as other brilliant poets including Layli Long Soldier, Ilya Kaminsky, Natalie Díaz, Kaveh Akbar, Joy Ladin, Aracelis Girmay, Aimee Nezhukumatathil and many more. This is a perfect book for any poetry collection and would make an amazing book for someone looking for a start in reading poetry.

Tuama provides a lot of personal history to these essays that endear you to him as well. A queer poet growing up in a religious household and community, his selections and ideas often revolve around ideas of religion but in ways that step outside of theology and into the art of myth-making for the sake of enlightenment and the betterment of the self and the world. The poems here often address the issues of the world around us and make for excellent guides through difficult or painful conversations about society, politics, the traumas and sadness of living, but also the joy that miraculously survives amidst all the world throws at us.

In The Ethics of Ambiguity, Simone de Beauvoir (best known for her cornerstone work, The Second Sex, which kickstarted second-wave feminism) address such questions of ethics from a perspective of existentialist thought she was developing with friend and contemporary Jean-Paul Sartre. Having stated in a lecture that Sartre’s Being and Nothingness was inadequate to base an entire ethical system, Simone de Beauvoir approached existential ethics through the basis of human freedom, which she declared the foundation of morality instead of a binary between good and bad. Above all, she argues one must ‘act to defend and develop the moral freedom of oneself and others.’ Across the three sections of The Ethics of Ambiguity, Beauvoir takes a philosophical deep dive into the ambiguity of existence, examining ethical attitudes and ‘ways of being’ people may take in relation to our own freedoms as well as the freedoms of others, arguing that even without a fixed moral absolutism, existentialism provides a path of virtuous and praiseworthy living all the same. 'Ethics is the triumph of freedom over facticity.' The Ethics of Ambiguity is a highly readable book, and at just under 200pgs it is one that never feels like biting off more than one can chew despite it being a heady and nuanced work worth giving plenty of space to digest. It is a delicious meal of thought, however, and I’ve always found the ways Beauvoir relates her own thinking with the writings of other philosophers to be rather inviting, giving the reader enough context to follow along even if they are unfamiliar with the other’s work. This book offers some excellent looks at her ideas set against the big picture of other ethical systems as well as in context with other existentialist ideas, often writing in defense against criticisms against existentialism for being too bleak or not offering any distinction between right and wrong. Beauvoir asserting that morality is something people develop through life in relation to the current contexts of life instead of a fixed and universal code. She cites and rebuts Fyodor Dostoevsky’s famous line from the The Brothers Karamazov ‘if God is dead, everything is permitted, ’ as she posits that whole humans are ontologically free, life is not a nihilistic free-for-all under existentialism and she also develops criteria that can determine if actions are moral or not. ‘[L]et us therefore try to look the truth in the face. Let us try to assume our fundamental ambiguity. It is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our life that we must draw our strength to live and our reason for acting.’A tenant of existentialist thought is that ‘existence precedes essence,’ namely that objects or ideas exist before value is assigned to them and that, as Sartre argues, life has no meaning until we assign a meaning or essence to it. In this way, Beauvoir argues against any idea of absolute goodness, stating ‘there exists no absolute value’ and that instead value is developed from our choices. So while morality is subjective it is still meaningful because all meaning is subjective. In this way, Beauvoir follows Sartre’s ideas against ‘bad-faith’ living, and that we must desire to always be ‘willing ourselves free’ in authenticity of the self instead of having our value defined by others. So what is ambiguity? We need to break this down a bit. Beauvoir draws heavily on Sartre’s works in Being and Nothingness on the distinction of anything being ‘in-itself’ or ‘for-itself’ (roughly: using Martin Heidegger’s concept of daesein, or being-in-itself, Sartre looks at in-itself as the object in the world and for-itself as the consciousness of existence/purpose/activity/etc) and sees the friction between the two as creating much of the ambiguity in existence. She shows how as individuals we see ourselves as, say, the main character in our lives, but also must acknowledge that we are side or background characters in the lives of others. We are both subject and object, and while we are free we also exist in the lives of others as ‘factic’ and operating under all the factors of reality and forces of society (laws, socioeconomics, social codes, and social barriers of prejudices/racism/sexism/etc to name a few). This is our ambiguity, and life is ambiguous. We set out with goals and feelings and inevitably die.She draws a distinction between ambiguity and absurdism as well. ‘To declare that existence is absurd is to deny that it can ever be given a meaning,’ she writes, ‘to say that it is ambiguous is to assert that its meaning is never fixed, that it must be constantly won.’ While Camus leaned into the absurdity in life, writing that we find happiness in the struggle itself, Beauvoir looks at how that does not form an ethical system that enhances freedoms for all. ‘Absurdity challenges every ethics; but also the finished rationalization of the real would leave no room for ethics; it is because man's condition is ambiguous that he seeks, through failure and outrageousness, to save his existence. Thus, to say that action has to be lived in its truth, that is, in the consciousness of the antinomies which it involves, does not mean that one has to renounce it.’In a way it makes Camus feel overtly nihilistic and Beauvoir argues that freedom comes from the pursuit of it. Transcendence much be found by itself but never actually fulfilled as we inevitably die and the world continues on. As an example, she argues artists don’t set out to “finish” art but instead to capture it in its moment, time always marches on and expands on what came before, which she also addresses in terms of how society and politics are always changing over time.’Freedom is the source from which all significations and all values spring. It is the original condition of all justification of existence.’Freedom creates values but this sort of subjective approach has an objective morality of responsibility with freedom. Beauvoir teaches us to remember that our will to freedom affects all those around us, creating a sense of morality that enhancing freedom is ethically correct, but restricting freedom of others even in enhancing our own, is not. ‘A freedom which is interested only in denying freedom must be denied. And it is not true that the recognition of the freedom of others limits my own freedom: to be free is not to have the power to do anything you like; it is to be able to surpass the given toward an open future; the existence of others as a freedom defines my situation and is even the condition of my own freedom. I am oppressed if I am thrown into prison, but not if I am kept from throwing my neighbor into prison.’There is a good look at the ways systems purported to promote freedom often become restrictive. Freedom must be employed productively or it becomes oppressive, and a large part of The Second Sex shows that subjugation comes when a person (women, in this instance) is denied being thought of as for-itself and viewed instead as an object/property or other aspect of materialism. She also shows how moral evil for existentialists is essentially anything preventing us from accepting life’s ambiguity being able to improve both yourself and the world together. Or, anything that makes your valuation the object of another’s will. ‘Man must not attempt to dispel the ambiguity of his being but, on the contrary, accept the task of realizing it.’Part two examines how as we enter adulthood we realize that we not only have freedom but responsibility and our actions shape the world. She breaks down several ‘ways of being’ and how that relates to ideas of ambiguity and freedom which I suppose could serve as a replacement for the enneagram if you wanted. These include examples like the sub-man who is so afraid of action they deny their own freedom and aims to do nothing at all, the adventurer who seeks their freedom but often runs over that of others, or the passionate man who is similar but allows diminishment of his own freedoms for others. Problems arise due to either rejecting the experience of freedom or misunderstanding the meaning of it, and one should live with passion and generosity while protecting both themselves and others from becoming an object of another’s will. We must accept the burdens of freedom and not avoid them.‘The oppressed can fulfill his freedom as a man only in revolt.’The third section emphasizes actions and how they relate in her concept of ethical ambiguity. Much of this addresses the misuse of freedom, particularly in ways that oppress others and how this is always evil. Yet because oppression always exists, and because oppressors go to great lengths to convince the oppress this is just the “natural” order or way of things (think how under capitalism the poor are mistakenly socially framed as failures to mislead from acknowledging them as victims) and thereby we must always be in revolt. She addresses Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and how his works acknowledges 'the struggle will never cease' and 'does not dare delude himself with the idea of a stationary future.' 'The fundemental ambiguity of the human condition will always open up to men the possibility of opposing choices; there will always be within them the desire to be that being of whom they have made themsleves a lack, the flight from the anguish of freedom; the plane of hell, of struggle, will never be eliminated; freedom will never be given; it will always have to be won.'I’m reminded of Le Guin’s The Dispossessed and how society is an endlessly revolving series of revolutions and must always be aimed at expanded ethical freedoms. She cites Leon Trotsky envisaging 'the future as a permanent revolution' and once again reiterates than ethics is of the moment and not a mark on a static line through time.When it comes to revolt, Beauvoir looks at how during revolt 'we can conquor our enemies only by acting on their facticity, by reducing them to things,' and how, in the process of this, we 'have to make ourselves things' in return. This also gets into the issue of violence and she asks if there are circumstances when violence is justified against oppressors (this comes after the occupation of France by the Nazis during which Beauvoir worked with the Underground). ‘In order for a liberating action to be a thoroughly moral action, it would have to be achieved through a conversion of the oppressors: there would then be a reconciliation of all freedoms. But no one any longer dares to abandon himself today to these utopian reveries.’She posits that when violene is done to, say, a 16 year old Nazi on the battlefield 'it was not he whom we hated but his masters,' but also that 'the oppressors would not be so strong if they did not have accomplices among the oppressed themselves.' She admits that, ideally, we should re-educate those who have been persuayed to serve the oppressors in violence and unethical action, but the 'urgency of struggle forbits slow labor.' The conclusion she arrives at is 'we are obliged to destroy not only the oppressor but also those who serve him, whether they do so out of ignorance or out of constraint.' Overall, we are called to ask how we commit to freedom for the self while also making room to the freedom of all others. This is explored in many aspects of ambiguity and ethical conundrums where the point of objectivity in the subjective reality is always freedom. The Ethics of Ambiguity is a great and worthwhile read that would serve as a perfect introduction to existentialism ethics or simply to anyone interested in ethical philosophy in general. Perhaps not her strongest work, yet still plenty engaging and interesting. I’ve always found her method of examining concepts to be very effective and promote understanding without being overly obfuscating. I also enjoyed many ways how I could see her expanding or using these ideas in the underpinnings of her later work, The Second Sex. Short, but not short on big ideas to wrestle with, The Ethics of Ambiguity is a staple of existentialist works.‘ we are absolutely free today if we choose to will our existence in its finiteness, a finiteness which is open on the infinite.’...more",Notes are private!,5,156,1,"Feb 23, 2023","Feb 23, 2023","Feb 23, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/27558543-the-ethics-of-ambiguity

It only flows when life is left to exist in its own natural way.’I am at all times wanting to vanish into the gorgeous landscapes and whimsical worlds of K. O’Neill’s imagination. The Moth Keeper proves to be another magnificent journey, transporting the reader beneath starry skies and into a village that has adapted to be nocturnal to honor the Moon-spirit. Explores themes of responsibility, cooperation and sharing the burdens of others, the story follows Anya as she becomes the protector of the Moon-Moths that are essential for the flowers the village needs to thrive. Like their Tea Dragon Society books, The Moth Keeper is teeming with tradition, myth, and magic, making for a lovely story full of endearing characters and told through O’Neill’s gorgeous, signature artwork. The Moth Keeper is sure to warm your heart and send your imagination soaring.  [image]Inspired by the landscape of the Tongariro National Park of New Zealand, and a rare species of moths there, O’Neill creates a vast desert world that is exciting to explore and learn about. There is a fun dynamic examining the way a society would learn to thrive living only in darkness, which contrasts with the day-village that appears later in the story. But even in the cold of night there is a lot of warmth in this village, with everyone working together to uphold one another, ‘a village where each person holds the hand of another. So that no one gets lost in the darkness.’ It is a beautiful sentiment and something O’Neill has carried through many of their books, often showing how that extends to the natural world as well. Much like the message in their Aquicorn Cove, the well-being of the village and nature go hand in hand.‘I want to become a light for others…I want to hold my lantern up high for everyone.’Anya becoming the Moth Keeper is a great honor but also a heavy responsibility and burden, and long nights alone in the dark begins to weigh heavily on her as well. Her desires to see the world during the day and the loneliness she endures at night dives her into existential anxieties that threaten to undo her, thinking about how she took the role to have a job that would mean she ‘matters to someone,’ to feel her existence is justified. There are thoughtful moments about how it isn’t just our labor that defines us, even in a community where everyone must shoulder responsibilities, and that sometimes love is already right there in the people right in front of us. As usual in O’Neill stories, the characters have a fantasy part-animal element to them and there are adorable, queer romances blossoming as well as the wisdom of elders to help guide the next generation, pass on the stories and traditions, and allow everyone to grow and be cared for. Their books always leave me in such a good mood and lightness of spirit.  [image]There is just so much to love here. I mean, as a lover of stories and a library worker I ADORE the owl-lady “keeper of stories” that has them quite literally inscribed on the feathers of her wings:  [image]But O’Neill’s art is so wonderful as well. Being set mostly at night, it isn’t as bright or as bold as their usual work but the cool colors, excellent use of lighting, and stunning visuals set quite the emotional tone to the story, which all vaguely recalls Studio Ghibli. The style is a bit looser here than their past works, which is quite effective, and I enjoyed the bits of experimentation such as the orange and grays of the charcoal-like style used for the scenes depicting village folklore:  [image] The Moth Keeper is a charming and inspiring graphic novel that, while aimed at a young teen audience, is just as moving and magical for adults. The inclusive cast of characters are wonderful, the art is spectacular, the story is excellent and the messages are beautiful to take to heart. While Anya’s backstory felt a little underexplored, with the tidbits raising far more questions than explaining much (is this the start of a series perhaps?), I still enjoyed the way this story seems to show how dealing with trauma is a lifelong process. If anything, this story shows how we can all help and heal one another and that working together uplifts all. A marvelous book that I can’t wait to revisit again and again.4/5  [image]...more",Notes are private!,4,167,1,"Mar 09, 2023","Mar 09, 2023","Feb 23, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/61356477-the-moth-keeper

And, as with We Deserve MoWhen your 12 year old tells you they love a book and it is a must-read, you stop whatever you are doing and read that book. And, as with We Deserve Monuments, the debut novel from Jas Hammonds, you often find a book you now love too. Here is what they had to say about it:‘We Deserve Monuments by Jas Hammonds is a must read for anyone young and queer, following the love story of two girls and the buried history of racism in the small town of Bardell. My dad even liked it. I couldn’t stop reading it and when I had to for school or whatever I was still thinking about it the whole time. It is really good!’We Deserve Monuments follows Avery, a queer, biracial teen, and her family returning to a small, Southern town when they learn the grandmother has cancer. It is a story about a family amidst racism and generational trauma, but it is also a love story and perhaps the most impressive aspect of the novel is that Hammonds manages to balance both and portray them with equal excellence. Yet, this is also a story about friendships, with Avery bonding with her Black neighbor Simone and Jade, the daughter of a wealthy white family with an unsolved murder in its recent history, and navigating her blossoming love with Simone in a deeply conservative town where being both Black and queer puts your life in jeopardy. This is a YA debut that will touch the hearts of readers of any age, being a multigenerational tale that elegantly addresses each family member in a way that, as Jas Hammonds says in an interview with NPR, is ‘like, ""Gilmore Girls,"" but make it Black and gay.’ Setting is a key part of We Deserve Monuments, as spilled blood and the echoes of trauma never seem to dissipate a sense of place. The small town of Bardell, where ‘every corner [holds] a story,’ is a well crafted setting that rural readers will find to be rather authentic and quite lovingly portrayed. It is a troubled city where racism is as deep and numerous as the potholes and MAGA bumper stickers, yet there is a sense of irony that Avery finds more acceptance here as a queer, biracial teen, than she did amongst her peers back in DC. The choice of DC as Avery’s “home” is key, making a strong argument that the spectacle of politics that has become the sitcom of social media is not an authentic representation of the livelihoods of people actually living in the communities being argued over. Hammonds is deliberate in wanting to ‘showcase that queer people exist everywhere. We exist, and we not only exist, we thrive everywhere. And that includes small rural towns, especially down in the Deep South.’ Avery and Simone have a date in a secret underground club, showing safe spaces for communities of queer and Black people exist everywhere, which is quite lovely. Especially as spaces like this are often threatened.‘ I cried because I felt guilty. And helpless. And lonely and frustrated and angry. I cried because I couldn’t tell if everything was changing or nothing was.’There are several mysteries at the heart of this novel—a major one being the unsolved murder of Jade’s mother—that serve as an excellent catalyst for the events to unfold and for the trio of friends to go digging into the past. What they find is horrifying and plays into themes of generational trauma and the terrors of racism, all of which begins to slowly unravel the looming mysteries about Avery’s family. Her mother and grandmother are on poor terms, to put it gently, and the absence of her grandfather as well as the decades-longs frustrations between the mom and Mama Letty are an enormous elephant in the room for much of the book. Mama Letty is rather caustic, and Avery’s initial attempts to approach her are met with mocking and disdain, but Avery know that if her family is to every come to a sense of healing these are secrets that must be uncovered and confronted. ‘If I was going to get to know Mama Letty, I was going to have to be the one to crack through her prickly exterior. She had to shed her loneliness, one layer at a time. Maybe I would be perfect for the job since I was dealing with my own version of loneliness after my breakup.’Hammonds works wonders juggling the multiple characters and addressing both past and present, with the fallout between Avery’s mother with her Mama Letty as well as her former best-friend neighbor (also Simone’s mother) telling as much of a story as anything else. Something I enjoyed immensely here is the way this is less plot-driven and more a character study of women coping with trauma, familial struggles, and young love in a world that is far more apt to inflict harm than offer space to heal. The interracial tensions that linger across the decades show how much racism has left a festering wound across society and that we must become the sutures to stave off further bloodloss and begin the difficult process of healing. But Hammonds offers excellent role models, such as the mother who managed to stop the cycle of trauma and abuse (though her struggles show this is not an easy task despite being a necessary one), Avery who aims to uncover and assuage the pain while blossoming into a world of queer love, Simone who is discovering her sexuality and finding space to do so productively, or even Jade who bridges racial divides and stands up for her friends for their sake instead of as a weapon against the racism of her family legacy.Beyond just enjoying reading a book recommended to me by my own kid, I liked reading about people of their generation experiencing a lot of things that in ways my kid sees them. Such as the mentions of Covid and how frustrating and, well, rather traumatic the back-and-forth from in-person to slapdash online learning was while also having to navigate a global problem bewildered that the adults who are supposed to be in charge and protect them couldn’t even decide if they wanted to try and be productive or pretend it wasn’t real for edgy clout. It was a perspective from that year that I can’t have experience not having been a teenager in school and it was a good way to think about what they were going through from their own perspective and help them see how to cope with it all and remember there are people who care, who help, and even when they feel like an outsider to know they can find a community for them. As Hammonds says in the NPR interview: ‘There's an ongoing theme about giving yourself grace. If teens read this book and if they take anything away, I hope it's that. I hope that it's, you know, there's a power in community and asking for help and, you know, asking to be seen and being witnessed and just really knowing that you don't have to go through this world alone. And that people - there are people out there who will love you and uplift your whole self. That was just really important to me for - especially for young people.’I’m glad we could share this book and have good heart to heart conversations about it.Ours is a complex world full of past and present hurts that bruise and bewilder us all. We Deserve Monuments is a gorgeous and intricate narrative about reaching out across divides, seeking towards empathy, understanding and healing. It can be a bit slow for a YA, which I enjoyed, but the many twists and revelations will keep you turning pages, even if just to bask in Jas Hammonds lovely prose. This is a marvelous book full of heart.5/5‘We had everything we needed now to become a whole, complete family—time, proximity, bodies hugging the dinner table every night.’...more",Notes are private!,0,228,1,"Feb 20, 2023","Feb 22, 2023","Feb 20, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58484187-we-deserve-monuments

And I am grateful I have as Bonjour Tristesse is a startling achievement in capturing the carelessness Nick describes but from the interior life of a teenage girl as a portraiture of youthful amorality and yearning for an unbridled existence. ‘I realized that carelessness can govern our lives,’ Cécile, our teenage narrator confesses, ‘but it does not provide us with any arguments in its defense.’ Told as a reflection on the events years down the line, this a tangled web of desires with Cécile pulling the strings in a complex plot to retain her and her widower father’s hedonistic lifestyles. Since ‘all plots tend to move deathward,’ as Don DeLillo would later write, and with the sense of regret in the narration lending a foreboding air, one can deduce they are watching a slow-motion car crash. St in the amorous summer heat along the French Riviera, Bonjour Tristesse is an infectious, psychological coming-of-age tale that will have you eagerly riding along feeling complicit in this web of passion and plotting run amok‘For what are we looking for if not to please? I do not know if the desire to attract others comes from a superabundance of vitality, possessiveness, or the hidden, unspoken need to be reassured.’Published when the author was 18 years old—only a year older than her character, Cécile, leading to speculation of autobiographical element—Bonjour Tristesse was an instant and scandalous splash in the French literary world, with accusations of unscrupulousness and moral frivolity in this novel of sexual coming-of-age and disillusionment making it all the more alluring. As the Times reported in 1955 that ‘famed Roman Catholic novelist, François Mauriac, said the book was clearly written by the devil, and that did not harm its sales.’ Born Françoise Quoirez, she adopted the name Sagan in homage to her literary hero Marcel Proust’s Princesse de Sagan, she would go on to write numerous books, though none that ever quite matched the success of Bonjour Tristesse. The title of which is inspired by a Paul Éluard poem which opens the novel.  [image]From the 1958 film adaptation with Jean Seberg, Deborah Kerr, and David NivenStill, this novel of teenage amorality strapped to a roller coaster of passions and the manipulation of love affairs opened the doors to many novels we have today. During my enthusiastic time reading the novel, I kept declaring that without Sagan we would never have had Sally Rooney. Not that Sagan has a detached style the way Rooney’s can be, quite the opposite really as Cécile’s narration is full of poetic emotional intensity as her moods rise and fall abruptly in response to her situations. In a way there is a kinship with the writing in Osamu Dazai’s Schoolgirl, which also positions the narrator as responding to their social environment. ‘Oh what a tangled web we weaveWhen first we practice to deceive.’- Sir Walter ScottWhen Anne, a friend of Cécile’s deceased mother, comes to stay along the Riviera with Cécile and father, she quickly pushes aside the father’s young lover Elsa and the two plan to marry. Despite her massive respect for Anne’s intelligence and ability to look down upon even the wealthiest of playboy socialites, Cécile sees the impending marriage as an intrusion into the carefree existence her and her father lead (not to mention a sense of jealousy over her father’s affections) and plots to break them up. She arranges her own lover, Cyril, to playact romance with Elsa to make her father jealous and shake Anna aside in order to continue her life of luxury without rules and pleasure without restraint. ‘I would be influenced, re-oriented, remodelled by Anne,’ she fears and fears the thought of her life changing. She finds herself quite fond of a quote by Oscar Wilde that reads ‘sin is the only note of vivid color that persists in the modern world,’ and aims to embed it in the way she lives her life. ‘I made this attitude my own with far more conviction, I think, than if I had immediately put it into practice. I believed I could base my life on it…I visualized a life of degradation and moral turpitude as my ideal.’It is a youthful desire, an aspect of the novel Sagan so perfectly leans into with a lot of self-awareness for being a teenager herself at the time or writing. While the critics of the book chastised Cécile for hedonism, her and her father—who she admits is a libertine—likely points to a bit of post-war cultural context and the emphasized valuation of freedom. France had occupation and filled with a spirit of resistance and a yearning to be free. Cécile would have grown up hearing idealized stories of heroism towards liberation, finding empowerment in a struggle against restraints and finding ‘The freedom to choose my own life, to choose myself.’ Oh her father she thinks, ‘a break-up would be less painful to him than having to live a well-ordered life,’ and this statement is the heart of her desires to be unshackled from orderly natures of rules and ‘proper upbringing’ in order to retain a wild, amoral freedom that she has built her sense of self around.‘it was for this I reproached Anne: she prevented me from liking myself. I, who was so naturally meant for happiness and gaiety, had been forced by her into a world of self-criticism and guilty conscience, where, unaccustomed to introspection, I was completely lost. And what did she bring me? I took stock: She wanted my father, she had got him. She would gradually make of us the husband and step-daughter of Anne Larsen; that is to say, she would turn us into two civilized, well-behaved and happy people’The tragedy at the center of this story is that Cécile does in fact respect and appreciate Anne otherwise and had been excited by her coming. The two often get along, with Anne having played a big part in her upbringing and Cécile vacillates between earnestly wanting to live up to Anne’s expectations and wanting to rend the whole affair asunder. ‘How difficult she made life for us through her dignity and self-respect,’ she fumes.‘I was not at the age when fidelity is attractive. And of course, I knew little of love: the meetings, the kisses, the weary aftermath.’There is also an intriguing regard towards love in the book, with Cécile still young and naive as she pursues the older Cyril. French culture has an international association with romance, stemming from the depictions of love from the troubadours, the way poets like Charles Baudelaire emphasized the way art feels emotionally, and the history of French literature depicting feelings as instinctual over logical and love in ways it can exist outside of marriage, and one would not be out of line to refer to this novel as feeling, well, very French as those who had read it before me spoke of it. Love is very central to this story, but Cécile is more of a rambunctious tourist into it than anything else. There is a comedic element to the way Cyril, several years her elder (making it ideal to play act as Elsa’s partner) feeling guilty that he could have ‘had his way with her’ and being proud to tell her he resisted for her sake while Cécile is thinking more along the lines of ‘what the hell man, just take me’. The relationship dives through some interesting corkscrews in this emotional roller coaster of a novel. She even considers how she ‘had given myself to him because I knew that if I had a child, he would be prepared to take the blame,’ which is one of the many signs of her carelessness that she believes anyone but her should clean up her mess. Sagan’s self-awareness makes this book work so well, with Cécile often shown as naive and arguing bad points Anne dismisses as ‘fashionable’ where even Cécile has to admit she is correct. Not that Cécile will ever repent, which is a major aspect of the novel. And it isn’t that she isn’t intelligent, quite the contrary, though she has no refinement and allows herself to be blown about at the mercy of her passions and flights of fancy. She is also cunning, realizing and finding ‘intense pleasure of analyzing another person, manipulating that person toward my own end.’ Sagan’s capturing of youth and the cruelties one can commit when they react from a place of reactionary emotional discomfort reads quite well and occupying Cécile’s headspace makes it easy to be swept along in the story. ‘ I have known boredom, regret, and occasionally remorse, but never sorrow,’ Cécile tells us but also admits ‘today it envelops me like a silken web, enervating and soft, and sets me apart from everybody else.’ Told somewhere down the line after the events of this story, we know right away that something will go awry and wait with baited breath the whole book to find out exactly what it is. It captures what Fitzgerald was aiming at with Nick’s speech on the carelessness of those with high social standing, retreating back to their lives with others cleaning up the wreckage, and as the novel concludes we see Cécile and her father returning to their reckless ways. Cécile admits ‘I was relieved’ when nothing of the aftermath can held against her and she casts aside Cyril in order to return to her leisurely life of pleasure, much as Nick accuses Tom and Daisy of in Gatsby. However, being told through Cécile we also see that behind the pursuit of pleasure she still does feel pain and regret, with an acknowledgement to herself ‘that poor miserable face was my doing.’ Outwardly she has moved on with nary a scar to show for it, yet at night ‘that summer returns to me with all its memories,’ and we see her haunted by it, though able to snuff those feelings out like one of her cigarettes. Yet still she admits ‘bonjour, tristesse!’ (hello, sadness). Bonjour Tristesse is a wonderful portrait of youth, which is as brief as the novel at only 130pgs. Lovingly translated by Irene Ash, this book is infectiously written, pulling you through the ups and downs of Cécile’s moods much like the way she weaves her plot to break up love and set herself free. Beautifully constructed, this dark coming-of-age was an absolute delight.5/5‘Now I had caught a sudden glimpse of the marvelous mechanisms of human reflexes, and the power that lies in the spoken word.

Your job is to not kill the bird with the stone’Victoria Chang is full of magical surprises. Her recent collections have taken unique approaches to topics of grief and remembrance, such as Obit constructed through poetic obituaries to various words and ideas or Dear Memory: Letters on Writing, Silence and Grief, a moving collage of poetry, letters and photographs. Her latest, The Trees Witness Everything, continues her elegiac poetry towards the death of her mother and the slow dying of the Earth. Here, however, she has imposed artistic rules and restrictions, written in various Japanese syllabic forms called wakas and each titled after poems by W.S. Merwin and responding to said titles. They are short and to the point, yet pierce right into your heart as she examines ideas of grief for loved ones, be them human, animal or landscapes, as well as stunning meditations on poetry and the cycles of life amidst all the sorrows and joys the world immerses us in. These are brilliant, tiny explosions of emotion that thrive under Chang’s artistic self-regimentation, poetry merging with the natural world—especially trees—and each of Chang’s words digs up life to uncover a somber beauty within.PASSAGEEvery leaf that fallsnever stops falling. I oncethought that leaves were leaves.Now I think they are feeling,in search of a place—someone’s hair, a park bench, afinger. Isn’t thatlike us, going from place toplace, looking to be alive?In the notes following the poetry, Chang quotes fellow poet Terrance Hayes saying ‘my relationship to form is that of a bird inside of a cage, moving around.’ This spirit is embodied in the way Chang so deftly moves within her imposed forms, which she describes as taking a title from a Merwin poem and then choosing a syllabic form at random for her own poem. In this way we can almost feel the art of creation on the page, and as the book is published uniquely as a tall, very thin book, this also constrains the lines which have at most 6 or 7 words each. There are also only two poems per page, like a sort of call and response (aside from the one long poem, the 15 page Marfa, Texas, or the final section, Love Letters consisting of a barrage of 3-line poems). Merwin is an interesting choice, and poet Jennifer Chang theorizes in a  by way of conversation with Dean Rader for an LA Review of Books article that the homage may stem from Merwin having been a major source of Asian poetry translations. Victoria Chang herself notes that she ‘selected Merwin’s titles because of how open they seem,’ and in this openness she manages to create conversation between his and her work. Often her poems are not actually responses to his poems themselves but to the title, the crack in the wall through which both poets’ beautiful discourse flows outward. CONVENIENCEYouth stretches overeverything, can be used once.Then we turn it inside out.The passage of time is always felt through these brief poems, chronicling the moments that make up a life and the turning of seasons. ‘Someone is turning / the earth with wrenches, each turn / a bit closer to the end.’ Time is the great eroder of all, we see, and Chang finds this both tragic and beautiful all at once. ‘Sadness takes time,’ she writes, with grief always ready to intrude into her works, ‘sadness / is made up of minutes. Hope / is made up of years.’ I am in awe at the way Chang blends the cycle of human emotions—going from hopeful to sad to joy around and around feeling all our feelings as the days march on—with the cycle of seasons, folding our lives into being of the Earth. Yet there is also resistance against being caught in a cycle: ‘I am still angry / with God and all the patterns / we’re forced to follow’ While these poems are all very brief without often being a deep enough recess of feeling to be a foothold in the collection, it embodies the way passing moments and feelings are—in the grand scheme of things—rather brief and the beauty of this collection comes from the amalgamation of the poems.HOMECOMINGThe birds come backbut they don't tell us stories. Their wings remember nothing, are never knowledge. We don't remember our birth When a mother dies, it's gone.Grief is everywhere in this collection. There is discussion of war and its endless repetitions (‘war is never by / itself, just like laughter or / snow’), of death, and of the ways we harm the natural world. Chang pays special attention to the ways we cause destruction for personal gain and grieves that our success as a species was at the expense of the Earth rather than looking for more sustainable methods or living in better harmony, such as in the poem Tool:We make tools to fixeverything—hammers, nails, wiresthat we twist to holddown or bend into beauty.We make a small treeinto the shape we want, tobe slanted, silent.The wire on my wrists cut in,I take the shape of desire.Yet this isn’t to say it is a dark and gloomy collection. There are humorous witticisms and often a great deal of hope. ‘Hope has footprints too,’ she writes, ‘some days we follow it. / some days it follows us.’TRANSITWhat are words but lies?A footnote has lost is thought.Have you ever been so afraid of desire, youwished for yourself to die first?I appreciate how much this collection engages with the act of poetry itself, or the existence of the poet. The speaker is always right there on the page, musing along with thoughts like ‘A poem is published / it is posted everywhere. / A tree drops leaves in secret.’ I feel a really personal connection with these from having spent a few years secretly leaving poems all over my town on trees. I always love a good tree poem because of it and this collection is full of them, but I also tended towards short poems one could quickly read but spend the day mulling over. So this is like the ideal collection for me in that way. TO THE MARGINI will never loveanyone the way I lovemy memories and their cliffsVictoria Chang’s The Trees Witness Everything is a superb little collection of passing poems and moments like catching rays of light shimmering off a pond. While this one might be sometimes too weightless to really stick, I am always marveling at her creativity and enjoy seeing how well she flourishes creating unique projects such as this.4.5/5‘I struck a bargain with language.

The Night Eaters: She Eats the Night, which is a rather redundant subtitle, is the first volume in what will be a continuing horror graphic series from Marjorie M. Liu and Sana Takeda (the pair also worked together on Monstress). And this is a sufficiently scary start. The art is rather striking, and the pacing is good, weaving past and present, though the need to hold off on some of the big reveals frustrates some of the storytelling. Mixing the haunted house narrative full of demons and dread with themes on immigrant family relations and the difficulties of COVID times, The Night Eaters is visually stunning and a fun, wild ride. While this is just the first piece in a longer series to come, it stands alone pretty effectively. I really love Takeda’s artwork, which is rather dynamic in setting an eerie, moody tone that can abruptly dip into great monster scenes as well as being able to keep a good comical vibe with the ways shouted dialogue is presented in a near-anime style. It does, at times, feel like there was uncertainty how to fold the reveal into the story beyond the shock scene and could probably have benefitted with a bit more foreshadowing. Though that said the pace in this is quite nice and I enjoyed the way the demon story is so wrapped up in Liu’s commentary on immigrant mothers and Chinese culture. Ipo is a tough mom and I appreciated how there are moments when you question if she is good or evil--especially after digging up the skeleton of a giant demon.  [image]There are some classic horror tropes here—such as digging into the history of a house and visiting an old person in a hospital to investigate further—that feel a bit cliched with the way they rush through it a bit. However, I did quite enjoy the way the story takes its time in the beginning, comfortably moving around COVID times with issues of masking and the uncertainty of restaurants being able to stay open or not. Ipo refusing to wear a mask (which will later make sense because…no disease is going to hurt Ipo) and people leaving bad YELP s all works as some comic relief but in a way that makes you go “oh yeah all that was very real.” It’s weird to see it already embodied like a period piece but it works.So if you want some good demon ass-kicking, The Night Eaters is for you. And next time your parents ask you to do a task for them, you’ll be glad these aren’t your parents. Or jealous that they aren’t. I really loved the dad, honestly.

Mr. Salary kicked off Rooney’s career, winning the short story award from the Irish Times (you can read the entire story here) and attracting publishers into a massive bidding war for rights to publish her debut novel. While it is a brief read, Rooney manages to extract an incredible amount of insight through this slice-of-life look at the complex relationship between early-20s Sukie and her friend and father-figure, the nearly-40s Nathan. Mr. Salary is sharp and concise while delivering an intricate portraiture of emotional complexity, power-dynamics and desire that feels like a prototype of Rooney’s characters and themes to come. ‘My love for him felt so total and so annihilating that it was often impossible for me to see him clearly at all.’In her debut novel, Conversations with Friends, Irish writer Sally Rooney asks ‘is it possible we could develop an alternative model of loving each other?’ Her works are full of non-traditional relationships—often toxic or approaching taboo if not socially-frowned upon—yet Rooney never sets out to moralize on them but merely present them in their messy and emotionally wrenching complexity. Rooney likes to discuss ‘the idea that relationships constantly take forms that don’t really fit into categories that we use to describe those relationships,’ as she says in an interview with Granta, and her deeply-interior novels are mostly played out through conversation and miscommunication as ‘I’m interested in what we are communicating when we’re not necessarily communicating.’ This is forefront in Mr. Salary, with an emotional connection boiling right at the surface of the novel ready to burst at any moment, though as is typical in Rooney there are social dynamics that make it a fraught path of feelings to follow.’I had read that infant animals formed attachments to inappropriate things sometimes, like falcons falling in love with their human breeders, or pandas with zookeepers, things like that.’Sukie has feelings for Nathan, the much older man and distant relative-by-marriage with whom she moved in with out of necessity at the age of 19 when he was 34. He serves as a father figure, caring for her, buying her things, showing her the media his generation enjoyed (they watch Twin Peaks), and this is only enhanced due to Sukie’s own widower father being rather absentee and problematic. Though her feelings grow over the years and by 24 she openly jokes about fantasizing over him. Age gaps are common in Rooney novels, such as Francis and Nick in Conversations, thoughmore akin to Simon and the age-gap with Eileen in Beautiful World, Where Are You?. Though unlike Simon who is openly aroused by age gaps (there is a sex scene where Eileen jokes about being his daughter, turning him on), Nathan is actively trying to not upset the balance of his role as a father figure by allowing his attraction to Sukie to take over…well at least in the past for the most part. This story feels like a prototype for Rooney’s leading women as well. Sukie’s family history is tragic and her poor relationship with her father is implied to be part of why she is drawn to father figures, which is all very much like Frances and even Marianne in Normal People has implications that her mental health struggles and sexual submissiveness are exacerbated by her poor relationship with her parents. In Mr. Salary, Rooney is able to succinctly pack multiple years of history between Sukie and Nathan into a singular day, with their non-relationship finally coming to a head when she returns to Dublin to see her dad who is dying of leukemia. ‘We were predictable to each other,’ she says of Nathan, ‘like two halves of the same brain,’ and this familiarity is comforting in a life where uncertainty and shame ruled the day. However, Nathan, who seems to have little interest in women his own age beyond one-night flings, also uses a sort of jokey-mean tone with Sukie. You know, the kind of gross “he’s making fun of you and being mean because he likes you” behavior that gets normalized in youth. Nathan comes across as potentially emotionally stunted, though it seems more an indication that abuse or shame is normalized in Sukie and she finds it arousing. Which is very present in all of Rooney’s books.The more her dad wanes in her life, the more she clings to Nathan as a father figure as if to subconsciously balance everything out, but it also leads to deeper sexual urges for him. ‘They hated each other,’ she says of Nathan and her father, who negatively nicknamed him Mr Salary, ‘and I mediated their mutual hatred in a way that made me feel successfully feminine.’ Her desires to feel wanted and cared for in both a fatherly way and a romantic way have merged, and the dislike between the two registers like a love triangle affirming her desirability. ‘Emotionally, I saw myself as a smooth, hard little ball,’ Sukie says (she is called frigid by a former boyfriend), and enjoys feeling that Nathan ‘couldn’t get purchase on me. I just rolled away.’ Sukie seems to want to believe she is being chased and holds the power in this relationship, similar to Frances feeling the power-balance was more equal that the reality of it in Conversations. The issues around the impending death of her father brings up issues of mortality. Rooney crafts a great metaphor on the will he/ won’t he aspect of her father’s death with Sukie watching what might be a body but isn’t being dredged from a river, causing Sukie to muse on the spectacle of death. She considers why humans often act ‘as if death was more of a miracle than life was,’ and there is a great blend in the end of the story with death and sex juxtaposed as if to imply ideas of destruction versus creation.Easily read in a single sitting, Mr Salary is a great insight into the themes and characters that Rooney would certainly expand upon over her coming novels. It is a bit slight, yet still feels packed with insight and builds the rather tangled web of feelings and complicated situationship that is heart to her works. I love the way her prose is always so direct and mostly devoid of sentimentality, yet she peppers it with such striking metaphors that it nonetheless stirs the heart and mind. A great opener to a career to come.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,11,222,1,"Feb 11, 2023","Feb 11, 2023","Feb 11, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34234631-mr-salary

In Binti, the Himba are adept at electronic technology, with her father being a successful maker of ‘Astrolabs’ (a communication device that stores the whole of a person’s life) and Binti being a ‘master harmonizer’ able to create electric currents with her body.They are tight-knit, wary of outsiders, and while Binti’s acceptance to the university is a major accomplishment, it is upsetting to her community.‘My tribe is obsessed with innovation and technology, but it is small, private, and, as I said, we don’t like to leave Earth. We prefer to explore the universe by traveling inward, as opposed to outward. No Himba has ever gone to Oomza Uni. So me being the only one on the ship was not that surprising. However, just because something isn’t surprising doesn’t mean it’s easy to deal with.’The Himba are generally looked down upon by the Khoush, the lighter-skinned humans who are city and space dwellers and the race that runs and attends Oomza Uni. Binti tells us they have a feeling of superiority to other races and while Binti experiences racism, it is different than the aggresiveness the Khoush feel for the Meduse, the jellyfish-like species with which the Khoush have a long-standing disdain. The nuance is best expressed in the way they treat Binti and Okwu, the Meduse she tepidly befriends amidst the tense standoff central to the story: ‘where they saw me as a fascinating exotic human, they saw Okwu as a dangerous threat.’ ‘They say that when faced with a fight you cannot win, you can never predict what you will do next.’There is a great depth of world building in Binti and with only minimal explanation, Okorafor is able to probe vast implications as to the nuances of interspecies relations. In a book that focues largely on ideas of tradition, we see how hatred can become a sort of traditions itself, such as the way ‘the Khoush expected everyone to remember their greatest enemy and injustice. They even worked Meduse anatomy and rudimentary technology into mathematics and science classes.’ Generations of groomed disdain often has violent consequences when assumptions bypass true understanding of unfamiliar people and cultures. The Meduse, in turn, operate on assumptions such as ‘humans only understand violence,’ making Binti’s need to negotiate survival all the more difficult and fraught with misunderstanding.‘The Meduse are not what we humans think. They are truth. They are clarity. They are decisive. There are sharp lines and edges. They understand honor and dishonor. I had to earn their honor…’Adapting is a crucial element to survival, and one Binti must utilize in order be the great harmonizer she is destined to be. We see a contrast in her relations with others and how it relates to aspects of culture, such as friends from her own culture (one in which members don’t really associate beyond work with outsiders) who do not value her aims of mathematical scholarship and then her friends on the ship that value her for her academics but are removed from her culture. It is a reminder that while our culture and traditions are valuable parts of our identity, it is not all we are. Later, Okwu and Binti, about as at odds with each other as they can get, begin to value each other through a mutual respect and open curiosity for one another’s cultures. Using the edan, a mysterious object she discovered long ago that activates and protects her from the Meduse while also giving them the ability to speak to each other despite not knowing one another’s language (it is sort of a Pentecost moment here), they begin to relate through similar aspects of individual identity, valuing the determination and convictions the other holds. Binti, in this way, becomes a parable on seeking to understand in order to overcome prejudice.‘My hair was braided into the history of my people.’There is a beautiful moment when, through their ability to communicate, they discover that the Meduse word for their speared tentacles that are critical to their cultural identity and Binti’s word for her hair braids translate into the same word: Okuoko. It becomes a touchpoint of similarity despite being two different things, though both essential elements of their cultural identity. For Binti, her braids are woven in a way that ‘tell the story’ of her family and legacy. The tentacles are part of the Meduse’s self-defense, and the story revolves around the Meduse attempting to break into the Uni in order to recover the tentacle spear the Khoush took from the Meduse chief for the purpose of study and have displayed in the Uni’s museum. At the end, Binti’s braids are replaced with Meduse okuoko and is symbolic of her identity adapting from an isolated set of traditions into a more collective identity in a larger world. This is similar with the Otjize, the mixture of red clay the Himba wear on their skin as part of their cultural identity and religious practice. Along the way, Binti and Okwu discover the clay works as a miraculous healing balm on Meduse skin and, later, Binti discovers she can recreate the mixture with clay found on her new home planet at the Uni. It becomes a more nuanced symbol of the benefits from sharing culture with others as well as a reminder that traditions can adapt to incorporate new landscapes and new lives outside the traditional cultural homeland. An element of traditions adapting after diaspora is evident here.‘“When you do math fractals long enough, you kick yourself into treeing just enough to get lost in the shallows of the mathematical sea.’The story certainly probes ideas of ethics, such as the previously mentioned spear kept in the Uni museum. The story feels like an allegory of colonialism in a way, touching on how, throughout history, cultural artifacts have been taken from other cultures to collect in, say, the British Museum. There is also the gatekeeping of academics, with Khoush traditionally being the only ones invited to study at the Uni. In Binti, we see science and mathematics being a way for cultures to interact through the shared knowledge, such as it being an equalizer for Binti and the Khoush friends she makes in the early stage of the voyage, but also a warning to the violence when academics is undertaken without ethics. At novellas end, however, we see a renewed commitment towards inclusion in the Uni and hope for a brighter, shared future. It could come across as a bit simplistic and naive, especially how quickly the shift occurs, but I do enjoy the hope inherent here.I quite enjoyed Binti, a quick tale about culture and forging connections across divides and hope to continue reading the series. I mean, I need to know what the edan is, and I enjoy how weird tech artifacts always figure into Okorafor’s afrofuturism stories. I also enjoy how much her stories employ actual African culture and deal with issues of Western society and colonialism in friction with culture. This is a fun one with a lot of excellent world building that seems shockingly vast considering the small scope of the novella. And just cool sci-fi stuff, like the ship they travel in is actually a living creature refurbished for ferrying people around the stars. I also enjoy the hope in a shared, ethical future where we can learn to stop war and overcome prejudice. Cheers to that.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,0,126,1,"Feb 09, 2023","Feb 09, 2023","Feb 09, 2023",,Unknown Binding,view (with text),/book/show/25667918-binti

Poetry, rubbing two words toge‘The wound is where the light enters us.’I often think that poetry is one of the closest ways we come to magic in life. Poetry, rubbing two words together until they make fire. Something that can warm the heart, spark desires, or simply illuminate the darkness like a torch in the labyrinth of life. Dr. Maya C. Popa is a poet who cultivates and shares this love for the guiding light of poetry. I first discovered her through social media as she maintains an endlessly wonderful twitter feed directing readers towards poems sure to stir the heart, though her own poetry is also a blissful balm on our weary souls. Wound Is the Origin of Wonder, Popa’s follow-up collection to the rightfully applauded American Faith: Poems, traverses the both the grief and joys of life. The word ‘wonder,’ says the book’s epigraph, is thought to derive from the German wunde, where we also get ‘wound,’ and by this logic Popa shows us pain and joy as not opposites but inseparably two sides to the same coin of life. Inevitable experiences we grasp in contrast to one another. These poems flow through these concepts with a tone of acceptance—sometimes tragically—though never resignation, instead always flexing the muscles of hope to crumble the crusts of sorrow that try to harden around our hearts. With poems addressing loss, the recent pandemic, or even ghost crabs and peacocks, Popa’s elegant poetry breaks into the reader like a ray of light through a stormcloud with understanding and encouragement, always questioning amidst all the sadness the world can throw ‘when joy comes, will I be ready, I wonder.’‘Begin again in darkness, life says sometimes.Picture the trees burning in autumn,the earth’s relief, at last, at being fallen.’I appreciate the way Popa never shirks from hardships and hard subjects yet also never feels bogged down in them either. ‘I have wanted all the world, its beauties / and its injuries,’ she writes n the opening poem Dear Life, and this commitment to the spectrum of experience resonates through the entire collection. Yet it also goes deeper than merely juxtaposes joy and grief, digging into moments of loss to embody the sadness that comes from separation in a finite life to show that it is a risk we take for pursuing joy. ‘A sort of slow vanishing / your image from every vantage / absented,’ Popa writes of a lost love in Longing Explained by William James, and while the tone is somber, it is a reminder that opening ourselves up to the wounds of life is also the only way we can experience wonder. The whole maxim about it being better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all but expanded to a wide variety of experience. We must allow ourselves to lower our armor, give ourselves to the beauty of the world, acknowledge that wounds come with it, yet bravely embarking anyways.‘The past is a country of held breathsmisread as silence, or the way thingshad to be.’Many of the poems brush on the griefs and separations of the recent COVID years, a time when ‘there was malice, but mostly / a kind of grief,’ as she writes in Late Genesis. There is a plea for ‘anything but illness, I beg the plagues, / but shiny crows or nuclear rain,’ wishing for a tenderness in all the hurt and fear. Popa’s toolbelt of historical allusions tie past and present, creating a timeless quality to her poems that remind us that our experiences are part of a larger human experience that has traversed the timeline of humanity and appeared in many reiterations of the same themes. Her allusions, often Biblical or references to scientific figures, wed ideas of spirituality and science in an interesting way that probe notions of experience that can’t be simply contained and explained within logic or academics.Which is where the magic of poetry comes in and the ways it can give us an artistic perspective on life that explores meaning in the abstract. ‘I worry I’ll only / have words with which / to tell the story of what mostly / occurred outside language,’ Popa confesses, tapping into the root of the poet’s struggle to use the faulty nets of words to trap the ineffability of life. She wishes ‘to upend beauty for something / approximate,’ or to live life ‘for the ode of it./ The life that can’t be lived behind the eyelids’ It is a lovely sentiment, the idea of being a living poem.Life is full of pain, but life also goes on, Popa tells us, or better put ‘time persists, yes, I can see there are new branches.’ This collection is absolutely gorgeous, embodying the ‘grains of happiness measured against all the dark’ as Jane Hirshfield writes in her own poem The Weighing. With Popa, we feel it is enough. 5/5Dear LifeI can’t undo all I have done unto myself,what I have let an appetite for love do to me.I have wanted all the world, its beautiesand its injuries; some days,I think that is punishment enough.Often, I received more than I’d asked,which is how this works—you fish in open waterready to be wounded on what you reel in.Throwing it back was a nightmare.Throwing it back and seeing my own faceas it disappeared into the dark water.Catching my tongue suddenly on metal,spitting the hook into my open palm.Dear life: I feel that hook today most keenly.Would you loosen the line—you’ll listenif   I ask you,if   you are the sort of  life I think you are....more",Notes are private!,-1,130,1,"Feb 08, 2023","Feb 08, 2023","Feb 08, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60165416-wound-is-the-origin-of-wonder

This Eisner Award Winning series hits a lot of turbulence but manages to be a really fun ride that could arguably be said to overly rely on tropes but I personally see it as having fun with familiar sci-fi elements. You know, the way you play with your action figures when you are a kid. We last left the ragtag group of space heroes as they are picked up by a rogue sect of The Renunciation hellbent on revolution,but their fire and brimstone approach might be a bit more of an extremist takeover. They have converted a planet into a superweapon that isn’t NOT just Starkiller Base from Star Wars: The Force Awakens and, Grix, ever the non-violent warrior has discovered in this case ‘the enemy of our enemy is NOT our friend.’  [image]This is an exciting conclusion, with the crew caught between religious extremists with a taste for murder and a massive corporation who believes ‘No life more important than the generation of revenue.’ There are a lot of loose threads to wrap up here and the graphic duo of G. Willow Wilson and Christian Ward manage to do so quite effectively—though not always smoothly with yet again some pacing issues and the jumping back and forth that leaves some questions about about timeframes—with absolutely gorgeous artwork. I mean look at this, I love this stuff:  [image]Vess has the most interesting storyline of the whole bunch through this series, and here we see her loyalties tested as she maintains her commitment to The Path. But is the naked dude medidating at the center of a superweapon ready to vaporize people with no warning truly a spiritual guide or just another false prophet?  [image]Either way, this spells disaster for the budding sapphic romance between her and Grix, and much of this volume is driven on vibes of sorrow and desperation, which makes for a pretty epic tone as all the plotlines come to a dramatic head.  [image]I really enjoyed this series, even despite some of its flaws, and it made for a great sci-fi good time between issues of SAGA. There are some really awesome elements here, and I kind of loved how on-the-nose it was about Lux being Amazon (having it turn out to be run entirely by AI algorithms with no empathy reminds me of real life Amazon algorithm stories affecting employment). I also loved Vess and her entire story. While pacing was the largest issue in the series, and a sort of jerkiness to the storytelling that occasionally made it hard to understand what was going on, it was still a satisfying ride. I enjoyed the way it would carry over dialogue into the next scene, effectively having voiceovers in print media. Plus the art was jaw dropping. And we see some Star Wars-esque planet killing:  [image]Anyways, I would recommend this for anyone looking for a visual extravaganza and a fun and chaotic space opera. The love story is really cute and charming as well, and Cpt Grix rules. I would read anything this duo does after this.

After a rocky but promising start in the first volume, this segment slows down the action and focuses in on a more contained episode which is truly to its benefit. Grix and Vess, teamed up aboard the Sundog and on the run after broadcasting the details of an epic political scandal everybody decided to ignore since it would upend all of society, have a run in with space pirates and Grix’s leadership is put to the test to get them out alive.

There are some real Becky Chambers vibes here mixed with the nods to Cowboy Bebop and Firefly, and the character dynamics really sing here and make you invested in the outcome. I loved it.

Who Owns the Clouds, a harrowing yet beautiful graphic novel from Mario Brassard, illustrated by Gérard DuBois and translated here into English from the original French by Yvette Ghione, tells the story of Mila, a woman still haunted by childhood memories of war. Told through her dreams of an endless line of people fleeing the fires and devastation of war, the story has a sparse surrealistic quality that opens up into profundity. ‘Even if I wanted to tell you everything, I’m not sure what good it would do,’ Mila says at the scope of traumas that unfolded, but adds ‘That one person went through this pain is enough, I think.’ This is a haunting reminder of the suffering war brings on all those involved, especially the innocent children who can’t quite grasp the enormity of its monstrosity and, told through beautiful artwork with only a minimal seasoning of color, a story that will dwell deep in your heart.  [image]The art in this is simply gorgeous, managing to convey the devastation so effectively with its images and mood. I love the art style, which looks a lot like printmaking, and I especially love the inclusion of so many cats. The artwork is mostly in black and shades of gray, though an occasional splash of color adds an emotional punctuation into the work.   [image]The loss of innocence is captured so heartbreakingly well in this little book, and the lingering terrors that send tremors through Mila even into adulthood are approached delicately yet powerfully. The sparseness of the prose helps, teasing out a darkness lurking just beyond Mila’s understanding. Nothing is directly addressed, yet the reader can deduce the tragedies in the unspoken, making this all the more haunting. A brief moment of artistic resistance by her uncle, which ends violently, makes for a chilling centerpiece of the story that metaphors the balance of childlike innocence with the darkness of war.   [image]This is a brief but lasting look at war and the shadows that chase survivors no matter where they go. I enjoyed centering the tale on ideas of clouds, with white cloud signifying a sort of happiness and peace and dark clouds belonging to the death-bringers. This is an affecting little work of artistic beauty and a plea to remember that engaging in war harms far more than enemy soldiers and politicians, with the worst trauma falling upon the innocent young like Mila. This would make for an excellent addition to any school library and would be effective for classroom use.4.5/5‘Maybe memories are like clouds.

I love this view of poetry, as a guide through li‘Poetry is not a code to be broken but a way of seeing with the eyes shut,’ wrote poet Linda Pastan. I love this view of poetry, as a guide through life existing on emotions and vibes more than some academic puzzle to decode, something that harmonizes with your inner being and allows you to feel the rhythms of ideas and existence. I was saddened to learn that Pastan (1932-2023) had passed this week at the age of 90, but reminded of how lovely her words are and how much they meant to me. Pastan is a poet who manages to capture the anxieties that exist in everyday life—the personal moments that occur ‘behind the news of the day’—and often works in themes on grief (‘ Grief is a circular staircase / I have lost you.’), marriage and death. Or, as Pastan says herself, her poems have ‘ interest in metaphor, in the changing of the seasons, in Eden, in the dangers lurking beneath the surfaces of everyday life, in Death just waiting.’ Nominated twice for the National Book Award, Pastan’s poetry is highly moving with a sweetness of slice-of-life moments, managing to be emotionally complex yet blissfully accessible while the surface of the poem still hints at the mysteries to unpack just beneath. A lovely poet with a long legacy, she will be missed yet I am thankful for the words she leaves behind. Such as Imaginary Conversation, which has long been amongst my favorite poems:You tell me to live each dayas if it were my last. This is in the kitchenwhere before coffee I complainof the day ahead—that obstacle raceof minutes and hours,grocery stores and doctors.But why the last? I ask. Why notlive each day as if it were the first—all raw astonishment, Eve rubbingher eyes awake that first morning,the sun coming uplike an ingénue in the east?You grind the coffeewith the small roar of a mindtrying to clear itself. I setthe table, glance out the windowwhere dew has baptized everyliving surface.This collection does what Selected poems do best: select an overview from the poet’s work that best represents them and here you can find some startlingly good poems. I first came across Pastan in an anthology (it was the poem above) and knew right then and there she was a poet I had to explore further. I love finding a poet who’s words you immediately fall in love with, and few poets have ever captured this feeling as well as Pastan’s own poem about that matter:A New PoetFinding a new poetis like finding a new wildflowerout in the woods. You don't seeits name in the flower books, andnobody you tell believesin its odd color or the wayits leaves grow in splayed rowsdown the whole length of the page. In factthe very page smells of spilledred wine and the mustiness of the seaon a foggy day; the odor of truthand of lying.And the words are so familiar,so strangely new, wordsyou almost wrote yourself, if onlyin your dreams there had been a pencilor a pen or even a paintbrush,if only there had been a flower.This captures Pastan’s style quite well, with figurative language that embodies feelings of coziness—paintbrushes and pencil, gardens, the sea washing on foggy shore, and other elements where one wouldn’t be wrong to refer to her poems as cottagecore—and Pastan tends to bring landscapes alive in imagery of ‘ dreamlike / rivers of color.’ Her poems tend to be short and concise, something I always really appreciate and this aspect made her a frequent go-to for poems that I would leave around town when I did my public poetry projects. ‘My impulse is always to condense,’ she said in an interview with the Paris Review, ‘and the few times I’ve tried writing prose, or even narrative poetry, I keep chipping away at the words until I may end up with no more than a haiku.’ In this way, Pastan is able to say so much in so little, with each poem being like a seed that in planted in your mind where it will later bloom within your thoughts. Pastan also has a wonderfully constructed structure to most of her poem, often giving it a rather rhythmic flow. Poems like Insomnia: 3am often use the form to embody elements of the poem. The poem begins:Sleep has stepped outfor a smokeand may not be back.which is lovely imagery, but the short lines in bursts of three also seem to imitate the ticking of the clock that becomes central to the poem. Pastan captures quiet moments in ways that really bring them to life with a great musicality to them and helps us see the beauty of life all around us.The DogwoodsI remember, in the weekof the dogwoods, why sometimeswe give up everythingfor beauty, lose our senseand our senses, as we do nowfor these blossoms, sprinkledlike salt through the dark woods.And like the story of pheasantswith salt on their tailsto tame them,look how we are made helplessby a brief explosionof petalsone week in April.‘There is an age when you are most yourself,’ Pastan writes in Something About the Trees and I love reading an overview of a poets work as you can often see who they are in the moment of each individual collection. While Pastan doesn’t stray far from her primary themes, it is wonderful to watch her thoughts progress over the years. Later poems start to approach death more often, less as a thief in the night but as someone they are preparing to meet. But it is always managed in such comforting prose, such as this from Musings Before Sleep:The lines on my face are startingto make me look like photographsof Auden in old age. If the linesof my poems could also beas incandescent as his,would I be will to lookas worn and wrinkled?’Farewell to Linda Pastan, but at least she has left a lovely trail of words to follow her. Sweet, accessible, and always moving, these are marvelous words.4.5/5Why Are Your Poems so Dark?Isn't the moon dark too,most of the time?And doesn't the white pageseem unfinishedwithout the dark stainof alphabets?When God demanded light,he didn't banish darkness.Instead he inventedebony and crowsand that small moleon your left cheekbone.Or did you mean to ask""Why are you sad so often?""Ask the moon.Ask what it has witnessed....more",Notes are private!,-1,101,1,"Feb 02, 2023","Feb 02, 2023","Feb 02, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60165420-almost-an-elegy

Writer and artist duo G. Willow Wilson and Christian Ward plunge us into an exciting and dynamic galactic adventure that may have a bit of a cliched assortment of elements that feel rather on-the-nose at times, but the overall interplay between them feels successful and like a shortcut to excitement. Drawing on many noticeable influences like Dune and the tv series Cowboy Bebop and Firefly, this is a high-stakes space extravaganza that has some early pacing issues, though there is a lot of moving pieces to coordinate in order to light the fuse of conflict that I am eager to watch play out further. A critique of capitalism and religious influence in government and the corruption that can occur, Invisible Kingdom shows a lot of promise, and some extraordinarily eye-popping artwork, despite a bit of a jumbled narrative that needs more room to breathe.  [image]The story follows space captain Grix, who pilots a Lux cargo ship (the Lux corporation is a bit heavy-handedly just Amazon in space, but I’m into the criticisms so lets goooooo), and Vess who has just joined a religious sect called The Renunciation. This cult swears off all worldly possessions in a galaxy where rampant consumerism seems to be the only joy left for anyone. While the two groups seems diametrically opposed, an uncovered scandal links the two and Grix and Vess’ destiny cross in order to stop in, or be blown to space dust. The story really addresses capitalism head of with the major corporation doing what major corporations do best: corruption. And also how under capitalism it’s so expected that a for-profit company would be shady that nobody seems to care as long as they get their consumer goods. There is a great look at how the government’s hands are tied to the corporation and the religious sect over the need for donations and votes and why would the politicians act when it would be political suicide to expose the truth? It gives a good high-stakes tone for the series to progress, added by the fact that literally everyone is trying to kill our “found family”-style crew.  [image]Starting with the positives, the art is incredible. The character designs are great (and are a variety of humanoid species) and the colors really pop. There is a sense of bright, in your face pop-culture marketing to the color palettes or the video com systems. It’s just so pretty to look at and there is awesome stuff like a floating cathedral.   [image]The story is fun, but it really struggles to find its legs. It jerks back and forth like Grix’s ship doing evasive maneuvers more so than flow forward and a controlled pace, and some of the major reveals at the beginning are a bit hard to follow at first. They try to tease tension through a slow reveal but it mostly just makes it feel clumsy as everything comes at you a bit fast, especially Vess’ storyline that needs a bit more breathing space to capture the sense that they have been there awhile. It also just feels like “Epic Sci-Fi Starter Kit” with many of the elements. But it works for the most part and I enjoyed it. I do enjoy the sapphic elements as well, and that Vess’ species has numerous different genders.Overall, I’m really enjoying this and optimistic about where it is headed. Will they survive? Will they topple empires?

A bizarre yet satisfying fever dream of a graphic novel, Press Here to Continue by Spanish artist Ana Galvañ taps into human discomfort in a technological world across five brief graphic shorts. Set in an uncanny valley reality, you can feel the humanness being deleted from existence through stories which are more surreal and threatening vibes than concrete narrative. Not that there isn’t a story to glean, but they come across as fragments full of dread, building a wave of unease through lack of a larger context. It is successfully destabilizing, with a bright art style that feels very much like eerie corporate pamphlets, using a lack of details to further dehumanize the characters and make the setting feel universal. It is a quick read, but one that will linger like a splinter in the mind.  [image]I really enjoyed how unsettling these are. The title recalls video games and here it feels like the humans are pawns in a system where nothing quite adds up and everything seems ominously sadistic. There are some serious Philip K. Dick vibes touching on technology anxiety that will make you begin to understand why Lord Byron was a Luddite. Though it also feels like a more abstract and punchy collection of Black Mirror shorts. I feel like Radiohead should probably be playing.  [image]The dehumanization aspect plays large here, always seeming like some larger power is pulling strings and everyday people are their prey. We have a doll head that seems to take over it’s victims bodies by luring them through sex, a corporate interview full of mind games, and a sort of computer virus that thrives on trauma—it’s all very sinister and creepy. It never seems to fully land or be explainable but that sense of chaos only adds to the discomfort in a successful way. It is a bit brief and readers may want more to latch onto, but if you need some disquieting and menacing vibes, this is for you.3.5/5  [image]...more",Notes are private!,0,111,1,"Jan 26, 2023","Jan 26, 2023","Jan 26, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/52467321-press-enter-to-continue

Middle School is a fantastic and moving graphic novel of a slightly fictionalized version on their 7th grade experience growing up in Canada, a book I knew I had to have as soon as I saw the great artistic prodigy, Tillie Walden was providing the artwork (On A Sunbeam remains an all-time favorite graphic novel for me). We watch the twins face learning a new school and new friendships (while trying to keep their best-friend in the loop), adapting to the changes of puberty, and entering the tumultuous emotions of first crushes, but a chance discovery of their mom’s boyfriend’s old guitar might change their lives forever and give them an outlet for their feelings. Fans of the duo will enjoy this look into their early years though strangers to the music will find this to be just as heartfelt and endearing. Gorgeously illustrated and handling topics with humor and sensitivity, Middle School is an absolute delight that effectively captures the pre-teen vibes and might even inspire you to grab a guitar. So why don’t you come a little closer and let's talk about this lovely book.  [image]First performanceJust based on the band and artist I knew I was going to love this, but the message on finding your friends and who you are hit especially well for me. When the album Heartthrob dropped in 2013, I had just started a part time job at a Barnes and Noble in a city I didn’t know and far from any friends I’d ever had after basically fleeing working a factory job I hated (okay so I might have tried to start a union at my Uncle’s factory. I’d say we don’t talk about this but nobody from that part of the fam even talks to me since then so it’s cool). Heartthrob and the first Lorde album happened to be the only two in-store-play albums we had at the time so it got a lot of play, which was great because I fell in love with it and I remember making a joke with a coworker about how whenever Closer came on we’d instinctively start shelving faster like it was some 80s workout video. So you know you are doing well enough as the new person if the cool employee with a Libertines tattoo doesn’t hate you, and a lot of old memories associated with really enjoying all the Tegan and Sara albums came back reading this (like my oldest seeing them as a first concert). So reading a book with that connection about finding friends and fitting in way nice as most of my friends 10 years later I people I met working at Barnes and now 3 of us share an office together working the library (and yes we have a union here) so that’s a happy ending.But back to this book because it really is quite lovely and—as expected—Tillie Walden’s artwork is phenomenal. I mean:  [image]Tillie Walden superfan right hereSara and Tegan are identical twins, so to help the reader keep them apart Tegan is often represented with the color blue while Sara through the color red. There are quite a lot of characters here which can be tough to keep straight sometimes but Walden switches up their hair enough to keep them in order. The story is rather episodic while having overarching elements such as Sara crushing on one friend while Tegan is navigating trying to be best friend’s with Noa despite Noa’s other best friend being a total bully and downer (this is packed with middle school drama!), but it all flows quite well and has a good comfortable pace that makes it feel like you are reading a full year of growth without ever feeling like it drags. I also enjoyed that, despite being their graphic memoir, the story is pushed to take place in the present as it will resonate more with middle or high school readers. Texting is very central to the communication in the book yet it does still retain a sort of “timeless” pre-teen feel that anyone will empathize with.  [image]Teenage Tegan and Sara performingI really enjoyed getting bits about the twins forming a band as well, here named Gunk (instead of Plunk, which was their actual first band name). We see how songwriting becomes a way to express complex emotions in a productive way and how quickly the twins take to putting effort in the music (also the difficulty of balancing art with school work). For those looking for more, Tegan and Sara released a memoir in 2019, High School, that tells the “true” story, and their 2019 album Hey, I’m Just Like You is a reworking of many of the songs they wrote as teenagers and are alluded to in this book. Even if you’ve never heard of this group (would recommend checking them out) you can get just as much out of the book as anyone else. It is quite a moving and familiar story and I just loved it. Walden does such an excellent job with the artwork, the story is really endearing, and everything about it just works. Also this would be a perfect way to kickstart Pride Month starting this week!4.5/5  [image]...more",Notes are private!,0,106,1,"May 30, 2023","May 30, 2023","Jan 26, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61418417-junior-high

Blackwater, the queer YA horror graphic novel from Sometimes what are seemingly all the right ingredients can still not mesh into a satisfying whole. Blackwater, the queer YA horror graphic novel from duo Jeannette Arroyo and Ren Graham unfortunately resides in this category, having a lot of good things going for it but never quite finding its footing before stumbling through a rather rushed ending. It’s a tale of two unlikely friends when Tony, the popular track star suffering and acting out due to his alcoholic father’s inattention, teams up with Eli, the quiet kid who gets bullies and has an autoimmune disorder that makes a public life all but impossible, when their town is threatened by hauntings and horrors. With a retro art style that rotates each chapter between the two illustrators (a rather jarring effect, unfortunately) and plenty of spooky elements, this never quite satisfies or scares, feeling rather forced in terms of both the representation elements and storyline.I really wanted to like this one but it just seemed to fumble about on most levels. The storyline is a bit clunky and occasionally easy to lose the thread of what’s happening, not to mention the pacing never feels comfortable in it’s own story which makes for a rocky landing at the ending. I also just am personally not a big fan of the art or character design. It is presumably set in the modern day, though Tony looks like he walked off the set of Grease. The illustrators made the choice to alternate chapters, and in some ways this works as the more cartoony style is more befitting the action sequences, but the characters seem a bit too dissimilar between the two and it unfortunately comes across as mostly a jarring experience.I do really enjoy how much representation there is in the story, however. Tony is Puerto Rican and Eli is trans and Jewish, and the unlikely romance is great to see. Some of the elements did feel a bit inserted for the sake of being there without being folded into the narrative, but all in all I’d rather see clunky representation than none at all so I still count that as a win. It does feel realistic in its representation and adds a good dynamic, plus I love how supportive the characters are of queer romance and overall it is rather cute and charming. Except when Eli steals Tony’s inhaler to teach him a lesson, which was really uncool. Unfortunately the horror elements fall pretty flat though and the werewolf story is pretty weak and could have used more background.Blackwater is a book that could have been great but just never quite seemed to make all the ingredients work together. It is still worth reading and I’d love to see more YA graphic novels with this level of representation, especially having chronically ill characters who are very often overlooked in fiction. Though if you are looking for a good spooky and queer YA graphic novel, I would also recommend Over My Dead Body, Coven, or Squad (which also has a retro art style). 2.5/5  [image]...more",Notes are private!,0,112,1,"Jan 25, 2023","Jan 25, 2023","Jan 25, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58484027-blackwater

You know, the one that asks “What will we do with a drunken sailor?” Well, if McGlue, the title character of Ottessa Moshfegh’s debut novella McGlue, was here to answer he’d tell us ‘The only solution is to drink again. That makes me almost jolly.’ And so it goes in this gritty novella as Moshfegh has us tossed about sailing the seas of the ocean and alcoholism inside the titular character’s consciousness. It is more gross than dark, building a grimy tone that reads like waking up with a hangover covered in your own vomit and sweat—a frequent occurrence in the novella. McGlue is a bit intentionally gratuitous, with a constant barrage of grime, violence, misogyny and far more slurs than needed to make the point, so reader beware if these are an issue especially as homophobia is central to McGlue’s own blistering self-hatred. Much of this reads like a joyless version of Our Flag Means Death with the humor replaced with spite, though it is also subversively akin to Azareen Van der Vliet Oloomi's Fra Keeler. Yet, amidst the filth and squalor of the plot, the prose shines like a lighthouse guiding us through it all. With tinges of mystery and riding the waves of shock value, McGlue is a portrait of an alcoholic down on his luck and fighting with his own mind as he struggles to put together the truth behind the night he may have murdered his only friend.‘ I wanted to change my name and forget my face and I wanted to drink and get my head ruined but I certainly hadn’t thought about making it. That wasn’t anything I’d ever sought out to do.’The novella opens with McGlue in a ship’s hold, fighting waves of nausea to learn he will be facing trial for the murder of his only friend when they reach home in Salem, Massachusetts. Set in 1851, this is long after the witch trials, however evoking Salem probes the idea that accusations might not be the whole truth of the matter. The problem is, McGlue can’t remember a thing. He tells us his ‘memory has suffered a long time from my love for grog’ and a head-injury that left an large crack in his skull also scatters his thoughts, sending the reader through a tumultuous narrative that blends past and present without warning with the ghosts of the past occasionally intruding. It is expertly done and if there was one take-away from this book it is that Moshfegh is a fantastic writer. Here we have imagery like the ‘night sky sparkling like wet, broken glass,’ and a control over the pacing and seamless transitions that are enviable from any writer, much less a debut. The scene setting and characters come alive quite well, even if the characters aren’t always the most dynamic.McGlue essentially chronicles the companionship between McGlue and Johnson, a rich kid who was ‘just a student of misery’ and rescues a runaway McGlue from freezing to death. The pair make a dynamic duo of debauchery and self-destruction. Johnson is interesting, having abandoned a wealthy family for the sake of destruction.‘He had this idea that there was something like grace and victory to be found in smiting your good fortune, choosing the worst. In answering what he would do with his life say to follow the most putrid path, to ruin his life.’ It comes across a bit like a rich boy trying to be all 1850s Fight Club fetishizing self-destruction, though to be fair it’s not like they had therapy back then and as will be discussed later, feeling like an aberration in society can be really harmful. McGlue, on the other hand, never had an avenue towards success and is content to continue to sink into drink and destitution. Having the story told from his perspective allows us to witness his dark passengers of alcoholism and self-hatred, as well as his damaged ‘snake brain’ that fuel his self-destructive tendencies. ‘Had I liquor to spill I’d pour it directly into the crack, to cool the snakes,’ he explains about his constant drinking to quiet his mind, ‘get them to settle down, quit hissing. If I drink enough down my throat they lie still for a while and I can ride out a moment of my life.’ To him, alcohol comes before all else, even—in a scene that seems a parody of Molly Bloom from Ulysses—tying a woman who is interested in him to a railing and leaving her all night in order to drink undisturbed. The need to drink overrides all:’I am a drunk.It took me some time to know this.Here is how I know. How it’s always been is I don’t know how to talk or move or sleep or shit. I wake up mornings with my head in a vice. The only solution is to drink again. That makes me almost jolly. It does wonders in the morning to take my mind off the pain and pressure. I can use my eyes after the first drink, I remember how to line up my feet and walk, loosen my jaw, tell someone to get out of my way. Then I get tired. I whine and need to lie down. I lie down, I want a drink. I cannot sleep without having already forgotten my name, my face, my life. If I were to sit still or lie down in a room with some memory of myself – the time I have left to live out, that nasty sentence, that hell – I would go mad.’Something Moshfegh does well is present completely horrible characters and manage to humanize them, and by the end you do feel for McGlue. In a way this gave me shades of McCarthy’s Child of God where the disturbed focal character was no more disgusting than the society that demonized them. ‘I am livewired, hungry-eyed like a scorned wolf, but give the appearance of a nervous boy, tittering along in search of something, namely, another drink.’This does go a bit much however, particularly using racial and homophobic slurs to such an extent that it isn’t even shocking or edgy and seems more like a teenager without much creativity to use anything else. Which, to be fair, is the character, but using the N-word to be punchy isn’t my favorite and while sure maybe it is historically accurate the constant use of Fag isn’t as it wasn’t a slur being used in 1851 Not to say authors can’t do this but it was to such an extent that it was eye rolling. As a friend put it, that sort of writing works if you use it as seasoning but here it feels so over seasoned that the actual flavor of the dish is lost beneath it. Which is a shame because it is a good dish that didn’t need so much seasoning. I do like how this is a woman writing the sort of novel full of problematic issues that men have long gotten away with though, and I think there is something to be said about it being subversive in that regard. In this way it reminds me a lot of Azareen Van der Vliet Oloomi, another Iranian American author who did this technique more successfully in Fra Keeler and (to a lesser extent) Call Me Zebra. However, Oloomi manages to creep into the reader's mind more effectively through atmosphere and nuance whereas McGlue, unsubtle, relentlessly bashes at the door. Which might be your thing and that's cool too. It just never amounted to all that much beyond the effect for me and felt more like trying to be dark than actually being dark. There is, however, an element where the braze. homophobia is meant to signal something deeper ‘in that idea in the air between [McGlue and Johnson.]’ It demonstrates how in a society that doesn’t give space and understanding for people to be themselves and grow, the anger is often directed inward and stifles them. It is a rather tragic tale with a bit of a twist ending that is rather emotional but also a bit trite.Still, McGlue is still an impressive debut, and despite a few criticisms it does make me want to explore more of Moshfegh’s work. There are some really wonderfully constructed scenes here, and while shock value doesn’t do much for me some of the more alarming moments are pretty great. Overall though it is like a good steak, a really good one, but it’s obscenely over seasoned and there are no sides or a drink to go with it. It’s just missing any zest, it’s missing anything to complement it and make it work beyond merely swallowing it all down. This is a grimy and bleak tale and one I can see why it would really work for others but at the end of it all it felt more like a well-embodied passing hangover that I don’t see much need to dwell in.3.5/5'I stand praying, just to see what happens.

It is a ‘play-novelette’ as he called it, not unlike The Moon Is Down, though here the mixture of prose and play-format dialogue swings heavily towards the dialogue. It tells the story of a couple, Joe Saul—one of Steinbeck’s signature ‘everyman’ characters—and his with Mordeen who, wanting to give a child to her husband but fearing he is sterile, gets pregnant with Joe’s arrogant assistant, Victor. Rounding out the cast is Ed, Joe’s best and most loyal friend, and across four different settings the characters discuss their situation and muse about life in typical Steinbeck fashion. Unfortunately, this comes across rather stilted and while the dialogue has some beautiful moments it is also a tad overwrought. This would perhaps work much better as a radio play or on the stage, but feels rather lifeless upon the page. Still a worthwhile read with glimmers of what makes Steinbeck such a beloved classic writer, Burning Bright is a rather dim light in his impressive oeuvre.There is much to enjoy in Burning Bright, however. The play breaks into four scenes with a different setting for each: a circus, a farm, a boat and a hospital. While their personalities and present drama remains the same, each setting has the characters with different backgrounds to fit the setting (they all live in nearby farms in one, or are all sailors in another). Steinbeck tries to make the story a universal one, a story that fits over any social circle or setting, which is a really cool concept and while it is a bit jarring I think it would look cool in a play. It also plays into the idea that Joe is the ‘everyman,’ a concept that Steinbeck often worked into his novels and characters like Joe, or, say, Ethan from The Winter of Our Discontent, become a bit of a barometer of the soul and social values of mid-century United States. The whole plotline with his Mordeen sleeping with the completely despicable Victor, who is portrayed as an usurper, has some Biblical seeming vibes but is also just a bit not great. It makes her function almost solely for her role in upholding the emotional states and legacies of the two men and serving mostly for her childbearing abilities than as a person with her own agency. Nobody has ever called Steinbeck a feminist writer for sure, but this felt a little egregious here. I do enjoy Ed, however, and his name recalls Steinbeck’s good friend Ed Ricketts who is the inspiration for many Steinbeck characters such as Doc in Cannery Row. Ed is quite likeable here and helps Joe through his existential crises once he realizes he is, in fact, infertile and there is no way the baby can be his. It does all lead up to a satisfying conclusion, with an large idea that ‘every man is father to all children and every child must have all men as father.’ This is classic Steinbeck, the idea that we are all one family and must care for each other and raise the human race together. I just feel like he did this more effectively in other books. Burning Bright is a curious and interesting experiment in the lengthy list of Steinbeck books, and it is nice to see him playing with his own craft. While it didn’t fully work here, there are some lovely moments and at least Steinbeck was pushing himself to create in fresh and dynamic ways. A worthwhile read, though one that will likely most interest long-time fans while I would caution newcomers to try some of his other books first.3/5...more",Notes are private!,-1,113,1,"Jan 23, 2023","Jan 23, 2023","Jan 23, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/287241.Burning_Bright

Dystopian sci-fi has been quite popular in the past few decades and champions the spirit of rebellion and resistance, but something I find so charming about Ursula K Le Guin is that she tends to focus less on the struggles within dystopias and instead on the struggles that come trying to envision and forge a better world towards a eutopia. Though Le Guin also agrees with Atwood, having written ‘every eutopia contains a dystopia, every dystopia contains a eutopia,’ and in her novel The Lathe of Heaven, Le Guin explores the idea that even best intentions in creating a perfect world can fracture to chaos and hunger for power and be full of imperfections. Le Guin explores the philosophies of Taoism—central to many of Le Guin’s works— and critiques of Utilitarianism in this wildly imaginative story. Through shifting realities that barrel through an exciting variety of sci-fi tropes, The Lathe of Heaven is an excellent examination on power and control, the nuances that make up society and an expression that ‘it’s not right to play God with masses of people.’‘This was the way he had to go; he had no choice. He had never had any choice. He was only a dreamer.’Philip K. Dick wrote that Lathe of Heaven is ‘one of the best novels, and most important to understanding of the nature of our world.’ Which is high praise from another master of science fiction, and the author this novel is most often compared with. He adds that in Lathe ‘ the dream universe is articulated in such a striking and compelling way that I hesitate to add any further explanation to it; it requires none.’ Which I tend to agree with, and there is nothing I can say that hasn’t already been better expressed by others of Le Guin herself but I love this book so much that I can’t help but ramble about it. A short novel, but packed with amazing ideas, Lathe of Heaven rotates between three perspectives. First is George Orr, a man with the power to change reality with his dreams, keeping them at bay with a harsh drug addiction that winds him in the care of the character who is our second perspective: Dr. Haber. The doctor, representative of the taoist yang, has a belief in Utilitarian ideals leads him to exploit Orr in order to reshape the world as he sees fit. He has the best of intentions at first, but chaos and a thirst for power befall even the noblest of pursuits. Finally we have Heather Lelache, a Black civil rights lawyer and ACLU observer who attempts to aid Orr against Haber’s quest for control and with whom Orr falls in love. The three of them guide us through the changing realities as Haber directs Orr to imagine a more perfect world, though the results are often not what they expect.‘The end justifies the means. But what if there never is an end? All we have is means.’With each new reality—only Orr and Haber can remember what came before and the world is whiplashed into new realities with each dream—Le Guin is able to create a lot of good fun examining how these changes might go awry or how they alter society. Haber, a utilitarian, finds his quest for perfection often misses the nuances in their implications and one must ask if the maximum amount of happiness is actual extreme unhappiness for others. Such as his fears of the world being overpopulated leads Orr to dream of a plague that causes mass death and chaos, or his desire to world peace creates an alien race threatening the Earth which unites all the nations against a common enemy but has us on the brink of galactic war. One of the most effective digs into the nuances of society comes when Orr dreams everyone into having gray skin under Haber’s orders in an attempt to eliminate racism. This makes for an excellent rebuttal against the ideas of ‘not seeing color’ or color-blindness in society as showing that cultural differences are a lively part of life and without them the world is rather bland (hence the grayness). As Heather is of mixed parentage, she is eliminated entirely from this reality, with Le Guin telling this segment from Orr’s perspective in a way that makes her absence emphasized. When Orr brings her into the world again through his dreams, the absence of her background that formed key elements of her personality leaves her docile and practically not Heather at all, the one who would ‘come on hard’ and intimidate with ‘fierce, scornful’ remarks (though it should be noted this is playing into a pejorative stereotype of the ‘angry Black woman’ that is rather harmful). ‘We're in the world, not against it. It doesn't work to try to stand outside things and run them, that way. It just doesn't work, it goes against life. There is a way but you have to follow it. The world is, no matter how we think it ought to be. You have to be with it. You have to let it be.’Returning to the concepts of Taoism, we have Orr representing a more passive stance while Haber is the more controlling one who’s attempts to play God have him destined to be ‘destroyed on the lathe of heaven’ (interestingly enough, Le Guin later admitted the title is based on a mistranslation). George Orr—named as both a nod to George Orwell and play on Kierkegaard’s Either/Or, with Heather referring to him as ‘Mister Either Orr’—appears rather passive, though this stems from his belief that ‘it’s wrong to force the pattern of things.’ Often compared to jellyfish, Orr can be best understood through the way Le Guin describes the sea creatures:‘Hanging, swaying, pulsing, the most vulnerable and insubstantial creature, it has for its defense the violence and power of the whole ocean, to which it has entrusted its being, its going, and its will.’Like the jellyfish using the strength of the ocean where it lacks personal defensiveness, George employs the world around him and his friends to help him out. While we first see him as soft, as the representation of yin, we discover that is only half the perception and Heather sees him as the ‘strongest person she had ever known, because he could not be moved away from the center.’ I mean, he reshapes reality, he just doesn’t want to. Haber’s depiction of him helps us see Orr more clearly as well: ‘you’re a median…Both, neither. Either, or. Where there’s an opposed pair, a polarity, you’re in the middle; where there’s a scale, you’re the balance point.’George Orr represents the tao as a whole, being both yin and yang, being the duality that is needed. To be just one is to be unbalanced, as we see with Dr. Haber.Le Guin often uses taoist philosophy in her works, and her essay on writing europias, a highly recommended read you can access here, uses the language of yin and yang to elucidate her ideas. Even The Dispossessed uses a blend of taoism and anarchism as a central part of the novel's social and philosophical construction. There are other expressions in here as well, most notably Mt. Hood being symbolic of wu wei, or ‘effortless action’, being a constant presence that also serves as an indication of the current state of reality in the novel. Water also serves as a symbol of this as well, being a natural order of things and the absence of it shows the disruption of the natural balance of life.‘Those who dream of feasting wake to lamentation.’Chuang TzuWhile George is compared to a jellyfish, Haber is frequently compared to a bear: a force of brute strength in nature. ‘He was gray, large, broad, curly bearded, deep-chested, frowning,’ we are told of his bearlike appearance, followed with ‘Your God is a jealous God,’ evoking the Christian depiction of God with Christianity often played as the foil to taoism in the novel. He seeks to rule the world and all reality as he sees fit, saying ‘this world will be like heaven, and men will be like gods!’ However, Orr replies ‘we are already,’ a further expression that the natural order of things is the best way. There are many consequences shown for playing God here, most notably the mass deaths and destructions that come as consequence of the changes, but also compiling reality on top of realities begins to create a sickening sense of unreality. Le Guin references a T.S. Eliot poem, Burnt Norton from the Four Quartets, in which a bird argues ‘mankind cannot bear very much reality.’ However, here we see it is unreality that the mind cannot bear and it has terrible consequences.This has all been a rudimentary look at the philosophical undertones of the book, and I wouldn’t want to make it appear rather stuffy or heady as the book is, in fact, a really fun and engaging story with a fast-moving plot. With each change it is exciting to see how the world responds and Le Guin moves through a lot of rather cliched sci fi scenarios that manage to still feel fresh in the framing of the novel as a whole. There’s a lot of action too, such as an alien invasion scene. The alien species, which is rather turtle-like, is quite fun once they are no longer a threat to humans. I love the moment where we learn of their social anxieties, having to point at the face of their interlocutor in order for their translation equipment to work while also knowing pointing is considered rude so they just don’t talk much. I FELT THAT. ‘You don't speak of dreams as unreal. They exist. They leave a mark behind them.’Le Guin was an absolute master and Lathe of Heaven is yet another example of how she would courageously and creatively make literary gems within a science fiction framework. This book is packed with philosophical insight and a driving plot that will keep you turning pages to see what bizarre twist will befall them next. A fun story with a lot of heart, and something to keep in mind if you ever decide to play God.4.5/5‘A person who believes, as she did, that things fit: that there is a whole of which one is a part, and that in being a part one is whole: such a person has no desire whatever, at any time, to play God. Only those who have denied their being yearn to play at it.’...more",Notes are private!,0,212,1,not set,not set,"Jan 21, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2930299-the-lathe-of-heaven

It follows Taylor, the good looking basketball star in a rural school that seems like the all-american boy. Except Taylor is from outer space. And Taylor is actually a princess. Created through a team with a trans author and nonbinary artist, Jadzia Axelrod and Jess Taylor respectively, it is so wonderful to see DC giving space to a story and creators like this. While it takes place in the DC universe, readers won’t need any familiarity with it to enjoy. I mean, I know next to nothing and had a blast with this. The colorful art and the emotionally charged narrative make this a really wonderful read that explore issues around being trans and the hardships society dumps on them but also includes an inclusive cast to address issues of race and disability that all culminates for a rather amazing little graphic novel.  [image]This book is worth reading for the art alone. I mean look at how pretty it is. It is super stylized with bright colors like a cosmic neon palette and everything just looks so cool. The character designs are great, the pacing is crisp and allows space for emotional scenes to breathe and the characters are well done. Also there is a sidekick talking corgi, so how could you not love that?  [image]I LOVE this corgiThe story involves characters that fled their homeworld when it was destroyed by a vague enemy called The Vale and have been hiding on Earth disguised as humans. The general, who plays the role of the father/basketball coach, has hid the space princess as Taylor, a young boy, but Taylor begins developing feelings for the hip girl from the city, Kat, who has also moved to this small town with her mother to hide out from her abusive father. The princess finds she can switch back and forth between Taylor the boy and her true self, which makes her feel free but also brings the threats from society for not being “normal”.   [image]The trans narrative is all right there embedded in the story of aliens disguised as humans and its all pretty emotional and effective. We watch very difficult and tragic interactions, such as a best friend rejecting her and a school assuming her presence as an alien girl after living as a boy will be too disruptive and damaging to other students.There are issues of fears around her for being different, her feeling invisible to others, and general abuse she gets once she is who she really it. It’s all fairly on-the-nose, but in an effective way that works for both the messaging and the story itself. I did enjoy the way the Vale (no idea if they are in the DC universe already or not) are sort of just a vague concept here of hatred that comes after anything different from them.  [image]As mentioned earlier, this exists in the DC universe but one need not have any familiarity to enjoy Galaxy. Superman comes up a few times, and I found it clever the way he is used in a way that addresses issues of the model minority myth. I enjoy how at first the presence of Superman in the news is threatening to the family as human’s knowledge of one alien on the planet might lead people to be wary of other aliens hiding out. Though later we see how Superman is accepted because he is overtly doing good deeds and saving the planet and the principal tells her ‘Taylor isn’t a superhero,’ as if Superman’s…well superness is some sort of metric any other intergalactic person on the planet must meet or be rejected. Being in the DC universe, there is also implications that she will eventually gain superpowers, though she has not reached this yet so I’m guessing this character will appear in other stories later on and that’s cool.  [image]So, superhero fan or not, Galaxy: The Prettiest Star is a fun story with a lot of heart. I love the artwork in this so much and I quite enjoyed seeing a large entity like DC addressing trans identities so openly and productively. I could have used a little more, this is fairly quick, but it also works that they didn't shoehorn in galactic conflict abruptly at the end and focused more on the story of Taylor becoming who they are. There will be time later to fight the Vale. This is certainly worth a read and I hope there will be more.⅘  [image]...more",Notes are private!,0,82,1,"Jan 19, 2023","Jan 19, 2023","Jan 19, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/59235529-galaxy

The final panel sets up an exciting new plot possibility that I am excited to see inevitably go south in a cool way because this is Saga and what other direction would it head? It's gonna rule. This issue also revisits some characters we haven't seen in a long time—like Sophie who is now pushing teenage years into young adulthood—and set up another plotline parallel to the motivations of characters in the last volume. There are a lot of pieces in play in this series and the way this issue revisits ones we haven't seen since the break feels a lot more like the original few issues than the last volume did.

Where you stand motionless, feeling time and importance press around you, press into yo‘Have you ever been in a place where history becomes tangible? Where you stand motionless, feeling time and importance press around you, press into you?’Space, the final frontier. Since humans have first looked up in wonder at the cosmos we have always dreamed of knowing what awaits us there. As a kid I was a massive space nerd, I mean I was the kid with the planets on their bedroom ceiling surrounded by glow-in-the-dark stars and read countless books about space that often went way over my head and loved all the novels and films about space exploration (still a huge Star Wars fan). In 5th grade we had to turn in an original short story each semester and I opted to heavily research how a Mars mission would work and used each assignment as another chapter of my little kid hard-sci-fi story about me and my friends going to Mars. So needless to say, Becky Chamber’s Hugo nominated To Be Taught, If Fortunate, a novella that centers on the earnest scientific awe and discovery of scientists exploring exoplanets, is very much my jam. While technically a prequel (by thousands of years) to Chamber’s much-lauded Wayfarers series which has been dubbed ‘cozy sci fi’, this novella can also be enjoyed as a stand-alone. And what an enjoyable ride it is. Eschewing the standard space adventuring heroics of most sci-fi, Chamber’s story puts all the action in the joy of discovery and scientists doing scientist things while trying to not upset the ecosystems of the marvelous destinations on their trip. Chamber’s balances philosophical inquiry with an awe-inspiring story in a comfortably quiet book of the how and why for space exploration because ‘we’re scientists. We live and breathe why.’ While a slim novella, To Be Taught, If Fortunate has a vast cosmos of thought swirling through it, examining the purpose of exploration and how to remain pure in both intentions and execution, and delivering the reader the jaw-dropping magic of boldly going where no one has gone before.‘We believe the potential answers are worth the challenges.’Chambers effortlessly taps into the wonderment of space travel in a way that makes this just as gripping a story as the epic space operas despite mostly being scientists gathering observations and basking in the bliss of chronicling cutting-edge cosmic discoveries. I mean, this makes scientists quietly examining samples and running diagnostics into a thrill-ride. Like, when you are a kid and first learn about cool science stuff—Chambers has written a book for adults that launch us straight into the galaxies of childhood astonishment. Framed as a final transmission to Earth from the narrator with a question she’d like us all to ponder, the story follows this team of four across four exoplanets as they ponder the great existential questions of existing in such a vast universe full of life beyond our own. Not that this is bland, and while admittedly it seemed slow at first, this became impossible to put down and has plenty of friction and tension created without needing character’s with trauma or difficult personalities or even a high-stakes plot with threatening elements or villains. It’s just a celebration of the human quest for knowledge and it signs out in proud harmonies that echo from star to star.‘if you understand that space exploration is best when it’s done in the name of the people, then the people are the ones who have to make it happen.’I really enjoyed the discourse on how space exploration should be ethically conducted, which is a theme that pulses through the entire book. If we are to explore, we must ask ourselves why, must look at our methods and goals to ask who will it serve, and wonder what will be done with what we learn. Are we doing this for the sake of exploration and knowledge or is it tainted by ulterior motives that spoil the statement that “we came in peace for all mankind” as the US astronauts said on the moon missions we forever wonder how much flexing technological might at Russia was the motive behind such robust government funding. This is all asked lightyears away, wondering what people still think back on Earth.‘What we want you to ask yourselves is this: what is space, to you? Is it a playground? A quarry? A flagpole? A classroom? A temple? Who do you believe should go, and for what purpose? Or should we go at all? Is the realm above the clouds immaterial to you, so long as satellites send messages and rocks don’t fall? Is human spaceflight a fool’s errand, a rich man’s fantasy, an unacceptable waste of life and metal? Are our methods grotesque to you, our ethics untenable? Are our hopes outdated? When I tell you of our life out here, do you cheer for us, or do you scoff?’ Chambers never shirks the issues of capitalism and demonstrates how a profit motive will always poison the pot. The narrative examines previous attempts at launching into the cosmos and how ‘they found that dream inextricably, cripplingly anchored to the very founts of nationalistic myopia and materialistic greed that said dream was antithetical to.’ Funding by government leads to nationalism, funding by corporations leads to slapdash plans where cost cutting is valued over all else and built by the lowest bidder who’s shady business practices haven’t been a news scandal yet. So an international coalition of people who want to do science for the sake of science funds this expedition, but with over forty years of space travel separating the astronauts from the planet, what will change in priorities, funding, government and more when they need Earth to retrieve them home?‘When the world you know is out of reach, nothing is more welcome than a measurable reminder that it still exists.’Perhaps some of the most endearing moments of the book are the ways the astronauts engage with memories of a planet light years behind them. There are discussions on what they miss and often find it is the feelings and experiences around things more than the actual things themselves, such as when one astronaut states ‘I don’t miss drinking [coffee]. I miss it being around.’ In space they are forming a sort of found-family to stave off the loneliness being separated from the ones they left behind. But they also left behind a world that is constantly in flux and must acknowledge ‘how much a world can change within the bookends of a lifetime.’ I enjoyed the way they begin to reject the daily news updates which was ‘an odd mix of unpredictable changes that follow tragically predictable patterns. War, elections, lines drawn in the sand. The perpetual ebb and flow of some countries reaching out while others walled themselves in. A constant parade of societal drama, powerful within its own sphere, yet impotent when pitted against the colossal rhythms of the planet itself.’It is interesting to see how they decide to reject the daily play-by-play of politics (it doesn’t help that its a 40 year trip home so none of that will be relevant when they return anyways) but it is also a message to us, the reader, that the sports-castification of politics is about drawing us in for clicks and views for the sake of power, profits, and visibility. The story takes a twist when the transmissions cease (leading to the human diaspora which will lead to the Wayfarers series) and the book takes an interesting vantage point on the collapse of society from a planet not even visible across the void of space.‘Because sometimes we go, and we try, and we suffer, and despite it all, we learn nothing. Sometimes we are left with more questions than when we started. Sometimes we do harm, despite our best efforts. We are human. We are fragile’In this novella that probes what it means to be human against the infinite backdrop of space, Chambers grounds the story through a lot of explanation of the science behind the inner workings of the voyage. It never bogs down the story with unnecessary description and, honestly, I never care much how something works, mostly instead what it means philosophically and emotionally in context which is another element Chambers elegantly balances. I enjoy the idea that the freezing process for travel can only delay time and the scene about them having aged two years during the travel is delivered through their emotional responses and the narrator’s interior reactions to their own reflection. It really works and latches the readers emotions to the ideas. This is another way the story centers the idea of science but in a way that focuses primarily on the ethical implications. There is an extreme care to not upset the planet’s ecosystem or interfere. This is balanced with the fact that ‘at some point, you have to accept the fact that any movement creates waves, and the only other option is to lie still and learn nothing,’ so they take great care to ethically approach this boundary. I really love this element of the book, the idea that communities thrive together and that science should be done for the sake of knowledge without any ulterior motive. No profit, no search for something that can be a weapon, no colonization, only knowledge for the benefit of all. The question is, will anyone else care about knowledge only for the sake of knowledge and this is how Chambers makes us look at our own lives, our own times and ask if our efforts are gifting or grifting.‘We have found nothing you can sell. We have found nothing you can put to practical use. We have found no worlds that could be easily or ethically settled, were that end desired. We have satisfied nothing but curiosity, gained nothing but knowledge.To me, these are the noblest goals.’This is a short but sweet novella that hits so many high notes and is just a warm, comforting place to be. I love the efforts towards championing science over conquest and examining why this is as well as looking at the existential questions an explorer headed towards the unknown reaches of space might ponder. Chambers has a knack for folding into philosophical inquiry while keeping the pace moving forward. This is an inspiring story, one to uplift the curious minds and question our place in the greater cosmos, and one I definitely recommend to you.See you, Space Cowboy.4.5/5‘Where we go from there is up to you.’...more",Notes are private!,0,143,1,"Jan 17, 2023","Jan 18, 2023","Jan 17, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43190272-to-be-taught-if-fortunate

[image]Indira and FawnThis was an interesting one to read while conversations over AI art is currently a hot issue and ethical debate as Fawn is quite literally an AI creating art and even has eyes programmed to work as a top quality digital camera. The friction between humans and the worries of AI people, and vice versa, play into early elements of the two women’s frustration with each other but it is charming to see how the more they learn about one another the closer they become and begin to care deeply. I liked how Pixels of You didn’t get bogged down revisiting tired narratives about AI being human or not (or human enough) and instead focused on Fawn’s emotional states and how she interacts with a world likely questioning those issues.  [image]This is a book I think I want to like more than I actually did. It is full of great ideas that come across as a bit slight, with the story heading forward too quickly and at a rather jumpy pace. The world wasn’t fleshed out enough and while there are a few all-black pages with a brief detailing of problems going on in this world around AI—issues of racial or sexist bias or blunders such as AI algorithms interpreting Bollywood lyrics as profanity—it feels a bit tacked on and not folded into the narrative to be addresses. Still, I’m glad these are topics that are being brought up in YA books and I hope it inspires people to read more on them. A major one is the issue of gender bias in AI, which explores how the flaws and biases of humans who create AI will inevitably be found in the AI systems as well. This has been well documented as a current issue already causing discrimination issues in the workplace and internet algorithms.

Set two years after the events occurring in Alice Oseman’s Heartstopper graphic novel series, this novella finds the charming couple headed towards a massive hurdle in their relationship: Nick leaving for college. It is a very emotional arc full of anxieties for the future and self-doubt that will likely be relatable or resonate with many readers and it is fun to see these characters navigating teenage drama during a period of time when the circle of high school life cracks open and everyone heads down new paths towards adulthood. Miscommunication is central to this story, and I enjoy how Oseman allows it to be sad and frustrating as it feels real that the characters would make bad assumptions due to the anxiety of their interior lives and stumble into miscommunicated mishaps. Nick and Charlie is as cute as you would hope it would be and Oseman continues to have her finger on the pulse of fun, queer, teenage stories.While this just came out in the US, Nick and Charlie was originally published in 2015 in the UK. The story came out after Solitaire in which Nick and Charlie play supporting cast in a story about Tori (Tori continues to be great here, probably my favorite character honestly) and was written before Heartstopper. Due to this, some of it feels a bit off, like in the way after watching several seasons of a tv series if you return to watch the first season the characters don’t feel as nuanced or dynamic quite yet. It’s also two years later so it makes sense they come across a bit differently. But also we are so used to these characters in graphic novel format where here we are much more inside their heads—Oseman rotates between both character’s perspectives every new chapter—so it is a fun way to revisit familiar friends in a new way. That said, its best to approach this without trying to overly compare it to the Heartstopper series. The illustrations throughout the story are also a nice touch.This is a really cute slice of life in the story of a couple that ‘if you had to provide evidence for soul mates, everyone would pick you two.’ I really enjoy how much miscommunication and assumptions derail their stories, or anxieties growing worse seeing other friends break-up as this feels pretty true to life. I remember being this age and people having theories on if it is better to just go into college with a clean slate or seeing couples break up almost immediately under the weight of distance dating, so this story felt like a good catalyst to test the relationship of a couple. While the story may be overly simplified and perhaps too happy of an ending, that’s also what you expect with these characters so I enjoyed that. Sometimes you just need a good happy ending to wash away the built up sads and feel good. Nick and Charlie delivers in a quick novella that makes for a nice afternoon read.⅘...more",Notes are private!,0,128,1,"Jan 14, 2023","Jan 14, 2023","Jan 14, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61285758-nick-and-charlie

Still, several people sustained injuries.’While society loves to extol the virtues of being independent and breaking from the mold, those who deviate from the norm are often the first to be scapegoated and targeted when society needs someone to vilify. María José Ferrada’s How to Turn Into a Bird is an enchanting yet haunting read that chronicles the perils of breaking social code. The enrapturing storytelling comes through the eyes of 12 year old Miguel, he witnesses the drama of both his family and the locals unfold when his uncle Ramón decides to live inside a billboard outside their tenement housing in order to escape ‘the noise of the world.’ While first the locals treat him with encouraging bemusement, the arrival of a homeless encampment begins to turn public opinion until a tragic event becomes the catalyst for violence. A Sparse, yet gorgeously layered and intricate, How to Turn Into a Bird is both a coming-of-age novella around the loss of innocence and becomes expansive through the implications in the blank spaces of the narrative as Ferrada interrogates the complexities of human connection and how the policing of social norms tries to justify violence in the name of security.The charm of this novella holds up to Chilean author María José Ferrada’s masterful previous work, How to Order the Universe, which was a favorite book of 2021 for me. Ferrada has a skill for concise yet gorgeously poetic language (both novellas are lovingly translated by Elizabeth Bryer) that uses the perspective of a child to a narrative advantage by leaving much left unsaid or not understood and allowing the reader to color in their own interpretations and conclusions. The mystery of the adults in the narrator’s lives plays into a larger mystery of society that appears almost as absurd through their tenuous grasp on events. There is a sad and somber undercurrent to the whole story, yet through Miguel’s eyes it simultaneously feels bathed in the warmth of childhood bliss which, told in a rather rhythmic beauty, lulls the reader into a false sense of security. Not unlike the way adults calm children in times of struggle. These techniques also allow Ferrada to fill so much into a tiny space, both narratively and descriptively. Her quick but witty characterizations are delightful, such as the narrator Miguel being described as ‘I wasn’t a model student, but I was a good model of a typical student,’ or his Aunt Paulina, who spends her days organizing shelves and trying to be understanding of her absentee husband being characterized as ‘a current that flowed over and around the hard facts and objects she bumped into in the supermarket aisle and on her life path, which for her were one and the same.’ Ferrada cuts directly to the core while leaving much open to interpretation, a style that deeply resonates with me.‘[B]y climbing up to the billboard house, he had transformed into an intermediary figure somewhere between a friend, a bird, and a teacher.’While Ramón spends the novel attempting to be undisturbed in his ‘search for silence,’ he also is the center of gravity around which all aspects of the story revolves. He is ‘odd, but not a bad person,’ and uprooting his life to live above the city in a billboard becomes a major point of friction for his marriage and the rumor-mill for ‘the people down below’. Ferrada paints a dichotomy between the world of the ground and of the sky, frequently comparing Ramón to a bird who wishes to fly away from society. Even his billboard home is said to have ‘looked like it had been made by a bird that wasn’t all that interested in building a lasting monument to its species.’ It also functions as a way to show how sometimes we must step outside society to see it as it truly is, to see the  'relationships between what happens above and what happens below. you had to position yourself in an intermediary space—not too attached to the earth, not too close to the sky—in order to see them.'As the novel progresses, his appearance in the sky drains of its charm for the locals and we begin to see how deviation from social norms is met with resistance and wilful misinterpretation because ‘as happens with all interpretations, those doing the interpreting invented whatever they felt like.’ These interpretations are rarely to the outsider’s benefit.‘Ramón and the homeless were starting to share the same galaxy known as “the problem”.’There is a sharp criticism in How to Turn Into a Bird on the ways we ‘other’ people in order to push them aside and dehumanize them. Midway through the story, the campfires of a homeless settlement are seen beyond Ramón’s billboard. The language is brilliant: ‘they twinkled as if they were all that remained of a tired star that had plummeted to Earth.’ Here we have a segment of society at its most exhausted and cornered, yet also some of societies most demonized and wilfully misunderstood. Working in a public library has given me frequent interaction with both the unhoused community and the local resource groups that work with them (we have a wonderful partnership with local social workers who use the library as a space to connect and provide resources) and a major lesson is how it can, truly, happen to anyone. And through a quick spiral of events often beyond the person’s control, leaving them very disadvantaged to be able to simply “pick themselves back up.” It is an issue that the United States is egregiously struggling with such as often providing more funding in policing than helpful resources and often shelters have strict religious requirements (as the one in my city does) or anti-LGBTQ policies that push people away or create additional barriers for those most marginalized. But this story takes place in Chile and I am undereducated in their unhoused policies so I’ll stop my rant, my apologies. Anyways, having a group of people society “others,” such as the unhoused settlement and the billboard dweller makes for convenient scapegoats: ‘What the neighbors had right there…the perfect excuse to get rid of Ramón,, the homeless, and everything they considered “the problem,” once and for all. In other words, to get rid of anything and everything that didn’t function according to the laws of the group which they—as judge and jury—had taken it upon themselves to dictate.’There is an especially unsettling element here as the housing projects the characters live in were set up as a way to help them when they themselves had been homeless. Ferrada interrogates the way people will punch down and pass cruelty on others simply for believing those people to be “beneath them,” often, as we see, a way to push away the anxiety that even a small change of circumstances could have placed them on the other side of it all. Violence eventually erupts, examining mob mentality and the sick irony of attempting to justify violence in the name of peace. ‘To become a crowd is to keep out death,’ author Don DeLillo writes in his White Noise, ‘to break off from the crowd is to risk death as an individual, to face dying alone. Crowds came for this reason above all others. They were there to be a crowd.’ Ferrada explores this mentality expertly, watching not only how the tenants gatekeep their “crowd”—such as ejecting two of the unhoused children from their “children’s day” party for not being “one of us”—but also push back with violence at the fear of death or anything threatening once death reaches their community. This violence is said to be ‘so that you never forget:What you shouldn’t have done.What you shouldn’t have thought.What you shouldn’t have wanted.’The irony here is that those under the gaze of the crowd violence only wanted freedom. ‘Was that all sorrow lasted? The world was a little puff of popcorn, a tiny speck of lint.’The musician Frank Zappa, known for stepping outside the norms and experimenting, once said ‘without deviation from the norm, progress is not possible.’ Business lectures often tell you to stand out, be different. Yet being “different,” or breaking social norms, is often the quickest way to have a target painted on your back and for the gears of social policing to start churning. Sometimes violently. María José Ferrada examines this with a piercing beauty in How to Turn Into a Bird, carrying the reader through a heavy fall from innocence that will rock this small Chilean community forever and with deadly consequences. It is a story told with such exquisite beauty, in such short passages with as much empty space on the page as the gaps in the narrator’s knowledge of the events unfolding in front of him. A quick read, but one that will haunt you.4/5...more",Notes are private!,2,154,1,"Jan 13, 2023","Jan 13, 2023","Jan 13, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60583991-how-to-turn-into-a-bird

Things are different on either side of them.’If the whimsy for a magical adventure oozing with charm and full of unforgettable characters ever strikes you, might I direct your attention to the Diana Wynne Jones’ endlessly entertaining Howl’s Moving Castle. It is a story where assumptions are tested and often overturned and the characters are full of as much nuance as they are personality, making for an engaging read that will keep you on your toes. Sure, there is the Miyazaki film adaptation, but the two are different enough to each stand on their own and this novel is such an fun-filled event I stayed up far too late to finish the book but do not regret yawning my way through the following workday. Howl’s Moving Castle is a quirkily endearing coming-of-age story in a fanciful realm of magic and mystery that explores ideas of freedom, family and that appearances can be deceiving.  [image]The film adaptation of Howl’s Moving Castle by Studio GhibliWhat really sticks this story straight into the readers heart are the characters that populate the magical realm of Ingary. Jones creates a world that is adjacent to our own, with characters such as Howl’s sister Megan still residing there (her frustration with her brother often hinging on not knowing he is in fact a magic user in Ingary instead of pursuing a job). The story follows Sophie, the oldest of three sisters and ‘it is quite a misfortune to be born the eldest of the three. Everyone knows you are the one who will fail first, and worst.’ A run-in with the Witch of the Waste leaves her cursed to have the body of a frail, elderly woman, but Sophie is a fiery and determined woman who seeks an end of her curse and forces herself into the employment of Howl, a wizard with a dangerous reputation who roams the countryside in…you guessed it, a giant moving castle.'My shining dishonesty will be the salvation of me.'Howl is an absolute delight as a character, and also rather insufferable (which is half the fun). Appearing at first to be a villain, the more we learn about Howl the more endearing and completely aggravating he is. To the reader and especially Sophie. Prone to tantrums (he trashes the castle over a bad hair dyeing), being overdramatic (‘I'm going to bed, where I may die,’ he says of a minor cold), and reckless womanizing that leaves behind a string of broken hearts, Howl is ‘fickle, careless, selfish, and hysterical,’ says Sophie. He is a ‘slitherer-outer,’ with his cowardly side keeping him from action, yet there is another side of him that makes him shockingly likable. Jones jokes in interviews that when girls say they are in love with Howl she says to not do that as he is awful, joking that in response to them saying they would like to marry Howl she says 'Howl would be one of the most dreadful husbands one could possibly imagine.' But his duality gives him charm and a weight as a character that is rather infectious, and, yo, this dude is supposed to be HOT so I get it.’Half the time I think he doesn’t care what happens to anyone as long as he’s all right— but then I find out how awfully kind he’s been to someone. Then I think he’s kind just when it suits him—only then I find out he undercharges poor people.’Howl is a perfect representation of how appearances can often be deceiving in this novel, and Jones writes really excellent gray characters that were fairly nontypical for the children’s fantasy novel genre in 1986 when it was released, which is part (along with the great humor for sure) of what makes this just as engaging for an adult to read. Sophie looks old and frail, but is determined, the fire demon Calcifer looks ‘extraordinarily evil’ but he is an anxious and charming, even the castle seems like a massive evil building but is actually just Howl’s home bewitched to be able to move about without ever actually leaving. This latter example plays into another theme where the character’s homes tend to represent them, Howl’s being a wandering sort that is actually all just smoke and mirrors or the Witch living in the middle of nowhere as a representation for her isolation from everyone.‘A heart's a heavy burden.’Every character seems simple but are always hiding a tangled web of motivations beneath the surface. Howl and the Witch also tend to take advantage of their appearances in order to get what they want. This contrasts well with Sophie, who is prone to brash action without thinking. The catch in the book, however, is that one’s identity often becomes a sort of imprisonment to them. Destructive patterns get them into trouble, Howl’s good looks play havoc on his relationships and Sophie’s lack of self-esteem is a major obstacle for her to overcome throughout the course of the book. This also plays into overcoming expectations, such as the curse placed on Howl using a John Donne poem about impossible tasks. The ultimate task, to find a 'woman true and fair,' does smack of some misogyny that Jones delights in overturning, but overturning and subversion is the name of the game here. This is a world where nothing is impossible, and if we let ourselves be stopped simply by expectations, what are we missing in life? In what ways are we self-sabatoging?It is impossible to not think of the Miyazaki version of this book when, to be fair, it is what lead me to reading Jones’ original. Being loosely based on the book and taking it in different directions, I feel the two are easily enjoyed separate from each other and I never feel compelled to “prefer” one or the other. I do enjoy how the movie takes a much greater anti-war stance, something that Miyazaki often features in his film and is vocally anti-war in his personal life. He did not attend the Academy Awards when his film Spirited Away won an Oscar for Best Animated Feature and told the LA Times ‘The reason I wasn’t here for the Academy Award was because I didn’t want to visit a country that was bombing Iraq.’ Diana Wynne Jones enjoyed the film, saying ‘I was thrown back in my seat with amazement’ (there is a good interview of her talking about the film you can watch here), and had made special requests of Miyazaki to not change anything of Howl’s personality. Howl’s love of all animals and refusal to kill is emphasized well as a theme of pacifism in the film.Howl’s Moving Castle is destined to become a classic, and is effortlessly charming and nearly impossible to put down. It is a wonderful statement about moving away from our defensiveness and out of the prisons of the self we either self-impose or have assumed of us based on appearances. This is a story where the only thing to expect is the unexpected and it makes for a fun and often very funny ride. Definitely would recommend.4.5/5‘I think we ought to live happily ever after.’...more",Notes are private!,8,287,1,"Jan 11, 2023","Jan 11, 2023","Jan 11, 2023",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6294.Howl_s_Moving_Castle

Born in Belgrade in 1938, Simic I was saddened to learn today of the passing of an absolute favorite poet, the great Charles Simic, at the age of 84. Born in Belgrade in 1938, Simic arrived in the US in 1954 after having witnessed the horrors of WWII and would launch an impressive poetry career that would earn him a MacArthur Genius Grant, a Pulitzer Prize and a seat as the 15th US Poet Laureate in 2007. Charles Simic has always held an extremely important place in my heart, being the first poet to really enrapture me to the point that I simply had to try to write my own poetry, so enamored with the dexterity and abstract agency he granted to language through his own poetry. Not only was his poetry so irresistible to me, but his whole persona as a poet who taught and talked about poetry bolstered my love, particularly when he discussed his methods for poetry as being like a game of chess with words, or a line I quote often that a good poem is like a bank robbery: you get in, get attention, get the goods and get out fast. True to his teachings, Simic has always excelled in packing so much in a succinct package of poetry, being works you can read quickly but then spend the rest of the day unpacking in your mind; meaning hides in all the nooks and crannies of word choices and if you shake his poems and entire civilization of thought comes spilling out he pockets. Towards the end of his life—he passed from complications due to dementia—his poems began to move inward, growing shorter and shorter as if he had found the secret shortcut to fold a world of ideas into a few sparse lines. He is a perfect balance of thought-provoking depth and accessibility, and one of the first I always recommend for people looking for a start in poetry. Now, if you’ll bear with me, I’d like to dive through a lifetime of poems and a cosmos of beauty in tribute to an absolute favorite poet. ‘The secret ambition of all lyric poetry is to stop time,’ Simic wrote. While time could not be stopped and Simic has passed on, he has left a legacy of brilliance (he published over 30 books) and his words will live on through all those who read them.  [image]I left a significant amount of Simic quotes around on trees in my community as part of my public poetry project.‘Inside my empty bottleI was constructing a lighthouseWhile all the othersWere making ships.’Charles Simic once wrote that ‘a poem is a secret shared by people who have never met each other.’ I think of this often and the way a poem can be a lightning strike of emotion and meaning straight into the heart of the reader who looks back to the page to feel the poet nodding to them. ‘Everyone wants to explain the poem,’ say Simic, ‘except the poet,’ and I believe the perfect poem is designed to say something in a way that can’t fully be said otherwise—an essay on the meaning of a poem still can’t quite grasp the way the succinctness of a poem packs a world of ideas into a linguistic stab at the ineffable. To attempt to net reality in the faulty net of language. For me, Simic was the first to explain and demonstrate this and I will always be grateful for that. ‘Poetry is an orphan of silence,’ he wrote, ‘the words never quite equal the experience beneath them.’ I think it is the way his poetry leans into the surreal that enhances this effect, and the way a simple statement is often just the translucent lid on a container of ideas you can glean bustling about underneath. Simic leans into the abstract with imagery that traverses through the grit of world war and family history, illustrating scenes as if in sepia tones or photographs curling at the edges, and often bears the black and white vibes of noir aesthetics. These are poems that would feel at home read in back alleyways clouded with fog and cigarette smoke, or half drunk into a fading glass of bourbon. One of the first to ever jump out at me came from the collection Walking the Black Cat:CLUB MIDNIGHTtAre you the owner of a seedy night club? Are you its sole customer, sole bartender,Sole waiter prowling around the empty tables? Do you put on wee-hour girlie showsWith dead stars of black and white films? Is your office upstairs over the neon lights,Or down deep in the dank rat cellar? Are bearded Russian thinkers your silent partners?Do you have a doorman by the name of Dostoyevsky? Is Fu Manchu coming tonight?Is Miss Emily Dickinson? Do you happen to have an immortal soul?Do you have a sneaky suspicion that you have none? Is that why you throw a white pair of dice,In the dark, long after the joint closes?Something about this shook me. The noir aspects, the seediness, the philosophical undertones of eternity and our finite space in it grasping at the history of literature for it’s immortality as we plunge forward in time. I was working at a Barnes and Noble in Holland after having uprooted my entire life and living in this new space where I knew nobody, and bonding over Simic poetry was one of the ways I met my friend Pete who became a very dear friend. So I have Simic to thank for that as well. Ah hell, this is supposed to be a  but to be frank, I’m drunk on gin because I just learned a hero of mine is gone and I’m gonna spew some random thoughts at all of you. Here is another poem I love and love to post every Labor Day on social media (from That Little Something but they are all found here in this Selected Poems):LABOR AND CAPITALThe softness of this motel bedOn which we made loveDemonstrates to me in an impressivemannerThe superiority of capitalism.At the mattress factory, l imagine,The employees are happy today.It's Sunday and they are workingExtra hours, like us, for no pay.Still, the way you open your legsAnd reach for me with your handMakes me think of the Revolution,Red banners, crowd charging.Someone stepping on a soapboxAs the flames engulf the palace,And the old prince in full viewSteps to his death from a balcony.Simic had a decorated career, winning the Pulitzer Prize for The World Doesn't End (a brilliant collection of prose poetry) and being the 15th US Poet Laureate. I’ve always been charmed by Simic having served in this role during the George W Bush administration and with the weight of this role having released Master of Disguises full of anti war poetry. I don’t know how apocryphal this is but supposedly he was supposed to do a reading in the White House Rose Garden but someone got wind of him planning on reading only anti-war poems and it was canceled. I choose to believe this and love this. Speaking of anti-war poems, I’ve always loved this one from Selected Early Poems where he even discards the heroes for the sake of peace, Simic who grew up in occupied Serbia during WWII which appears in many of his poems:MY WEARINESS OF EPIC PROPORTIONSI like it whenAchillesGets killedAnd even his buddy Patroclus-And that hothead HectorAnd the whole Greek and TrojanJeunesse doréeAre more or lessExpertly slaughteredSo there's finallyPeace and quiet(The gods having momentarilyShut up)One can hearA bird singAnd a daughter ask her motherWhether she can go to the wellAnd of course she canBy that lovely little pathThat winds throughThe olive orchard.The thing you need to know about Simic is that in his hands language could be anything. He can truly embody a moment with all the emotional context and make a poem that feels full from a single image. With Simic, life is always a cosmic joke, death is overworked while his lover awaits him at the end of the day, watermelons are something where ‘we eat the smile / and spit out the teeth,’ history books have the face of executioners and the rustle of a newspaper is ‘the silence of the night writing in its diary.’ Simic made a name for himself through his exquisite wordplay that could move between nuanced and layer abstractions to something as simple as My Secret Identity Is // The room is empty, And the window is open.’ He won a Pulitzer for prose poems, a style often overlooked and difficult to perfect but Simic managed to orchestra into something haunting and visceral:My mother was a braid of black smoke.She bore me swaddled over the burning cities.The sky was a vast and windy place for a child to play.We met many others who were just like us. They were tryingto put on their overcoats with arms made of smoke.The high heavens were full of little shrunken deaf earsinstead of stars.Something that has always charmed me about Simic is the way his words disrupt your reality, jostling it until the pieces align in a new image that gives a lucid impression of the abstract realities coursing through the veins of life. He also does this with poetry in general, having worked of several projects that exist in a poetic realm between prose and verse, and often in communication with images such as photographs of the night sky or Joseph Cornell’s boxes in Dime-Store Alchemy (a title I used for social media names often in life). ‘All art is a magic operation, or, if you prefer, a prayer for a new image,’ he writes in Alchemy, and through a poetic remix of the pieces Cornell molded from found objects to leave them teeming with abstract emotion, Simic conjures a new image within the image. ‘Making art in America is about saving one's soul,’ he wrote, and through his words we may not find evidence of a soul (the question of one is often fluttering through his pages) but we certainly find a liminal space of beauty that makes existence worth it all regardless. After reading Dime-Store Alchemy, I took a trip to The Art Institute of Chicago to see Cornell's boxes (they have one of the largest collections of them) only to find they were currently off display and then got stranded by a snowstorm. I sat in a bar writing bad poetry. I think Simic would appreciate that moment, and I have since seen the Cornell boxes.THE BODYThis last continentStill to be discovered.My hand is dreaming, is buildingIts ship. For crew it takesA pack of bones, for foodA beer-bottle full of blood.It knows the breath that blows north.With the breath from the westIt will sail east each night.The scent of your body as it sleepsAre the land-birds sighted at sea.My touch is on the highest mast.It cries at four in the morningFor a lantern to be litOn the rim of the world.It is sad to know Simic has passed on. He is of the last of a group of poets that all meant a lot to me in my early 20s, a group that also all knew each other well. Russell Edson, James Tate, Mark Strand and Charles Simic, all of them now passed on but leaving behind a trail of immaculate poetry to follow them and remember them by. Simic even wrote a beautiful eulogy for Strand after his passing. In his later and last poems, the ones collected beyond this amazing Selected work, Simic’s poetry would seemingly retreat inward, trying to pack as much into as little a space as possible, but would also frequently comment upon an impending death.AT TENDER MERCYO lone streetlight,Trying to shedWhat light you canOn a spider repairing his webThis autumn night,Stay with me,As I push further and furtherInto the dark.Poetry can stop time in order to move around within a moment, but it can’t stop the inevitable. In his final collection Simic includes the following:THE WIND HAS DIEDMy little boat,Take care.There is noLand is sight.Simic’s little boat may have departed us but what a glorious gift it has left us. I once found his professor email and after too many drinks decided to send him a lengthy and blatantly obviously intoxicated email. I awoke to a response from him where he kindly answered every question and thanked me for my enthusiasm. What a guy, what a poet, what a legend. Farewell to a hero of mine, thanks for the lovely words.5/5STONEGo inside a stoneThat would be my way.Let somebody else become a doveOr gnash with a tiger's tooth.I am happy to be a stone.From the outside the stone is a riddle:No one knows how to answer it.Yet within, it must be cool and quietEven though a cow steps on it full weight,Even though a child throws it in a river;The stone sinks, slow, unperturbedTo the river bottomWhere the fishes come to knock on itAnd listen.I have seen sparks fly outWhen two stones are rubbed,So perhaps it is not dark inside after all;Perhaps there is a moon shiningFrom somewhere, as though behind a hill-Just enough light to make outThe strange writings, the star-chartsOn the inner walls.EVENING WALKYou give the appearance of listeningTo my thoughts, o trees,Bent over the road I am walkingOn a late summer eveningWhen every one of you is a steep staircaseThe night is descending.The leaves like my mother's lipsForever trembling, unable to decide,For there's a bit of wind,And it's like hearing voices,Or a mouth full of muffled laughter,A huge dark mouth we can all fit inSuddenly covered by a hand.Everything quiet.

Matilda by Roald Dahl is a beloved children’s classic for a reason and one that still warms the hearts of kids and adults today. Who doesn’t love a book that celebrates the empowerment of reading, that tells a story of overcoming tyrants and surviving abuse while retaining a love for the world? Wrap that all up in a story of a girl with magical powers and a will to freedom and love aided by librarians and a caring teacher and you’ve got yourself a winning story. While I noticed some problematic aspects returning to this again as an adult, I was reminded how much this story meant to me as a kid and how much it grew inside me through my whole life. ‘The books transported her into new worlds and introduced her to amazing people who lived exciting lives.’For the uninitiated, Matilda is the story of a young girl who ‘longed for a friend, someone like the kind, courageous people in her books.’ Her parents neglect her and are involved in shady dealings, her principal is a nightmare who hates children and loves punishment, but she has discovered her magic powers and will right the wrongs in order to thrive. There is a fantastic film adaptation I used to watch constantly as a kid and this, coupled with movies like The Pagemaster, was an early start to my love of libraries and books. We see how books can comfort the lonely, can inspire and empower, and there’s nothing I love more than the idea that money is not an obstacle to reading when you have a library card. Flash forward to today, I work in a library and in a bookstore and, likely thanks to Matilda, have devoted a large part of my life to getting good books to the people who need them. ‘So Matilda’s strong young mind continued to grow, nurtured by the voices of all those authors who had sent their books out into the world like ships on the sea. These books gave Matilda a hopeful and comforting message: You are not alone.’The idea that books remind you ‘you are not alone’ is something that has always struck me hardest. I used to leave favorite poems all over trees for that very reason, to say ‘I was here’ but also ‘you are not alone’ and picked passages that might comfort or inspire. Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish once wrote ‘A poem in a difficult time / is beautiful flowers in a cemetery,’ and I believe this applies to books too. A good book can help in times of need, can comfort, uplift, can be a friend when you need one. And in good times too, a book can elevate your day and be a companion in your mind, something you can’t wait to return and read more. ‘There is no frigate like a book / to take us lands away,’ wrote Emily Dickinson, and Franz Kafka reminds us that a ‘book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us,’ so I have always believed in the power of books. Reading helps build empathy and opens us to new ideas, so read widely and often and definitely read to children if you have any available.Dahl is a complicated figure, however, and there were some aspects that raised my eyebrow while reading. You can always find discourse on Dahl all over the internet, such as the extremely frustrating fact of his vocal antisemitism, or his use of racist tropes, and claims of fatphobia and misogyny abound. A big debate is often about the way he writes about women, as The Witches is hotly argued, though many consider Matilda to be a feminist work. Sure, we have Ms Honey, a single woman who is able to rise about on her own, and Matilda, a young, determined girl who can overthrow tyrants. But the depiction of Agatha Trunchbull are a bit unpleasant as it seems an anti-lesbian structuring. Called simply by her last name, Trunchbull is vaguely based on Soviet Olympian Faina Melnik and is described as big and bulky and, well, rather masculine. It would seem, as a contrast to Ms Honey, that Dahl finds women acceptable only if they perform femininity in the “right” way. Trunchbull is pretty blatantly queer and he depicts her in a way that is very similar to accusations thrown against queer women at the time, such as wanting to destroy the nuclear family (after the children spell ‘difficulty’: ‘Mrs D, Mrs I, Mrs FFI, Mrs C, Mrs U, Mrs LTY,’ Trunchbull is outraged and snaps ‘why are all these women married?’) and for not being sexually desirable the way society thinks they should be. It all seemed a bit off, and a quick internet search showed I wasn’t alone in thinking this, so, as a queer person myself, that's a bit of a bummer. The book does focus on breaking the cycle of child abuse and a lot of it is very good, but this was rather awkward as an adult. Also the reading list in the book is very much white, male cannon. So take that as you will, I still find the book worth reading and enjoyable, and I have to give a hand to Pam Ferris for a knockout performance as Agatha Trunchbull in the film. Separating art from an artist is something that people will do at their own comfort level and we should give space for everyone for that.This book looks at the mentality of ‘I'm right and you're wrong, I'm big and you're small, and there's nothing you can do about it,’ and tells it to sit down and shut up. This is an underdog story (well, an underdog with magic) and one that celebrates reading. I loved Matilda as a child and now look at me, I’m writing about books constantly of this website hoping people might see them and be inspired, and spending my working hours getting books into people’s hands.

Like if you had a cool, quirky aunt living in a cottage and when she sat you down to show you her paintings they didn’t suck. Women Holding Things is her latest collection of art and musings and reflects on the concept of holding things, be that physically, emotionally, artistically, existentially, ect. She reflects on how we hold our tasks, our family and history and more, juxtaposing sparse text often in poetic form with her lovely art. This is a lovely book to spend time with, absorbing her discourses on what we hold and gazing through the colorful artwork to feel the emotional charge she directs through the combination of mediums. I enjoyed how it dips into family history, even into the horrors of WWII, but also into famous people through history and even more abstract ideas about what objects—such as a chair—hold and how it relates to us. It does have a section about men near the end, which feels a bit awkward as if she feared criticisms for not addressing the emotions of men and seems rather tacked on, so that is rather unfortunate as women rarely seem to be given a space for themselves without it being infringed upon. But overall this is a charming book and I enjoy the art.  [image]I like how this book feels like a visual poem, flowing from idea to idea along a current of artwork that complements the writing and vice versa. It never feels like the words are there to accommodate a reason for displaying the paintings, or the paintings there to flesh out the words, but a balanced partnership of both. We learn about her family, such as her grandparents and her parents fraught marriage, and we also learn about various women across history. There is some good wordplay along with the concept of holding things, such as these two below.  [image]Gertrude Stein “holding true to herself” (left) and Virgina Woolf “barely holding it together” (right)There are some excellent discussions on concepts such as time as well, and how it is something we simply cannot hold on to: ‘Finding time is all we want to do.Once you find time, you want more time.And more time in between that time.There can never be enough time.And you can never hold on to it.It is so strangeWe live. And then we die.So unutterably strange.’Another aspect I enjoyed was her discussion on communication and how we hold each other through our interactions. Particularly her mention ‘on some level, this lack of / communication feels like true / communication. Or that is how / I have come to think of it,’ and how this applies to the larger picture that what we hold shows what we value. ‘Objects around us holdour attention and our love.It is hard workto hold everythingand it never ends.’There are some great passages with ideas of objects, though the section on men seemed unnecessary. I would have preferred if the focus could have just been women as the title implies. I see how it is a tribute to the men in her life, or the lives of the women discussed, but that seemed already better suited to being framed through the women. Perhaps she felt she women would not be given the space, or perhaps it is a way of trying to accommodate everyone but it just felt misplaced in the book. Or, perhaps, she just needed a reason to have some of those paintings (the Chekov one is great), so who knows. Either way, I think the overall effect would have been just as good if not better had this section been cut.  [image]Hortense Cézanne holding her own.Kalman has made a delightful little book full of great art and ideas to ponder. I enjoyed spending some time with this for a few days and I suspect you will too. It is good to think about what we hold, and as Kalman mentions at the end, thinking about what we carry and why leads to thinking about the ideas around letting go. 3.75/5‘And perhaps someone you are walking withWill ask you to hold something for a minuteWhile they tie their shoelaces.“Of course” is the answer.“As long as you like.”...more",Notes are private!,0,89,1,not set,not set,"Jan 08, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60194116-women-holding-things

It is hard to not instantly fall in love with Mamo as the breathtaking artwork grabs your eye and pulls your entire heart and soul into the idyllic, pastoral landscapes of Haresden, a town where the local witch has recently died and chaos and fae mischief is running amok. The artwork is so enrapturing you’ll practically smell the sweet grass and feel yourself ramble on through the fields and forests along with Jo as she aids witch Orla in a quest to collect the bones of her grandmother Mamo, the deceased witch. The pair must find and bury the bones to assuage Mamo’s angry spirit, lest the town be swallowed by the landscape, while also having the right the wrongs of Mamo’s neglect to the land. As adventurous as it is heartwarming and whimsical, Mamo is a magical story about the ties that bind us, featuring a thought-provoking magical lore and a deeply felt look at the ways we struggle with our personal histories.  [image]I can’t scream enough about how much I love the artwork here. It comes alive in color palettes so precisely selected for maximum beauty to deliver you into sweeping vistas of countryside and cozy homes.The character design is also sharp and expressive, and there is such lovely attention to details that draw you in.  [image]Isn’t this gorgeous? I mean, you can truly get lost in the art and Mamo is worth owning simply to return to the artwork.  [image]Come for the artwork but stay for the story, because Mamo is an excellently plotted tale with plenty to ponder and love and surprise twists-and-turns. The dynamics between Jo and Orla as their friendship (and maybe something more) blossoms in the sunny fields and farms through which they travel on their quest. But there are plenty of other fascinating characters, such as fae and trolls who Orla must appease like little side-quests in the adventure to save the town of Haresden. This is a town Jo loves, but one Orla has a painful relationship with leading to her caustic and closed off attitudes that she must learn to abate as the story progresses. The pacing is delightful here, which is something I often find minor gripes with in graphic novels. It feels neither too long nor too short and keeps a good forward drive while still pausing to breathe in quiet moments that are welcome for their coziness and dialogue. The story is told in five chapters and was originally published as five issues, but it has a single-forward moving story instead of feeling episodic. That said, each chapter has a self-contained pacing structure that ebbs and flows in an effective rhythm for teasing out tension and tales.‘Family isn’t about being the same. It’s about looking after one another.’The magic system is integral to the overarching message and themes of the story in a moving and dynamic way. Without giving away too much, ideas of connection and bonds are central to the book, from perspectives of being shared burdens and being stronger together to feeling bound and tied down to painful memories and stifled by your home. There is a lovely message that when something is given freely, its magical essence doubles instead of is halved, which makes for a lovely metaphor about love and support. There is also the emotional irony that witches ‘are lonely by nature, but their work cannot be done alone’ and being bound to your repayments of debts and deals or accepting difficult consequences in order to get what you want become a running theme that brilliantly adds texture to the plot. It is a magic system that delivers an emotional resonance in a minor key within the reader’s heart, casting a bittersweet and existentially heavy shadow on a story so beautiful in its presentation. Plus there are other wonderful magic elements such as the creatures that populate the world, including a really fantastic talking crow.  [image]Watching the characters progress in their bonds and shared trials is delightful and builds enough empathetic high stakes for the dramatic conclusion to really land. It is billed as a YA graphic novel, but it has so much heart and sublte depth that I suspect it would be just as entertaining for any adult interested in graphic novels. This is just such a cute sapphic story delivered with such wonderment and amazing art. I will read anything Sas Milledge puts out now. I knew this was going to be fantastic as soon as both Amanda and hope independently told me it was a must-read during the same work shift. Mamo is a charming book and easily read in a glorious afternoon full of witchcraft and whimsy, you won’t regret it.5/5  [image]...more",Notes are private!,5,167,1,"Jan 06, 2023","Jan 06, 2023","Jan 06, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58673892-mamo

Absolutely, but that is half the charm. But does it hold up? Well, honestly, yes.

Jack is still Jack, which is what everyone wants, and he does become a bit more the focus (the gag of the film is that he is actually just the side-kick, though I suppose this does center the white character even when he isn’t the real hero).

The tightness of her novellas, like in Foster, seems to have been forged through Keegan’s history of short story writing from which she has published two collections. Keegan’s recent short story So Late in the Day, (you can read it or listen to her read it here) yet again demonstrates her incredible prowess with a taut plot and subtle symbolism where nothing seems wasted or in excess. Keegan also pulls no punches, delivering a sharp jab into misogyny and the societal norms that allow it to perpetuate, told in a story filled with idyllic language and scenery but a dark shadow of unease growing over the landscapes of prose.Writing advice commonly instructs to never start a story with descriptions of weather and atmosphere is better served through character’s reactions than a description for the sake of a jumping in point. Keegan subverts this well, opening with ‘on Friday, July 29th, Dublin got the weather that had been forecast,’ a quick line that instantly snags at our assumptions and is a rather surprising start for a line about being unsurprising. This plays into the tone of the story flawlessly: what comes as a surprise is, unfortunately, unsurprising. So Late in the Day is told from the perspective of Cathal, opening with him clearly dealing with some grief before diving into a story of a relationship a year prior. Keegan casts an idyllic setting, Dublin in the summer full of children playing with ‘carrying smoothly on, despite the tangle of human conflicts and the knowledge of how everything must end,’ and we know darkness lurks around the corner. In short, it is the story of a failing engagement, one where the woman must bluntly reflect her partner back to himself in order for him to see the reality of his behaviors. It is not a pretty sight, but it also startles him into realizing how much of who he is was learned through his father and through what society allows to pass unchecked.‘“You know what is at the heart of misogyny? When it comes down to it?’ she asks him, ‘it’s simply about not giving…whether it’s not giving us the vote or not giving help with the dishes—it’s all clitched to the same wagon.’ Keegan brings up pranks pulled of Cathal’s mother that the father allowed, or the acknowledgement that ‘mother had served everyone,’ with Cathal not realizing how much emotional burdens and labor men in society thoughtlessly pile upon the women they claim to love. ‘‘At least half of men your age just want us to shut up and give you what you want, that you’re spoiled and become contemptible when things don’t go your way.’It takes a directness for Cathal to even accept this might be vaguely true, as his whole perspective until then had been critiques of her ‘ that she would not listen, and wanted to do a good half of things her own way.’ The man’s way is thought to be the only way and Keegan would like to remind you that this is a notion that must be torn down and snuffed out lest women be forced to carry the labour of men’s inability to process their own emotions forever. And also Cathal’s unrealistic expectations when his idea of romance sours for him because ‘it’s just too much reality.’There is also an element that Cathal believes ‘ if things have not ended badly, they have not ended,’ which plays into why the most dangerous time for a women is when she leaves her partner, with 75% of all domestic assaults occurring during a separation. 1 in 4 women have been abused by a current or former partner in Ireland, while in the United States an average of 20 women per minute are assaulted by an intimate partner. Men will use this violence to keep a woman from leaving, thinking, like Cathal does, if things haven’t gone to total ruin, there is still a chance to win them back. Which is horrific.This is a chilling but wonderfully executed story that probes at the heart of misogyny. Keegan is always ready with a perfect phrase, or symbol such as the cherries here that chart the ups and ends of the relationship. Succinct but powerful is Keegan’s signature, and this story does not disappoint.⅘ ‘At least half of men your age just want us to shut up and give you what you want, that you’re spoiled and become contemptible when things don’t go your way.’...more",Notes are private!,0,162,1,not set,not set,"Jan 04, 2023",,,view (with text),/book/show/60505208-so-late-in-the-day

It is an important lesson to learn that asking for help and working together is not something to be ashamed of and this message is central to the adorable youth graphic novel, The Sprite and the Gardener from Rii Abrego and Joe Whitt. With incredible artwork, this is the story of how sprites used to grow the world’s gardens but stepped aside once humans divided up the land and began their individual gardens. Wisteria moves to town and decides to lend a hand to Elena, a teen girl who can’t seem to get her garden to grow, but will her help be unwelcome and shatter Elena’s confidence or will it lead to a new partnership between humans and sprites. Cute and charming, though a bit slight, this is a very endearing story of gardening, teamwork and friendship that is sure to warm your heart.  [image]As someone that always disliked group projects in school, I could certainly relate to the aversion to group gardening that trips up the characters in this story. I had been burned so many times where I had to practically do the whole project that it lead me to just wanting to do it all so I could trust it would be done satisfactorily, but in life I’ve learned that this is not the way and a team built on trust and dedication can harness the strengths of many members to become something greater than the sum of its parts. Here, the characters want to do it all themselves as a way to feel good about themselves and their abilities, and there is an implied shame to accepting help. Like myself, this is something they have to unlearn and The Sprite and the Gardnener is a whimsical and imaginative look at how a community working towards a common goal can uplift everyone.   [image]This was a fun story and I really loved the artwork and how the character’s individual designs fit the plants they were named for. It is a bit brief and one-dimensional, which is fine as it makes for a good message though it wraps up almost too quickly and could have benefitted from a bit more tension to flesh out the story and provide a bit more texture for the reader to latch on to.

In Sweet Bean Paste by Durian Sukegawa, an unlikely friendship between an formerly incarcerated confectionary shop worker, the 78 year old woman he hires and a troubled teen girl becomes an emotional investigation into stigmas around identity and health and demonstrates that the only thing shameful about them are the stigmas themselves. Short and with a simple but direct prose, wonderfully translated by Alison Watts, Sweet Bean Paste is a story as sweet as the title would imply, making for an idyllic little read. While fairly simple itself, it is still effectively affecting and spirals through moments both heart-warming and heart-wrenching as the characters face the trials and tribulations of life with grace and remind us all to be open to love and acceptance. Durian Sukegawa delivers a lovely book that tackles a difficult piece of Japanese history surrounding the treatment of people with leprosy that becomes a moving statement not just about accepting and understanding one another and history, but also about embracing and including. ‘That's why I made confectionery. I made sweet things for all those who lived with the sadness of loss. And that's how I was able to live out my life.’This was a charming little novella and made for a nice final read for 2022, so thank you to Nenia for recommending it (read her wonderful  here). It is indeed rather sweet as confectionery but manages to never seem overly saccharine even as it delivers big sweeping messages on interconnectedness and people being our footholds to know we are part of a big, beautiful cosmic existence. It helps because much of this comes from Tokue, an elderly woman who’s hands have become gnarled due to Hansen’s disease, is so endearing a character. As is Sentaro, the ex-con turned pancake maker who is reluctant to hire her fearing she will be too old and slow for the labor but changes his mind after tasting her sweet bean paste. ‘Are you telling me to fire someone who’s not sick, just because she was in the past?’Unfortunately for Tokue, there is a large stigma around leprosy. In Japan, those with leprosy were isolated from society, unable to work or interact, until the ban was lifted in 1996. Though she is no longer legally required to be removed from society, public perceptions are still harsh. ‘The world hasn’t changed. It’s just as cruel as it always was,’ Sukegawa writes. Even Sentaro first hides her in the kitchen, afraid the sight of her hands will drive away customers, and he is later told by the absentee-owner of the shop to fire her. When word gets out, the shop loses business because of stigmas around people with leprosy, even though Tokue is asymptomatic.Sentaro is no stranger to the cruelty of public opinion either. He is a classic ‘troubled’ character, having done prison time, is burdoned by debts, has mother issues and is troubled by alcoholism. The book examines how we internalize failure, with Sentaro viewing himself as built to fail when many of his foiled attempts to better himself are unbalanced against him by systemic stigmas against his character. ‘He did not know when or why his fall had begun, but he sensed the seeds of it had always been in him, ever since he was small. It was nothing sudden. It was not failure to try and live an honest life – the result of leading an honest life was the wreckage of his days now. In short, Sentaro suffered because he was who he was.’This probes the idea that so much of our self-worth is constructed from the distorted mirror image society reflects back at us. As Jean-Paul Sartre wrote ‘People who live in society have learned how to see themselves in mirrors as they appear to their friends.’ Like with Tokue, the negative perception of them from society can seep in and make a person feel they are just born bad. We don’t learn much about Sentaro, only just enough to get a general idea from what he tells people, but this is one of the more brilliant parts of the novel. By keeping Sentaro fully in the present, we examine—and inevitably judge—him based on the person presented in the now. His past is just a shadow we only catch in our peripheries. This is a nice effect, and a good way to focus the story on accepting people for who they are, not for their health struggles or past.‘The only way to get over barriers, she said, is to live in the spirit of already being over them.’Tokue, on the other hand, is representative of a deeper societal problem of ableism paired with a work-culture that values people by their labor roles. Before the lifting of the ban, people with leprosy had very little avenues for much of a life, and her attempt to find labor here is beyond even a means of living as, to her, making bean paste for people to enjoy is a life affirming activity. Giving love and care to others, making something beautiful even if ephemeral. Which is another conversation altogether about how meaningful work and profitable work are not necessarily synonymous (I’m typing this while at work at the library…).‘I believed that a life has no value if a person is not a useful member of society. I was convinced that humans are born in order to be of service to the world and to others.’Tokue speaks often of connection and uplifting others, but the stigma of her health blocks her from being able to be of service. Which shouldn’t make her any less of a person in the public eye but her lack of employment is looked down on. I struggle with this perspective on people in the world as someone is far more than their job description and “hard work” isn’t the only meaningful way to be. When I worked a year as a manager for Goodwill (who’s slogan ""Changing Lives Through the Power of Work"" painted on the wall at work was uncomfortably adjacent to the phrase Arbeit macht frei [“hard work will set you free”] which was carved on the gates to Auschwitz) it was frustrating that we would allow job training for formerly incarcerated individuals but were not allowed to hire anyone with any sort of criminal background. We can help you but you can’t be financially able to survive with us because of your past mistakes is the message that seemed to send, and that always bothered me (that never went over well at meetings with corporate though). So that was all in the back of my mind reading this book.‘People’s lives never stay the same colour forever. There are times when the colour of life changes completely.’Overall, this is a very hopeful book with a lot of pleasant things to say about interconnection and valuing people for who they are. It is a good reminder that people can turn their lives around and that we can help give the space for that to happen. Its also a good reminder to appreciate what we have and see the beauty already present in a world, even if it can be quite ugly and we have to look for the beauty some days. ‘I pay attention to the language of things in this world that don’t use words…It’s my belief that everything in this world has its own language. We have the ability to open up our ears and minds to anything and everything. That could be someone walking down the street, it could be the sunshine or the wind.’This book can tip towards overly sweet at times, but it pulls it off nonetheless and will warm your heart. It is also an interesting look at issues of ableism both historical and lingering and how social stigmas become an oppressive force. Sweet Bean Paste is a cute book and now I really want to try some dorayaki.4/5‘All experience adds up to a life lived as only you could. I feel sure the day will come when you can say: this is my life.’...more",Notes are private!,1,298,1,"Dec 31, 2022","Dec 31, 2022","Dec 31, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/33376821-sweet-bean-paste

[image]Lovers across timeZeno and Ana have spent their lives orbiting one another in a bittersweet dance that never aligns their hearts together but keeps them yearning and dreaming for one another. The story is told through outstanding and whimsical artwork and moves backwards through their live—not unlike the film Memento—with each new chapter preceding the last on a timeline returning us to the origin of their first connection. Time is practically a character, pushed in reverse as we unravel the culminations of their lives as paths cross and recross in a backwards waltz of muted passion rivaled by commitment to duty and family. It is a bittersweet story, kept upbeat by the format making each reveal a bit more charming while also coming loaded down with an added emotional weight in the irony of knowing what is to come as the characters greet each page with an eye to the future and an unshakable desire for each other despite the uncertain grounds of love on which they stand. Anyone who has ever had a late night phone call with a long-lost love or wondered if your paths will reconnect with someone where distance grew as a consequence of circumstances will find their hearts aglow with the angst and tender agony of their love.   [image]‘A long time ago, the moon and earth each followed their own trajectories. One day they crossed paths and were mutually attracted to each other, but neither managed to stop. They followed their own course, each with a power of attraction over the other…and the forces combined and the moon started orbiting around the earth over and over again.’  [image]‘They never managed to latch onto each other…but their paths are forever linked.’This story has left me in a warm blanket of not quite sadness but sweetly exhausted melancholy. It is the feeling of perking up after a good soul-dumping cry. This is a story where so much of what is said speaks to something beyond the actual words, the codes of longing and checking the boundaries to see if there is still a place in someone else’s heart for you.  [image]'We're not talking about the bookstore anymore are we?'See what I mean?Ana gets married, becomes a career mayor while Zeno sails, explores, womanizes and works on his PhD dissertation (interestingly enough a quantum physics theory that time can be halted and spun backwards, much like the narrative). There were a few aspects I raised an eyebrow or sighed at, as the romanticization of the wanderlust man who can’t commit is a bit tired, especially as the women in this story are left carrying an unequal load of emotional labor. The two characters are balanced out well though as to both be upholding the longing on each other, though when Ana’s husband is a bit too supportive of her feelings for Zeno its a bit odd (homeboy is like hey I’m old and you can still get frisky so do it up which was…awkwardly executed). Also the story does a disservice to Ana’s husband and daughter who are overly sidelined without much space for them, though their one big scene is a a well done metaphor directed at uncovering Ana’s emotional affair. One final gripe, I sort of dislike the font choice and it is quite difficult to read in a digital version.That said, there are some intensely cute and tender moments, brought to life with the gorgeous artwork, such as when their phone calls merge them into the same panel as if they are dancing together or embracing on the same beach. Their longing is always felt and their emotions dance off the page, especially the joy they cannot mask with each reconnection.  [image]I love these moments in the story. The book succeeds through not attempting to do too much with the plot but keeps it fairly centered in the mundanities of life while still making them fairly extraordinary people, he adventurous and brilliant, she driven and strong willed. While it is full of romantic quirkiness, it never launches too far and just breathes with everyday life. I think this made is stick more for me.The artwork really brings it here. The color palettes are divine, conveying so much mood and the panel work keeps the story moving forward (well…backwards) at a well-balanced pace. Sometimes this book feels like not quite enough and sometimes a bit bogged down in the repetition, but it also feels alive and true, which helps. Projects like Zeno’s PhD or Ana’s mayor-defining bridge weave through the story, finding out the inspirations or pitfalls in ways the keep these sideplots interesting enough to pull the story along. But what is most impressive is the way the erosion of time is show in the landscapes and characters, with their aging being done quite impressively on the page.  [image]But we have to talk about Zeno. Jordi, how dare you make this cartoon man so damn dreamy. Handsome, roguish academic to silver fox…I feel personally targeted. I mean c’mon:  [image]Insert heart eyesShort but full of love and life, Always Never is a charming and cute read. The idea behind the narrative is great and never feels like a gimmick but only enhances the story and is a unique way to squeeze out as much emotion as possible from the storyline. It all ends where it begins, and is a cute a satisfying moment that will have you flipping back through the story to follow the threads forward through their lives as there are aspects you won’t realize are meaningful until later in the story. A feel good yet feel sad story with exquisite art, this was a hit.4/5‘Inevitable, but impossible. Separated by infinity. United by the horizon.

Fractious petals, stopinterrupting me with your boring beauty.All the boys are in the field gnawing rawbones of ambition and calling it ardor. Whothe hell are they? This is a poem about war.This is just one gem of many to be found in her collection Some Say the Lark, and what a gem it is. Lark moves through existential quandaries of living in both the world and internally, often positioning on a balance between love and longing. This is a collection that looks deeply at language, thought and knowledge, such as in Small Philosophies, a poem in three parts, and also asks ‘what does it mean even to write a poem?’ There are tiny meditations to be found, such as Chang’s discourse on personal growth where she writes ‘My silent habit / is to listen: / for I knew these trees once / as a different self,’ or her advice that ‘ the best walking is without / reason, formless, scattering the self / into thinking.’ The collection becomes a beautiful reminder that time spent in quiet introspection is time spent well. ‘I have stood in this clearing and cannot decideif I miss the trees or if I love newborn clarity.How can I love a damaged place? But I loverooms and cities I'll never return to, and onceI loved a man for how he damaged me. Hereis the footbridge unbridged by that storm. Hereis the fire pond the walker could not find: he did notknow my route. Here is the water. Where is the fire?’This is a book I’ve revisited several times over the years, always one I spot in the 811s at the library and think “yes, I do want to read a few of these again.” It has become like visiting a friend, and each read I noticed something different or a line strikes me in a new way. I think that is what I love best about poetry, it’s like the old saying about never stepping in the same river twice because while the words remain unchanged upon the page, ourselves and our feelings and being flows across them in new ways each time. We are the babbling brook of the self with poetry to direct our course downstream. Returning to her query about what is a poem, Chang once delivered a lovely example in an interview with Tupelo Quarterly. Asked about the temporality of poetry, Chang replied:‘Poems are like time machines. They travel through time as a medium for individual memory and, as a genre, they engage historical time, collective cultural memory. But I think poems also activate a simultaneity of past, present, and future. A poem’s rhythm moves us forward in time; the imagination a poem (hopefully) sparks posits futurities, a constellation of potentialities. Considering the nexus of verb tenses versus the present tense of the reading experience, a poem has already happened, is always happening right now, and will soon happen again.’I find this to be all very lovely. Poetry points towards possible horizons, of society, of discourse, and of the self. It is alive as it becomes an emotional rudder in the stream of existence, helping us navigate traumas, sail through heartbreak and look into the vast skies and find our place within it.This is a collection about emotional vulnerability, feeling like ‘a door/ falls out of the frame and you're more/ open than you'd like.’ It is one that spends a deal of time in the idea of longing, but also the idea of loving, and finding the two to not be mutually exclusive. Some Say the Lark by Jennifer Chang is a collection worth diving into again and again.⅘The Lonely HumansAbout solitude, I don’t need proofit’s lost.

First and foremost I’d like to extend a thank you to all my friends for the s we’ve shared and discussed and bonded through because Goodreads is above all things a community of book lovers and I am proud to share this niche corner of the internet with you all and look forward each day to our interactions. I’m always so grateful for all the support and words are too fragile a medium to capture how much it means to me to be able to interact with all of you across the globe. It was a great year of reading for me, personally, and one in which I think the most fun I had was shitposting about Lord Byron on a warm summer’s night deep in inebriation. But this was also a year I discovered my new favorite author, met a lot of really wonderful people, built a more structured reading list and just simply enjoyed discussing books. So, if you’ll permit my usual loquacity, I’d like to lay out some highlights.I began the year declaring that 2022 was the year I read Elena Ferrante. I did a quick one-two punch of The Lost Daughter (I still need to see the film) and Troubling Love, enjoying bot immensely. I hit a snag when, about to embark on a winter’s vacation to Minneapolis, my plan to start her tetralogy was foiled by a customer at the bookstore I work in purchasing the first book before me. No bother, I thought, and decided to revisit a book I had always considered a favorite but had never ed since it came from pre-goodreads days. Nothing could have been more serendipitous because that book, The Passion by Jeanette Winterson not only reaffirmed itself as a favorite book but launched me into a year-long obsession with Winterson where I now cite them as my favorite author. It couldn’t have come at a better time as my favorite band, Florence and the Machine, also released a new album and the pairing of Winterson’s work and Florence’s music is honest…chefs kiss. It sustained me through the year, threading Winterson with each few books I’d read and I am still just as excited as I was back in the previous winter to read more. This year I completed:The Passion (favorite novel EVER)Sexing the Cherry (read entirely on a train ride to and from Chicago to visit the Ukrainian Museum)Oranges are Not the Only Fruit (pairs well with Florence’s Delliah)Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal (pairing Oranges with the memoir is a highly recommended reading adventure)Written On the Body (also read in Chicago)FrankisssteinLighthousekeeping (pairs well with Florence’s Wish That You Were Here)The Daylight Gate (Florence’s Which Witch for sure)WeightThe Lion, The Unicorn, and MeAnd the literary advent calendar of Christmas DaysNeedless to say this has been literary bliss and I love Winterson. I look forward to reading the rest in 2023, here’s a sneak peak:  [image]But I did read other books, I swear. This spring I had a project I called Sobbing With Steinbeck where I reread all the Steinbeck novellas and found that Tortilla Flat still slaps. I also finally succumbed to joining a book club which has been a lot of fun and a lot of drinking. The big surprise hit of the year from that was Carmilla, though I was also pleased to find Kurt Vonnegut Jr. still hit when we read Mother Night. Hell, we even read Second Sex Simone de Beauvoir and I forced everyone to read (and then watch the film) Persepolis.There were some random reads that I greatly enjoyed, one of the biggest hits being Boulder by Eva Baltasar, Pachinko Parlour by Elisa Shua Dusapin, and I was thrilled to read another Mieko Kawakami with the English translation release of All the Lovers in the Night. Also a huge shoutout to my good friend and coworker Hope who joined me on a lot of reads this year and put up with relentless book discussions. I did try to be a bit more structured with my reading this year and paired a lot of books together (often for the sake of the s). I really enjoyed my queer horror kick this summer, going from Carmilla into Our Wives Under the Sea—a chilly novel I quite enjoyed oddly read during a warm, sunny vacation in Denver—and then followed up with Winterson’s Frankissstein. For that I read Shelley’s Frankenstein along with it to get a better understanding, and enjoyed being creeped out the night I finished it when a deep fog hit when I was walking my dog post-midnight through a field in an unfamiliar area near the place I was staying while my house was being worked on (I also enjoyed doing a lot of reading in unfamiliar places and a different coffee shop or bar due to the displacement). I also paired Winterson’s witch novella with In Defense of Witches, even if only for some pull quotes to better  the former, though finding the latter was a perfect read following up Beauvoir. One of my favorite reading kicks this year was October when I went full tilt into spooky season. I got deep into some Poe and the Poe-retelling What Moves the Dead, but also read a lot of Stephen Graham Jones, reading The Vampyre to keep the anti-Byron flame alive, and didn’t fall victim to the imagination until right before Halloween when knocking from the stairwell next to the bookstore made me flee quickly only to have to return and open the completely dark coatroom to find my keys while I heard pounding from just behind he door. Thanks, literature, I almost shit myself. I also got down on' a big string of myth retellings after my community did a community read of Circe, my favorite of them all being Ali Smith’s Girl Meets Boy which I read in blissful 80 degree weather under a palm tree during December while drinking rum at Disney. Would recommend.  [image]I did get to play my girl Persephone staffing the library Murder Mystery Party based on Circe, so that was cool, shoutout library programs.  [image]This photo is also a confession I write and underling ALL OVER my booksSpeaking of libraries, however, I am glad to be continuing working in the library as well as the local indie bookstore. It allows me to have a lot of interaction with books and readers, but I also get to make fun projects like this Ghost Hunters Bookstore edition video. Though it isn’t always laughs as this past year has seen a lot of attacks on books so I do devote a lot of time to following these issues and trying to find ways to push back, which I wrote about extensively here. So, as always, if you love books I encourage you to support your local library!As always, I read a lot of poetry this year with my favorites being Noor Hindi, the new Franny Choi, the new US Poet Laureate Ada Limon’s The Hurting Kind and Xie’s The Rupture Tense. I must also recommend the anthology Words for War, a collection of Ukrainian poetry about the Crimean war, which hit quite heavy this year. I also got down on A LOT of graphic novels, with some notable’s being It’s Lonely at the Center of the Universe, Thieves, Ballad for Sophie, Over My Dead Body and The Sad Ghost Club. I also can’t believe it was just this year we all got treated to the netflix adaptation of Heartstopper!Wow, what a great year, honestly. Thank you all for the support and conversation. I’ve missed a lot of books I’ve read but it has been lovely looking back over my reading list and seeing all I have enjoyed. A huge part of this year was Annie Ernaux winning the Nobel Prize, which has sent me down a trail of her books, such as my favorite so far being Possession or Shame and I can’t wait to read more in the coming year. I look forward to seeing everyone’s Year-in-, I’m a sucker for that kind of thing at the New Years mark, and I wish you all a happy holidays and I am certainly going to be doing some pagan shit to bring in the new year.

It is Winterson’s nativity story, told from the perspective of a lowly donkey who is chosen by an angel to carry the newborn Jesus on his return journey, and it makes for a lovely Christmas read. The story first appeared as text only in the collection Christmas Days, though it is brought to life and greatly enhanced through Rosalind MacCurrach’s lovely illustrations. Charming, magical, and full of the soothing writing one would expect from the great Winterson, this is a delightful holiday story that made for a perfect read while snowed in from the current Christmas Eve blizzard fussing about outside my window.  [image]The Lion, The Unicorn, and the Donkey as illustrated by Rosalind MacCurrachThis is short and sweet, and while it is a bit text heavy with a tale that might go above the heads of younger listeners, it has enough magic for them to endure through it and still enjoy the cute story. Winterson is a huge fan of Christmas and while there is a lot of organized religion trauma from their upbringing, Winterson always manages to unlock the magical spirit of the season in whimsical ways that explore the joy and the mystery of the season. I appreciated the artwork here as it presents Mary and Joseph with more accurate dark skin instead of the pasty white folks that used to be the staple of nativity illustrations in my childhood, and I very much enjoyed that the angel is depicted with bright, flowing red hair. Fans of Winterson’s earlier novels will recognize the significance as red hair is a common motif for the important characters or love interests in their stories. It is short and cute, with plenty of magic such as the donkey being touched by an angel to later discover ‘my muzzle had turned as gold as a trumpet that proclaims another world.’  [image]In Christmas Days, Winterson writes that the text for this story was written in ‘straight through one night, too unhappy to sleep’ following a split from her partner in 2007. Winterson was living in the Writers Room at the famous Shakespeare and Comapny Bookstore (‘a novel in three words,’ the founder, George Whitman, said of the name to his store which he also called ‘a socialist utopia masquerading as a bookstore.’) that December and was using writing as a way of coping with loss. ‘I am the donkey,’ Winterson says of the creature in this story who proclaims ‘if He is to bear the burdens of the world, He had better be carried by me.’ We can easily see the metaphor for carrying the burdens of grief and forging oneself anew in solitude. Winterson also speak on this in the novella Weight, a retelling of the Atlas and Heracles myths where she writes ‘having no one to carry me, i learned to carry myself’ and confesses to having ‘an Atlas complex.’ It is always enjoyable to see how much of themselves Winterson filters their stories through, and even in this brief nativity story we see Winterson working through personal emotions in a way that feels productive and we all benefit from.This was fun and I’m excited to make this a holiday tradition to read every Christmas Eve.‘I lift up my voice and I bray and I bray, for memory, for celebration, for warning, for chance, for everything that is here below and all that is hidden elsewhere.’  [image]...more",Notes are private!,2,104,1,not set,not set,"Dec 24, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/21402638-the-lion-the-unicorn-and-me

I find humans dull except in grief.’Grief is a natural response to loss, yet it is something we struggle with giving space to and processing as a society. This is particularly prevalent in Western societies—often criticized as being death-denying cultures—where we push death aside, relegating it to hospitals and hospice care, finding corpses to be grotesque, and correlating death with failure. This makes grief all the more tricky to navigate, when mourning seems to have a quick expiration period before returning to the office and “normal” life is expected despite the old “normal” being a concept forever shattered. Perhaps we all could use a little help, and in Max Porter’s hybrid novella, Grief is a Thing With Feathers, we have Crow who comes to a newly motherless nest to aid in the grief process. Written in poetic form and chock-full of references to poet Ted Hughes’s Crow: From the Life and Songs of the Crow, the story is told rotating between Crow and the perspectives of family members simply named Dad and the Boys. While occasionally is feels like in avoidance of being too much the novella comes across as not enough, Grief is a Thing With Feathers dives into grief and examines how the non-linear process affects a loving family coping with the horrible loss of a beloved mother and wife.‘Grief felt fourth-dimensional, abstract, faintly familiar.’The poetic quality of the novella breaks down barriers to move freely between inner thoughts and impressions and outward conversations in a swirling cavalcade of perspectives. The father, Dad, is a Ted Hughes scholar working on a book about the poet when his wife is tragically taken from them and sends him into a spiral of emotions. ‘She was not busy dying, and there is no detritus of care, she was simply busy living, and then she was gone.’ While he copes, his young sons are also grief-stricken and feel their father slipping away into his own recovery zone. Enter Crow. Crow is a mythological creature ‘ who is stronger than death,’ as Hughes had written in his crow poetry, whos appearance is ‘suggesting constant readiness for violence with / his posture,’ and who only finds humans interesting during their stages of grief. He is here to guide them through. It is a moving novel, one that shakes you up and makes you consider grief, and has even been adapted to the stage.  [image]Cillian Murphy in the stage adaptation of the novel.This book is a really moving meditation of grief. What is grief, the man asks, to which Crow responds ‘It is everything. It is the fabric of selfhood, and beautifully chaotic. It shares mathematical characteristics with many natural forms.’ We see Dad wrestle with it, we see The Boys wrestle with it, we see Crow encourage and jibe them during it all. There are gorgeous passages in this novel that capture the feelings of longing and grief, something Max Porter is familiar with as a grief counselor and, as he said in conversation with The Guardian, the journey of The Boys is based on his own passage through grief when his father passed when Max was young.’I missed her so much that I wanted to build ahundred-foot memorial to her with my bare hands. Iwanted to see her sitting in a vast stone chair in HydePark, enjoying her view. Everybody passing couldcomprehend how much I miss her. How physicalmy missing is. I miss her so much it is a vast goldenprince, a concert hall, a thousand trees, a lake, ninethousand buses, a million cars, twenty million birdsand more. The whole city is my missing her.’To all this, Crow simply responds ‘you sound like a fridge magnet,’ never allowing anyone to get too bogged down in their grief and taking themselves overly seriously. But this novel is a reminder that grief is never a simple task. ‘You were done being hopeless’ says late in the novel when Dad is beginning to repair his life, ‘grieving is something you’re still doing.’ Grief isn’t linear, it is raw and messy.’ Moving on, as a concept, is for stupid people, because any sensible person knows grief is a long-term project. I refuse to rush. The pain that is thrust upon us let no man slow or speed or fix.’It is a good reminder that grief is something we carry with us, live with, and that it isn’t shameful to have these emotions long term and honor the memory of what we have lost.‘We miss our Mum, we love our Dad, wewave at crows.It’s not that weird.’Much of the novella is inspired by the work of Ted Hughes, which also figures into the book along with poems by Emily Dickinson (the title itself being a play on her poem Hope is the Thing With Feathers). The free verse mimics the form of Hughe’s poetry, though it does often read more like prose with line breaks at convenient length rather than ‘being a poem’ so to speak. Which is fine, as this is more of a hybrid format than anything and really adds to the effect of the book. Though having discussed the prose with some friends on here I will concede it is more spectacle than substance. Hughes comes into play several times, such as the Dad having his first romantic fling since the death of his wife with a Sylvia Plath scholar, and largely draws on his work Crow: From the Life and Songs of the Crow which dealt with his grief following Plath’s death. Here’s an example:Crow Blacker Than EverWhen God, disgusted with man,Turned towards heaven,And man, disgusted with God,Turned towards Eve,Things looked like falling apart.But Crow CrowCrow nailed them together,Nailing heaven and earth together-So man cried, but with God’s voice.And God bled, but with man’s blood.Then heaven and earth creaked at the jointWhich became gangrenous and stank-A horror beyond redemption.The agony did not diminish.Man could not be man nor God God.The agonyGrew.CrowGrinnedCrying: “This is my Creation,”Flying the black flag of himself. Hughes is a poet surrounded by grief and made it a frequent topic of his poetry, though it should be noted he was fairly problematic and abusive, and this book gives him a lot of space in an uncritical way. Hughes had many affairs and abused Plath—her diaries show this contributed to her suicide—and his later partner, Assia Guttmam (who is easily the best translator for Yehuda Amichai, including my favorite version of my favorite poem of his that is also just a favorite poem in general: A Pity We Were Such a Good Invention) would also commit suicide and murder her and Hughes’ child after learning of his many affairs. Though if we are being critical, it is only fair to mention Plath’s work has been criticized for her use of racist metaphors and tropes as well as appropriating Jewish narratives. So Hughes is a person surrounded by grief but also was the reason for a lot of grief, which makes sense to have him be an inspiration for this work but the loving, caring relationship between Dad and Mum here was not the case in his life. Separating artist from art is something everyone has their own comfort level with, so take all this as you will. ‘Perhaps if Crow taught him anything it was a constant balancing. For want of a less dirty word: faith.’There are some very lovely moments in this book, and several members of my bookclub mentioned this helped them understand and process grief in their own lives. I was particularly moved by the notion that ghosts don’t haunt the present but return to the warm memories of their past to linger. Grief is the Thing With Feathers takes wing and brings the reader through emotionally fraught subject matter to remind us, as the epigraph by Dickinson reads ‘that Love is all there is; / Is all we know of Love.’ It is occasionally more bold expressions than actual depth, but I enjoyed the way it encourages embracing emotion and discussing grief in a way that young children would process it. A quick punch of a novel that will leave a sting.3.5/5‘I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOU I LOVE YOUand their voice was the life and song of their motherUnfinished. Beautiful.

In this case, you unpack a sucker punch of feelings straight to the heart and we are all better for it. Claire Keegan’s Foster is such a book, being taut and economical in Keegan’s pitch perfect prose but delivering an emotional resonance far surpassing its brief 80pgs. Originally published in 2010 in Ireland where it garnered awards and school curriculum reading, Foster has finally arrived on US shelves, no doubt aided by the success of her recent novella, Small Things Like These, which was nominated for the Booker Prize this year, and the film adaptation of this book. I found Foster to be even tighter and more succinct, which was to its benefit though Small Things was fantastic itself, and this novella manages to say so much in all the unsaid moments. Thriving through a story taking place beyond the grasp of the pre-teen girl who narrates the story, Foster is a tiny, bittersweet masterpiece that captures the aches and living and comforts of love all set against a lush Irish landscape.‘“I try to remember another time when I felt like this and am sad because I can’t remember a time, and happy, too, because I cannot.’Foster is a simple enough story, a young girl is sent to live with distant relatives for a summer while her mother is pregnant with yet another child and the short time together builds a deep emotional resonance in the lives of the girl and the Kinsellas who take her in. While it is a tight and succinct novel, Keegan depicts gorgeous landscapes and has an ear for dialogue that brings this story to life and makes you feel like you are with them as they run to the Irish sea or play cards amidst the laughter of the night. While there are only a few passing scenes of domestic life—a shopping trip, life around the house doing chores together, walks through nature and a wake—a whole world of emotions explodes from every sentence, even if the narrator can’t quite corral them into words. ‘I have learned enough, grown enough, to know that what happened is not something I need ever mention.’There is a beauty in the way Foster exists most in awkward spaces, in the silences between words, the space between dark and light, or between understanding. ‘Everything changes into something else,’ the narrator observes, ‘turns into some version of what it was before,’ and we are met with frequent references to the world around her in moments of flux. This is a very loving household, though one that values both openness and knowing when words are not necessary. Mrs. Kinsella is upfront about this from the start: ‘‘Where there’s a secret,’ she says, ‘there’s shame – and shame is something we can do without.’’This seems to contrast with the narrator’s home life, one we are lead to assume has landed her here because the father drinks and gambles too much and they have too many mouths to feed than they can afford with another on the way. We also have Mr. Kinsella’s thoughts on not always needing to speak:’‘You don’t ever have to say anything,’ he says. ‘Always remember that as a thing you need never do. Many’s the man lost much just because he missed a perfect opportunity to say nothing.’’Better to be quiet than be a fool. Though this is also reflective of the novella itself and how so much understanding is in the unsaid. Much of this is built through the perspective of the narrative that is attempting to recount ‘things I don’t fully understand, things which may not even be intended for me,’ and written only through how she is able to comprehend the world around her. There are cute flourishes such as the narrator mentioning Mrs. Kinsella asking for ‘Aunt Acid’ at the pharmacist (presumably antacid) and other misreadings that no attention is called to and brings the narrative voice alive. It is a massive success and sticks the emotional landing through the dramatic irony that we are watching the narrator just on the cusp of understanding while ourselves knowing how her heart will inevitably crack open when it sinks in deeper in the time after the novel has concluded.The idea of silence, however, also plays into the political backdrop of the novel and the culture of silence that permeated Ireland during The Troubles. The wrong words, or any words at all, could land you on the wrong side of the violence. Midway through the book there is a brief conversation about a hunger striker who has died, reminding us of the violence lurking within the idyllic landscapes of Ireland and Kinsella questions if he has earned being well fed while people are starving for freedom. 'A man starved himself to death but here I am on a fine day with two women feeding me.' Of course this also juxtaposes the girl's family and her starving sisters and asks us if they deserve to go without due to the sins of their father. Perhaps some of the darkest aspects of the book go in silence as well, only hinted at—Kinsella teaching the girl to run the very specific distance from a house to a road, her bed wetting and avoidance of her own father seem to possibly imply an abuse that is never vocalized.‘He looks happy but some part of me feels sorry for every version of him.’There is a tender, sore spot at the center of the novella that is only addressed briefly and directly once, but the bruise is felt throughout. The Kinsellas are a loving family now without a child, trying to do best by the girl now in their care while also trying to not resent her family who have many children growing up without care. This novel drifts dreamily through the summer towards an inevitable end and a final paragraph that is certain to tug your heartstrings into tears. We see the girl being as much a gift for growth to the Kinsellas as they are for her, with the girl observing ‘I feel I have her balanced,’ about Mrs. Kinsella. In a scene ripe with symbolism, the man is only able to find her footprints to retrace home and jokes ‘You must have carried me there,’ though this is the sort of joke that reveals a deeper emotional truth about their attachment. My heart skipped a beat when, looking out over the sea, he points to the three lights in the sky and says that earlier there had only been two. 'There, the two lights are blinking as before, but with another, steady light, shining in between.' The imagery is beautiful.'My heart does not so much feel that it is in my chest as in my hands, and that I am carrying it along swiftly, as though I have become the messenger for what is going on inside of me'I can’t stress enough how beautiful and emotionally charged Foster was for me. David Mitchell has compared it to Anton Chekhov which isn’t wrong, as each sentence feels carefully crafted and chosen in construction of this sturdy and succinct little story that has a power as deep as books thrice it’s size. Keegan has an ear for dialogue and a gift for perfect sentences that feel like squeezing an ocean from a stone and Foster is a miraculous novella of the ways love can creep in and fill our hearts.5/5‘As soon as he takes it, I realise my father has never once held my hand, and some part of me wants Kinsella to let me go so I won’t have to feel this. It’s a hard feeling but as we walk along I begin to settle and let the difference between my life at home and the one I have here be.’**Update: Finally watched the film adaptation— An Cailín Ciúin (The Quiet Girl)—and it was absolutely wonderful. I cried again. Shoutout to my partner finding it online as it’s not in the US yet. Great performances, they change Mr Kinsella at the start a bit but it builds nicely due to that, and I loved that it’s mostly in Gaeilge. The interpretation of the final scene is great and I like how it shows the duality of the final line.

The one album you‘It was like a S.W.A.T. team kicking out windows inside my head.’We all have that one album we knew intimately in our teenage years. The one album you knew every word, wrestled with every lyric. The one album you could hear even the notes deep in the mix inside your mind when you thought of it in silence. For me that album was Neil Young’s Rust Never Sleeps, an album that sent me on a lifelong journey of guitar playing and harmonica blowing, but for teenage Roger locked away from all he loves in a mental health facility in 1985, that album was Black Sabbath’s Master of Reality. Who is the master of your reality musician John Darnielle of the Mountain Goats asks in his novella, Master of Reality. Who controls what you think and do? Who decides what is real? Raging against the nurses and doctors and feeling hopeless without access to his tape collection, Robert pens his thoughts on his treatment and favorite music in the journal he is made to keep. Darnielle creates an nuanced and layered story that is part music criticism and part introspective mourning for a lost adolescence and spins it out in a way that really speaks to the sore spots inside us all. The magic of this story is the way it focuses on the way the music makes Roger feel, being more a catalog of emotional resonance even when band biography comes up. It’s about what Black Sabbath meant to him. Swinging hard, yet peppered with humor and infused with a deep empathy for those who struggle through this world, Master of Reality is an engaging novella that fans and even complete strangers to the band—such as myself—will find to be a moving meditation on the power of music to heal and give hope.  [image]Black SabbathWhile I’ve never been a music biography reader, I’ve always been curious about the 33 ⅓ book series where the submission call was to write about your favorite album in a literary way. I was thrilled to finally read one when this became our bookclub read for December, even more so as I am a big fan of John Darnielle’s band, The Mountain Goats. I’ve seen them several times and their lyrics often speak to me. I’ve avoided his novels, worried if I didn’t like them enough it would spoil that magical spell his songwriting has had over me, but I was pleased to say this only made me appreciate him more. As a former nurse on a psychiatric wing in a hospital, Darnielle writes from the heart and dedicates this book ‘to all the children to who I ever provided care, in the earnest hope that your later lives have brought you the joy, love, and freedom that was always yours by right.’ It makes me pause and consider that the Gary (‘fucking Gary’) to whom Roger is writing—and raging against—may in fact be party Darnielle himself, conflicted over having been a player in a mental health system he critiques. Either way, the emotions feel authentic and hit hard here.‘I don’t do sports, but with Ozzy I feel like I understand the concept of the home team crowd.’For Roger, Black Sabbath and Ozzy speak to him in a way where ‘it’s like, I know that dude,’ and because ‘only Black Sabbath sounds like exactly what my friends and I might have done if we’d had the equipment.’ Darnielle certainly empathizes, having recorded his early tapes after his shift, mostly solo, wanting the equipment for a full band and fuller sound. But this also approaches the way musical idols in our youths are often people we want to be like, or feel like they would hang out with us. He acknowledges that even Ozzy wasn’t the character he played on record and stage, and considers ‘how important it can be to really be free to pretend.’ He sees Ozzy as someone like him, troubled but wanting so badly to keep going and make something of himself. ‘That’s why Black Sabbath are special. They aren’t rags to riches. They are just rags. All they have is themselves, but that’s turned out to be enough.’ We all hope that we can be enough.What works so well is they way the story focuses on the feelings bestowed by music, the experience of it all. Darnielle captures his own message that ‘it’s not emotions but the aftereffects of them, or a memory of them, or imagining what it might be like to really let them out.’ Interestingly, at one point he pairs the phrase that Roger ‘lost control’ with his outburst being a way to ‘assert some kind of control,’ and in a way this reflects the loud, chaotic music: it is a highly choreographed chaos of sounds and letting out the emotions is how the musicians and listeners find a way to feel in control of them. I enjoy how he doesn’t put the music all on a pedestal, criticizing Ozzy’s voice at times, admitting his lyrics ‘sounds like he’s saying his piece before he really thought it through,’ and even admitting he dislikes 3 songs on the album. It’s all really heartfelt and honest, and it really works and is infectiously in awe of the band. I’ve never been a fan, and even appreciating these songs in a new light won’t make it enter frequent rotation of listening, but even so this book really took hold of me.‘The real message the hidden message is that we are the ones who are making better days.’The hospital is written as a threatening place that is more about restraint than aid. Roger knows his music helps him. The music ‘pulled me gently out of real life and transported me somewhere else, which was what I felt like I needed most in the world.’ Without it, he spirals. The second half of the novella, written 10 years later in diary entries sent to Gary again (‘fuck you, Gary’ reflects on the irony that his music was looked down upon because of the dark themes and imagery. The hospital pushed religious overtones in everything and Roger writes incredulously ‘Ozzy was one of you guys! He was on your side the whole time, but you wouldn’t even listen to him to find out!’ It’s a rather beautiful dive into the lyrics, which he sees as redemption, giving oneself to Jesus, finding hope in the darkness:‘Peace, peace, peace, happiness, happiness, happiness. That was the message that Master of Reality came to spread….But some of us who are desperate to find this message end up finding it in places where the tones are really dark and the images are explosive and scary, and when we say that we found the secret of love in some sticky lightless place, we get punished. Which ends up happening a lot of times, because we keep digging around in the places where we know love is…we learn not to mind getting punished if we can just keep what we found on the way to the punishment.’It is a tragic tale, one where the punished come to only find purpose through punishment, only feeling alive through pain when they so badly want to feel joy. There is a solidarity with people who feel that way here, all set against the backdrop of 1980s State Institutions that seem to swallow young souls up forever in a maw of darkness kept hidden from the world. ‘So I felt sad for you,’ Roger writes to Gary, ‘because you haven’t ever stood in the shadow of a volcano and lived to tell about it.’ His hardships have made him stronger and able to appreciate the life he has left to live, bearing scars that show the harsh journey to be where he is in the second half writing in 1995.‘I’m 26, but I’m not ready for m 16-year-old self to be dead.’The aspects of grief and mourning in this novel are gripping. Roger mourns the lost years of adolescence, stuck inside a State Institution until he finally turns 18 and is thrown out to fend for himself without many resources. By reading his old diary and listening to music, he is trying to recapture that 16 year old emotion but finds it eludes him. ‘Maybe that younger person died when he became this older person, and now when I’m feeling his emotions and sharing his rage, I’m really just mourning his death.’ Music is a shortcut to dredging up old memories and feelings. With some songs I can taste the air and weather of the day it first meant something to me. It is a eulogy to time now gone, and Darnielle captures this in introspective tragedy through Roger laying his past self to rest, buried inside him with a funeral dirge of metal guitars fuzzing alongside the hard rhythm of a drum.‘So we look up to Black Sabbath—to what we remember of them, in my case. Even after we’re grown up, we do. Always.’Short but powerful, John Darnielle’s Black Sabbath excels at capturing the feeling of a favorite band. Wedding music criticism to a harrowing story of surviving your own mental health and a system that doesn’t seem to be helping, this is a stirring novella that will have you getting out your headphones and revisiting the songs that speak loudest to you. Music can heal and comfort, it can excite you and make you dream big, and often I find it is the closest thing to a magic spell we get in this world. Darnielle understands this, and his depiction of it will rock the stadium of your heart.3.75/5...more",Notes are private!,0,94,1,"Dec 22, 2022","Dec 22, 2022","Dec 22, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2286938.Master_of_Reality

I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future. The Spirits of all Three shall strive within me. I will not shut out the lessons that they teach.’Perhaps the ultimate Christmas story, Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol has captivated hearts and minds each holiday season since it’s release in 1843. And what says Christmas quite like using the fear of death to sway a wicked, rich man into opening his eyes to the need for community, for sharing burdens, for using our brief time amongst the living to uplift one another instead of shackling others to debt and misery in order to enrich ourselves at the cost of all that is good and beautiful. Though it is not his death that shakes him up most, but seeing the effects of his actions and learning that empathy is the best path forward. This story is as festive as a tree freshly adorned with lights and has canonized itself as a holiday tradition in the great collage of seasonal influences. Dickens harnesses the joyful mystery of the Christmas season as a searing message of kindness, empathy and rebirth, placing a damned soul on the precipice of his legacy of ruin and causing an introspective trauma with enough blunt force to shatter the ice around his heart and open the possibilities of shared love. We all have our ghosts that haunt us—usually they don’t kidnap us from bed on Christmas Eve to rub our noses in the filth of our making to wash ourselves clean, but this does remind us maybe it could happen to you—and Dickens reminds us all to live better, live for each other as well as ourselves, and to give in to the spirit of the holidays.‘There is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and good humor.’I have to thank my good friend Kenny for inspiring this read as it is his holiday tradition to have a Dickens December. Which gets me thinking about tradition, especially as I’ve been reading impressing upon the bliss of tradition. The holidays are a magical time because it is a season where it is socially acceptable across all fronts to emote. Sure it has become mired in capitalist steroids of expensive gifts, flashy displays, and all that jazz that pissed the Grinch off enough to rob everyone bare, but underneath it all is a tender heart of compassion and expressions of love that we can return to in our hearts. Traditions are like the shortcut to that passion. This story, for one, is a tradition in my family as I am quite fond of The Muppet’s Christmas Carol, and the power of this narrative to have the pulse of the holidays is part of the reason it has become a tradition for many and has been widely adapted. I grew up on the Alastair Sim version as well, finding it a bit dusty for my childhood tastes but now watching it is a quick route to warm memories. Same with It’s A Wonderful Life, a movie I couldn’t stand as a kid because it was SO long but now I can’t go a December without watching (while usually getting good and wine drunk and shouting along with every line, sorry everyone). It isn’t Christmas for me until my sister and I shout “Merry Christmas Bedford Falls!” to each other in bad Jimmy Stewart impressions and then retort “And a happy new years! In jail!” But enough about Christmas traditions.This book is a pretty awesome punching up at society. Dickens shows the poor as downtrodden and oppressed, but captures the whole “salt of the earth” elements to show that their resilience and love shines bright enough in the darkness to make this whole tragicomedy of living worth the endeavor. Tiny Tim is a symbol of purity, like a Job unquestioning in his faith of goodness despite the hardships of his reality. And then we have Scrooge. The bad boss, the guy you cross the street to avoid, the man with nothing good to say and only greedy hands that will take your very soul if they can grasp you. Sweet Bob Cratchet labors away for him in the dimly lit office because ‘darkness was cheap, and Scrooge liked it,’ a line that makes me chuckle having worked in a factory where ‘being cold in winter is cheaper’ was a legit response to asking if we can get some heat. Dickens takes dead aim at the ruling elites and, through the help of three ghosts, shows that their money loving ways is a crash course to spiritual ruin and a legacy of shame. Not to make this sound bleak, because Dickens is quite funny in fact. Also this book still feels wildly relevant in theme and message all these decades later. I love that this is a ghost story. I love the infusion of horror with Christmas, I think it puts us closer to life by remembering death is part of the deal. I like the theory that the lamp gasses in the Victorian era lead to the telling of ghost stories because everyone was high as shit, which isn’t that different from my own Christmas Eve’s with friends. So carry on that tradition. But it also gets into how rather frightening a lot of religious messaging on hellfire and damned souls can be. Which has never been something I’ve enjoyed about religion but when you mix it with Christmas and tell a story like this, the holiday acts like sugar to sweeten it all into a pretty charming festive treat. Dickens story lives on, and understandably so, because it grabs our primal fears of death and public opinion and asks us to be the better version of ourselves. Because in doing so we can uplift those around us. Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, Happy Holidays to all my friends. Thanks, Dickens, this was a magical read that put me in some high holiday spirits.

Fairy tales are like tiny doorways into the realm of vast possibility, where even a poor kitchen maid can become queen, a king become a beast, and a tiny seed can grow to a magical land amongst the clouds. ‘In the end, a fairy tale is nothing more than a sense of hope,’ the narrator remarks in Roshani Chokshi’s The Last Tale of the Flower Bride. They are something that ‘whispers to us that we are extraordinary’ and teach us ‘the dragons can be killed’ as G.K. Chesterton once said of fairy tales. However, ‘hope lures and tricks’ and as folklorist warns, in fairy tales ‘the sweetest tongue has the sharpest tooth.’ Drawing from an eclectic mix of folklore and fairy tales, such as the story Blodeudd from which the novel gets its name, Chokshi crafts a gothic tale of menace and mystery like a modern day fairy tale where everything is either a sign of possible magic or horrific gaslighting sending the characters either to riches or ruin. With gorgeous prose that glistens like both a treasure and a threat, The Last Tale of the Flower Bride is a deeply distressing tale that perfectly captures the spirit of fairy tales while examining the lies and hopes we believe, the way wealth can shelter a person even from a sense of humanity, and how there is always a story lurking, ready to ensnare us in its jaws.‘If you combed through enough fairy tales, untangled their roots, and shook out their branches, you would find that they are infested with oaths. Oaths are brittle things, not unlike an egg…there is one thing they all share: they must be broken for there to be a story. Only a shattered promise yields a rich, glittering yolk of a tale.’I devoured this book in a single day, realizing it had bewitched my mind and trapped me in it’s pages as if to devour me in return. Here is the story of a poor professor of fairy tales, named only the Bridegroom, who manages to wed the unfathomably wealthy and mysterious Indigo Maxwell-Casteñada, a fellow lover of tales, who promises him unending happiness and security if he vows to never pry into her past. But when a dying aunt brings them to her childhood home, The House of Dreams, dark secrets reach out to be heard and offer their own rewards if they are unearthed. Will it be a tale like Melusine, where a broken vow runs off the beloved forever, or more akin to Eros and Psyche where a betrayal can be overcome. Or will the secrets be irreparably horrifying? It is a novel where the less you know going in, the better as there are some well executed twists and the whole book is dripping in foreshadowing, so I’ll avoid spoilers but continue at your discretion. The book rotates between the perspective of the Bridegroom and Azure, a teenage girl who was so close to Indigo they believed they ‘shared a single soul’, and as the stories weave we feel the past catching up to the present like a scream brewing in our throats.‘Our illusions weave roses around us, and when we try to escape, we are met with thorns.’What really makes this story work is how seemingly effortlessly Chonski transports us into the realm of fairy tales. The prose moves with a dreamlike quality to it, shimmering as if capturing the power of moonlight and enticing us further into the dark recesses of the novel. And dark it is, much more than I ever expected, and while this novel disturbed me in many ways I was delighted for it all the while. The tone overwhelms you like an enchantment and her offkilter descriptions and observations build an eerie, gothic atmosphere you can get lost in like a fog. Birds take to the sky ‘like a scream given shape,’ skies are ‘the color of scraped eggshell’ and the House groans, gurgles and sighs in all sorts of uneasy personifications. Much of the novel makes you second guess yourself, wondering if we are entering a realm of magical-realism—and, truthfully, wanting to believe in it for the sake of some of the characters—because the reality could be too horrifying. ‘The secret to everlasting love was fear. Fear tethered love in place. Without the terror that came from imagining a life without your beloved, there was no urgency in loving them.’Fans of fairy tales will enjoy the frequent allusions and analysis of the genre, with the story stitching together the spirits of many tales such as the aforementioned tales, Bluebeard, and both the German tale Allerleirau as well as the English tale Catskin which Allerleirau is often retitled despite the differences between the two. Catskin will also become a nickname Indigo gives to Azure, much to Azure’s resentment of it, like a prophetic role to fill in order for the two girls to achieve their belief that they are magic beings waiting until the time is right to be returned to their kingdom. In this way the story is able to play with a multitude of tropes as the girls attempt to prove themselves and abstain from becoming too much of this world, fearing they will be a ‘Cast Out Susan’, referencing Susan Pevensie who was denied access to Narnia for liking boys and makeup too much.‘“She looked like the nostalgia that settles in your ribs at the end of a story you have never read, yet nevertheless know.’Much in the way fairy tales are easy to relate to and superimpose the messages over our own lives by using archetypal characters and narratives, The Last Tale of the Flower Bride sort of superimposes itself over the genre by incorporating many recognizable archetypes to reconfigure them for its own purposes. ‘Fairy tales are the purest and simplest expression of collective unconscious psychic processes,’ Jungian psychologist Marie-Louise von Franz writes in The Interpretation of Fairy Tales, ‘they represent the archetypes in their simplest, barest, and most concise form.’ In this way it is able to dive directly into a sharp, psychological horror by striking at our purest fears of selfhood. Is the person closest to you betraying you and is your whole identity being built around a lie? ‘Because of her, I believed I was someone who deserved things, someone for whom destiny itself had fashioned a cozy, star-lined pocket,’ Azure confesses about her lifelong attachment to Indigo,practically living with her in the House of Dreams and isolating herself from peers to be in inseparable duo their classmates fear. However, as the Bridgegroom warns ‘this is why fairy tales are dangerous: their words sneak into your veins and travel into the chambers of your heart, where they whisper of your exceptionalism…but we are not exceptional.’ Indigo is as much of a mystery as the central narrative mystery, and Chokshi is excellent at delivering a sense of unease and often revulsion around her. ‘[Indigo]was like peering straight into something primordial and desperate, where the inscrutable space between stars had once birthed myths and gods, built palaces of story and scripture in which human doubts found a place to rest their weary brows.’Chokshi is at her finest when crafting how Indigo figures into both their lives, brilliantly balancing our uncertainty of her as a rose or a thorn, and like a window more than a body or—in the tropes of fairy tales—a path into the wilderness that may lead you to fortune or fatality. ‘Hallowed ground was not always a fixed, physical place. Some sacred spaces were indivisible, the taking of them an endless communion that ate of your flesh, drank of your blood, and its grisly alchemy fused itself to the very skin of your soul so that no matter where you were, you would never be without it.’Location is always key in fairy tales, and The House of Dreams and the Otherworld—the secret hangout of the two girls—is like stepping into the familiar mystical places of any fairytale. Transformation is always a critical component of fairy tales and locations like a castle or forest tend to provide the catalyst for them. As Jack D. Zipes teaches ‘no one gains power over the forest, but the forest posses the power to change lives and alter destinies.’ In this way we see Indigo and Azure paying tribute to their Otherworld and reading signs in the ways the trees move or the roots reach for them as indications of their transformations. ‘Indigo and I were the Otherworld, and the Otherworld was us, and for as long as we lived, it would live too.’ Adding to the uncertainty if there is something magical actually happening is the House, another space of transformation, which each character seems to recognize as responding to them and encouraging them on their paths. It is more like a living, breathing character than a house, often reminding me of a warmer and welcoming version of the house from The Haunting of Hill House, or is it all in the character’s minds? This is contrasted with Jupiter’s house—Azure’s lecherous step-father, another classic fairy tale archetype—which ‘had never been a home at all to her but a mouth—a place that chewed and swallowed and fed on her so well she couldn’t even see how deep she was buried in it’s belly.’ These spaces that seem to hunt, seem to dream, seem to offer up possible rewards if only we are pure of heart and motives to grasp our destinies. Or, like those who throw back their shoulders and square up to the minotaur, will they quickly learn they were not exceptional as they feared they weren’t right as their life is pulled from their bodies.‘Until that moment, my life has been about the collecting of knowledge. Now the House of Dreams was tempting me with a different ending if only I would do it’s bidding…Thus, like all the fair-of-face fools before me, I rejected my knowledge and I believed’Few books have unsettled me quite like this one. For those who appreciate trigger warnings, the list is long with this one and the rampant manipulation and gaslighting is intense. As fairy tales are often cautionary and critical of power and obdurate establishment, Chokshi brandishes her literary blade at those who’s wealth becomes a fortress protecting them and trampling others underfoot. Even judicial systems can bend to their will, and Chokshi provides a startling character development on how those who want for nothing and know they hold power over others lose a feeling of empathy towards those in their grip. People are playthings or pawns, and someone with a vast imagination and expertise at narratives can construct entire realities for the sake of manipulating others to serve them. As Aunt Hippolyta, also named Tati (a woman rumored to have witchcraft-like powers but is reduced to serving Indigo and the estate not unlike her namesake from Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night's Dream who symbolizes the repressed power of women) warns ‘people like her can remake reality as they so wish, but we are forced to live in the lands they leave behind.’ We see this all the time in the world, the wealthy living out fairytale fantasies globetrotting and wanting for nothing while others work themselves into the grave in order to uphold the systems providing wealth for the few and debt for the many. And fear is often used to keep them in line.‘But she saw something in me. Something that turned her kiss into a knife that cut me free from the dark.’For how often the term “dark fairy tale” gets thrown about to mixed results, The Last Tale of the Flower Bride is one that truly deserves the claim. ‘Every fairy tale has blood flecked on its muzzle,’ Chokshi writes and this story has teeth and horror lurks everywhere for those brave enough to look. I especially enjoyed how much this story captures emotion, especially allowing the Bridegroom to express emotion (which I think is possibly why he is a sympathetic character who is ushered onto a quest to test him instead of some toxic character swallowing emotion away). As dark, eerie and threatening as any quest in these tales of wonder and possibility, and with glittering and gorgeous prose to propel us down the path, Chokshi weaves a tale that will seep into you and transfix you to keep turning the pages. 4.5/5‘Too often the truth of a memory lives not in the mind but in the heart, in the subtle and sacred organization that makes up one's identity. But it is a tender place to reach, and I am wounded by touching it.’...more",Notes are private!,2,249,1,"Jul 06, 2023","Jul 06, 2023","Dec 20, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61150759-the-last-tale-of-the-flower-bride

A hard hitting collection that centers on concepts of endings, Choi blissfully incorporates the aesthetics of science fiction into her poetry, crafting landscapes of the now as dystopian wastelands that make this read with a rather epic sense of urgency. ‘Grief's a heavy planet’ and Choi takes us through the horrors of the past and present and asks us what the future will hold. There are difficult questions poetically posed, moving between global scales wondering if it is already ‘too late for the earth / to yield anything but more corpses,’ to more personal examinations of identity such as when she asks ‘am I the colonization or the reparations? (she adds later ‘I choose to be the reparations’). The World Keeps Ending, and the World Goes On is a powerful collection of socio-political criticisms, and examinations of history and cultural identity that delivers lines that will knock you right over and others that will tug your heartstrings with such an urgency that you cannot, and should not, look away.‘Sliced from bone, my lifeHung like a jaw—faultless. AndUnforgivable.’The weight of history hangs heavy in each of these poems, moving across atrocities of war—such as the dropping of the atomic bombs which figure into several poems—mass refugee and immigration movements, and even into the present with poems addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. While the amalgamation of traumas and troubles is often thought to be leading towards an impending apocalypse, Choi asks us to consider that it has already happened.She shows how, for many marginalized peoples, they have been already living in a post-apocalyptic world for decades, such as in the title poem:‘[T]he apocalypse beganWhen Columbus praised God and lowered his anchor. It began when a continent was drawn into cutlets. It began when Kublai Khan told Marco, Begin at the beginning. By the time the apocalypse began, the world had already ended.’In an interview with Alyssa Lo from Catapult, Choi says ‘it might be helpful to remember that the apocalypse happened a long time ago and that our people have survived it and have been surviving it for many years,’ and thus the collection, which builds itself around the title poem, looks at the sadness but also at the ‘unthinkably inventive modes of survival’. The ways in hardship people conclude ‘Why not / smother doubt to save the family / we’re responsible for.’The poem With Mouths and Mushrooms, the Earth Will Accept Our Apology, for example, nods to the matsutake mushrooms that were the first living thing to come from the devastated landscape of Hiroshima after the bombing. Here, Choi contemplates the renewal of the natural world, with or without us, after humans have wrecked our environment. It reminded me of the hope in the final paragraph in Cormac McCarthy’s The Road where the plant life begins to slowly return and ‘hummed of mystery.’ The hope in this book takes hold even through all the darkness.‘O beasts of fortune, I am loved sweetest by the horrors of blood,By my own, and by ours, blessed root rot, by ours.’Choi looks back to her ancestors frequently in this collection, as guides and as touchstones to moments in history. ‘Sometimes I wonder how long I’d have to run / to reach the last generation where one of us felt loved,’ she writes, feeling part of a lengthy legacy that has endured history but has been scarred in the process, ‘I come from a short line of women / who were handed husbands as salvation from rape.’ The legacy of misogyny and homophobia lurks in all the corners, even language as in one poem Choi looks at how the term ‘comfort woman’—Korean girls who were kidnapped and put into sexual servitude for the Japanese army during WWII—was a phrase to comfort the perpetrators of sexual violence, linguistically softening the connotation of their actions where the term ‘sexual slavery’ would have shed more truth. ‘Whatever helps you bear the day // whatever sweet, what touch’ Through it all, however, Choi builds a hope for the future as a way to bear the legacy into a new light, and hopefully we will all survive the many apocalypses that are to come.But what sort of legacy are we leaving? In Protest Poem, she considers the ‘as-yet-unbuilt museum/ of what we had to survive / to make paradise/ from its ruins,’ what artifacts of today will we leave behind, and what will it say of our present. In Science Fiction Poem, she lists the many minor ‘dystopias’ of our daily living, causing us to look around us in a new framing and acknowledge what we endure. This can be comical, such as in another she considers how with the world heading towards political and environmental disaster, we look away and fill our time with online shopping. Though one of her most powerful poems, Field Trip to the Museum of Human History, addresses the legacy of police brutality where ‘In America, there were no greater / protections from police than wealth and whiteness.’ Partly inspired by The Dispossessed by Ursula K. Le Guin, Choi herself has been a prison abolition advocate and it makes its way into the hope that is central to her work.‘You don’t haveTo believe in something for it to startle you awake.’With poems that either grip you by the throat or the heart, The World Keeps Ending, and the World Goes On is a dazzling and chilling collection of poetry. The dives through history are dark, but Choi never leaves us without a hint of hope for light at the other end of the tunnel.4.5/5...more",Notes are private!,3,220,1,"Dec 20, 2022","Dec 20, 2022","Dec 20, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60147181-the-world-keeps-ending-and-the-world-goes-on

Or perhaps this is some Who Saturnalia? I love this book. It is one I have read or seen so many times I can recite it from memory, which I have done so on several occasions. Those who remember my time as Barnes and Noble storytime leader can attest. There are slight differences between the book and animated film (red vs black thread, and the book doesn’t contain whimsical Who-world presents) though I’ve found that the changes in the animated actually read much smoother and I see why the alterations were made (the “it was merry!

All of the aboveE. None of the aboveREADING COMPREHENSION (the actual )I’ve come to really enjoy non-traditional narratives and the way stories can come out of something beyond a point A to B plotline. Postmodernists made an art of using lists to tell a story through the collective relationships between the items, what sort of person would you imagine based on the litany of things in their pocket, for example. Zambra tells tiny stories through the form of multiple choice questions and is able to extract an incredible amount of emotional resonance—and humor—through the endeavor. You can read these questions simply at face value, but there is a story to be found within them all and the relationship between answers. This question makes a good example:40. Students go to university to _____, not to ______.study, thinkstudy, protestdrink, thinksleep, diebuy, window-shopOr this one:41. And if they have any _____ left, that’s what _____ for.Energy, sports areHope, reality isIllusions, the void isDissent, the cops areNeurons, crack cocaine isThere is a lot to read into through the questions in this book. Zambra’s experience as a poet is evident with the ways he can make language so malleable and contain multitudes in the abstract. Like the way a father writes to his son in one of the ‘Reading Comprehension’ section (a section that allows Zambra to fold a few short stories into the book) ‘neither your mother nor I were talking about you. We were talking about you, but only to hurt each other through you.’ These question are always so much more than a simple reading of what the words say. You can often detect that there is often more than one “correct” answer in the question. This also nudges the unspoken (unwritten?) acknowledgement that the test only has one “true” answer and this implies a forced “truth” imposed by a governing body. Which is a pretty hard-hitting statement about the forced ideology under Pinochet’s violent regime, a sentiment that Zambra explores further in several stories in My Documents. It is most evident in question 74 when all five multiple choice answers read ‘You weren’t educated, you were trained.’There is also a larger statement being made that no matter what you choose, it all leads to despair anyways. Much of Zambra’s works is a critique of his home country of Chile (critical yet hopeful), a focus that often leads to comparisons with Roberto Bolaño along with their shared love of poetry, and Zambra paints a bleak outlook of the ways Chile can oppress and crumble the citizens just trying to get by. Especially when speaking out was a quick way to be 'disappeared'. ‘You share your fragility in silence, like a sacrifice,’ Zambra writes, though as he wrote in Not to Read, ‘writing could be a beautiful and noisy way of keeping quiet.’ His works are his rebellion against the past, but, as he shows here, the legacy of Pinochet's violence and neoliberalism still haunt Chile beyond the lifespan of his rule.Not that this collection is bleak. Multiple Choice is often quite humorous and heartfelt, and also works as a nostalgic investigation of his school years. I particularly enjoyed the “story” about the cheating that would occur during the exams and how ‘thanks to cheating, we were able to let go of some of our individualism and become a community. It’s sad to put it this way, but cheating gave us a sense of solidarity.’ That sense of solidarity with the oppressed is alive through this whole odd book, including a story where Zambra “occupies” the voice of one of Chile’s political executioners, robbing the powerful of their power. Which, in turn, is sort of the aim of this collection, robbing the resonance of the exams of its power and turning it into a spoof of itself.It is, admittedly, a strange book to address. Think of it like short stories or, better yet, a poetry collection. The latter especially as the relationship between words is a major focus and the ways tweaking a sentence can explode into various meanings and intents. Ultimately it amalgamates to a collage effect depicting life under Pinochet, but also the fallout after (utilizing failed marriage metaphors) and a few short stories directly addressing legacy and lineage. If you can appreciate the abstractions, there is a lot to enjoy here.This is a good book to have on stand-by, to pick up and read a little bit at a time and enjoy the collected impression made through the experimentation with the standardized test format. Or just blast through it, it is a short read. A fun little book, Zambra’s Multiple Choice is a great read.7. What are your impressions?

Truth be told, as an adult I’ve always struggled with Christmas for a variety of reasons—a big one likely being years and years of holiday retail where the holidays meant good fun for others but endless long shifts, an overabundance of (cranky) customers, and exhaustion—but to celebrate the holidays with a Wintersonian Christmas in 2022 was just the thing I needed to be filled with joy. The book consists of 12 stories for each of the 12 days of Christmas, each followed by a little essay by Winterson complete with a holiday recipe from her or her friend’s personal repertoire, and I set about reading one per day leading up to Christmas eve. It was the best reading idea I’ve had in years. This is a lovely collection where Winterson provides a variety of tales, from somber reflections on the season to corny hallmark-style romance and—my personal favorite—ghost stories that help tap into the magic of the holidays. I even made many of the recipes provided and enjoyed them! ‘Christmas is about community, collaboration, celebration,’ Winterson writes, ‘done right, Christmas can be an antidote to the Me First mentality that has rebranded capitalism as neo-liberalism,’ and across 12 days of tales and feasts, we too can share in Winterson’s infectious love for her favorite holiday.‘Why are the real things, the important things, so easily mislaid underneath the things that hardly matter at all?’When I read these last holiday season I left notes for each day but never came around to providing a proper , so I shall correct that finally. Besides, if you start now you can can enjoy this book right up until Christmas day. I love that Winterson cheerleads an enjoyment of holidays—2023 saw the release of her collection of ghost stories just in time for Halloween, Night Side of the River—as its so easy to get caught up in our lives and miss the bliss of leaning in to a celebration. The essays here are just as fun as the stories, and I love her research and undeniable passion for bringing christmas into the hearts of the reader   [image]I have successfully made and drank the mulled wine. Would recommend.Below are my original notes for each section of the book going day by day. I have kept portions of them if anyone wants to follow along, but I also wanted to keep them for myself.Winterson begins trimming the tree of this holiday treat with a lovely introduction on the historical context of the Christmas season. ‘Christmas traditions are a bizarre mix-up of influences,’ Winterson explains, ‘that is part of their charm.’ There is an overview of how our modern perspective of the holiday draws from many cultural traditions, often as a way for the christian narrative to co-opt and override pagan beliefs, and aspects of all that were absorbed are still present today. She covers how the dates are important in this way, with Christmas being positioned over Saturnalia, which also allows a symmetry of Jesus’ conception and crucifixion having a nice symmetry in March.This lack of ‘purity’ of the holiday celebrations led Puritans to ban Christmas in New England in 1659 (repealed in 1681) and Cromwell banned Christmas in England from 1647 until 1660. Winterson looks at how the Reformation ‘demoted’ Mary, mother of Jesus, and how the Catholics retaining Mary’s status was part of the impetus to ban the holiday, along with it being ‘too pagan in its origins…too party time, too pleasurable.’ Those who have read Sexing the Cherry will be familiar with Winterson’s antagonistic stance towards the Puritans. This also leads to an interesting discussion on the tradition in myths for ‘marvelous mortals’ being born of ‘one divine and one human parent,’ something we see with figures like Hercules or Helen in Greek mythology and Winterson also notes The New Testament was written in Greek, allowing the Gospels to ‘fix their Messiah in the roll call of superheroes with a divine dad.’ Of course, returning to Mary, the virgin birth is also key, with Mary’s purity and submissive nature being a departure from fertility rites and Goddess-worship in non-Jewish or non-Christian beliefs.After some more discussion on the history, Winterson ends on a lovely message of hope and warmth, reminding us to not get caught up in the commercialization and capitalist ploys of Christmas, noting that the Christmas story begins with demand for money with Caesar Augustus putting out a decree to tax all the worldDay 1:This was an adorable and moving story of a couple so caught up in the hectic nature of the holidays and the stress of familial relations that they have been pushing one another away. A possibly magical child locked in a corporate Christmas display brings them through a magical night with lessons about unburdening yourself, the joy in renewal, and coming together. Is it Santa or a burglar with a sweet ride? Will the narrator learn to notice the things in life that make worth living, or will we always be bogged down in distractions. Funny and heartwarming, this was a great start to the collection.Day 2:Possibly my favorite story of the whole collection. The holiday magic is on full blast in this whimsical story that riffs on the Frosty the Snowman tale. A young girl, Jerry, and her friend build a snowman together that comes alive one night and brings Jerry on a late-night adventure. There is some excellent snowman lore about how they come alive to those who believe and how the power of love is a magical force. ‘Every year we meet again, because once we come alive, we live forever,’ SnowMama says, ‘you see us melt, and we do, but that’s us moving on, to the next place where it snows.’ But this story is also about the magic that comes from helping others, and how an act of..well, straight up theft can help turn Jerry’s mother’s life around. It is a very whimsical tale, one that seems like it could verge into corny territory in lesser hands but Winterson pulls it off. ‘Love is a mystery and that love is the mystery that makes things happen,’ Winterson tells us, and by retaining the mystery this story allows us to re-experience the wonders and magic of childhood. I found this story very moving and enjoyed the way it subverts gender expectations a bit. A whimsical and touching story about the power of aid and that ‘love comes back.’Day 3:For today’s tale, Winterson treats us to a spooky tale of a haunted house during a snowstorm. I’ve always loved that ghost stories for Christmas were a tradition in Victorian England and I think we need to resurrect this. Winterson does well here with and makes me hope she gives us a haunted house novel someday. Dark Christmas has some creepy moments, a tragic past, and is a lot of fun with the way a nativity set figures prominently in the horrors. A good one to read on a dark and (snow)-stormy night, remembering that ‘We are lucky, even the worst of us, because daylight comes.’Day 4:Here we have Sam, who’s parents vehemently did not celebrate Christmas, being coaxed towards holiday magic by his friend Lucille and learns that ‘home is where you make it.’ This was a charming holiday-enemy-to-holiday-lover trope and the holiday spirit has only intensified with each day of reading these.. Oh and this story also references Fairytale of New York which you absolutely MUST listen to at least once in December (bonus points if its on Dec. 24th).‘It’s about making your own raft of time. Your own doorway into Christmas.’Today, Winterson treats us to their smoked salmon and champagne recipe, and with 2 hours still left of this work shift right now let me tell you I want some champagne. She discusses how ritual is important and what the ritual of this recipe means to her, as well as always listening to the same BBC Christmas Eve program every year:‘Ritual is a way of altering time, by which I mean a way of pausing the endless intrusion of busy life…The reason I suggest making some of this small meal yourself is because ritual has an anticipatory relevance – we prepare for it, practically and psychologically; that’s part of its benefit.’I like how much through these stories and essays Winterson focuses on not rushing, not letting the distractions of life bogging us down, and just enjoying the things that really matter. Day 5:I really loved today’s story. It is a retelling of the legend of the bride who, while playing hide-and-seek as is a Christmas Eve tradition, gets locked in a chest only to be found years later decomposed in her wedding dress. This is Winterson so there are many more nuances to the story, like what if the man had only married this young bride to produce an heir because he really wants to marry his cousin? I love how the maids subvert their master’s plans and this becomes a story of women helping women escape patriarchal oppression. It has a killer ending, literally,Day 6:Today’s story revolves around the trope of the Christmas wish, and centers the story with Irish culture where faeries are a big part of cultural lore. It’s a bit light but cute, with O’Brien finding much of life too exhausting and spending a lot of time resenting the commercialization of Christmas which is a common theme in this collection. A chance wish from a fairy, a cool lesbian fairy at that, seems wasted on something actually surface related like the commercialization she dislikes but ends up being a confidence boost she needs. Another Christmas romance in the books.The recipe allows us more insight into Winterson’s relationship with her adopted father. Mrs. Winterson was such a larger than life personality that he was mostly relegated to the fringes in Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit though we learn more about him and his second marriage in the memoir. Winterson returns to themes of forgiveness here in a few gorgeous passages:’I am sure that if we can find reconciliation with our past - whether parents, partners or friends - we should try and do that. It won't be perfect, it will be acompromise, and it doesn't mean happy families or restored bonds - there is often too much damage, too much sadness - but it might mean acceptance and, the big word, forgiveness.’Reconciliation is a big theme in this book, and Winterson long journey through addressing her childhood is always in the periphery in her books. Wishing Winterson a Christmas season of peace and love.Day 7:The moody, eeriness of today's story was a perfect companion for this gray, moody day. Winterson returns to a holiday ghost story narrative where, like in Dark Christmas, a house spills the tea of its violent past through apparitions and nightmares. The stronger of the two, I quite enjoyed the added tension between the narrator’s friend and her husband, who has always been jealous of his wife’s close relationship with the narrator. This is reminiscent of the Roman myth of Iphis with a woman raised as a man who chooses to wed another woman, but homophobia can lead to violence and thus we have a ghost story to tell here. This also reaffirms to me that Winterson should write a haunted house novel someday.I absolutely adored the recipe essay today as it dives into the history of the famous Paris bookshop Shakespeare and Co. and it’s legacy amongst writers. Including Winterson, who also lived there in Winter 2007. It is a beautiful tribute to the place and it’s literary past, and Winterson provides the recipe to their Chinese Dumplings, providing a quick tale of when the first time they served them at a Christmas dinner amongst writer friends, there was almost a medical disaster when the person who prepared them didn’t know what an onion was and served it to someone with allergies. Today was certainly a high point in this collection.   [image]Shakespear and Co. was a popular hangout for writers, including Allen Ginsberg (second from left).Day 8:Today began with Christmas Cracker, a goofy story about a stray dog that finds himself through a comedy of errors being one of the prizes at a charity event. 'This is the children’s charity party,' Winterson tells us, 'rich parents have paid a lot so that their children can help children in need without having to meet any of them.' Its a bit of a dumb story, but cute and fun enough. I did enjoy how much she dunks on the rich though. The three kids seem to have been influenced by Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and to let you know she thinks all the people there are shitty they keep name dropping Putin and Trump as personal acquaintances. Light but charming enough.Day 9:'I never sought to avoid the overwhelming fire of existence. It’s not death that’s to be feared. It’s eternity. Do you understand?' I love Winterson doing horror, this is now the third story and I can see how they would really make it sing in full novel space. This one was fun, I spent a lot of my teenage years skiing and do enjoy the almost eerie space of a snowy hill that this story captures. It has a good historical legacy attached: I liked the incorporation of Arthur Conan Doyle and the real mystery of George Mallery and Arthur Irvine who perished on Everest. Chilling, especially with a snow storm headed my way.Day 10:Okay today's story was really fun and taps into the vibes of children's fiction (this one has an affinity with Dahl's Matilda) with an evil orphanage director and the children being freed by oppression through a magical army of frogs. It is whimsical and charming and worked better for me than Christmas Cracker though the two are somewhat similar in tone. It's got a big children's holiday tv special feel to it and was a nice way to start the day.The essay/recipe today focused on the idea of memory in a really lovely way. 'I don’t make New Year resolutions,' Winterson tells us, 'instead I have a psychic clear-out. What would I prefer not to repeat?' Winterson discusses how much baggage we carry in our memory, but also how we should honor both the happy and sad memories and allow ourselves to feel, allow ourselves to atone for self-hurt, and be mindful of the memories we make. It is a lovely reminder, also the Cheese crisps sound delicious.Day 11:This was a lovely story, a nativity story that Winterson would later have illustrated and made into a children’s book. To save space you can read my thoughts on it hereThe recipe essay was fascinating and discusses how March 25th was always the legal New Year though we celebrate it on Jan 1st (oooooh, so thats why the end of the fiscal year is later). I enjoyed learning how Britain did not adopt the Gregorian calendar until 1752 and had been 11 days off from everyone else for awhile because of it. This is also a lovely reflection on Winterson’s childhood and Mrs. Winterson using a comb and paper to sound the trumpet for the apocalypse so the family could practice what to do. I think I am going to borrow Winterson’s tradition of burning the calendar on the new year, seems fun.Day 12:‘Have yourself a merry little christmas…’ sings Judy Garland as Winterson’s christmas collection ends and I sat sobbing because this final story is beautiful. A really moving story about moving on after the death of a loved one, who appears to his partner for a final christmas eve farewell. Winterson is always at the top of their game when speaking on love and this story hits hard, reminding us that we should honor the past but also that ‘love is not a prison. You can’t be imprisoned inside your love for me.’ I also love any story that includes a line in all caps saying ‘GO TO THE FUCKIN’ LIBRARY’ so thats also a win. What a lovely way to end the collection, ‘thank you for making me happy.’The essay is a nice discussion on reversals and how that figures in fairy tales and the nativity story. Reversals disrupt and make anew, she says. ‘[W]e could do with more stability in our outward-facing lives so that we could risk disruption to our inner lives; our thinking, feeling, imaginative lives,’ Winterson writes, which I feel is a good response to how instead of a world on competition and consumerism valued stability, creativity and the human spirit. I also loved Winterson’s note at the end, telling the story of their final Christmas with Mrs. Winterson (which went awkwardly) and a discussion on why they love christmas and how it gives us ‘space in our lives for imagination and reflection.’ This was such a fun way to spend December and I loved reading these every day.------------------------------------------------------Hope you all have a happy holiday season.

Okay, I’m guessing these aren’t your holiday traditions, that is of course unless you live in the small village of Dikanka where strange things are afoot in Nikolai Gogol’s comedic holiday classic The Night Before Christmas. This long-beloved Ukrainian folktale has been adapted into numerous films and operas and is still widely read as a holiday story. It is a humorous little romp; a jolly novella with multiple plotlines and shady motives colliding on Christmas Eve in slapstick fashion. The various threads all seem to revolve around the local blacksmith, Vakula, whos artistic talents in painting as well as smithery have offended the Devil himself, and on his last night before descending into Hell the Devil decides to wreck a little havoc. Will Vakula win the affection of the most beautiful girl in town, or will the Devil and Solokha, the witch with whom he teams up for a night of devilry, thwart his life and stir unrest in the peaceful village full of lusts? This was a delightful read and the darkly comical story certainly put me in the holiday spirit.  [image]The holiday spirit of ripping a pipe while riding a devil across the sky. Art by Igor Grabar.The Night Before Christmas is collected in Village Evenings Near Dikanka and Mirgorod, it is also published as a standalone novella in translation by Anna Summers, and works quite well as a single sitting read as snow flutters outside your window on a dark winter’s night. But is it the evening arriving early that has made it dark or have you crossed the Devil and he has stolen the moon from the sky as he does here…The story begins with a stolen moon and snowstorm concocted by the Devil and witch as they cackle above the carolers. We get dropped into a wonderfully tangled web of motivations, with the Devil hoping to thwart Vakula’s advances on Oksana, a girl with a beauty ‘to such a degree that no less than a million kisses could have done it justice,’ by creating a mess of weather that will send her father back home to catch the pair and banish Vakula. But the witch, who happens to be Vakula’s son, has designs on Oksana’s father for his wealth which she’d rather for herself instead of her son if he were to wed the girl. But nearly every married man in town comes to call for the witch, and we get a parlor comedy of visitors hiding from one another reaching such a silly fever pitch it is hard not to chuckle. There is also Oksana herself, who enjoys leading the blacksmith on though her coldness drives him to despair. Through a comedy of errors and lusts these characters bump across Christmas Eve, making a mess of everything. Will the devil reign supreme or will love conquer all on this holy night?‘Gogol was a strange creature,’ wrote Vladimir Nabokov, ‘but genius is always strange.’ This story is a screwball comedy of village manners and folklore run amok, something one would expect from the short story master—often considered the first “great” of Russian literature—with facrical tales that mock government authorities, social critiques, or chilling stories such as Viy that play with myth and morality, all of which influenced writers like Fyodor Dostoevsky, Mikhail Bulgakov and Franz Kafka. The Night Before Christmas uses his pastoral settings to create something like a spoof of peasant culture, a technique of Gogol’s that Russian Literary scholar Victor Erlich referred to as ‘stock characters’ akin to archtypes that, along with the unfolding of events are drawn from the ‘traditional repertory of the Ukrainian puppet theater.’ Elements such as these are the heart of the folktale vibes in the story, with pretty one-dimensional characters that serve the story, although it can be unflattering stereotypes and women are not represented very well usually serving as outlets for sexual desire (Oksana’s whole concern is with her own beauty and Solokha seemingly beds all the men who come to call for personal gain) or simply the shrewd, nagging wife role. Which is…not great. It all does culminate for a reading experience that brings nostalgia for children’s classics however, and the holiday setting sprinkles some magic in.So get your seasonal beverage of choice, cozy up by the fire, and get down with some goofy Gogol. It is a charming little read with a happy ending and it will make the season bright.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,22,216,1,"Dec 13, 2022","Dec 13, 2022","Dec 13, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20893322-the-night-before-christmas

It shouldn’t be here.'I find Stephen Graham Jones to be so endearing and charming. I mean, that seems a weird way to describe someone who writes really unsettling literary horror that has definitely haunted me and made me anxious of every bump in the night but also his conversational writing style is really charming especially as he instill a lot of nostalgia. But I don’t just mean as a writer but as an authorial persona. Have you ever read his acknowledgements pages in his books? They are so sweet and full of personality. And the notes sections in his short story collections are just as engaging as the actual stories (I LOVE how often he admits he writes a story because it actually frightens him). So when I found out he had put out a new story this year, Men, Women, and Chainsaws, I HAD to read it as soon as possible (you can read the whole thing here). It was the perfect way to start my day today, and this intense and supernatural tale of revenge has all the hallmarks of what makes Stephen Graham Jones’ stories so irresistible.  [image]The story artwork is great and wonderfully represents a key sceneThe story is constructed with a lot of homages and references to classic horror, most notably the film Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 and the actress Caroline Williams, with a photo of her atop an old rusted Camaro figuring prominently into the story. Something I truly enjoyed was the way you can feel Jones’ excitement about all the references built into the story, which in turn makes you excited about them (even though I really know nothing about cars and have never seen the film, but it’s like how you get excited about things your friend likes because you are just happy to see them happy). Jones builds the story through Jenna’s narration, often having you witness events without much context for the motivations. Yet. That context comes, and the slow reveals create a really palpable tension.Jones knows horror and he often uses expectations of the genre to his full advantage. There is a Christine-like car haunting going on here (this is a story where the less you know going in the better so I won’t spoil much) that makes you question if the haunting is real or only in Jenna’s head. Knowing it is horror, you kind of play along but there are a few moments where you can feel him winking at the reader like, oh have I fooled you, or is there more to come? It was delightful. It’s also always satisfying to read a revenge tale against an abusive asshole, so that was fun.'He was trying the door handle again and again, but, unlike every girl in town, it wasn’t submitting to him.'Men, Women, and Chainsaws is a quick read but makes for a really spooky good time. It all leads up to a pretty wild final scene, one that with plenty of surprises.

The title story snagged the Hugo, Nebula a Locust Awards and each story in Bloodchild (I read the expanded edition that contains two additional stories to accompany the original stories and essays) probes concepts of connectedness, imprisonment vs freedom, and violence, often with human and alien species walking a tightrope of fragile co-existence. We are guided through the stories by the late-great Butler herself with an afterword to each tale for added authorial context and insights, as well as two essays that examine her journey of being a writer. These are stories that drop you right into the world without much explanation, allowing you to pick up context as you go, which is a technique I really appreciate as being a bit disoriented adds to the overall effect. Bloodchild is an exciting collection that opens the mind to confront age-old moral and political quandaries of existing alongside one another in speculative scenarios. ‘Free will coupled with morality has been an interesting experiment. Free will is, among other things, the freedom to make mistakes.’Fears of subjugation and violence permeate the stories in Bloodchild. On the surface, the cosmic scale of these stories reduces us all to animals feeling cornered, but this is countered by the emotional portraits and deeply empathetic narratives Butler enacts to resist dehumanization. This goes for both the humans and alien species. Stories such as Amnesty or even the title story reference political treaties and interspecies governmental interaction where both the humans and aliens are attempting to maintain a peace despite factions that wish to exterminate the others. In Amnesty, the aptly named character, Noah, recounts her imprisonment with the alien species (known to humans as Communities) but warns that ‘most of the time, the people actually hurting me were other human beings.’ This is an alarming turn in the story that recalibrates everything:’The only difference between the way they treated me and the way the aliens treated me during the early years of my captivity was that the so-called human beings knew when they were hurting me…It mattered more than I know how to tell you that this time my tormentors were my own people.’It is effective, and even in stories of fear over alien visitors, it reminds us how much humanity has often been it’s own greatest enemy. In several stories we learn of people ‘quick enough to take advantage of any chance to exercise a little power, get a little pleasure by making another person suffer,’ or, as in the story Speech Sounds, a brilliant tale where speech and writing has gone missing, we must wonder ‘how many more of him were there—people willing to destroy what they could not have?’ Chilling. ‘You will help humankind to survive its greedy, murderous, wasteful adolescence. ’In a world where there is so much fear of the Other, Butler asks how can we survive if we can’t even save ourselves from ourselves. In The Book of Martha, a woman is tasked by God to save humanity from itself, to ‘help it to find less destructive, more peaceful, sustainable ways to live.’ There is a call for people to reverse climate destruction as humans are ‘well on the way to destroying billions of themselves by greatly changing the ability of the earth to sustain them,’ and that rallying behind hatred and lust for power will be our own undoing.‘It’s too easy to follow bad but attractive leaders, embrace pleasurable but destructive habits, ignore looming disaster because maybe it won’t happen after all—or maybe it will only happen to other people. That kind of thinking is part of what it means to be adolescent.’Reading this had me thinking God was asking Martha to find a way to avoid a future such as the one she imagined for us in Parable of the Sower. It is a fun story, one that also calls into question ideas such as how whiteness has been unfortunately centered in societies (Martha, a Black woman, sees God as an white man looking like Michelangelo’s Moses because she sees what she thinks she should see), examines concepts of free will and stubbornness, and is a story with a lot of imagination. This one, like several of the others, read like thought experiments given space to run free more than a forward-moving plot but hat is half the charm to Butler’s stories. As Noah says in Amnesty, ‘I want to make them think,’ and that is exactly what Butler makes us do.There is a Biblical undercurrent in a lot of these stories. Having the woman who will guide humanity from destruction to a working future with the aliens in Amnesty be named Noah is pretty on the nose but cool. Butler tells us that she was encouraged early in life to read the Bible by her mother (perhaps not unlike Martha who’s mother wants her to be good and ‘to her, “good” meant “religious”) and found the themes in them fascinating. ‘When I began writing,’ Butler says, ‘I explored these themes in my own stories’ and the story Next of Kin is written as an acknowledgement of the many moments of incest that occur in the Bible. Honestly, one of the best parts of this whole book is Butler talking to the reader in the afterwords. It’s very enlightening and charming, such as when she admits many elements come from things that actually frighten her (this reminds me a lot of Stephen Graham Jones who’s story notes I find so endearing because they are often like “yea so this shit scares me so I wrote about it”). I found the Biblical elements also helped give these stories a very epic feel, nudging towards very cosmic meaning that also seemed very ancient in spirit.‘Do you want someone else telling you what to do with your body?’Returning to the ideas of subjugation, the concept of imprisonment is rampant through these stories. Fear of imprisonment in tiny societal bubbles of safety from the “wilds” outside their gates, fear of imprisonment in alien captivity, imprisonment in your own role or even imprisonment in your own flesh. The second story, The Evening and the Morning and the Night is one of her best and follows a young woman who has a genetic issue that has Othered her in society. Butler says she wrote the story ‘wondering how much of what we do is encouraged, discouraged, or otherwise guided by what we are genetically,’ and created a genetic disorder (Butler tells us she based it on a combination of Huntington’s disease, phenylketonuria, and Lesch-Nyhan) that will inevitably lead her to feel so imprisoned by her own skin she will impulsively try to tear and eat it all off her own body one day. The story nudges at ideas like model-minority stereotypes, such as in this society people with the disease are thought to be excellent scientists because they are more motivated to study biology. Concepts of free-will and subjugation arrive here when a path towards progress to live “normally” involves a pheromone that feels too much like mind control to one of the characters, and Butler makes us consider ideas of freedom and sacrifice and what we are willing to balance in order to help others. ‘You have a choice.’This last idea is best explored in the title story, Bloodchild, and it is easy to see how this novella picked up so many awards. It is, in part, a coming of age story where the narrator, Gan, matures through looking at a larger portrait of society beyond just his role in it. This story is very textured, involves many of Butler’s major themes, and though she insists it is not about slavery readers will easily make parallels to how refugees and immigrants are subjugated in, say, the US. Butler presents an interesting gender role reversal that subverts gendered expectations, such as the multi-limbed alien T’Gatoi representing traditional masculine roles while being a woman and the young boy Gan representing a traditionally feminine role. By being the child bearer, Gan is also seen much like property, a concept that Simone de Beauvoir spoke on at length about how women have become subjugated in patriarchal societies. This is an intense story revolving around a rather graphic “child birth” sequence where Gan witnesses firsthand what is in store for him in order to bear T’Gatoi’s children, but ultimately it is a call for vulnerability and emotional agency and openness. Butler shows that only through equity and respect between partners can there be real trust and fruitful relationships.‘They do whatever they want to us, and instead of killing them, all I can do is ask them for a job!’At the heart of many of these stories is a critique on the way people are valued by their labor and use. In the title story, Gan is valued because he can be used for breeding and is therefore given a larger portion of the eggs they are fed to keep them strong and resist aging. In Amnesty, Noah is valued above most because she can translate. Often we see that people are oppressed, kidnapped or otherwise enslaved because they are useful. The Communities in this story run tests on people and when they die this is another way they learn how human biology works (very Nazi medical experiments vibes here). ‘But what’s important to them is not what they think of our intellect. It’s what use we can be to them,’ Noah says. And as long as humans can continue to be useful, they won’t be destroyed. Yet they can’t be free either. There are two essays included in Bloodchild as well, both of which deal with Butler’s life in reading and writing. She discusses being a Black woman writing sci-fi when ‘nearly all professional science-fiction writers were white men,’ as well as why she believes sci fi (and afrofuturism) can be so empowering to Black people.’What good is any form of literature to Black people?...At its best, science fiction stimulates imagination and creativity. It gets reader and writer off the beaten track, off the narrow, narrow footpath of what ‘everyone’ is saying, doing, thinking—whoever ‘everyone’ happens to be this year.’I see the influence of Butler in writers like the incredible N.K. Jemisin and it makes me all the more thankful for Butler. She encourages writing, discussion how she was obsessed with it: ‘Obsession can be a useful tool if it’s positive obsession. Using it is like aiming carefully in archery.’ Butler also offers advice, and amongst the basics like read, write, and edit, she tells us:‘forget inspiration. Habit is more dependable. Habit will sustain you whether you’re inspired or not. Habit will help you finish and polish your stories. Inspiration won’t. Habit is persistence in practice.’The main takeaway from her lessons on writing is simply to keep doing it, keep believing in yourself and, always, ‘persist.’I truly had a great time reading Bloodchild. It is very imaginative and plays with a lot of really interesting themes and ideas, often putting a fantastical scenario up in order to explore issues that affect us in the present, everyday reality. These are quite varied, even with a few that don’t have quite a sci-fi setting, and offers a good look at her range. It is also a quick read, but one that will have you turning some of the stories over in your mind for awhile to come. A great experience.4/5‘Down through history, in myth and even in science, we’ve kept putting ourselves in the center, and then being evicted.’...more",Notes are private!,0,162,1,"Dec 11, 2022","Dec 11, 2022","Dec 11, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61343601-bloodchild-and-other-stories

Transition is central to many of these poems and Yanyi, a trans man, chronicles change with heartbreaking yet empowering clarity. There is a surreal quality to these poems, with lives slipping into swirling metaphors and a disarming feeling of weightlessness even amidst poems pinned down by heavy emotion. Perhaps it is because Yanyi can adjust the mundane into a quiet explosion of emotions with a succinctness of prose. I’ve been dazzled for days now. Here’s one I’ve returned to again and again, sending screenshots to friends each time I step back into these words:OnceI admit it.That we were aliveat oncethe same time.That we were connectedto each other.And two mindsmove meas this lifebecomes a story.We were alive,we were free,choosing the hourwithin a moment'sbright precision.There is still that hourwithout a future or a face.I am the hour. I am the place.This poem captures many of the prevailing themes found within Dream of the Divided Field, such as the way examinations of memory become a collision of past, present and future or ‘the past and the present / overcoming one another.’ It creates a unique space for self-examination. ‘The dream is, also, neither the future nor the past,’ Yanyi writes in the titular poem, ‘but a perception of the world through me…’ The body is central to many of these poems, often opening up like a landscape such as in one of my favorite poems Landscape with a Hundred Turns (read it here) that use the metaphor as insight to how a person can contain multitudes. But the body is also a place of transition, of translation (‘to admit / I was the original’) and memory. ‘[B]odies may be monuments, side by side, / enacting what is already a memory,’ he writes in In the Museum, a poem that uses blank space within lines to show the gaps in time as well as the leaps of faith we must make into the future.‘I want to be beautifulAnd a part of this earth.’Yanyi can break your heart with lines as simple as ‘It is a year before we separated. / You were my friend’ closing out a poem. Yet there is an incredible warmth and earnestness to these poems nonetheless. Many deal with difficult topics, such as familial struggles and trans acceptance. ‘I was born a girl and I was born a boy,’ Yanyi writes in one of many instances that probe fluidity. However, we see how transition can be difficult and how the ones you love can hurt you the most. Take the following poem for instance:Once, you dovethrough iceto provewhat you’d dofor your family.What would I dofor my family?What I ask from disappearanceis that I don’t have to do it again.There is this feeling that being oneself, being his true self, is a rejection of family, of not diving through a metaphorical ice to save someone. Which is tragic, as all he wants is to not disappear, to be himself as he is, on his terms. These poems are rife with examinations of disappearance, such as relationships dissolving into the past and defined now by their absence such as when he writes ‘the bathroom noticed / what else was missing.’ These poems pull the heartstrings, but as much as they can break you they will build you up stronger. For every line that shakes you up such as ‘And I have to live with my love / it is almost more painful than the pain itself, ’ it is balanced with the joy of lines like ‘I woke up with so much love for you / It doesn’t matter where I am.’ Ultimately, it is love that flows into us through this collection.‘As a man, I've learned something of nationhood:the shape of a brook now straddled by a dam, or choked by it.’Yanyi constructs surreal and powerful poems out of precise prose and poignant emotions. These were a treat to read, ones that seemed deceptively simple yet opened up more each reread. At times it seems almost too elusive, but it still connected for me. A great collection to keep by your side awhile, this has been a lovely companion the past two weeks and I am thankful for the beauty of Yanyi’s words.4/5‘When you turned into a hundred rooms,I returned each month as a doorThat opened only one.’...more",Notes are private!,0,87,1,"Dec 09, 2022","Dec 09, 2022","Dec 09, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58133514-dream-of-the-divided-field

This has a fast paced story that feels like well controlled chaos and bright, energetic art that makes this feel bubbly and boisterous. Quick yet with enough subplots and action to feel quite full (it does, admittedly, try to do a bit too much but it’s also setting up a series so I sort of expect that?), Unfamiliar is a cute look at friendship and allowing oneself to be vulnerable, with the characters becoming closer the more they learn about each other and realizing that despite how cruel the world can be, facing it with friends makes it worth it all. This is the first volume of what is shaping up to be a great series and I can’t wait for the next.  [image]Off to find new friendsI told you all I am going to read every witchy YA graphic novel I come across this year, and doing so has been a fountain of joy in my heart. Youtubers may recognize Newsome better by the name LavenderTowne, under which she had a hit youtube channel with her art videos. Her art style, as well as her sense of humor, recalled the animated series Adventure Time for me, especially because this is equally wacky and fun. The art, which is a bubbly gothic style, keeps things moving quite quickly and is a fun medium for this story. Newsome balances her multiple characters and subplots quite well, with Planchette—a kitchen witch—as the focal point around which the narrative revolves and unfolds.   [image]Babs and SunThe basics is that Planchette has moved to be nearer to people like her but discovers her house is super haunted. She enlists the help of Pinyon, the daughter of a wealthy and powerful witch coven who is fearful her magic powers will never come. along the way meet Sun, an overworked girl trying to rid herself of a curse that she believes makes her ugly and keeps people from talking to her, and Babs, a popular girl (also a siren) who became reclusive because wants to be like Sun and left alone by everyone. When they discover they can help the ghosts pass on by resolving their issues, Planchette sets out to help every ghost and reclaim her home.  [image]The character Sun being the employee at every place they go to really charmed me. As someone who worked three jobs at a time for a few years, I certainly related. Also that all her bosses were literal demons, funny stuff. There is a strong labor critique at the heart of this, with violent factory owners, oppressive bosses, and shady dealings for profits. There’s a lot of heart to this book and it is as sweet as it is funny, such as the story of the woman who became a world-renowned detective after her best friend disappeared. Also shoutout to Bab’s cat Marlow, because that is also my cat’s name.This is only volume one, but I will certainly be back for volume 2 and whatever else is to come. This is goofy and amusing and the characters are so lovable, who wouldn’t love this!?4/5  [image]...more",Notes are private!,1,78,1,"Dec 08, 2022","Dec 08, 2022","Dec 08, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60320191-unfamiliar-vol-1

Lovecraft’s The Shadow O‘Where does madness leave off and reality begin?’The eeriness of a small seaside town becomes a tale of cosmic horror in H.P. Lovecraft’s The Shadow Over Innsmouth. The only book of Lovecraft’s distributed during his lifetime, Innsmouth figures into Lovecraft’s Cthulhu Mythos and offers a frightening deep dive into humans caught in the sinister plans of a mysterious species with aims of conquest. Chosen by my book club for our November read as none of us had ever read him before, this is a quick and rather fun book. It does get off to a rocky start, but once the plot kicks in this dives into some truly creepy territory (and, alas, fairly xenophobic and problematic territory as well). There is also a deep fear present of hereditary fate, something Lovecraft himself felt in his own family history. The Shadow over Innsmouth looks at the fragility of humankind amidst the cosmos, ideas of madness versus reality, our growing reliance on technology and explores issues of fate in a story that will have you looking to the sea with trepidation.‘The mere telling helps me to restore confidence in my own faculties; to reassure myself that I was not simply the first to succumb to a contagious nightmare hallucination.’If nothing else, I am glad I have finally read a Lovecraft story, which has been an aspect I really enjoy about being in a book club because it shakes up my reading list with choices by friend’s who I respect. Personally I hadn’t much interest in Lovecraft due to his name being most known for him having been…well, pretty damn racist, which unfortunately is evident in this story itself. While ole H.P. certainly didn’t put the Love in Lovecraft, we have to recognize that he was an influential American writer that still can turn sales to this day (unfortunately for him this wasn’t the case in his lifetime. Moral of the story is don’t be a racist dick). Lovecraft developed the literary theory of cosmicism, which is that ‘there is no recognizable divine presence, such as a god, in the universe, and that humans are particularly insignificant in the larger scheme of intergalactic existence,’ something you see quite plainly in Innsmouth. Cosmic horror often shows how quickly the human race could vanish, such as how the Deep Ones that lurk off the coast could overcome humanity someday. Lovecraft, who drew influences from authors like Edgar Allan Poe, was also a major influence for Stephen King. ‘[Lovecraft] opened the way for me,’ King has said, ‘it is his shadow, so long and gaunt, and his eyes, so dark and puritanical, which overlie almost all of the important horror fiction that has come since.’ I noticed a similarity in the mood setting of the town here with King’s ’Salem’s Lot, and King’s ‘sequel’ short story to the novel, Jerusalem’s Lot published in Night Shift, actually contains references implying there is a Cthulhu Mythos connection. While King's novel It is, according to him, inspired by the story of the Three Billy Goats Gruff, Pennywise as an alien coming to prey on humans while lurking in the deep feels very akin to Lovecraft's mythos and ideas of cosmicism.On the topic of mood setting, I have to admit the beginning of this was a slog. Lovecraft establishes a creepy vibe to the town and its citizens who distrust outsiders, focusing on the ‘Innsmouth look’ of ‘bulging, unblinking, watery eyes,’ greyish skin, a unique walk and a strange attraction to the sea. While effective, the prose is a bit rough and Lovecraft will never use just one adjective when a pair or triple is available, making it feel a bit overwritten. A bookclub friend—shoutout to Carl—mentioned the style does give a whole “ancient text” vibe to the endeavour, which I will concede does add to the overall horror vibes Lovecraft is honing in on. Add a mysterious epidemic that killed half the population and all the churches being replaced by the Esoteric Order of Dagon and you’ve got palpable unease for days. Also shoutout to Greg whole collected some of the best word matchups because he really goes off with ‘bestial Babel’ and I love how the phrase ‘raucous clamor’ trips off the tongue sounding exactly like the noise it describes. ‘Certainly, the terror of a deserted house swells in geometrical rather than arithmetical progression as houses multiply to form a city of stark desolation. The sight of such endless avenues of fishy-eyed vacancy and death, and the thought of such linked infinities of black, brooding compartments given over to cob-webs and memories and the conqueror worm, start up vestigial fears and aversions that not even the stoutest philosophy can disperse.’There is an acute loneliness felt in the town, while it is described as small it seems sprawling as well, and the difficulty grasping the scope makes it all the more menacing. While everyone is excited for technological advances such as the train, Innsmouth is more disconnected because of it as it does not run near enough to them. This probes at a fear of technology as something menacing and scientific advances that can override our societal norms or, like the Deep Ones, eventually rise up to rule us.The secrets of this town are slowly revealed and the narrator, who had previously felt himself better than the locals, finds a personal connection that could mean inescapable doom. The hereditary connections fears draw from Lovecraft’s own life as both his parents were institutionalized (his father when Lovecraft was only 3 years old), and as a child he suffered from extreme nightmares as well as frequent illness. There is a sense of inevitable, horrible fate rumbling forward in this book, a horror we can see but can only embrace as it gets closer. The narrator, in fact, goes from fearful to accepting by the end. And, honestly, the ending to this tale of cosmic woe slaps. It really does go out on a high note.However, on the topic of genetics, Lovecraft has some troubling beliefs that are represented in this book. Reading as an allegory, the idea of an alien race coming to conquer and breed out the population is the root of replacement theory of white supremacist rhetoric, something that was accused of basically any non-white group immigrating to the US and is grossly still prevalent today. Lovecraft despised anyone who was not Anglo-Saxon (and disparages anyone who is not in his fictions), praised Hitler (there are debates over if he did withdraw from support, and he did have a Jewish wife, though only because he said she was ‘well assimilated’), and held a strong classism belief that Anglo-Saxon intellectual elites should rule all populations. So…not awesome. Though from this world-view, you can get a sense how his fiction is laden in fear of the unknown with narrators who perceive the world around them as threatening.‘One night I had a frightful dream in which I met my grandmother under the sea. She lived in a phosphorescent palace of many terraces, with gardens of strange leprous corals and grotesque brachiate efflorescences, and welcomed me with a warmth that may have been sardonic. She had changed—as those who take to the water change—and told me she had never died.’Problematic issues aside, the story is quite fun and the Deep Ones are interesting. There is, of course, the issue that the military decimated an entire town on the word of a person with a history of mental illness claiming sea monsters have corrupted everyone, but just go with it. It is cool as well to see all the fictional towns Lovecraft would revisit throughout his tales, and it was interesting to realize that Arkham Asylum from the Batman universe takes its name from Lovecraft’s Arkham. All in all, I’m glad I read this. It is a bit like Philip K. Dick for me where the story and ideas override the relatively clunky writing, but once the train of plot kicks into high gear, wow does this get creepy and intense. The Shadow Over Innsmouth is an eerie, worthwhile read and makes for a great introduction into the world of Lovecraft.3/5...more",Notes are private!,0,97,1,"Dec 08, 2022","Dec 08, 2022","Dec 08, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13175692-the-shadow-over-innsmouth

Lewis, author of the beloved Narnia series, is a firm believer in the power of myth. By adorning ideas into a story‘You are yourself the answer.’C.S. Lewis, author of the beloved Narnia series, is a firm believer in the power of myth. By adorning ideas into a story, Lewis argued ‘we do not retreat from reality: we rediscover it.’ This is doubly evident in his construction of Till We Have Faces, Lewis’ final novel and the one he considered his best, as Lewis examines many of his theological ideas through a myth narrative, but also allows us to rediscover the joy of older myths such as the story of Cupid and Psyche which provides the bones upon which Lewis builds his story. It makes for an engrossing read that is palatable even for those who don’t subscribe to the Christian mythology that is embedded in Lewis’ retelling. Told from the perspective of the oldest sister, Orual, Till We Have Faces is a moral examination on justice, faith and love, particularly interrogating the dichotomy between selfish versus selfless love as well as divine love. Highly approachable and soothingly written, Lewis’ retelling becomes something far more expansive than the original myth and is a novel that is infectiously enjoyable.‘I have said that she had no face; but that meant she had a thousand faces.’In his essay On Three Ways of Writing for Children, C.S. Lewis wrote ‘I now enjoy the fairy tales better than I did in childhood: being now able to put more in, of course, I get more out.’ I feel similarly, having enjoyed them in childhood but have found my interest and enjoyment reinvigorated with a greater intensity as an adult. There are extensive literary theories and techniques and many have written about the moral and psychological aspects in them such as Carl Jung who believed fairy tales were a way to study the ‘anatomy of the psyche’ and Jungian psychologist Marie-Louise von Franz wrote that ‘fairy tales are the purest and simplest expression of collective unconscious psychic processes.’ Alternatively there is Philip Pullman who believes ‘there is no psychology in a fairy tale,’ and instead it is simple repetition on good and bad. For Lewis, as well as J.R.R. Tolkien, they believed fairy tales point us towards faith, with Tolkien once encouraging Lewis to believe in Christianity because it was ‘the fairytale that is really true.’ While I’m not personally religious, for me I see fairy tale stylings as a great way to fold in social criticisms and other messaging in a way that feels epic and imaginative. I’m included to agree with what Jeanette Winterson once wrote on that matter:’Reason and logic are tools for understanding the world. We need a means of understanding ourselves, too. That is what imagination allows…As explanations of the world, fairy stories tell us what science and philosophy cannot and need not. There are different ways of knowing.’Lewis has always worked in myth and fairy tales—George MacDonald being one of his idols—and even in his mythical world of Narnia we see figures from the Greek myths inhabiting his lands. Till We Have Faces is his most direct immersion in the genre. Drawing from the story of Cupid and Psyche as it is found in The Golden Ass by Apuleius, Lewis sets his tale in the fictional kingdom of Glome in the country Greekland (if you guessed it’s modeled on Hellenistic Greece, you’d be correct). Where in the original myth the older sisters hope to send Pyche to ruin due to jealousy of her, here the tragedy is sparked due to jealousy for Pysche’s love. Told in a first-person narration, Urual’s tale reads as rather confessional, representative of the sacrament of Reconciliation in Christian practices. Written over a span of 35 years, the story also reflects Lewis’ conversion into Christianity, mirrored through the narrator Urual who’s complaints against the gods were Lewis’ own when he began the tale. The second part, written alongside his wife Joy Davidman, affirms his conversion and creates an interesting contrast to his beliefs from his pre-Christian days. Characters such as the Fox, a slave named for his red hair that becomes the three princesses’ teacher, operate within realms of logic and reasoning based in Stoicism, which is juxtaposed with later revelations by Urul which demonstrate Lewis’ belief that ‘Christianity is both a myth and a fact,’ and operates not without logic but beyond it. Lewis is widely beloved in Christian circles (it became evident to me once I was an adult why the Narnia books had been pushed on me so hard as a child), though his theology often draws criticism from these same circles for beliefs such as this (Aslan allowing folks into his kingdom like Emeth who believed in a different god is another Lewis belief I have heard him harshly criticized over). While I’m not really all that into religious messages, I think this novel is still just as enjoyable reading it as a message of self-discovery and positive morality.But on to the story. Lewis reworks the original myth in fun ways, with Aphrodite represented here as the goddess Ungit and Cupid being the Shadowbrute, a god of the Grey Mountain who is purportedly the son of Ungit. It begins similarly, with Psyche being worshiped by the kingdom for her beauty and a belief that she can heal the sick, which leads to her being sacrificed to the Shadowbrute. The tragedy begins when Urual, unable to see and therefore unable to believe in the Shadowbrute’s invisible palace where Psyche has become his bride, convinces Psyche to betray him and is thereby banished from his kingdom. The notion of faith and the importance of believing without evidence is blatant, with the palace serving as a symbol of divine mystery. This is central to the novel and one of Urual’s dominant complaints against the gods (which she refers to as ‘divine Surgeons’) is that they do not speak clearly to mortals. She does not yet see how the ambiguity is key to faith, instead frustrated that it leads to mistakes for which the gods punish them. Her brief vision of the palace—and choosing to disbelieve it—is highly symbolic of how she opts for a selfish, earthly love to have Psyche to herself like a possession. There is a clear juxtaposition in the novel of selfish and selfless love, with earthly concerns making love more of a devouring of one another than anything else. ‘Some say the loving and the devouring are all the same thing, ’ Urual is told. When she is Queen, she sees this as devotion to her is something of a sacrifice, even leading to the death of her military counselor, Bardia, who more or less was overworked right into the grave. Urual is rebuked by his widow who tells her ‘I do not believe, I know, that your queenship drank up his blood year by year and ate out his life.’ Urual eventually realizes that it is she who is the devourer: ‘I was that . . . all-devouring womblike, yet barren, thing. Glome was a web—I the swollen spider, squat at its center, gorged with men’s stolen lives.’Urual is not an unsympathetic character however, and we see how she was shaped by the cruelty of her father and her belief in her own ugliness. The veil she wears to hide her face—symbolic of her cutting herself off from humanity as well as hiding her ‘true face’—is donned to hide her ugliness which can be read as more an unconscious belief in her tormented soul than just physical beauty. You wouldn’t be wrong to raise an eyebrow here, as physical beauty (or lack thereof) being a reflection of the soul can be a bit problematic. There is also the awkward element of Urual being treated more ‘like a man’ by her court because she is not sexually desirable (this is coming from the same author who kind of denied Narnia to Susan for being into boys and make-up). But it does lead to the idea that Urual must embrace her own face because the gods cannot ‘meet us face to face till we have faces’Faces are highly symbolic in general here, with Psyche’s betrayal is that she (through Urual’s direction) attempts to see the gods faces. Mirrors, as well, function symbolically in the story, being used to convince Urual she is not qualified for the god’s love due to her ugliness and she later removes the same mirror as it has become representative to her of her father’s cruelty. ‘I know now, Lord, why you utter no answer. ’Urual believes ‘the case against [the gods] should be written,’ but when the time comes to confront them she hears her own voice in a new way. ‘the complaint was the answer. To have heard myself making it was to be answered. . . . I saw well why the gods do not speak to us openly, nor let us answer. Till that word can be dug out of us, why should they hear the babble that we think we mean?’This becomes Lewis’ way of examining divine mystery as part of the whole point in faith. Divine love is intended as all-encompassing, a giving of oneself bare of the veil of self-deceit, and only then can the gods look upon us ‘face to face.’ Possessive love must be denied, and it is only by accepting and, well, confessing, one’s sins can one be cleansed. It gets pretty religious here, but the message is powerful to embrace ourselves even in our flaws and cultivate a self-understanding to do better and do no harm.This was a wonderful novel, one that it is easy to get lost in as Lewis constructs a world that feels just as magical and engrossing as his Narnia. The title, taken from the line ‘how can they meet us face to face till we have faces?’ was originally intended to be Bareface but Lewis’ editor thought it would sound like a Western. While the editor is probably right, someone should jump on this as a band name. Till We Have Faces has been another fascinating myth retelling in my current obsession with retellings, and one that I have heard all my life cited by others as one of their favorite books. Myths and fairy tales are powerful and can be a lovely way to deliver a message. As Jeanette Winterson wrote, ‘they explain the universe while allowing the universe to go on being unexplained,’ and that notion of retaining the mystery is highly representative of Till We Have Faces and Lewis’ belief in ‘the true myth.’ A book well worth reading.4/5...more",Notes are private!,0,152,1,"Dec 07, 2022","Dec 07, 2022","Dec 07, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29938408-till-we-have-faces

Welcome to witch kingdom Hyalin, a place of intrigue and danger where witches keep the ‘peace’. But Nyneve is uneasy with their ways, having grown up fatherless after he was executed by the guard for being too powerful, and does not wish to join them. Witchy, which began as a webcomic (read it here), is the first of currently two installments in a series that has some expansive and nuanced world-building, creating a fascinating landscape full of history and exciting characters that are a joy to watch butt heads and play out what is shaping up to be an epic story.  [image]Classic moment of letting all the hair out so that it is messy and wild but also beautiful.Admittedly, this one took me a bit to get into. There is a lot of set-up, which is fun, though the whole concept of the length of your hair being the strength of your power…is a bit awkward. Does it stay the same length always? You gather that cutting it is a massive offense, but they burn witches at the steak if their hair is too long, so there seems to be some logistical questions that could be better addressed here. Pushing that aside, this is really fun. The kingdom of Hyalin is inspired by a blend of Asian and Oceanic cultures, which is really exciting to see and the book has a wonderfully diverse cast. We also have queer and trans characters, so bonus points there too. While the art is bright and fun, it isn’t a style that particularly grabbed me and it can be tricky to follow along with at times with the layout (especially layout of dialogue) seeming a little chaotic.I do appreciate the grit this graphic novel has and it does not shy away from difficult themes and conversations. Trauma and military violence are central to the story, and the need for resistance and progressive politics are addressed as well. Witch burnings and book bans give texture to the narrative, drawing connections with current day issues and struggles and allowing readers to consider the implications of them in a fantasy world where we can feel empowered.Witchy is an interesting and fast paced action adventure and I will certainly be back for more. There’s a talking raven, how can you not love that!? It was a bit of a rough start for me but by the time I got to the end I was eager for more and fully hooked on the story, which is becoming more rebellious by the page.

Reading Ali Smith’s Girl me‘Nobody grows up mythless…It’s what we do with the myths we grow up with that matters.’Sometimes the right book finds you. Reading Ali Smith’s Girl meets boy felt like a book I was always meant to encounter, a book I, as a reader, had come together in all the ideal ways for this book to fully immerse itself in my heart and soul. ‘Some stories always need telling more than others,’ Smith writes, and for me this is certainly one of those. Using the story of Iphis and Ianthe as the heart of the story and spirit of it’s themes, Girl meets boy becomes a gorgeous meditation on fighting for freedom from the subjugation of social constructs and narratives built for the purpose of gatekeeping power, challenging the modern myth-making of corporate marketing and embracing a joyful fluidity of identity. This is a book that made me feel seen, understood, and empowered, and read like a celebration of the possibilities of life. With a balance of humor and fierce criticism told through blissfully beautiful prose and a narrative that rotates between the perspectives of two sisters, Anthea and Imogen Gunn, Ali Smith combines the modern myths while honoring those of the past in a raucous and rebellions little novella that has completely stolen my heart.‘I was a she was a he was a we were a girl and a girl and a boy and a boy, we were blades, were a knife that could cut through myth.’At its core, Girl meets boy is a love story. One with searing prose on the way love can enrapture and awake you that reminds me of my personal favorite, Jeanette Winterson, with queer love befitting lines such as ‘I had not known, before us, that every vein in my body was capable of carrying light.’ It is a story of Anthea meeting Robin—‘she was the most beautiful boy I had ever seen’—but also a love story to the myths we make, to protest, to freedom, to queer possibilities, to ‘the whole world, beautiful, various, waiting.’ This is a story about being free from the shackles of gender binaries (something that I really appreciate as an enby) to love that makes you realize you are ‘both genders, a whole new gender, no gender at all.’ And most importantly, the safety to embrace yourself this way. Goddamn, I can relate. I read most of this book with chills going through my entire being. I was grinning and cheering. This is a love story to love and I, in turn, love it with all my heart.‘You’re going to have to learn the kind of hope that makes things history.’Smith draws on the Roman myth of Iphis and Ianthe, such as it is told in Ovid’s Metamorphoses. In Smith’s book, Robin respects Ovid for being ‘very fluid, as writers go…he knows, more than most, that the imagination doesn’t have a gender.’ We find here that Girl meets boy is another tale in the spirit of Ovid who ‘honours all sorts of love…all sorts of story.’ You will be fine if you are unfamiliar with the myth as Smith explains it for you. Twice, actually. Once directly and then again in an adorable dialogue between Robin and Anthea as Robin explains the myth as the reason behind her artist name being Iphis (you’ll likely note the name Anthea is rather adjacent to Ianthe). Though the myth is layered in with Anthea’s grandfather’s stories, the novel opening with him saying ‘let me tell you about when I was a girl.’‘You’re going to have to learn the kind of hope that makes things history.’The use of names is rather blunt, yet effective. ‘You’re a walking peace protest,’ Robin tells Anthea who’s first name meaning flowers and her family name, Gunn, carries the clan motto Either Peace or War, ‘You’re the flower in the Gunn.’ This recalls two famous photos, The Ultimate Confrontation as well as the Pulitzer Prize-nominated photo Flower Power, the former taken by Marc Riboud of high school student Jan Rose Kasmir confronting a bayoneted gun with a chrysanthemum, the latter by photographer Bernie Boston of protester George Harris putting carnations in soldier’s loaded rifles aimed at unarmed civilians. Both were taken during the 1967 March on the Pentagon as a protest of the Vietnam War:  [image]The Ultimate Confrontation  [image] Flower PowerThe spirit of resistance and public displays of protest is alive and well in Smith’s tale, beginning with the grandfather telling of the time she was accomplices with a woman’s suffragette named Burning Lily who protested by burning down factories (in the notes section, Smith says she was based on suffragette Lilian Lenton) and moving to Robin spray painting messages around the city. Such as outside Imogen and Anthea’s job at Pure, a bottled water company with aims not just for global distribution of overpriced water but becoming a corporation so large and octopus-like to have a hand in many industries. ‘You really think you’ll make a single bit of difference to all the unfair things and all the suffering and all the injustice and all the hardship with a few words?Yes, she say.’The peaceful protests of graffiti highlighting inequalities like gender pay gaps, femicides, or the ethical issues of reducing access to natural resources in order to profit from them are not always welcomed, and not just by the police. Average citizens fear their public art protests are too divisive or will drive tourists away. I loved this section, as my own public art displays (I left painting around town with favorite poems written on them) were shut down for “graffiti violations” and am a huge fan of public art. But here this is used as a way to interrogate ideas of who is allowed to direct the ‘dominant narrative’ of social discourse, and the ways those with money and power gatekeep modern myth-making.‘[D]o myths spring fully formed from the imagination and the needs of a society, I sad, as if they emerged from society’s subconscious? Or are myths conscious creations by the various money-making forces? For instance, is advertising a new kind of myth-making?’I’ve always referred to marketing as ‘corporate fanfiction’ at best, it’s actually one of my degrees though I like to say I have a degree in propaganda. For my final course when asked what our biggest lesson about marketing is, I wrote that my biggest lesson is we shouldn’t manipulate public psychology for profit and instead dismantle corporate marketing (they then got to hand me a degree with highest honors for a 4.0 GPA). Understanding is not the same as condoning, and I do value knowing how it all works. But, needless to say, Ali Smith dunking on marketing was absolutely delightful to me. Smith doesn’t pull any punches here, with the ‘Creative’ team meetings feeling rather cultish and the psychological manipulation and corporate myth-making being on full display. Anthea can’t buy into it, but Imogen does. We see Pure and corporate marketing as the antithesis to the messaging done by Robin, a battle to control the ‘persuasive myth’ either to set people free or to profit by subjugating them. Corporate buzzwords and capitalist messaging construct myths that elevate CEOs as the heroes of their own myths with skyscraper offices as the new Mt. Olympus from where they can frame the stories of the world and distort the public narratives to always be the freedom fighters even when curbing freedoms. ‘DDR…Deny Disparage Rephrase’ the Pure boss teaches. ‘Use the word terrorism,’ he instructs employees about speaking to the press about water protectors in India protesting that the dam built by Pure has killed their crops and polluted the only water access they have left. He says access to clean water is not a Right, but a Need, one they should exploit because they need money. ‘It’s international-government-ratified…Whether you think it’s bullshit or not. And I can do what I like.’ It would seem like cartoonish villany if this very thing wasn’t constantly so out in the open with people defending them all the time. As the graffiti in the book always says: ‘THIS MUST CHANGE.’‘It’s easy to think it’s a mistake, or you’re a mistake. It’s easy, when everything and everyone you know tells you you’re the wrong shape, to believe you’re the wrong shape.’Similarly, Smith addresses the narratives around gender and sexuality, such as how the natural love of Robin and Anthea is met with pushback. ‘My sister would be banned in schools if she was a book,’ Imogen thinks, a sentence that was rather alarming/amusing to read while in Florida, the state with the second most book bans in the US, usually over LGTBQ+ representation. The first section from Imogen’s perspective could be rather triggering—heads up—as it deals with her being shocked by Anthea coming out, though knowing Smith’s perspective on this you can see how she filters this with some humor like Imogen noting that Anthea had always liked Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Tracy Champman a lot which had to be foreshadowing. It does touch on how much gatekeeping and pushback there is over queer identities, usually most loudly by those outside of them without any experience in them insisting on controlling the narrative about them (like resistance to trans/nonbinary identities). This is reflected in the book with Imogen struggling to find the ‘correct’ way to term Robin and Anthea, only for Robin to effectively sidestep the whole thing. ‘The proper word for me, Robin Goodman says, is me.’‘Now I had taken a whole new shape. No, I had taken the shape I was always supposed to, the shape that let me hold my head high. Me, Anthea Gunn, head turned towards the sun.’I love Girl meets boy so much and it was the perfect book to read while on vacation. It does all lead to an uplifting ending, and while I am not usually one for overtly upbeat endings, this one earns it and we all deserve this ending. Especially after years of “kill your queers” or only focusing on suffering being a standard whenever there was queer representation in literature. This book is beautiful. It may be a touch heavy handed, but so are myths and Smith does an excellent job of recasting Ovid’s tale in a modern setting as a complementary story to the original. Perhaps my rating is a little inflated, perhaps I also don’t care, this book just made me very happy on a warm vacation and I’m fine with that. Its so many thing I enjoy thinking about all in one story. I shamefully had not read Ali Smith until now but this will certainly not be my last. Girl meets boy is an investigation into the power and necessity of stories, and a lovely story all to itself.4.5/5‘It was always the stories that needed the telling that gave us rope we could cross any river with. They balanced us high above any crevasse. They made us be natural acrobats. They made us be brave. They met us well. They changed us.

Helen DeWitt’Everyone loves a good story, but nobody loves a story of high-profile trauma quite like agents who want to sell that story to the world. Helen DeWitt’s novella, The English Understand Wool, is a brief but uproarious criticism of profits and publishing through an investigation into ideas of good taste, such as avoiding ‘mauvais ton,’ a term the narrator says looses quality in the translation to ‘bad taste’ in English. But can good taste be bought, or is it earned? DeWitt juxtaposes those who obtain wealth legally—yet through tacky manipulation at the expense of others and their own honor and morality—with those who come by their wealth illegally but act with honor and use their wealth to enrich those beneath their status, creating quite the comedy of morals in a legal thriller pitting a freshly-orphaned 17 year old girl against a publishing giant. The wit and cynicism is sharp and DeWitt writes with a succinctly powerful voice that makes The English Understand Wool a charming little tale with plenty of teeth.‘Maman was exigeante—there is no English word–and I had the benefit of her training. ’Helen DeWitt is a master of language, one who values the dexterity of being multilingual, and an author who herself is genius enough to write characters who are believably a genius as in The Last Samurai. That is all on display here in this short tale that had me stifling laughter to not upset my fellow flight passengers as I read, which would surely be mauvais ton. The English Understand Wool has a bit of a kinship with the aesthetics of Wes Anderson, with a quirky and rapidfire delivery from characters that place extreme emphasis on good taste, connoisseurship, and international travel. The story is told from 17 year old Marguerite, telling of her life brought up in Marrakech by her mother that impressed upon her not only cultivations and high tastes in arts and lifestyles but also generosity and the importance of taking care of those who take care of you. Her staff became highly sought after hospitality workers under her care. Marguerite’s life is happy, rich, full of music (she receives top notch piano lessons), and a luxurious social life (by the age of 10 she is a sought after Bridge partner). But what if one day Maman was gone? What if Maman was never her mother? What if Marguerite was an orphan with a $100million trust fund that a servant who understands good taste might find tolerable to raise? What publisher wouldn’t want this story, and wouldn’t pay handsomely for it?‘If the object is not merely to entertain, but to instruct, those in need of instruction will feel the benefit. If some other young girl, with two million dollars at stake, finds this of use I shall count myself justified.’The publishing industry, particularly large publishers who grapple for celebrity memoirs, is put on blast by DeWitt and every moment of it is utterly delightful. DeWitt asks us to consider how the persuasion of profits will inevitably poison any project as entertainment and marketing overrides authenticity. The editor begging Marguerite to add more emotion, to get angry, to call Maman cold only to be met with confusion had me in stitches.‘I do not understand this grievance you expect me to feel,’ she says, she had a delightful life (she insists her infant self couldn’t have picked a better caregiver, why is everyone so upset?). ‘They relied,’ she tells us of her publisher, ‘on the inexperience, the financial weakness, the presumed emotional fragility of the author to push through a contract which stood to her disadvantage.’ Is this any worse than Maman who, sure, might have stolen her, but at least had her best interests in mind. The publishers are only out for themselves, and while it might be legal, don’t they seem to be taking far more advantage of a teenage girl than the actual crimes committed by Maman?I love the way DeWitt shows that wealth is wasted on the wealthy who can buy anything they like but have not cultivated good taste. ‘This was precisely the sort of idiocy one would expect from someone who wore white patent-leather shoes,’ she snaps at one point, at all times looking down on the wealthy executives of New York as bumbling swine when it comes to matters of taste. To her, the crime of mauvais ton far outweighs any legal crime, the type of character who would call someone a philistine to their face and make it hurt like a knife wound. and I loved all of this so much. There are some fantastic twists that play on the idea that truth is something to be earned and how those who talk about trust the most often only do so because they are screwing you over. DeWitt throws punches like a prize fighter here, it’s a thing of beauty to witness. ‘Bad masters breed bad servants.’So if you are ever concerned about being on the run, perhaps get in good graces with those who run the finest hotels, who’s jobs are to take care of you and value discretion, people for whom a good paycheck is vital and respect those who respect them. There is a lovely working class consciousness here, something that recalls Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel both in hospitality camaraderie and overall aesthetics, and made me feel proud that my resume has a strong history in hospitality work. The English Understand Wool has a delightful playfulness that reminds us of the beauty in storytelling as well as how useful an understanding of language and the arts can be. It is a quick tale that is end-loaded with some jaw-dropping moments that will have you cackling at the 17-year old somehow being served wine in a fancy restaurant as she serves a legal ass kicking to those who hoped to profit off what they perceived as her misery and trauma. I’m delighted by this new Storybooks ND series from New Direction publishing that offers ‘the pleasure of reading a great book from cover to cover in an afternoon,’ and The English Understand Wool is a perfect way to pass an afternoon or, as I did, a flight home. A biting satire of capitalism with plenty of humor, this was a blast.4/5‘When I speak of these forms of understanding I do not mean that they are instantiated in every individual of a nation, a culture. I think of this thing which in France is taken so seriously, the terroir, the importance of a particular soil in conjunction with the water, the sun, the aspect of the land, and how this affects the grape. How this affects decisions concerning the grapes to be grown there. We see this likewise in the cheeses… It is as if certain qualities flourish in certain social conjunctions.’...more",Notes are private!,2,220,1,"Dec 03, 2022","Dec 03, 2022","Dec 03, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59468833-the-english-understand-wool

Not that I don’t enjoy a good mystery, I just rarely pick them and I think we all benefit from having our usual reads shaken up a bit. Though it is not a traditional mystery and Coe refers to it in the introduction as ‘a farce’ and it reads more as a satire on the genre as well as the wealthy, ruling class. It is a fun and funny read although I found it a touch too long to sustain the joke, though the moments of dry humor really connect at times. This is a complex, convoluted yet comical story of terrible people doing terrible things, but never fear, we see them meet terrible ends.The Winshaw Legacy deals with Thatcher era conservatives and draws in a lot of real world political drama, putting the characters behind the scenes of each and using global misery to line their pockets. It was hard to like even the better characters, but half the fun is hating them and watching them be absolute turds to each other. The jokes are more amusement at the long set up rather than actual laugh moment, which can be trying but I did get some good giggles. It gets a tad absurd near the end, following closely to the comedy film from which it was inspired, and while I don’t see myself reading more there are several others in the series. While I found this just okay, I do think about it all the time as the political issues in the book are still relevant today. I mean, it’s been almost a year so that’s gotta count for something.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,0,81,1,not set,not set,"Nov 30, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/193875.The_Winshaw_Legacy

These are maids who must clean the blood of Odysseus’ great battle against the suitors and then must die having been given no name or no other life in the book. This has never sat well with Margaret Atwood and so through the The Penelopiad, which reframes the story of Homer’s The Odyssey from the perspective of Penelope, she is able to center the voices of the women to explain these deaths. Atwood excels at subverting narratives and her knowledge and respect for the original tales is evident as she playfully and humorously reworks them into a story that explores gender and class relations. The latter is addressed most profoundly, giving the maids their own stories to show how the servant class of women are dehumanized. Utilizing the maids as the tale’s Greek chorus, Atwood breathes fresh life into a familiar tale, expanding and enhancing it in exciting ways that are as witty and they are darkly comedic.‘Where shall I begin? There are only two choices: at the beginning or not at the beginning.’While just under 200pgs, The Penelopiad is crammed with story and insight. Atwood mentions the tales come from research into The Odyssey but also from versions found in Robert Graves’ The Greek Myths. One would benefit from knowing the gist of the original tale, and there are a lot of names and references that are helpful to have some background on, though it is not necessary. Atwood’s retelling really makes it her own, and most interesting of the book is her use of the greek chorus. The twelve maids appear between chapters to sing ballads or sea shanties, deliver an ‘anthropological essay,’ perform a play and even participate in an abstract court trial. It is genius and easily my favorite parts of the book, and Atwood also writes them as very funny. The rather cabaret elements make it no surprise this book was adapted for the theater. The Penelopiad is narrated by Penelope after her death—in a present-day Hades where christian mythology has added pitchforked demons to the landscape, mind you—she retells her life story in an attempt to demystify the rumors and legends about her as well as explain the abrupt execution of her youngest, prettiest and most faithful maids. Atwood treats us to accounts of Penelope first meeting Odysseus, their marriage and years together before he went off to fight in the Trojan War. ‘And so I was handed over to Odysseus, like a package of meat,’ Penelope tells us, ‘a package of meat in a wrapping of gold, mind you,’ This is indicative of how she sees the treatment of women in society, as more symbols of testament to the ruling men and objects of pleasure than having full agency. She sees the myths as intentionally disregarding this, and the stories of women having bad behavior are less women being wicked and more women frantically trying to survive a violent patriarchal world. As Atwood famously wrote  ‘And what did I amount to, once the official version gained ground? An edifying legend. A stick used to beat other women with,’ she says. Penelope would like to set the record straight that the legends are not only flawed, but are reshaping the reality of Penelope’s position to further subjugate women. For example, the framing of the weaving and un-stitching for which she is best known for during her long wait is rebuked as such:‘The shroud itself became a story almost instantly. 'Penelope's web', it was called; people used to say that of any task that remained mysteriously unfinished. I did not appreciate the term web. If the shroud was a web, then I was a spider. But I had not been attempting to catch men like flies: on the contrary, I'd merely been trying to avoid entanglement myself.’Penelope is always at risk of death for the whims of men. Odysseus says if she ever sleeps with another man he will hack her to pieces, then laughs it off as a joke. Though she laughs along, she is terrified knowing this would likely happen. While Odysseus can still be the hero and feel no guilt for sleeping with other women—his sexual exploits even become epic songs of praise men sing to Penelope, which she is not into—Penelope becomes the butt of jokes and sneered at for rumors of possibly sleeping with a suitor or two. While she insists she never did, the maids sure like to tell us differently in their asides, one of Atwood’s clever ways at keeping myths a variation of truths based on the teller. ‘What can a woman do when scandalous gossip travels the world,’ Penelope asks us, adding ‘If she defends herself, she sounds guilty.’ The supposed agency Penelope has in the situation is shown as more victim blaming than anything else.‘The two of us were—by our own admission—proficient and shameless liars of long standing. It’s a wonder either one of us believed a word the other said.’I do enjoy the depictions of Penelope and Odysseus here. Odysseus is written as still clever and strong, though a bit more buffoonish and Penelope constantly mentions that he has amusingly short, stubby legs. But he is also fairly tender at times and the two make an exciting cooperative pair to read about, bonding over their shared familial traumas. Much of Odysseus’ return, his cunning, secrecy and the ‘divine’ coincidences turn out, in Penelope’s version, to be mostly her amused and letting Odysseus have his moment instead of catching her by surprise. It is fun and charming, much more so than her adversarial relationship with Helen.‘The gods were never averse to making a mess. In fact they enjoyed it.’Another aspect I quite enjoyed was Penelope’s dismissal of the gods at times, often questioning if they even exist. She questions the divine births that everyone with any power seems to claim, noting how convenient it is for their status and reputation to have a god on at least one side of the family tree. SHe also notes how convenient it is to credit the gods for an idea instead of having to take any responsibility for it: ‘creating some god for one's inspirations was always a good way to avoid accusations of pride should the scheme succeed, as well as the blame if did not.’ Penelope isn’t above crediting them though, claiming her weaving idea was divinely inspired by Pallas Athene, though it, in truth came from remembering her mother talking about how water finds away around obstacles. The only thing for sure about the gods in this story is, if they are in fact real, then ‘our suffering might be ‘what they love to savour,’ as they certainly destroy a lot of lives and leave women in terrible positions.‘We were told we were dirty. We were dirty. Dirt was our concern, dirt was our business, dirt was our specialty, dirt was our fault. We were the dirty girls.’If the gods are cruel, it is to the lowest classes they are the cruelest. The maids live entirely in servitude and are frequently attacked and sexually assaulted by the suitors. Even their own rape is held against them for it happening without a master’s permission, a wildly disturbing notion. Atwood uses them as a critical look at class and how the spoils for the wealthy are deadly and traumatic for the working or slave classes.’You don't have to think of us as real girls, real flesh and blood, real pain, real injustice. That might be too upsetting. Just discard the sordid part. Consider us pure symbol. We're no more real than money.’The final two sentences here, a quote Atwood uses from Claude Lévi-Strauss, are a great commentary on how their treatment and death is largely symbolic of the treatment of maids. But also how as a symbol they can be strong together. In one of the greek chorus sections, they teach how they are, in fact, symbolic of Robert Graves’s theory of a matriarchial moon cult and worship of a triple-aspect lunar goddess which he explores in The White Goddess: A Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth. Twelve is symbolic as well (‘there are twelve apostles, there are twelve days of Christmas, yes, but there are twelve months’) and Atwood figures them as a moon goddess symbol with Penelope as their Queen to be the thirteenth since ‘ the number of lunar month is indeed thirteen.’‘[O]ur rape and subseqent hanging represent the overthrow of a matrilineal moon-cult by an incoming group of usurping patriarchal father-god-worshipping barbarians.’Atwood fingers Odysseus as the head of the usurping patriarchy, placing power structures that benefit men at the expense of women and at the overthrow of the Lunar goddess. It was a high point of the book, as well the court trial scene.Through all the assertions, the maids say ‘No, Sir, we deny that this theory is merely unfounded feminist claptrap.’ Which is a great line, and also led me to wonder what what Atwood considers about her own retelling when the idea of feminist retellings of traditional stories is currently a popular subject. ‘I wouldn't even call it feminist,’ Atwood has said of this book, ‘every time you write something from the point of view of a woman, people say that it's feminist.’ She has made similar statements regarding The Handmaid's Tale.Which is interesting as some critics have argued that Atwood’s portrayal of animosity between Helen and Penelope here is one of several examples from her books dismissing the idea of an amicable universal sisterhood, one of several reasons (another more recent being her retweets of trans-exclusionary articles) many feminist critics consider her insufficiently feminist. Perhaps patriarchal power structures are the disruption of sisterhood for Atwood? For Atwood, storytelling that focuses on ‘giving a woman a voice and an inner life will always be considered 'feminist' by those who think women ought not to have these things,’ which, I think, is her saying that the idea of labeling something as feminist is a way for patriarchial forces to disregard it. Though in an industry (and society) where women’s voices have often been gatekept, suppressed or disregarded, centering those voices can still be a subversive act and there is still pushback and violence towards women all across the world when women move to achieve equality either socially or legislatively and many double standards are still unfortunately normalized.‘It's always an imprudence to step between a man and the reflection of his own cleverness.’Atwood’s The Penelopiad is a delightful little read that certainly has fun with the Greek myths and fills in the cracks for further enjoyment. Atwood had adapted myths previously in The Robber Bride and many poems, such as her look at the story of Helen in the poem Helen of Troy Does Countertop Dancing (read it here), and her knowledge and storytelling skills allow her to adapt this story in a very compelling way. Sharp, humorous, and constantly witty, Penelope is an exciting narrator and I enjoyed this fresh perspective on an absolute classic tale.3.75/5‘We can see through all your disguises: the paths of day, the paths of darkness, whichever paths you take - we're right behind you, following you like a trail of smoke, like a long tail, a tail made of girls, heavy as memory, light as air: twelve accusations, toes skimming the ground, hands tied behind our backs, tongues sticking out, eyes bulging, songs choked in our throats.’...more",Notes are private!,0,180,1,"Nov 27, 2022","Nov 28, 2022","Nov 27, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17645.The_Penelopiad

It is the way we construct meaning from the chaos of our lives colliding with one other; communicate with others; rationalize decisions; make each other laugh or cry; how we empathize or soothe; how we teach, learn, and dream. I am, shamelessly, a book lover. Considering this platform, I think it’s safe to say we are all book lovers here. Book Love, is a collection of brief comics from Debbie Tung that humorously prod at book lovers to pinpoint the common personality quirks that help define us as such. I say “us” because I felt called out in many of these shorts, and if you are reading this, I suspect you will, too. It is cute, cornball humor that will make you smirk and, while there’s nothing particularly deep or overtly hilarious, it will make book lovers feel understood. While not everything applied to me, a great deal of it did and it got me thinking about my own journey through life with books. I mean, I currently work in both a library and a bookstore and find ing books to be nearly as rewarding a pastime as actually reading books. My arms are covered in book references tattooed into my skin (I literally have a purple line drawing of Virginia Woolf’s face staring back at me whenever I look in the mirror). But something I’ve found while ing is that you can’t truly capture what a book meant to you without presenting a little bit about yourself in the context of it. The journey through a book is often a journey through yourself, and if you’d like to accompany me, I’d like to look at how this book resonates with my own life as a way of appreciating these comics.  [image]Me writing way too long of a  as always.Basically, I love books and I just want everyone to appreciate them in their own way. I work at a library, I just want to give you free books and resources. I want to open doors into trains of thought that you can ride through your mind, or lighthouses of ideas that can guide you in your darkest, stormiest moments. Am I the sort of library book lover that owns an Arthur t-shirt with the saying “having fun isn’t hard when you have a library card”? You bet your ass I am. I give out library cards all day long and sit on a committee that discusses ways to make the library more accessible and inclusive.  [image]Did I order this in the middle of the night after several drinks? Maybe…‘A book must be the axe for the frozen sea within us,’ wrote Franz Kafka, and I believe in the power of storytelling to hack up the surface so we can dive into the waters of ourselves and society to better understand them through the telling and reading of stories. But reading can fulfill a lot of purposes for people, from entertainment and laughs to academic insight. Some people read to find themselves, some read to find other answers, some read just to escape, and all of these are valid, cool, and subjective (my favorite kind of cool). That was one thing I quickly realized in my first bookstore job at the Holland, Mi Barnes and Noble. I worked there for several years, long enough to be a department lead, have a passcode that could do whatever I wanted, and be trusted with all sorts of important responsibilities without reasonable compensation. It’s a lesson I carry with me into my current bookstore and especially the library. I just want to give you access to books, I don’t care what it is. I will get it for you. Here’s a good look at what reading can be:  [image]Debbie Tung goes through lots of silly quirks about readers. I loved the bits about pre-ordering a favorite author’s new book without bothering to read what its about, hating movie cover editions, or loving that a book makes you sad. When people ask me for a happy book, I don’t know what to say, do I even read those? Give me your bleak novels, please, I want to hurt and think, and empathize and be horrified. If you say ""this book is about how oppressive society is and a mostly plotless deep dive into struggles for agency and a voice amidst surreal social constructs,"" I say ""PERFECT, TAKE MY DAMN MONEY.""  [image]Books have always meant a lot to me. I’ve learned so much about myself through them and found so many good friendships because of them. I can’t not mention my great goodreads friend Mike Puma who, sadly, passed away but we became a friend outside the screen and we used to trade books, meet up for concerts and museums, and even saw the play adaptation of 2666 by Roberto Bolaño—a favorite author I learned of from him. During a rough patch of my life I even started leaving favorite poem quotes on trees everywhere I went, making paintings to accompany them (not my poems, I’ve published a handful but I am probably not a poet). Find me at @poe_a_tree (GET IT!?) on instagram. Needless to say, books have an important place in my life.

Which is why this one is also super relevant:  [image]I’m heading out on vacation as I type this. Do I have too many books packed? Some might say yes. Will I read them all? Definitely not. Will I buy one more during this trip? Most assuredly. But you have to be prepared! I can’t discuss book love without shouting out to the people in our lives that make it possible. For me it was always teachers. I’m a classic example of “overeager reader kid who hung out with their English teacher” so much so that I still text with my high school English teacher every day. But shoutout to teachers and librarians for passing on the love. If Dr Robin Lucy from EMU ever see’s this: thank you, you turned my life around and I think of you every time I write. Also Mr O’Dowd in high school who first talked to me like an adult, passed me some Vonnegut, and let me do some pretty bonkers class projects. Thanks for being a real one. Thanks to all you book lovers on here as well. There are times when this comic dips into what I like to describe as the preciousness of books. You know, like Golum in The Lord of the Rings loving “my precious!” in a way that isn’t healthy to anyone (ie. if you see a book in the library dumpster, don’t panic that we are throwing away books and bring it back in to the desk with indignation…Because that book was tossed for being covered in actual human blood and no I don’t know why. True story.) The digs at e-readers not being real books is eye rolling because, while I don’t own an e-reader, it is still the same important effect just without the aesthetics that have been a bit fetishized (this book being one of those examples of fetishization, but I totally appreciate why people love these aspects of books because I do too). People have many reasons to use e-readers, some of them are accessibility reasons such as being able to enlarge the font. Yes, I collect books and love my personal library that takes up more real estate in my home than is reasonable, but it’s also very meaningful to me. I also read digitally because Hoopla is a great library app and it is free and it’s actually WAY easier to pull quotes for a  since you can open it in your browser window. So I don’t enjoy digging at digital or audio books, which are just as valid a way to ‘read’ as any. Access to books is the most important thing, and this can mean different things to different people. Let’s just all embrace that we enjoy having a story told to us.I was amused at the comics about not dog-earring or marking up books because I dog-ear and underline ALL DAY. I don’t care. To me, a physical book is just a possession and it’s the content that matters. Besides, I get a ton of use value from underlining and dog-earring because it makes ing a whole lot easier and more in depth when I can quote easily. I love looking back at my underlines and remembering what it meant to me during the time I was first reading the book. But I also appreciate people who want to keep their books as pristine as possible, and I would never mark up a borrowed copy (please don’t do this with library books). I also enjoy buying a used book that has underlines and notations though, it's like reading a book with the ghost of the former owner.So overall this book is cute but also a bit light, more like something that is fun to give as a gift and browse through more than anything. But it is a cute coffee table book for book lovers. I do have to say that there are a lot of jokes that were also done in Sarah Andersen’s comics and I sort of preferred her versions I guess? It is fun though.I love reading books. I love working in book world. I love going from the library to Reader’s World, the indie bookshop I also work at. I love interacting with both patrons and customers and considering the difference between both access mediums. I love hearing what people enjoy, don’t enjoy, the sort of books they want and I really love the hunt of getting them a copy (I made a “bookstore noir” video about that once, you can watch here: Part 1, Part 2, and  Part 3)I love Goodreads and rambling at you all about books I’ve enjoyed. More importantly, I love the comments thread where I can discuss with you all, share jokes, share stories, and share our lives. It’s a wonderful place to be. I am a book lover and proud.

What we gained in physical intensity we lost in time.’It is with a staggering brilliance and sublime prose th‘We were burning up a capital of desire. What we gained in physical intensity we lost in time.’It is with a staggering brilliance and sublime prose that Annie Ernaux is able to turn on a firehose of passion into her short works, leaving the reader overcome with emotion and flipping pages with the same feverish intensity as Ernaux describes herself in her recollections of the past. Simple Passion is a deceptively simple novel at 80pgs, but Ernaux manages to pack a seemingly endless flow of emotion into this story about an affair while also using it as a platform to discuss autobiographical fiction. As always, Ernaux harnesses a directness with words that pulls a fierce sense of passion with them, beautiful translated into English here by Tanya Leslie. ‘All I have done,’ she writes, ‘is translate into words…the way in which his existence has affected my life’ and she does so in a way that will certainly affect the reader and plant you directly into an understanding of her mind and manners during this period of time. Quick, gorgeous, and bursting with Ernaux’s enthusiasm and insights, Simple Passion is another reminder that even winning the Nobel Prize might not be enough praise for what she deserves.‘[W]hen I began to write, I wanted to stay in that age of passion, when all my actions…were channeled towards one person.’It is a simple enough story, covering the year of an affair with a married man—a Russian diplomat working in Paris and bears a ‘slight resemblance’ to a young Alain Delon—and a few reflections after it comes to an end. Yet, Ernaux manages to make it feel like it is a far reaching importance in a way that captures how this affair captured her entire being during the time. She says about the duration of the affair that ‘quite often I felt I was living out this passion in the same way I would have written a book: the same determination to get every single scene right, the same minute attention to detail,’ which makes sense to then which to capture the story and retell it in a way she hopes that ‘these pages will always mean something to me, to others too maybe.’ As with many Ernaux books, she separates from the idea of being purely memoir and this book is categorized by the publisher as fiction, though for those who are interested, her real, unfiltered diary entries from the time of this affair are published as Getting Lost, which appeared in English translation earlier this year.‘I could experience only absence or presence.’One this that comes across clearly in her works is that she is someone that feels emotion with her whole heart, body and soul. Simple Passion recounts, well, incredible passion and being ‘entirely at the mercy’ of these feelings. This full-being intensity is reflected as well in The Possession where she is completely driven by her obsessions, though her it is with a former lover’s new partner (not the same affair though as in this book). ‘I do not wish to explain my passion,’ she tells us, ‘that would imply that it was a mistake or some disorder I need to justify—I just want to describe it.’ Of the time during the affair she tells us ‘I behaved in an artificial manner,’ and ‘the only actions involving willpower, desire, and what I take to be human intelligence...were all related to this man.’ Anything not directly part of her ‘growing obsession’ she sees as something that is merely ‘a means of filling in time between two meetings.’ Anyone who has felt the intensity of love, especially young love, will likely be stirred by these feelings no matter how seemingly foolish, just as she realizes in this time how empathetic and empowered she is by all the stories of other women so immersed in their obsessions of love. She pushes aside anything that ‘prevented me from luxuriating in the sensations and fantasies of my own passion.’ In effect, he was her entire being during this period. ‘I measured time differently, with all my body.’The book recounts her observations of herself during the time as well as those of him, though we actually learn very little about him and much more about how she felt because of him. We know he is married, he likes to drink, he is only ever referred to as ‘A’, and that there is a bit of a language barrier, but for the latter she enjoys it as it gives her, upfront, ‘the privilege of knowing what we all find out in the end: the man we love is a complete stranger.’ I enjoy the way Ernaux describes how even things like a mark on the carpet from a food accident are pleasing because it is a reminder of time spent with him. This is something most of us do, attach memories to mementos, and I find that eventually these objects become neither the object or the memory, but an interesting blend that is both but could no longer have meaning without the other. Her method of detailing the emotional resonance from events gives a more heartfelt impact than if she had focused on detailing the events instead.During the later parts of the affair, we see Ernaux grappling with the knowledge of time passing, memories and feelings fading, and how we always try and inevitably fail to swim upstream.He leaves, inevitable, back for Russia and we find the the deluge of emotions has now dried up into a somber state of insomnia and lacking a sense of purpose. Where once absence meant longing for the next meeting, now it merely means absence without a presence to come. I found it particularly moving when she says that ‘the partly erased frescoes in Santa Croce moved me because of my story, which would come to resemble them one day—fading fragments in his memory and in mine.’ After a relationship ends sadly, often the idea that you’ll get over it is almost more painful, because at least you have the sadness attached to memories to keep you in that moment. The fading seems like a betrayal.‘Living in passion or writing: in each case one’s perception of time is fundamentally different.’‘Throughout this period, all my thoughts and all my actions involved the repetition of history,' Ernaux writes, 'I wanted to turn the present back into the past, opening on to happiness.’ When revisiting places does not trigger this, she turns to writing, something that figures as a life saving or life giving action in many of her works. This is also a favorite aspect of her books for me. Simple Passion tackles head on her fears of ‘people’s judgment and the “normal” values of society’ that can occur after publication, which she mostly dismisses in many others. But here she stresses over ‘having to answer questions such as “Is it an autobiography?” and having to justify this or that,’ and how this fear keeps many stories from people told. This is territory I’ve found Jeanette Winterson handles with expertise, insisting that even the books delving deeply into biographical details are simply fiction and that ‘Autobiography is not important. Authenticity is important. The writer must fire herself through the text, be the molten stuff that welds together disparate elements.’ Ernaux reaches her own conclusion tha stories must be told and this idea which is highly indicative of her work:‘It occurred to me that writing should also aim for that—the impression conveyed by sexual intercourse, a feeling of anxiety and stupefaction, a suspension of moral judgment.’So this is a great line, right? As time passes, she finds ‘the world is beginning to mean something again outside A’ but the pages of this book are a more permanent catalog of the passions and desires of their time together. She says they last with more emotion than, say, a bathrobe he once used she would cling to even once his scent has left, and through her fiction she is hope able to even ‘save the bathrobe from oblivion.’ It is a beautiful sentiment. What is interesting is that she says these are the fictional, polished accounts, but her writing manages to retain a rawness that strikes straight to the heart.‘It is a mistake therefore to compare someone writing about his own life to an exhibitionist, since the latter has only one desire: to show himself and to be seen at the same time.’Annie Ernaux is an absolute gem and I am once again blown away by how much power she can pack into these short snacks of remembrance. In such a little space she packs a whole cosmos of feeling, from passion to pain, and bestows it so elegantly and bravely upon the reader. While I found this one slightly less impactful than the previous ones I've read, Happening likely being the most, it was still a deeply emotive and moving experience. Through her reflections, she is able to learn more about herself and she passes that along to us as a lesson as well. Namely she learned people are capable of ‘ anything: sublime or deadly desires, lack of dignity, attitudes and beliefs I had found absurd in others until I myself turned to them,’ and that possibility is part of what makes fiction so essential. But most importantly she learned that, to add to all her ideas of what the word luxury means ‘is also being able to live out a passion for a man or a woman.’ I’d like to add another meaning, and that luxury is being able to spend time in the brilliant mind of authors like Ernaux.5/5‘Now I was only time flowing through myself.’...more",Notes are private!,2,217,1,"Nov 25, 2022","Nov 25, 2022","Nov 25, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/399257.Simple_Passion

Whoever the ghost writer is for Donald Trump books12. Alchemist (hide spoiler)]Jokes aside, The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho is an endlessly quotable book. It reads like a fable, with very catchy and accessible writing that is meant to empower and make you feel good. This really works for a lot of people—I mean this was a widely successful novel—and I’m happy that so many people could be moved and inspired by a book. Especially a book that unites people around the world by being an international success. Unfortunately, for myself at least, it all comes across as a pristine facade without much behind it, offering something that can be quickly digested but isn’t actually filling. This is a book that I recall enjoying enough when I read it as a teen but haven’t thought of since, so when someone picked it as our next read for our book club I was excited to revisit it seeing as I remembered literally nothing about it. I hate to say it, but being fun but forgettable is my takeaway from it again.‘There is only one way to learn... It's through action.’Coelho said the book was written very quickly because ‘the book was already written in my soul,’ and in the forward he discusses how this novel was his own Personal Legend. ‘I was living my own metaphor,’ he said, being thrilled just to get it picked up by a Brazilian publisher who, in 1988, only ran 900 copies assuming it would not be a big success. The book ended up taking off, with the 1993 English translation becoming a massive hit and lead to numerous further translations. Coelho even holds a Guinness World Record for “most translations of a single title signed by the author in 1 sitting”, signing his book in 53 different translated editions at a book event in Germany. So I can really appreciate that aspect, and his own personal journey into publishing and believing in himself is honestly better than the book itself.   [image]Fun fact: The Alchemist had a big boost in sales when then-President Bill Clinton was photographed reading it.For those who don’t know, the story follows a young boy, Santiago, as he journeys across the desert and meets a lot of interesting people along the way. Literally every person has a pearl of positive wisdom to share it seems, and it becomes a rapid fire of empowerment quotes that could all go on one of those inspirational posters made for office walls in the 90s. Actually, I’m fairly certain I’ve seen one that quoted this book. The characters all feel like a mouthpiece for Coehlo to pass along his positive message, or wisdom, and one can easily imagine this being a self-help book had he not decided to attach a fictional narrative to it. It is a nice message, that you have to believe in yourself and in your goals and, if you truly do (“only those who are true of heart” vibes like in fairy tales) the universe will conspire to help you achieve your goal. Which is a nice inspirational message and sometimes that is what you need to hear to break free from self doubt. Particularly as another primary message is that we must overcome fear to accomplish what we need to do. ‘Don't give in to your fears,’ Coelho writes, ‘If you do, you won't be able to talk to your heart.’ So great, yea, believe in yourself. I dig that.‘To realize one's destiny is a person's only real obligation.’I do, however, see it as a bit of a back-patting perspective. Like yes, if you are successful it is nice to feel like it is because you are pure of heart. He tells us that those who don’t follow their dreams end up in ruin and sadness. This is sort of a success fallacy in a way, as it implies that if things are bad its because you just didn’t try hard enough. Which…ehhhhh…I mean there are a lot of forces acting in society that gatekeep and sometimes it’s more than just not overcoming adversity. And I get it, keep trying, yea, but it feels a bit like shaming? Which is honestly overthinking it though as this book is not that nuanced or deep (something I kept saying during debates over minor details during book club: “I don’t think he even considered that and its beside the point because it’s not actually that deep”). It is meant to be a fun and empowering story that paints in broad strokes and yea, I get why it means a lot to many people. For me it just seemed a bit flat and like a snack when I wanted a meal.‘Everyone seems to have a clear idea of how other people should lead their lives, but none about his or her own.’ Okay, fine, I don’t know how to write a good book or how to live my life either, but I just know this one wasn’t it for me.I did appreciate how it was aimed at a general positive idea of spirituality that, while using different religions, was not necessarily religious. Spiritual, or mystic would seem the better term. I liked the idea of the universe, the sand, the wind, etc as conscious entities that can collaborate with you. While I really disliked the deus ex machina ending, the whole idea of the world as a spiritual presence was well done. Coelho does sort of pull an orientalism in his depiction as an outsider of the region as this wild and savage land full of wise sages and cutthroat robbers, but it does seem with the aim of capturing the feel of One Thousand and One Nights or other tales of adventure and ‘finding yourself’ in exotic locale. Which I think is a topic that people have had a more nuanced discussion on since this book was written.‘It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting,’ Coelho writes, and this I can agree with. However, in The Alchemist, the general tone of the book is that dreams seem a thing only for men. Fatima, Santiago’s love interest, lacks much agency in the tale and is more or less written as a prize for following his Personal Legend. She is an element of his journey, while I guess he is all her journey gets to be. He tells her ‘I love you because the entire universe conspired to help me find you,’ which…isn’t all that romantic or great? Hey, the universe popped you into my life, guess you’ll do for a bride. C’mon, man, does she have any personality or intelligence you enjoy and don’t just tell me how beautiful she is. Didn’t vibe with any of that aspect of the book.I also didn’t really like the ending. Sure it is riffing on the whole “it’s the journey not the destination” aspect but it felt a bit flat for me with the deus ex machina moment. It is a happy ending though, and one full of success and rewards. As a bookclub member pointed out, it sort of resonates with a quote by T.S. Eliot: ‘We shall not cease from exploration And the end of all our exploring Will be to arrive where we started And know the place for the first time.’So in the end, I’m mostly ambivalent to this book. I see why people enjoy it and it is admittedly pretty and sweet and uplifting. It’s a good vibe to be in. It didn’t do much for me, but that’s alright too. 2.5/5...more",Notes are private!,-1,210,1,not set,not set,"Nov 23, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18144590-the-alchemist

It’s part of what makes him so truly frightening: his horrors lurk in every day realities and often the community at large is just as threatening as the monsters that infiltrate in secret. ‘We’d all be scared if we knew what was swept under the carpet of each other’s minds,’ King writes in ’Salem’s Lot, and in this tale of good vs evil the ways the everyday folks of the town silently allow their neighbor’s traumas to brood and boil over onto each other becomes just as unsettling as the vampires drawn to the bad vibes. The watching eyes of a predator is just as eerie be it an undead monster or the judgemental gaze from a neighbors window. It’s a perfect set-up of small town scaries that tap into the real fears of small towns quite literally dying out, a topic that fueled a lot of political discourse in rural areas in the last few decades of 20th century in the US. A factory would close or an industry would dry up and suddenly the infrastructure of a town would cave in on itself with no jobs and no future prospects. Kids would flee the moment they could to avoid being pulled under with it. So begins ’Salem’s Lot, with the flight from a small town in Maine seeming like another victim of a collapsed local economy on the surface, but with a darker secret bruising within. ‘The town knew about darkness,’ King writes, ‘it knew about the darkness that comes on the land when rotation hides the land from the sun, and about the darkness of the human soul.’ The bad behavoirs of the town, with the abusers, affairs, and general selfish fuckery have opened an opportunity for far worse predators to nestle in and take control.Which brings us to the title and name of the town. Jerusalem's Lot. This may be a stretch but King does frequently play with biblical elements, and the shortened version, ‘Salem’s Lot sure feels adjacent to Sodom and Gomorrah as well as Lot from Genesis (one could also argue Salem where the witch trials occurred, seeing as a religiously tinged “purifying by fire” plays into the ending but more on that later). In reality, the town is based on Durham, Maine where King explored the real Marsten House (an abandoned home of the same name there) as a kid. But the story of Sodom and Gomorrah involves a town being destroyed because of—according to Isaiah and Jeremiah—greed, adultery, inhospitality, and lies. In Ezekial 16:49 it is written: ‘Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy.’ The larger context here is that Jerusalem is as bad, if not worse, than Sodom. I’ve had people also tell me the “real” reason is lack of remnant, basically failure of the church, which is sort of happening here as well though Father Callahan does some ass kicking later on. So here we are in Jerusalem's Lot, where pretty much everyone is lying, cheating, and inhospitable. Bam, vampire time. I do love a good vampire time (and as vampires are often written as some lusty folks, SO DO THEY). This is a genuinely creepy novel that maintains a growing tension of terrors through it’s hefty length. King is an author that can thrill and chill in the moment of reading but, like the monsters lurking out of sight, the lingering terror always strikes from your mind later on when you realize how you too could have walked right into the frights that occur in his books. Like I wrote about for Pet Sematary, the scariest bits are dropped into normal, mundane reality. Each October I love to over indulge in horror novels. I love the genre, it really works for me, and I always think “why don’t I read more like this all year?” But then something will happen, my imagination will run wild and I’ll swear off horror novels until the wheel of seasons rolls around again. This year I didn’t really have that moment and was just blissfully downing scary stories, thrilled to keep going into November while reading this book along with Nataliya (read here excellent  here). I had to feed my neighbor’s cat last weekend, and their electronic door lock isn’t working so getting it to unlock and lock was a bit of a hassle. It was late in the evening as I was walking down into the darkness of their basement where the cat dish is when suddenly my mind decided to pelt the intrusive thought “don’t think about the Marsten House” at me like a brick. Well, fuck, now I’m hoping I don’t turn around for Marsten’s dead ass chasing after me down the stairs. I did my chore SO fast and as I’m trying to lock the door, which isn’t cooperating, the windy night is creating a draft that makes it feel like the door is trying to be pulled back open from the inside. ‘The basis of all human fears,’ King says here, ‘a closed door, slightly ajar.’ YUP. So you got me King, that was my memorable imagination-run-wild fright of 2022.‘Small towns have long memories and pass their horrors down ceremonially from generation to generation.’I love the atmosphere of this novel. It’s a small town vibe that reminds me of the small towns in Michigan’s upper peninsula where I would spend my summers as a kid. The town itself is creepy and oppressive though. Everyone knows everyone else’s business (a bit too much), everyone is kind of a shit, and generational trauma is running rampant. It becomes sort of a question of were the people being shits the reason the town became evil or was the town being evil the reason the people are shits. Once the vampires get someone they sort of become the worst version of themselves, which is rather in keeping with the first vampire novel: The Vampyre by John William Polidori. In it, anyone who is drawn to the enigmatic vampire is met with ruin and becomes terrible versions of themselves on their descent. The vampire was based on Lord Byron and this whole road to ruin was pretty expected for anyone who decided to buddy themselves with him. There is a lot of standard vampire lore in this book that sort of lets the reader’s predisposition towards vampire knowledge fill in a lot of gaps, though the use of it is all a bit muddy. It’s King’s early work and it shows. The writing is great but some of the book exists without much clarifications because, well, that’s just what makes the plot work. The crucifix is a key tool for fighting vampires because thats just how fighting vampires works. There is a lot of symbolism around the church, though Barlow does inform us ‘the Catholic Church is not the oldest of my opponents.’ It just happens to be a tradition that is also an effective weapon against him. It is less that it is a tool from God, but, as Ben observes, ‘a direct pipeline to the days when werewolves and incubi and witches were an accepted part of the outer darkness and the church the only beacon of light.’ It also opens the opportunity for some great moments with Mark getting vampire murdering down with a toy cross. King always does utilize childhood innocence in a great way, something that is very characteristic of a lot of his works. A very 'suffer the little children' vibe juxtaposed with the power of their innocence. In the vibes of a small town dying out, there is a large theme about the part and reclaiming memory. Marsten House is largely a symbol for the trauma’s of Ben’s past that he has come to revisit. Why? He did it for literature (see also: profit—‘tapping into the atmosphere…to write a book scary enough to make me a million dollars’) Ben wants to dig into his past and write a good book, but also because he wants to reclaim the magic of time now gone.’What was he doing, coming back to a town where he had lives for four years as a boy, trying to recapture something that was irrevocably lost? What magic could he expect to recapture by walking roads that he had once walked as a boy and were probably asphalted and straightened and logged off and littered with tourist beer cans?’This resonates with the ideas of dying towns and wanting to reclaim the past, or where people hold to a golden age nostalgia to resist change or progress. You can’t reclaim the past though, and memory is often much rosier than the reality. The house becomes the general base for the vampiric plot, but its also convenient to the plot because Ben can center all the evils into one idea: Marsten House. ‘If a fear cannot be articulated, it can’t be conquered,’ King writes (I love this line, and have written frequently elsewhere about how naming a thing takes away its power or gives you power over it as seen in fairy tales) and there’s almost a metafictional aspect of articulating all the evil into Marsten House in a book about writing a book about evil. It’s King winking at us seeing if we catch the references to fairy tale theory more or less.‘Purification should count for something.’ Okay, we gotta talk about the ending. Or non-ending really. I mean, this book hits some HIGHS that are truly terrifying (those teeth, ahhhhh!) but, as is the complaint about King so common they spoofed on it in the new film remake of It, King often struggles to stick the landing. While I’m into the (view spoiler)[whole purify the land with fire motif going on to smoke out the vampires for one last great battle we don’t get to see (it can be assumed it isn’t wholly successful as in One From the Road in Night Shift the vampires are still preying. (hide spoiler)] On that note, Night Shift also contains the story Jerusalem’s Lot, written as an homage to H.P. Lovecraft and connects the town to the Cthulhu mythology (it was written before the novel but appeared in print after). But I would have been into the book abruptly ending when Ben says ‘I’ll be back’ like he’s Vampire Terminator. Imagine him riding out of town on a motorcycle if you want. I’ve always been into King’s tongue-in-cheek warning going into the end of Dark Tower, and with many of his books you can probably quit and write your own final few pages and he’d be into that. ‘Salem’s Lot is a wild ride of frights and fun that is worth the hefty size of the narrative. It’s early King and a few parts read as clunky (Ben’s interactions with women are a bit awkward too) but it’s a well told story that is worth the price of admission. There's a lot to talk about here and I do really appreciate the efforts made here to make horror into a work of literature by having a lot of symbolism and references that give some good depth to it. So enter, if you dare.3.75/5...more",Notes are private!,3,151,1,"Nov 21, 2022","Nov 21, 2022","Nov 21, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11590._Salem_s_Lot

Who can avoid what they must become?’Opening a Jeannette Winterson book is a lot like that scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark when they open the ark: angelic prose comes pouring out and it melts your face clean off. For real though, Winterson can spin words the way Rumplestiltskin spun straw into gold. In Weight, Winterson puts this poetic magic to the task of spinning the tales of Atlas and Heracles into something beyond a mere myth retelling as it becomes a metafictional examination on the purpose of art and the implications of freedom and fate. While those familiar with Greek mythology won’t find much of a surprise plotwise, Winterson never fails to surprise through philosophical interjections that expand the tales into a larger context of purpose, existential inner struggles of the characters, or simply by managing to bring Russian space dog Laika into the narrative, and this retelling will be just as satisfying regardless of prior knowledge of the myths. ‘These are the stories we tell ourselves to make ourselves come true,’ Winterson writes and through this poetically gorgeous retelling we find an authentically human purpose we can all take to heart.‘Like my brother Prometheus, I have been punished for overstepping the mark. He stole fire. I fought for freedom.’Retellings of Greek myths have been a darling of the publishing industry lately, with Madeline Miller leading the charge to popular success, but retellings have always had deep roots in the history of literature. The oral tradition of storytelling told and retold stories for generations, keeping them alive and often adapting them to fit the needs of the times. As Winterson says in the introduction ‘my work is full of Cover Versions,’ and indeed Winterson’s deep love of fairy tales and their literary theories permeate their works so it feels only natural for them to approach Greek mythology head on. I enjoy that Winterson does not bend the myths into something they weren’t—there is a clear, loving and respectful approach to them—but instead retells them to launch our minds into larger conversations. ‘Weight’, Winterson tells us, ‘has a personal story broken against the bigger story of the myth we know and the myth I have re-told,’ and much of the authorial asides that are threaded through the narrative read like a gearing up for the full self-investigation that would occur a few years later in the jaw-droppingly moving memoir Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal?. I love when Winterson shows up in their own books, that moment you can spot and say “that’s your life!” though, as always, Winterson insists it isn’t autobiography but a narrative that examines the self:‘Autobiography is not important. Authenticity is important. The writer must fire herself through the text, be the molten stuff that welds together disparate elements. I believe there is always exposure, vulnerability, in the writing process, which is not to say it is either confessional or memoir. Simply, it is real.’Much of Weight becomes a larger message on the purpose of stories and retelling them, though this comes through an investigation of the characters first. Throughout the plot of Weight we grapple with the emotional states of Atlas as well as Heracles when he briefly shoulders the Kosmos during his 12 Labours and through them come to grapple with questions of fate, freedom and purpose. For Heracles we see the question ‘why?’ begin to crack his proud veneer. Witnessing Atlas accept his punishment ‘with such grace and ease, with such gentleness, love almost,’ becomes something that will shake him even further.‘I find I am become a part of what I must bear. There is no longer Atlas and the world, there is only the World Atlas. Travel me and I am continents. I am the journey you must make.’This is the familiar Atlas of myth, a titan born between Earth and Poseidon, but one that becomes much more a story of what occurs internally than externally. ‘She loved him because he showed her to herself. He was her moving mirror,’ we are told of Earth’s love for Poseidon, who in turn knows ‘that while he could not cover the whole of her, she underpinned the whole of him.’ The writing is immediately lovely and love is examined in the signature Wintersonian ways that made books like The Passion so breathtaking. But this idea of understanding one’s self in relation to others is a major theme to be explored here. With Heracles, while holding the Kosmos he realizes his strength is contingent on motion or battle with others, and therefore so was his entire being dependent on being in relation to others. With ‘no one to listen to his stories, or to get drunk with, or to praise him,’ his sense of self deteriorates. This is then juxtaposed with Atlas. ‘He had only the punishment of forever,’ Winterson tells us of Atlas, ‘forever to be the same person. Forever to perform the same task,’ Instead of losing himself without others, his solitude becomes one that pulls him so far inward that he hears all of the world and begins to find himself meld with all space and time. ‘ I realise I am carrying not only this world, but all possible worlds. I am carrying the world in time as well as in space. I am carrying the world’s mistakes and its glories. I am carrying its potential as well as what has so far been realised.’With Winterson, time is always a construct and a narrative (‘Tell me the time’ you say. And what you really say is ‘Tell me a story.’), and we see here a melding of all things that feels akin to the understanding of Time in Sexing the Cherry, such as the quote ‘The journey is not linear, it is always back and forth, denying the calendar, the wrinkles and lines of the body,’ from that novel. ‘His dreams were always the same; boundaries, desire.’The gods punishment for Atlas was to trap him under the weight of the world, thus nullifying his strength. ‘They had captured his body, but not this thoughts,’ and in his solitude Atlas begins to consider the meaning of boundaries and freedom. Freedom, he observes, is something that can be best understood in relation to others as well.‘Why did the gods insist on limits and boundaries when any fool could see that these things were only rules and taboos – customs made to keep people in their place? Rebellion was always punished like this – by taking away what little freedom there was, by encasing the spirit.’Control is the name of the game here, such as Prometheus punished for giving fire to mortals (Heracles later frees Prometheus after understanding the unbearable weight of an endless punishment). Atlas considers how often we put up walls or restrict freedoms under the guise of ‘safety’—such as his own walled garden where the Golden Apples are kept—or engage in a creation of boundaries to curb desire. ‘Demarcation, check-points, border controls. And all in the name of freedom. Freedom for me means curbing you,’ he thinks, a passage that seemingly folds time to be a direct criticism of modern day politics. When Atlas asks Hera why the gods cannot grant his gift of knowledge of past, present and future to the mortals, she replies ‘Humankind continues in ignorance because knowledge destroys them. Everything that man invents he soon turns to his own destruction.’ For her, freedom is dangerous, something that must be controlled. ‘If I seem like fate to you,’ Hera says to Heracles, ‘it is because you have no power of your own,’ and we begin to observe Fate as the gods curbing our freedom. ‘How can I escape my fate?’‘You must choose your destiny.’In contrast to ‘the manner of infinite gentleness with which Atlas had resumed the impossible burden of the world,’ Heracles exists trying to dodge fate. His arc is one that is bent towards that fate, and no matter how hard he tries to escape it he finds himself redirecting himself straight for it. ‘The ancients believed in Fate because they recognised how hard it is for anyone to change anything. The pull of past and future is so strong that the present is crushed by it. We lie helpless in the force of patterns inherited and patterns re-enacted by our own behaviour. The burden is intolerable.’As David Foster Wallace said, ‘although of course you end up becoming yourself.’ In this, can we find a sense of freedom under the constraints of fate by instead choosing to see it as destiny? Do we find a fresh perspective on the hinge of connotations?‘No hero can be destroyed by the world. His reward is to destroy himself. Not what you meet on the way, but what you are, will destroy you, Heracles.’Honestly, I love Winterson’s depiction of Heracles as this sad, lonesome road warrior joylessly completing his tasks. ‘Is he a joke or a god?’ Atlas wonders, ‘his doubleness is his strength and his downfall. He is a joke and a god.’ Heracles is not depicted very flatteringly, prone of violence and sexual assault, and it is a delight to see him put in his place by Hera (Zeus being protective giving shrugs ‘as if to say, Women, what can you do with them?’ is comedic gold as well). The toxic aspects of him are writ large, though it doesn’t feel as pointedly critical like in Madeline Miller and instead assumes you’ll draw the conclusions on your own. Which is something I love about Winterson because Winterson believes in you, the reader, to connect dots that come across as heavy handed when other authors do it for you. But anyways, the portrait of him is one that observes how ‘Heracles’s strength was a cover for his weakness,’ and that even with all the strength in the world he cannot escape his fate. I adore the Heracles story as one of existential crisis, which is honestly more engaging than the Atlas story here if only because of how laced it is with a perfect blend of comedy and tragedy.‘Fate reads like the polar opposite of decision, and so much of life reads like fate.’What the gods they didn’t expect with Atlas was, while strict boundaries were enforced on his body, his mind would take flight towards freedom. This becomes a metaphor for the creative spirit and endurance of the artist and is also where Winterson does what I love best about Winterson novels: launch into philosophical discussions that launch us into the stratosphere of prose and thought. And in this we discover why the retelling is not just chronicling the journey of heroes, but the actual act of retelling becomes our own journey. ‘I thought that if I could only keep on telling the story,’ Winterson writes, ‘if the story would not end, I could invent my way out of the world.: This is a clear reference to the autobiographical details threaded through their novels, most notably the incredible Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit but they also crop up in almost every novel. The more you read the more you’ll recognize them.‘That’s why I write fiction – so that I can keep telling the story. I return to problems I can’t solve, not because I’m an idiot, but because the real problems can’t be solved. The universe is expanding. The more we see, the more we discover there is to see.Always a new beginning, a different end.’With each retelling a different stone can be turned over and examined, something new can be gleaned, and we hope that with each re-examination we are moving closer to some kind of truth that could set us free. Knowing we won’t reach it but believing anyways. This is one one of the most enduring beauties of literature. It’s why some of us read more and more, enjoying the release when an author hits a high note that reverberates through us so strongly we think we can feel our bones humming to the tune of the universe. It is how we try to escape fate and fumble to form a narrative that—we hope—is the pathway through the forest of life on a quest towards our destiny. Winterson discusses how when we are young we are rereading the narrative of our parents, but must inevitably set out on our own to write the stories of ourselves. It’s why the old myths matter: they are the lessons we use as a compass but we must write our own north star into the heavens of the Self to pursue our own sense of meaning. ‘Having no one to carry me, I learned to carry myself. My girlfriend says I have an Atlas complex,’ Winterson writes, and suddenly the reason for this specific retelling becomes clear.The phrase ‘I want to tell the story again’ repeats like a mantra across the novella Weight, a book that is short in length but deceptively so as it is deep in emotional resonance and meaning. While retellings are a popular topic, Winterson manages to do the original myths justice while still making them their own in a way that feels so unique and personal, I can’t help but gush enthusiasm for it. It traverses to a fitting end that becomes a modern myth all of its own. Sure, this is the first 4 star I’ve given Winterson, which isn’t a slight against it as I did enjoy this thoroughly but it doesn’t connect with the same power as the bigger titles. Still, Weight is a gorgeous achievement of prose and philosophical musings that examine fate, freedom, and the freeing power of storytelling.⅘‘Now he was carrying something he wanted to keep, and that changed everything.’...more",Notes are private!,0,176,1,"Nov 18, 2022","Nov 19, 2022","Nov 18, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15053.Weight

But instead I’m going to make something that didn’t exist before. And I think that’s beautiful.’What is the purpose of art? This is a question everyone from philosophers to the drunk next to you at the bar has grappled with since, well, someone first smeared some berries on a wall and someone was affected by it. You can always find the big, heavy quotations that attempt to maximize the beauty into a universal struggle for goodness and connectivity that improves us all, like Leo Tolstoy saying art ‘is a means of union among men, joining them together in the same feelings, and indispensable for the life and progress toward well-being of individuals and of humanity,’ but whew, if this is at a party it’ll kill the vibes pretty quickly. Besides, someone’s got a meme with good graphic design (I’m gonna guess a mountain range) of some shallow quote about Earth just being ‘eh’ without it that will basically cover the same grounds. Sharability, intended audience, subjectivity and what not. What I’m getting at is that maybe the power of art is an artwork all to itself. No, that sounds trite but the idea of letters colliding into a statement that will give a feeling is pretty cool at least, right? I’m getting carried away here What we are gathered for here today is to celebrate Zoe Thorogood and It’s Lonely at the Centre of the Earth, her marvelous ‘auto-bio-graphical novel’ that deals with art, depression, suicide, and just living a life. This is an exciting and wild ride through some heavy territory with a chaos of artistic styles (all of them extraordinary) and stories that form a larger portrait that feels pretty damn…human. There is a frenetic energy that roars forward through this highly metafictional memoir experiment that would feel twee or already well-trodden in lesser hands but becomes this incredible work that feels just as messy and lovely as real life should be. It is a controlled mess, one that is certainly well thought out but reads naturally. Sure, it might be a little over-the-top at times but that’s what makes it work—it pushes everything just a little too far because that zone is where magic is made.You are going to want to read this.  [image]This isn’t a light read, but Thorogood blends the harsh introspections with gallows humor and slapstick fun that keeps this bouncing forwards and impossible to put down. The art is fantastic, pivoting between styles and alternating between bright colors to black and white ink frames in a way that feels akin to the ups and downs of moods when struggling with depression. Which, to be fair, is a primary theme of this book. The story follows Zoe writing this book about writing herself for a period of six months, though it sways through the timeline of her entire life as well as into more abstract realms of her creative mind.   [image]This is a highly self-conscious book, capturing the very human inner contradictions and inner dialogues we all face, particularly during moments of self-doubt. Thorogood is very open and honest—often under the guise of self-deprecating humor—about her mental health, issues with life and struggles with her family. There is a discussion on depression being passed down through generations while the elder generations view mental health as a ‘dirty secret’ and don’t like how openly she speaks about her own, something I’ve experienced or seen far too often. This is a highly empathetic book, one that you may likely feel is showing you to yourself through the lens of her own self-analysis and so much so that she even jokes about how often people call her work relatable. It is existence exposed in all its messy flaws and joys, a book teeming with life and the feeling that ‘you’re getting older but you don’t know how to grow up.’Did I mention most people are drawn as people with animal heads? It is awesome. I love her art and vision so much.Some might be quick to dismiss some of the book as naval-gazing or too much pop philosophy, I think that those aspects are some of what makes it work best. Because it is self-conscious about that too, with Thorogood following up bold statements like ‘Reading a book, hearing a song, observing a painting—that’s connection. Sometimes wires get crossed and things get misinterpreted--but that’s pretty damn human, right?’ with a dismissal of it that she is ‘sucking her own dick.’ The self-conscious aspects there are real, and its a great technique (and you can quietly admit to yourself that the lofty moments actually are beautiful while still getting to laugh at yourself for it). This comes across screaming Cool then scowls at the idea of being cool. Which, let’s face it, is pretty cool. But ‘cool’ isn’t the point, because this is about struggling and trying to find your way. It’s so wrapped in layers of self-criticism and sneering at itself that it’s hard to get a hold on, but I think capturing that very thing is what makes this so well done.In the end, this is a book about experiencing and creating art. There are the moments about how it can help or heal, the old Picasso saying stuff like ‘art washes from the soul the dust of everyday life’ vibes. But more importantly the metafictional aspects of creating and how we are in turn created through critical analysis in the minds of others. ‘Zoe was hit with the horrible realization that she was, in fact, a real person. A real person whose art could be perceived and interpreted by other very real people,’ she writes at one point (with a nice line about her book getting polarizing ratings on Goodreads). Art is something we experience, and while it is an individual battle to create, it becomes a social item that everyone consumes, comments on, takes with them in their heart or leaves behind. There is also the fun aspect of realizing how much narratives shape our ideas about life. ‘I didn’t realize until later that the underdog was always the hero because all writers were losers at school,’ she observes at one point on her childhood belief in her own goodness. Which, at heart, is an early lesson on how art reaches out to hold your hand in moments of hardship. She begins to realize her earlier work The Impending Blindness of Billie Scott is very much about creating a narrative of who she is becoming who she wants to be, while this book about writing this very book is more a look at who she is afraid she is becoming.The Covid pandemic figures into the story as well, derailing her success after her first book by canceling her book tour and plunging her into solitude. Connectivity with others becomes a major concept she turns over, examining how much the self is observed as a product of other’s observations, though also how lonely one can be without it. She chronicles friendships, a failed romance and more. While life may not have any answers, what we arrive at here is lovely enough:‘Someone, somewhere, right now is being impacted by your existence—whether good or bad. That’s what I choose to believe this is all about. Not connection—but how we affect each other. Even at a distance.’That is as good as any reason to make art. Or to be you and communicate with others. I was touched by this a lot, remembering how I used to leave paintings with favorite poems written on them on trees around my town. Mostly just as an ‘I was here’ but also to hopefully have someone pause, read, and be touched by poetry even for only a moment. And hopefully feel good about the world. So yes, I believe this to be true. Zoe Thorogood’s It’s Lonely at the Centre of the Earth has affected me, I think it is marvelous, and now I am passing it along through this  that might affect you. All without ever really seeing or knowing each other. But I’m also shoving this into the face of every person that walks into the bookstore and library I work at. I hope Thorogood is doing well and will create more art. We can all benefit from being affected by it.5/5  [image]...more",Notes are private!,2,251,1,"Nov 17, 2022","Nov 17, 2022","Nov 17, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60760105-it-s-lonely-at-the-centre-of-the-earth

How easily and quickly that peace can be ruptured and we realize how thin the walls, how unguarded the gates, or how fragile the lives inside truly are. In Seven Empty Houses, the newest translated work from Samanta Schweblin, the Argentine master of uneasiness that brought us the tightly packed terrors of Fever Dream, the concept of homes and stability is constantly challenged. And not just from externally. Across these seven stories the idea of home becomes a space of disquiet as Schwebelin instills the anxieties of her narrator’s into the reader until we, too, are rocked by emotional discomfort. Neighbors begin to take on a tone of menace and grief cannot be held out even by locking the door. Beautifully translated by Megan McDowell, Seven Empty Houses is a chilling little collection that examines the spaces left by loss, our association with our own possessions (or lack of) and how stability and wellbeing is a fragile concept always ready to collapse.‘What kind of madness was all that?’Schweblin is able to turn any situation into one rife with fear, something best exemplified in all the domestic horrors in her previous short story collection, Mouthful of Birds. There is a uniqueness to her frights though, more creeping dread and unease than blunt terror which she builds by placing the reader in a narrator’s mind being destabalized by the vagueness and subtly threatening atmospheres around them. Houses plays with tropes of haunted houses, with grief being the lingering ghost to haunt the occupants (though one narrator does receive ghostly visits, something we are unsure is a haunting of specters or a haunted mind). The streets of Buenos Aires are cast in gothic atmospheres in stories such as Two Square Feet or Out, the former story featuring a woman on a quest for a pharmacy and the latter with a woman escaping a difficult conversation with her husband to wander the labyrinthian streets in just a bathrobe, both at night in the harsh contrast of shadows and streetlights. With Schweblin there is no need for monsters, as we are often our own most terrifying threats, a theme well explored in her look at our inability to use social technology without turning it into a nightmare in her previous novel, Little Eyes.‘She was sitting on two square feet, and that was all the space she took up in the world.’Occupying your own space is a concept always threatened in these stories, and windows figure prominently in several stories as a reminder of the gaze of our neighbors and society that seems bent on voyeurism into our personal lives. In It Happens All the Time in This House, even something as commonplace as taking out the trash becomes an opportunity for judgment from others, with the garbage man returning a bag of old clothes from the curb because they could be put to better use. Clothes become another common symbol in these stories, often as reminders of people now past or the selves we once were, and in the same story a couple’s feuding always ends with their deceased son’s clothes scattered in the neighbors yard. My Parents and Children a surreal story about the mental deterioration of a man’s parents—resulting running around the neighborhood leaving a trail of removed clothes in their wake—runs parallel to the deterioration of his former marriage as a new lover begins to replace him as a father figure. In these ways, possessions are often used as a signifier of one’s life. Packing objects into boxes becomes highly symbolic in several of these, such as the longest story Breath from the Depths where packing up a life is mirrored in the narrator's desire to pack up her life into the grave, or Two Square Feet where the boxes are a constant reminder of her transitional state and instability in life. Though the lack of objects also resonates with ideas of loss as well. The opening story, None of That, which is one of my favorites and made me feel so uncomfortable urging the characters to ‘get out of there’ with the same intensity of discomfort as in the scene hiding under the table in the film Parasite, features a mother’s fascination with fancy homes contrasting with her own lack. She is distraught that the people who have don’t even seem to appreciate what they have or know how to care for it like she can. It makes for a deliciously distressing story as the narrator must watch their mother’s instability threaten her own safety as she also watches the horror of the young mother and her own child as this woman races about their home.’That’s how I realize what it is that I want. I want her to look. I want her to move our things. I want her to inspect, set aside, and take apart. To remove everything from the boxes, to trample, rearrange, to throw herself on the ground, and also to cry.’The use of contrasting homes and houses speaks of a larger class issue, but also just a desire to be seen and understood by those who would turn their nose up otherwise.As is often with Schweblin, she hits parental horror the hardest. Which was a great success for her in Fever Dream. Here we often gaze into the absence left behind by the loss of a child, resonating years and years later such as in Breath from the Depths, a story featuring two different families that face the death of their sons. But there is also the horrors of seeing a child in peril or being unable to help. The Unlucky Man is a particularly good story that combines many of the themes, such as how the young girl narrating the story sees what should be the stability of joy on a birthday become a nightmare of a night. Her sister swallowing bleach, causing chaos as the family rushes to the hospital feels like a ‘affront’ to her. Later, sitting in the hospital without underpants, she must navigate by herself a man who is either a helpful stranger or, more likely, a sexual predator. The fear on the face of the parents in the final scene is palpable. ‘A deterioration that led knowhere.’The longest story, Breath from the Depths is more a novella than a short story and deals with all the themes of loss and deterioration from the failing mind of an old woman wishing for her own death as she begins ‘to fear the worst: that death required an effort she could no longer make.’ She suspects everyone of foul play, distrusting the neighbors and suspecting unhealthy relationships forming between her aged husband and the 12 year old boy next store. It is the best in the collection and is quite distressing, all culminating into a left-hook punch of a conclusion.‘Say something to solve this problem.’Life comes alive in all its menace in the words of Schweblin and Seven Empty Houses is a minor-key collection of anxieties. Winner of the National Book Award for Translation, this is a hit that holds to its themes like a center of gravity but allows the stories to drift in creative ways to address the themes from a wide variety of vantage points. Schweblin will sink under your skin in the best ways.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,0,184,1,not set,not set,"Nov 16, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60206505-seven-empty-houses

That they do not yet have words is both their struggle but also the purity of their impressions.

Margold loves to watch the world and think about it, or look through her alphabet book despite lacking the ability to read. Rose smiles, gets the affection of all who see her. The twins have a curiosity and loving understanding of each other, seeing in the other things they feel lacking in themselves. ‘Rose felt sometimes that she lacked depth,’ we are told, ‘she felt a little one-note, like a highly decorative cave painting,’ while Marigold wishes she could interact with the world more. ‘We have inner lives, Rose thought.’The story follows through the course of a year through a short series of impressions of the family, their garden, and all leads up to the twins' first birthday. There is a humorous confusion for Marigold that if they become one on their birthday, were they nothing before? This points forwards the impressions of mortality that permeate the story, with the non-existence before birth weighing on Marigold’s infant mind just as much as the absence after death. ‘Everything will disappear,’ she often thinks. This also leads to questions of existence, such as who she is herself, such as here when she observes herself amongst the family like a single seed amongst the hundred her mother uses for gardening: ‘Who am I, she thought to herself. Or really, which am I of the hundreds in the original packet…Marigold needed something that stood for herself as Rose stood for Rose.’While it all seems a bit much for an infant to be thinking of, the narrative implies that none of this occurs in words but in a grappling with impressions that is always just out of reach. There is a beautiful simplicity tinged with the twin’s frustrations because nothing ever makes full sense. ‘Marigold wanted to be prepared for change, which meant you had to learn to remember before you needed to remember.’In this way, the book becomes a look at language. There are impressions of the world we can form, yet without words to categorize and snare our ideas into something we can turn over in our mind, it is harder to understand them. It makes for a clever way to look at how the twins discover the world. ‘It was not a happy time, we are told after the Grandmother’s death, ‘this was the first the twins understood that word, happy, but they understood it because it was gone.’ Marigold learns how absence can be a great learning tool, understanding emotions only once they have passed and juxtaposing all feelings with others. Through all this, Marigold decides she wants to write a book and is always bending her mind towards that idea. No matter that she has yet to develop words. The desire for adulthood ‘with its vast cargo of words,’ becomes her desire for life, with all its aches, joys, pains and love.‘Long, long ago: that is how she would begin her book.’This is a lovely little philosophical narrative. I have long loved the poetry of Louise Glück (a favorite is Departure which I highly encourage reading) and Marigold and Rose feels like a natural extension of her poems. It captures the magic of words and the contradictions of life in such lovely prose and while it is bite-sized novella, it fills your mind like a meal.4.5/5...more",Notes are private!,4,141,1,"Nov 16, 2022","Nov 16, 2022","Nov 16, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59808598-marigold-and-rose

I rNow that the individual episodes have been bound together, I reread this arc as a total unit and I have to say that might be the better way to go. I really enjoyed this issue as a whole, it’s sort of a rebuilding arc that picks up after a few year gap to match the gap we all waited between issues, introduces a lot of new characters, and begins to push the story in a new direction. Which can be a bit cumbersome for many in terms of enjoyment as it takes a moment to really get a foothold into some of this. Personally, I’m excited about it all. Hazel has grown considerably and the story is starting to shift from the adults to this new, younger generation lost in space amidst warfare and other violence. There is a lot of great high points in this issue, from Hazel learning to play music (I love all the scenes with the volatile bandmates), Alana just trying to scrape by and being as badass as ever, a cute new direction for Squire, and the way it cycles back through a lot of characters we haven’t seen in awhile to reestablish where everything is at. Sure. this one doesn’t hit with the biggest action plot of all the issues. It takes its time to stretch the legs of the new narrative arc, but it is something I am certainly looking forward to watching grow.This is the rebuilding year. Which I think is often looked at as something negative, like, things will be rocky because it is ‘rebuilding’. But I always think back to when I entered High School and joined the Cross Country team, which has recently graduated almost all of it’s varsity members and was almost half new members. It was the rebuilding year, our coach kept saying. But instead of really worrying about wins or losses, he kept the focus on, well, building. The thing I remember most about that year was how much emphasis on fun and camaraderie there was. Because rebuilding isn’t just about finding your footing, but it’s also about experimenting and finding something new, and I think that is what this issue does well. It is sad to see many great characters go, but I am excited to get to know these new ones as well. This was worth the wait. I read each episode as they came out, which was a bit rough as so much of it felt too bitesized to really latch on. Reading it as one big issue made it feel much smoother and really take hold. I wish I could tell you I'd wait until the next full issue to read it again knowing this, but I can't. I know damn well the moment an episode goes live I will instantly gobble in up and bask in my joy and regret. Oh!

She dives into a social norm and explodes it to analyze The world becomes a nightmare of manners through the eyes of Japanese novelist Sayaka Murata. She dives into a social norm and explodes it to analyze how it’s gears adjust the clockwork of society. Through a slight twist of the themes into a something taboo, she reflects it back at us like a portrait of absurdity. A Clean Marriage, a short story by Murata, looks at sex in marriage from the point of view of a couple that views a good partnership as something that would prefer to not have sexual cravings of the other. The friction starts, however, because they want to have a baby. Through Murata’s destabilizing vision, we get a humorous and unsettling look at fertility clinics that uses the absurdity to unpack the social norms around sexual relationships.Published in Granta in 2015 in translation from Ginny Tapley Takemori (you can read it here), this is a stand-alone story that was not included in Murata’s recently translated collection of stories, Life Ceremony. Readers of Earthlings will find the set-up familiar, as the explanation of how the narrator met her husband through a dating service when he asked for a partner in a sexless marriage seems to be a draft of a very similar scene in that novel (though in the novel the aspect of needing a partner to avoid the social stigma against unmarried adults is far more emphasized). This story is quick and Murata’s style of unsettling humor is on full display. I did quite enjoy the positive discussions on asexuality and her attempts to break down ideas of marriage to examine the social functions of them in a way that separates them from sexual attractions and impulses. It all leads to a rather double entendre climax in a comically yet threateningly bizzare scene in the experimental fertility clinic that specializes in “clean sex” for conception.The translator includes a brief yet helpful introduction about the use of the word ‘clean’ in the title. She explains ‘the Japanese word seiketsu can refer both to something that isn’t dirty, and to a person’s character as straightforward, without deceit,’ and many of the English terms were problematic because most of the ‘options seemed to be making a judgement that wasn’t there in Japanese, and clean appealed as being simple and provocative.’ This is a fun little story for those who have enjoyed Murata’s work and would also work well as an introduction to her exciting and bizarre visions. 3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,-1,118,1,not set,not set,"Nov 15, 2022",,,view (with text),/book/show/53036105-a-clean-marriage

Merwin and truly falling in love with poetry. Appointed US Poet Laureate from 2001-2003, Collins is a fun and rather accessible poet that can open people up to poetry when they are looking for a first foothold into it. I’ve always had a bit of a soft spot for him, though after my initial excitement for him I did find him to be a bit too ‘old, white man humor’ and sort of cooled on needing to read him. Musical Tables, his 2022 release, is a rather unfortunate exercise in attempting short poetry, becoming more a collection of bad puns and ‘dad jokes’ that are more likely to make you cringe than cheer. Take the poem Carbon Dating, for example, that says a man ‘tried it once’ but ‘the women / were a million years old.’ This is rather eye roll inducing (and reminds me that poems such as Taking Off Emily Dickinson’s Clothes were always a bit…uncool?). There are some moments that can be rather cute, but then fall apart, such as the poem ‘Aa’, the title written the way the letter A would appear on an alphabet list in elementary school when learning to write letters. He describes the letter pair as ‘capital and small, / parent and child’ and the image of them holding hands is rather adorable, but then the conclusion saying they are ‘about to cross / the street / in Alphabet City’ is almost too cutesy and kind of cheesy. There’s just nothing really to cling to here and not much beneath the surface beyond the wordplay that relies too heavily on cheesy jokes with each poem made entirely out of singular images that would likely work better folded into the context of a larger poem but feel sparse and silly on their own. For example, The Visit, which reads in it’s entirety:‘The wind blewopen the front doorand sat downin my father’s chair.’feels akin to the more recent Charles Simic collections of condensed poems, though in Simic’s sparseness there is still a surreal quality that tends to pack the horrors of history and more inside while Collins tends to be wordplay without much beneath. There are some good ones still, like comparing falling asleep as ‘walking backwards / into a dark forest’ sweeping away ‘my footprints / of existence’ as he goes. Or View from a Bridge has an image I quite enjoy:I never thoughtof myselfas a little universeinside a big oneuntil just now.The trouble is there are only a small handful that work and register more as a relief than actual enjoyment when packed in with so many awkward ones. Honestly this whole collection feels like being embarrassed by your grandpa at dinner in public as he is too loudly making bad jokes. Because you get stuff like:The Code of the WestSay what you wantAbout me,But leave the horseI rode in on out of itAnd it’s just like OKAY, STOP IT, and then you flip the page and find a poem titled Henry Wadsworth Longfellow reads in its entirety ‘Trouble / was not / his middle name’ and you start yelling for the check and hoping to whatever god you choose that he isn’t going to pinch the waitress. He ""puts the ‘fun’ back in profundity,” says Alice Fulton in the cover blurb, which is more of a poem than most of these because both ‘fun’ and ‘profundity’ are doing a lot of ironic heavy lifting.Collins does have a fascination with short poems and even wrote a book about haikus, so I will congratulate him on trying something new that fits his interests. In the intro he references really enjoying the short poems by Simic, or Kay Ryan, and talks about how lovely the W.S. Merwin poem is that simply reads: ‘Elegy / Who would I show it to’. Honestly, the intro is the best part of the book and is a reminder that Collins actually does have great stuff to say and can say it well:‘small poems are drastic examples of poetry’s way of squeezing large content into tight spaces. Unlike haiku, the small poem has no rules except to be small. Its length, or lack of it, is is only formal requirement.’Its just unfortunate these do not work very well, especially since I, too, love the short poems the best. I think having picked the best 8-10 and making them a part of a collection with various styles and lengths would have worked significantly better because here it just feels like too much and not enough all at the same time. It isn’t necessarily that he went for humor that is the problem, as many pull this off well (James Tate comes to mind for similar sort of similarly cornball but effective humor). I think the micro fiction of Lydia Davis is a good style to examine for this, as she uses humor but the work does not fully rely on the humor in order to be effective or stick. She also excels at packing so much that is implied, yet still vague, into a small space of words that compels you to toss and turn them in your mind and discover a deeper story and implications almost as a co-creater. I think short poems work best when they leave a big sting but also ache long after, having a reason to stick by you. These seem to aim at eliciting a laugh and, for the most part, are entirely forgotten by the time you turn the page.If you are a big Collins fan, you might enjoy this and should still check it out. It wasn’t for me. I think there is a big push for poems that are small and compact though, especially as they are easy to share on social media and can make one point really effectively that sticks with you. I sometimes wish poets like Divya Victor who is winning lots of awards could get the publisher marketing benefits of a book like this. It just won’t be this book, but I am glad to see Collins is still working and still experimenting. Good for him.

You end up being a secondary character in your own life.’Uh, holy shit. I’m typing this during the “I’m not crying, you’re crying” moments immediately upon finishing Ballad for Sophie, a graphic novel about the life of a fictional famous pianist superstar. Beginning in a small village in 1933 France, young, wealthy Julien Dubois first hears François Samson, the impoverished son of a janitor, perform piano in a competition and their brief meeting kicks off a sweeping, emotional epic as their lives are irrevocably intertwined. Told as a series of interviews to a young journalist as Julien, now a recluse, is dying from cancer, this is a visually stunning tale of of jealousy, war, fame, shame and—of course—music. Written by Filipe Melo, gorgeously illustrated by Juan Cavia with background art by Juan Cruz Rodriguez, and translated from the Portuguese by Gabriela Soares, the writer and illustrators backgrounds in cinematography and directing are evident as reading this feels as close to viewing a big budget blockbuster film in a theater. It relies on a lot of musician bio-pic tropes, though being couched in the familiar also allowed it to extract an incredible amount of emotion. It gave me chills at times, pulled the heartstrings like it was conducting an orchestra, had a few good laughs, but what resonates most is the tenderness amidst it all.   [image]This truly felt like a historical fiction film epic. The story follows Julien, though he insists to the journalist that he does not want to be the subject of her article, as he traces the path of his life, always living with an aware that François Samson is somewhere out there. And making music he believes is impossibly good. When his mother bribes the judges to allow Julien to win despite François being the clear victor, it sets up a jealousy where Julien just wants to beat him honestly. While their lives go in different directions, Julien always has François at the back of his mind like an itch he cannot scratch. Even as an old, weed smoking, former musician who hasn’t touched a piano in years, he still listens to François every day.  [image] François (left) and Julien at two different, fateful meetingsThis book gives the scenes a moment to breathe, taking place over many decades and keeping a steady and engaging pace. We watch a young Julien living on the streets and bonding with the other unhoused people during the war, and then using his mother’s connections to give up his self-hood and identity to become Eric Bonjour, a multi-million record selling artist. But does fame satisfy a true artist when they are merely a puppet on the strings of corporate record labels?   [image]The book does tend towards a lot of clichés, such as Julien diving into ye ole spiral of sex, drugs, and rock’n’roll, the affair, the abusive producer (who is drawn as a big evil goat because that is how Julien remembers him), and the twist ending, though it also is part of what makes it seem like such a big Hollywood-style narrative. The familiar territory embeds it into the whole cannon of music films, making it a cozy place to nestle within and harmonize with the emotions the art and writing is able to extract. Also it gives the artist the opportunity to do a few pretty impressive drug scenes:  [image]But most importantly, it makes your impression of Julien a roller coaster of emotion, which, obviously, the journalist is also experiencing. After the life of the streets scenes full of camaraderie, we watch Julien discover ‘suddenly, in this story, the villain…was me.’ Melo’s biggest achievement is creating flawed characters that, even in their darkest moments, we can still empathize with. Is there a redemption arc coming, we must ask ourselves, and why does Julien seem so content in his dying days? There are also some extremely touching moments in this book, and Melo does well by creating moments that are somehow both tender and dark or upsetting at the same time.  [image]Don’t say “aww” too soon on this one…Ballad for Sophie took hold of me and I could not put it down. This is a big, epic tale and I love the framing of how, despite Julien being the center of the story, he is the secondary character for much of the tale with the mystery of François always on slow burn. Someone else is always making anything happen for him too, and must learn to embrace himself and find his own sense of self-agency. It’s a moving story with extraordinary artwork that helps make everything resonate and it seems only a matter of time before this is picked up for a miniseries or film. It’s also one of the few times I’ve found a graphic novel to have a lot of really quotable lines. You’ll laugh, cringe and cry at this one, and even the pretty glaring moments of cliche are more or less excusable in the context of the full effect.

This book is gorgeously illustrated with a sharp character design and excellent use of vibrant colors that radiate autumnal vibes across the boarding school setting where young women are educated in the ways of witchcraft. When a student’s disappearance parallels the unsolved disappearance of a girl decades earlier—rumored to have been taken by a demon that stalks the woods beyond the schoolgrounds—Abigail and her friends risk expulsion and death to uncover the truth against the wishes of the Headmistress and the ruling coven.

Dark academia with a witchcraft angle isn’t exclusive to HP, but it admittedly feels quite similar at times and has a few similar twists. Though Sweeny Boo makes it feel rather fresh nonetheless, and almost like a queer reclamation, and the overall aesthetics and vibes are something like witchcraft noir. Though the detective work Abigail and friends down library corridors instead of dark alleyways and instead of fog everything is awash in golden hour light rays and falling leaves. The characters are often small against their ornate settings, Boo’s color palettes are breathtaking and the use of light is astonishingly good. While a lot of modern YA graphic novels tend towards aesthetics and style seemingly influenced by Studio Ghibli, Boo’s settings and especially the use of light feel more akin to the stylings of Makoto Shinkai films.

Uncertainty if Enver can be trusted, being tailed by the mean-spirited Violet, the adults betraying shady motives and using administrative politics to their advantage push the stakes higher and higher, not to mention being mauled by a demon is also a possibility. The characters are great and it is fun to watch them move through their ulterior motives with some nice twists and budding romances in the mix, though Seymour the snarky cat familiar is one of the most endearing (okay, fair, snarky cat familiar is a bit cliched at this point and none can ever top Gigi from Kiki's Delivery Service). There is an attempt at least for inclusivity of skin color and body types (less though for the latter as most characters are drawn as very slender and beautiful) and the character design reminds me a bit of Yana Bogatch’s gorgeously illustrated figures in Grimoire Noir, another witchcraft noir that you should check out if you enjoyed this.  [image]Count me as scaredDid I mention there are some truly unsettling moments? Boo has some very creepy moments where the artwork really delivers some frights. It all boils over into a pretty dramatic climax full of big reveals and magical action and while that scene is a bit rocky on pacing, Boo’s use of collaged frames colliding or overlapping is a great technique to convey motion and organize the actions of multiple characters. I honestly cannot praise the art in this enough.So if you like dark academia, witches or just a good creepy mystery, Over My Dead Body is for you. This was so much fun and I would love to see a whole series of stories set in this world.

When it ends, a good novel still lingers in the mind and sometimes we find ourselves missing the characters like a friend we wish we could phone up and check on. Hiromi Kawakami feels the same about her own characters she creates, writing Parade as a brief ‘memento of a story that has ended,’ and returning us to the relationship between Tsukiko and her former teacher, Sensei from her lovely novel Strange Weather in Tokyo. Elegantly translated by Allison Markin Powell and with soothing and sweet illustrations by Takako Yoshitomi of geometric faces and shapes in two-colors, Parade is a brief yet beautiful fable-like story within a story that returns us to the sweetness of old friends in a passing, tender moment.Kawakami has become an author I turn to when I need a little dose of serenity. Her writing, always expertly translated by Allison Markin Powell, just puts me in a peaceful state that allows the emotions of her stories to wash over me like a cool breeze through a field on a warm day. Parade is short, easily a one-sitting short story read, but it captures this feeling and is such a nice snack of storytelling. It has an endearing innocence to it. We begin with Sensei asking Tsukiko to tell him a story as the odd couple picnics outdoors, weaving their tenderness touching hands in the field with a fairy tale-esque story about her as a child followed around by two tengu, mischievous creatures of Japanese mythology.   [image]Illustration of a tenguI’m reminded of something I read where Haruki Murakami mentioned it is a shame Western readers usually demand a story have a purpose, that there should be some direct ‘point’ or clear message, and that he enjoys allowing a story to just be a story. Parade would fit the latter and I actually felt a bit of an affinity between this and some of the anecdotes that add texture and nuance to his novels. Which is much of the charm here with Kawakami attempting to capture the ineffable through a chronicle of images and emotions that don’t necessarily add up to anything concrete yet linger in the mind as meaningful and emotionally poignant nonetheless. Like memories of childhood that seem too big to be contained. And there are some beautiful moments here. Much of the story, awash in fable qualities, deals with children all having some sort of mythological creature that harmlessly attaches themselves to them and there is a vague understanding of it as a sort of coming-of-age milestone. The illness of Tsukiko’s tengu coincides with childhood cruelty shown to a member of her class, and, like the best of fables, ideas on morality lurk just under the surface. Yuko shouldering the cruelty with grace becomes a beautiful idea that Tsukiko can only partially grasp, and the imagery of glowing skin and the kindness of her voice resonates well as something you observe but feel it is too delicate to actually touch, like a butterfly’s wings.‘I realized something in that moment. Yuko had somehow resigned herself to the situation. She had given up being sad or being disappointed. Just like my grandmother when she had taken her last breath, Yuko had purposely stopped feeling things.’The one catch about this book is that it reminded me that I kind of don’t like Sensei. Even Tsukiko gets annoyed with him—he is fairly critical of her and blunt—but she also acknowledges that ‘Sensei will be…Sensei,’ so good for her and him making it work. Men in Kawakami books do tend to get a lot of passes for uncool behavior and the women tend to be easily pushed around, which isn’t my favorite, but her novels are breathtaking nonetheless.Parade is a lovely little read that fans of Strange Weather in Tokyo are sure to enjoy, though it would still work if you had not read the original. It is a cute moment, one it is nice to see paused to bask in it’s tenderness before it is washed away in all the other little moments that make up a life. Short, sweet, and very fablesque, a charming little read.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,0,158,1,"Nov 08, 2022","Nov 08, 2022","Nov 08, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/44146682-parade

Books like Circe or The Song of Achilles bridge time to show how the themes are still very relevant today and have a throughline of feminist examination that really catches hold. Galatea is a short story by Miller that dives into the myth of Pygmalion and Galatea from the perspective of Galatea, the former statue brought to life. This is not what you remember from Ovid but something that becomes original and unique in Miller's prose. First published in 2013, then included in xo Orpheus: Fifty New Myths it is now receiving a stand-alone 2022 publication as a gorgeous little hardback volume. Short but full of lasting power and insight, Galatea examines misogyny in its forms of abuse, control and the oppression of unrealistic expectations of beauty as well as Galatea’s role as a mother trying to provide care and love, and is a lovely little read.‘Haven’t you ever touched a statue?’The story of Galatea, the statue come to life as a wish fulfilled by Aphrodite for the young sculptor Pygmalion, has long influenced art through the ages with sculptures so lifelike they seem on the verge of life becoming a common trope such as in Shakespeare’s The Winter's Tale. In fact, the 1964 musical My Fair Lady starring Audrey Hepburn is only two retellings removed from the myth of Galatea by way of playwright George Bernard Shaw’s Pygmalion. Miller’s approach to the story by placing us in the mind of Galatea makes her existence less romanticized by showing how concepts of ownership and expectations of beauty are stifling to her. Her very fluid and confessional prose presents the story in a way where the setting could be anywhere, and though it is presumably still in the setting of the original tale, the vagueness and modern feel to the language allow it to seem like it could be occurring in the modern world as well. It is effective as it demonstrates that the themes in the story have been issues for women throughout all of history and linger today.‘­People began to talk about the sculptor’s wife, and how strange she was, and how such beauty comes only from the gods.’Having been created by her husband, his sense of ownership over her is rather oppressive. Though it is almost more metaphorical about the patriarchal ideas that wives are the property of men as his behavior is very typical of any jealous husband. For instance, he fires the tutor for looking at her and is angered Galatea was aware of his gaze and did nothing, the irony being that she knows everyone looks at her because she is a curiosity and he formed her to be the most beautiful woman alive. When he notices marks on her due to having carried a child, he wishes he could chisel them away despite her remark that it is a natural part of life. Beauty, in his eyes, must be unrealistic perfection, and any aspect of the beauty that is found in reality, where imperfections are also lovely, he rejects because it does not serve his idealized expectations. His insistence for her to be compliant and grateful is incongruous with the reality of her being an independent woman with an interior life and not merely a statue who’s entire identity is bent towards serving his desire:‘The thing is, I don’t think my husband expected me to be able to talk. I don’t blame him for this exactly, since he had known me only as a statue, pure and beautiful and yielding to his art. Naturally, when he wished me to live, that’s what he wanted still, only warm so that he might fuck me. But it does seem foolish that he didn’t think it through, how I could not both live and still be a statue.’This all works very well, with Miller making the story of a living statue parallel to the familiar talking points in feminist writings about relationships. In 12 Bytes: How We Got Here. Where We Might Go Next, Jeanette Winterson compares the idea of Galatea to the modern sex-dolls and the rather unsettling advances to make them more lifelike with modern computer tech, writing that ‘doll-world reinforces the gender at its most oppressive and unimaginative,’ normalizing the idea of compliant sexual ‘partners’ ‘made to look like the male-gaze stereotype’ with no sense of identity beyond pleasing, able to take endless abuse without complaining, and never having an independent thought. Sure, these are lifeless objects, but Galatea is stuck in an existence where that mindset of her as a lifeless object is still imposed upon her and in reality, the mindset of many abusive partners in the world try to impose these standards on women. There is also an interesting, albeit brief, element that while the choice over reproductive rights and agency is a hotly debated political topic and women are often shamed and ostracized for making difficult choices, there is no social stigma against men who do not want to have children. While we watch Galatea being denied any agency in her life and accepting a lot of abuse and made to feel it is for her own good (when Pygmalion hurts her and notices the color of the bruises left behind, he tells her ‘You make the rarest canvas, love’), we also see her fight for the good of her daughter. The ending, which is rather darkly beautiful, is geared to the idea of protection, though retribution also inevitably factors in. In a way it is a call to break the cycles of abuse and ensure the coming generations are raised to know they do not need to accept the toxic behaviors that try to masquerade as love. This is a brief story, easily read in a sitting, but it is such an excellent analysis of the original tale via a new narrative. I was extra excited to find this story as my community is currently doing a community read of Circe with Miller giving a talk and interview later this week. Quick, but full of insight, Galatea is a lovely little read.3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,2,262,1,not set,not set,"Nov 07, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60105524-galatea

There never seems to be enough time in the day for all the joys and sorrows it may bring, enough time for all the work, reading, laughter or quality time with loved one. ‘If only we could put the world on hold,’ Kate Baer muses in her third collection of poetry, And Yet, and demonstrates how, perhaps, we can very well do so through poetry. Poetry puts a moment on pause and allows you to open it up, unpack the viscera of emotions and examine the bones of living, and across this volume we watch Baer chronicle many moments worth pausing on. The poems here gaze inwards to capture Baer’s self-reflections, particularly on motherhood and marriage, as well as outward to discuss topics like misogyny and the COVID pandemic. It's a bit light and could certainly go deeper, but the quick flashes of recognizable emotions seem to be the aim and in that it succeeds. Through the highs and lows, Baer asks us ‘to witness one / life’s miserable devastation and / see her reach, instead, for joy,’ and delivers it all in succinct poetry full of humor and wit.IdeaI will enjoy this life. I will open itlike a peach in season, suck the juicefrom every finger, run my tongue overmy chin. I will not worry about clichésor uninvited guests peering in my windows.I will love and be loved. Save and be saveda thousand times. I will let the want intomy body, bless the heat under my skin.My life, I will not waste it. I will enjoy this life.This is a short collection and many of the poems are quite short, but they also pack a lot of emotion within them. Baer became an instant hit with her 2020 debut, What Kind of Woman, full of strong feminist themes and empowering reflections that were wonderfully succinct and quotable, making them ideal posts to be shared and reshared on social media as a very difficult year was coming to a close. Her honest examinations of womanhood and criticisms of misogyny in her book of poems as well as her online blog received a lot of pushback and toxic responses which, in the mindset of the maxim about when life hands you lemons, she creatively transformed into poetic lemonade through erasure poems or poetic retellings of these emails in her second collection I Hope This Finds You Well. Here we return to more to the style of her first collection, though poems such as Reasons to Log Off that discusses the cruelty of strangers on the internet keeps her second book always close to mind as well. The poems vary across settings and scenarios like putting kids to bed, hating a move to a new home, waiting in a COVID testing facility, or simply feeling the exhaustion of life. But not everything is harsh examinations or poems about grief. Baer has a fun sense of humor, such as poems like ‘Writing Poems High/On Twitter’, or exploring alternative words to make the slang acronym ”Milf” (ending on ‘Mother I’d like to free’) or even that her headstone should one day read ‘Honestly just a really good time.’ There is a wonderful balance of emotions that keep this collection feeling light and playful amidst all the grief.‘How foolish we are / to believe what we love won’t end.’Baer gives a lot of space for introspection here, or, as she puts it. to ‘walk down to the river of myself / and see what I have always known.’ These poems are often easy to identify with or laugh with, which makes them quite catching. ‘Where are the poems / about the grief of two ordinary people / who fell in love?’ she asks, opting to write them herself with poetry about ordinary and everyday life carrying both joy and grief. There are close-ups of marriage, not shirking away from flaws and failures while still capturing moments of coziness and peace, and plenty of thoughts on parenthood wondering what we can actually pass along to children when we, as adults, are caught in the mess of a society we often make messier. But most of all, Baer captures moments when the walls are down and the armor is off and we can’t do anything but face ourselves.‘You ask me my intentionsbut darling, I have none.I only have desire.’This is a quick and fun collection that will certainly please fans and likely attract newcomers as these poems seem destined for social media feeds much like the first collection. Baer naturally gets comparisons to Rupi Kaur, and does feel like a more matured and formal few steps further than the insta-poetry scene that was quite popular a few years ago while still having a similar shareability. They can seem a bit slight, but the accessibility is nice and welcoming, and anyone can find something to identify with in these pages. And Yet reminds us to pause on moments and drink deeply from them to get the most out of life.3.5/5If You Were to Ask for the Secret to a Happy Marriageafter Leah Naomi GreenI would tell you how the fire beetle matesonly when the chaparral is burning.How the prologue changes when youwrite the second act.

I have been consistently blown away by her openness and insights, and in Happening Ernaux bravely and directly examines her abortion in 1963 when she was a young college student. While Ernaux writes that she had to ‘guard against lyrical outbursts such as anger or pain’ and removes much of the emotion, the reader is nonetheless threaded along on the emotional currents of fear and socially-induced shame that had undeniably engulfed her during this time. This is a quick read and although it is short in page length at just 93pgs—typical for Ernaux—it looms large in depth and impact: to read Ernaux books is like microdosing emotional devastation and I cannot get enough. Happening is a very heavy book that deals with a highly polarizing subject that, in the US, is once again a very timely subject 20 years after it was written and 60 years after the events within when France still had not legalized women’s reproductive rights. I am in awe of Ernaux for confronting her memories with such grace and openness, dissecting how the ban in the 60s didn’t reduce instances and only made them more dangerous as well as created a social stigma that exponentially piled shame and ostracization on already suffering and terrified women as the ‘sheer experience of life and death gave way to exposure and judgment.’. Ernaux has once again destroyed me with her words.‘I shall have no more power over my text, exposed to the public just like my body was exposed at the Hôtel-Dieu Hospital.’ What always impresses me most with Ernaux is how in her act of writing her memories, be they intended as memoir or thinly disguised as fiction, they reproduce and investigate the social and emotional contexts of the time period in order to better convey the depicted events. Ernaux is also conscious of how the act of writing informs upon ideas of memoir, each book feeling like those clear models of cars that show the engine running within and remind you how each element is consciously tuned and coordinated for the full effect. ‘After all, imagining and remembering are the very essence of writing,’ she writes and elegantly weds the two. But this is important in a book that is so open and bluntly honest, one she knows will receive as much judgment as the act she recounts and she writes to capture that.‘Above all I wished to capture the steady flow of unhappiness…The distress I experience on recalling certain images and on hearing certain words is beyond comparison with what I felt at the time: these are merely literary emotions; in other words they generate the act of writing and justify its veracity.’She tells us she is not writing from a place of regret and has always stood by her decisions as being the right one for her at the time, even stating ‘I know that this ordeal and this sacrifice were necessary for me to want to have children,’ which she would later in life. What is most important is that she adds her voice, one she says is important because once something is legalized ‘former victims tend to remain silent on the grounds that “now it’s all over,”’ and become ‘surrounded by the same veil of secrecy as before.’ She says she can avoid writing as an act of capturing rebellion and ‘face the reality of this unforgettable event,’ but also I believe this act of writing adds her to the list of women who showed empathy, comfort and aid to her during this time and allows her to be that comfort to another who may be reading this because ‘knowing that hundreds of other women had been through the same thing was a comfort to me.’ Many people across the world need that just as much today as ever.‘As was often the case, you couldn’t tell whether abortion was banned because it was wrong or wrong because it was banned. People judged according to the law, they didn’t judge the law.’What resonates so urgently in Happening is the social stigmas, shame and danger women face when reproductive rights are denied to them, a right that Simone de Beauvoir claims is essential to women’s liberation in The Second Sex. Potential readers be aware this may be an uncomfortable read for many reasons (inevitably this  as well), and Ernaux addresses that directly:‘I realize this account may exasperate or repel some readers; it may also be branded as distasteful. I believe that any experience, whatever its nature, has the inalienable right to be chronicled. There is no such thing as a lesser truth. Moreover, if I failed to go through with this undertaking, I would be guilty of silencing the lives of women and condoning a world governed by male supremacy.’At the time I read this, the United States was less than a week away from an election where in my state reproductive rights were the primary battleground just months after the US Supreme Court overturned Row vs. Wade. This book certainly hit hard, as the dangers and stigmas Ernaux elucidates are becoming a reality in many states. Luckily most states here have shown up in support of reproductive rights, with total bans proving extremely unpopular and losing most elections. Yet, without being codified into the constitution this is still an issue that is always looming.‘In my diary I wrote: “I am pregnant. It’s a nightmare.”’Ernaux writes ‘the thing growing inside me I saw as the stigma of social failure,’ and as a college student who wishes to pursue academic arts, she writes that it would deny her access into that world and return her to the working class. Similarly, her pregnancy would be viewed as just another ‘inescapable fatality of the working-class—the legacy of poverty—embodied by both the pregnant girl and the alcoholic.’ She writes that ‘I had stopped being “an intellectual.” I don’t know whether this feeling is widespread. It causes indescribable pain,’ and finds that she had ‘become an emotional outcast.’ The class aspects are interesting, as she knows there are avenues available but her social and financial status are massive barriers to them. Doctors won’t risk helping her (one even prescribed her medicine that prevents miscarriages while giving the impression he is helping), friend’s judge, and men seem to approach her with a sick fascination that unsettles her except ‘the only person who failed to show an interest was the boy who had gotten me pregnant.’ She notes, however, that for all the social ostracization of those who choose to abort, the same, if not worse, is heaped on single mothers that either chose or were forced to carry to term. Remembering the cruel dismissal of a single mother in the hospital by the nursing staff, Ernaux notes ‘Girls who abort and unwed mothers from working-class Rouen were handed the same treatment. In fact, they probably despised her even more.’ We see how either choice ends in a justification for society to devalue anyone who gets pregnant. Most writers on the subject will also mention this only gets worse with each marginalized intersectional identity.‘So, by all means, don’t have an abortion, if you’re personally opposed to them. But the state policing of pregnant bodies is a form of misogynistic control, one whose effects will be most deeply felt by the most vulnerable girls and women. And this, in my book, is simply indefensible.’- Kate Manne, EntitledThe worst is that, without safe options, Ernaux must enter into dangerous procedures. Her first attempt on her own lands her in the hospital where she is judged by doctors. The procedure she has done on her also ends up with her near death in the hospital, being in complete fear for her life and being shouted at by a doctor so much that ‘I believed he might actually let me die.’ Ernaux does not shirk from directly presenting the events, noting that rarely in fiction does an abortion actually get described. ‘It’s an indescribable scene, life and death in the same breath. A sacrificial scene,’ she says. To write so bluntly and openly, I believe, is Ernaux’s way of being true to herself but also an attempt to pick away at the stigma. She briefly compares those who illegally perform abortions in 1960’s France to those who smuggle refugees across borders in the present day. ‘No one questions the laws and world order that condone their existence,’ she says, but wonders if for both there is ‘a sense of honor.’ For the record, France legalized abortion in 1975.‘In my student bathroom, I had given birth to both life and death.’This is an intense read, but one that is courageously and beautifully written. I can’t stop thinking about the divide between those who showed cruelty and those who showed compassion to college-aged Ernaux during this time, and how much the aid of others meant so much to her 30 years later as she wrote the book. This is an excellent examination of memory along with the story, the way she finds what she remembers most shows that ‘true memory has to be material,’ and the way memory swaps in other’s faces on key people who we cannot remember much about. Ernaux continues to amaze me and I am awed at her handling of such a difficult subject in her own life while also allowing her story to shed light on society at large.

With a very loose but also very expressive character design, Bryon keeps up a fast pace bouncing between school, home, and parties while juggling dialogue and interior monologues across scenes or back and forth through time that really pushes the story forward without ever feeling cluttered or confusing. I like the simple use of only one color per scene, changing to match moods or time of day and Bryon effectively gets a lot of emotion and energy across.  [image]The characters are fantastic and we get a lot of character development for such a short book. Madeline seems like the perfect, got-it-all-together girl on the outside, but inside she is riddled with anxiety (she is still reeling from frequent bullying in the past) and her grades are teetering towards failing to graduate. As the frenetic story of reverse burglary goes on, Ella and Madeline have to confront the difficult-to-love aspects of each other and choose to help the other grow instead of walk away. They are aided by Ella’s best friend, the caustic Leslie, though a big part of the story is a reminder that you can’t just want your best friends around during bad times and need to allow them to be there for the good ones as well. The surprise twist on who Leslie’s boyfriend is was great and the dynamic of the two couples makes for a really heartwarming second half to the book.I love stories like this that manage to be fun and upbeat while still dealing productively with issues of mental health and self-confidence. This book is a great reminder that people’s interior life likely does not match the outward front they present to the world, and that Bryon really embraces flawed characters and makes them more loveable with their quirks and shortcomings is really wonderful.

It’s a cute story about feeling you aren’t good enough and having to face your fears told through lovely artwork and fun aesthetics, and while it does feel a bit short it makes for a fun, heartwarming read.I really enjoyed the art in this book and the minimal use of color really works, especially how Lorinczi uses the color pink to denote when something is ‘magic’. It works by giving visual cues in place of having to explain, which I thought was quite well done. The character design is also great and I like how Margot and Elena are written as flawed but quite likable, in fact their moments of anger and sassiness makes them all the more endearing especially as you see them later feel regret over it. But mostly, the story is just super cute and I like them as a enemies-to-lovers trope.  [image]The only issue is this story seems to end just as it is getting off the ground, with the set-up being the majority of the story before very quickly resolving. It is still a lot of fun though. And how could in not be, with withcraft and indie-bands being the main aspect of the book and some fun world-building with a witch society that and Margot’s business that has a Kiki's Delivery Service-type vibe to it. Also her snake familiar is super awesome. I also really liked how they come together to help solve each others problems and the whole book culminates in a concert. So if you like cute witches and music, definitely pick this up. It is fluffy and sweet and certainly satisfying, like the titular chocolate doughnuts!3.5/5  [image]...more",Notes are private!,0,56,1,not set,not set,"Nov 03, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60610214-doughnuts-and-doom

You know, this one:  [image]Stephen Gammell’s artwork for these books was so frightening that it was frequently a target for book bannings in the 90s (though the stories were thought to be too frightening as well and alarmed the usual subjects who get all giddy for Satanic Panic) and there was even a reprinting of all three volumes with different, toned down illustrations. Which of course, nobody wanted because it was the artwork that was half the fun. But the stories themselves are quite charming. Alvin Schwartz is a folklorist and set out to craft a sort of Grimm-style series of stories for American children’s literature. There are many fairy tale and folklore elements to these books, especially a large moral warning for children who misbehave (one story that always scared me was the children’s parents leaving and sending in a monster to raise the children because they had it coming). One element I found really exciting as a kid was to see narratives that did not end in tidy, happy resolutions. Stories end in misery or other terrors and that was such a thrill to me because you never knew what you were going to get.   [image]A lot of them are really cheesy as an adult, and each of the three volumes has a few meant to be silly jokes rather than scary (the window washer story still pops into my mind at least once a year), but it is still just a good time to share with the young readers in your life.

Three-term US Poet Laureate, author of nine poetry collections and editor of several anthologies, a Ruth Lilly Prize Winner, and recipient of numerous fellowships, Harjo is an incredible voice in poetry. Whenever she comes up I always blurt out “oh hell yea!” and try to direct people to her music, because who doesn’t want to hear Harjo rocking the saxophone or reciting her poetry over awesome jazz/blues fusion. Which I will direct you to this track, which is the title poem from her most recent collection, An American Sunrise. Weaving Sundown in a Scarlet Light is a beautiful selected poems collection that celebrates Harjo’s 50 years as a poet with 50 poems from her catalog. I have somehow neglected to ever  her and this seems a great opportunity as this collection makes for a lovely introduction to her work and includes a foreword by her friend and fellow writer Sandra Cisneros. With an art that combines her passion for oral tradition and music, Harjo’s poems are a special magic of storytelling that gives voice to indigenous people and the land, threading poetry through themes of grief, community and communal living with nature to create a beautiful American story.  [image]Harjo playing saxophone in the Library of CongressEach year my local community participates in the NEA Big Read and last year we read Harjo’s An American Sunrise, which was an incredible experience. Especially when I was able to attend the live Zoom chat with her and even got to speak with her and ask a few questions (one of which was ‘can you play us another song?!’ after she had shown us a track from her recent album earlier in her presentation. She was excited to oblige.) But to hear her speak about her art was very moving and inspiring, particularly as she imparts wisdom with such a calm and caring demeanor that shows she truly cares about art, about words, about nature and about people. Just a lovely person. One of the best aspects of this collection is that she includes, in the notes section, a few paragraphs about each poem in the book. It is just as interesting and thought-provoking as the poems themselves and I love when writers are willing to reach out beyond their works and discuss them with readers.RememberRemember the sky that you were born under,know each of the star's stories.Remember the moon, know who she is.Remember the sun's birth at dawn, that is thestrongest point of time. Remember sundownand the giving away to night.Remember your birth, how your mother struggledto give you form and breath. You are evidence ofher life, and her mother's, and hers.Remember your father. He is your life, also.Remember the earth whose skin you are:red earth, black earth, yellow earth, white earthbrown earth, we are earth.Remember the plants, trees, animal life who all have theirtribes, their families, their histories, too. Talk to them,listen to them. They are alive poems.Remember the wind. Remember her voice. She knows theorigin of this universe.Remember you are all people and all peopleare you.Remember you are this universe and thisuniverse is you.Remember all is in motion, is growing, is you.Remember language comes from this.Remember the dance language is, that life is.Remember.The introduction from Cisneros alone is worth checking out this collection as well. The two attended the University of Iowa’s Writers’ Workshop together from 1976-1978, Harjo having ‘recently abandoned visual arts and declared herself a citizen of poetry.’ Both women of color, they found they often had their voices stifled or spoken over, and the theme of having a voice became a strong aspect of their works during this time, such as this poem they wrote together while in school, aptly titled Permission to Speak:latelyi’ve turned to the riverto the starlings gathering there at twilightmoon in their throatsall i want is the musicanythingto keep me breathingthis dancingthis whirl of my heartI love reading author I enjoy discuss authors they enjoy, and this was a great way to kick off a gorgeous collection of 50 of Harjo’s best works. It is a good selection, never feeling like too few poems, especially as every single one is amazing and all of my personal favorites are collected here. I have a public poetry project I’ve been doing for years and Harjo is definitely one of the poets I have posted around my town the most. Fall Song‘It is a dark fall day.The earth is slightly damp with rain.I hear a jay.The cry is blue.I have found you in the story again.Is there another word for ‘‘divine’’?I need a song that will keep sky open in my mind.If I think behind me, I might break.If I think forward, I lose now.Forever will be a day like thisStrung perfectly on the necklace of days.Slightly overcastYellow leavesYour jacket hanging in the hallwayNext to mine.’Harjo often gives voice to indigenous people, something she did well during her time serving as poet laureate by publishing two anthologies of Indigenous poetry, such as the big volume When the Light of the World Was Subdued, Our Songs Came Through: A Norton Anthology of Native Nations Poetry which I also HIGHLY recommend. Harjo is straightforward with her discussions on the violence against indigenous nations over the course of US history. ‘We are still America. We know the rumors of our demise. We spit them out. They die soon,’ she writes in the poem An American Sunrise. Harjo is also so full of love and hope for a brighter future if we can come together, learn from the past and atone for it. ‘Forty years later and we still want justice,’ she writes, ‘We are still America. We.’ Her poems are always so moving and perfect.‘We Move with the lightness of being, and we will goWhere there’s a place for us.’-from SunriseThis is such a lovely and well edited collection. It is a perfect introduction for those new to Harjo or looking for a good overview of her work, though fans of this amazing poet will also find it a rewarding collection to read the introduction and all of Harjo’s notes about the poems. Honestly, I feel like even readers who aren’t usually fans of poetry would enjoy these. Harjo is a trailblazing voice in American poetry that used her own voice to uplift the voices of others and should certainly be immortalized in history as one of the Great American Poets.5/5I Give You BackI release you, my beautiful and terriblefear.

Gothic Tales, a slim little volume that collects a short ‘The more I live, the more I dread death, even while I abhor life.’Do you believe in ghosts? Gothic Tales, a slim little volume that collects a short story and an essay by Mary Shelley asks this question in the latter, ruminating on why tales of ghosts still capture our attention and fears even as science and reasoning have brushed aside many mysteries and myths of the world. This is a fun little book that serves as a gothic snack for those who may have only read Shelley’s famed Frankenstein and it made for the perfect spooky season treat to read it on this wet and grey autumn day. In it we find Shelley grappling with familiar themes and forcing the reader to confront ideas of death and ask what frightens more, the haunting of a spectral existence beyond the grave or one in which we must cover the corpses of all we know with dirt while being denied the peaceful finality ourselves.The short story in this collection, The Mortal Immortal was written for a 1834 annual literary collection called Keepsake, who published over half of Shelley’s 21 commissioned stories during her life. The story was inspired by a painting that shows a young man and woman assisting an elderly woman on the stairs, and so in The Mortal Immortal we follow Winzy as he must experience his beloved wife as both a young and old woman while he himself is unable to age. This confessional narrative probes a familiar theme to fans of Frankenstein, showing how those who attempt to subvert or outwit the natural world tend to open up horrors beyond their imaginings. Here we see Winzy find his immortality—or possibly just a long life, the uncertainty of this which haunts him even on his 303rd birthday—to be a curse that drives him to thoughts of self-destruction. There is a fun romantic plot complete with bitterness of a rival, some digs at arranging marriages for finance instead of love, an alchemist and is overall a fun 30pg read.‘But do none of us believe in ghosts? Shelley asks in her essay On Ghosts. She discusses how the advances in science have taken much of the mystery of the world away but that belief in ghosts still seems to linger. ‘For my own part, I never saw a ghost except once in a dream,’ she tells us, but discusses how ghosts can inhabit the spaces ‘of which we are ignorant.’ ‘beyond our soul’s ken, there is an empty space, and our hopes and fears, in gentle gales or terrific whirlwinds, occupy the vacuum.’Shelley relates three fun tales of hauntings, such as a ghost with hardly a head left and a talking cat, and I enjoyed the subtle dig that she was more willing to relate these tales ‘since they occurred to men,’ a nice barbed statement that she herself is often disbelieved for being a woman.Gothic Tales is a little Halloween treat that makes for a fun way to pass an evening. Plus the cover art is amazing.

The Penguin Book of Witches, edited by Katherine Howe, brings together documents from King James I’s Daemonologie—a manual for witch hunters published in 1597—to court records from the Salem Witch Trials in 1692 and beyond in order to give a first hand witness to the cross-examinations and writings of those who would condemn so many people to death. While it can be a bit dry and would have vastly benefitted from more commentary or supplemental essays, this is an interesting resource and guide through these dark histories of weaponized misogyny and religious and politically motivated executions that thrived on public fear.   [image]Salem Witch TrialsHowe begins with a look at how witches appeared in the Bible, pointing to the often cited ‘Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live’ of Exodus 22:18 that was used for decades to justify countless murders. Howe goes on to point out ‘all of Exodus 22 remains silent on the definition of what or who a wich is, or on what activities might constitute witchcraft,’ and what becomes evident through the many documents is that witchcraft is a term lobbed at anyone someone might wish to paint a target on. And it was an effective way to remove them. As Reginald Scott writes in his 1584 The Discouerie of Witchcraft: ‘the name of a witch is so odious and her power so feared among the common people, that if the honestest body living chance to be arraigned thereupon, she shall hardly escape condemnation.’We see in these cross-examinations that these women definitely are not actually casting curses and spells, and while the claims of witchcraft could be used, say, to get rid of a widow with land you might wish to take for your own, the majority of those accused and executed were the poor. And it was easiest to accuse anyone for what was determined to be anti-social behavior or any aberration from ‘polite’ society: namely childless women, old women or women with a sense of independence that made others uncomfortable. ‘When for ‘witches’ we read ‘women, we gain fuller comprehension of the cruelties inflicted by the church upon this portion of humanity,’ said 1800s women’s rights activist Matilda Joslyn Gage (who also was the inspiration of Glinda the Good Witch in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz). While, yes, men were accused, tried and executed as well, it was in far fewer numbers with far greater percentage of being let off. ‘Witch’ is something we call a woman who demands the benefit of the doubt, who speaks the truth, who punctures the con, who kills your joy if your joy is killing.’—Lindy West, The Witches Are ComingAs well as documents from the cases, the book also contains an apology of Salem judge Samuel Sewall in 1697 as well as the letter of apology from the jury. Howe chronicles how witchcraft began to be less of a legal issue and more of cultural condemnation, aided in part by the Witchcraft Act of 1735 which redefined witchcraft from being a pact with the devil to claims of practice that was basically an accusation of fraud. There are a few documents taking place after the Salem Trials, such as showing how indigenous peoples fell under scrutiny using accusations of witchcraft and, as Howe writes about one case, these accusations ‘conflates both confusions about native practice with lingering Protestand North American anxiety about territorial clashes.’If you are looking for much analysis about the psychology of witch hunts or lingering issues today, there isn’t much to be found here though I would highly recommend Mona Chollet’s In Defense of Witches: The Legacy of the Witch Hunts and Why Women Are Still on Trial for such purposes. Howe does briefly mention McCarthyism and states ‘the phrase ‘witch hunt’ appears frequently in American political and cultural discourse, perhaps frequently enough to be leached of much of its impact’ but doesn’t delve into it much. Those following US politics the past few years have certainly seen the term witch hunt appropriated by wealthy white men in statements where ‘being held accountable’ is the better fit, but thats another discussion for another day.Those with an interest in the documents of the Salem Trials and other witch trials will find this to be a cool resource. I would have liked more commentary but it is what it is and its a nice little book to have around.3/5...more",Notes are private!,4,133,1,not set,not set,"Oct 25, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/21535268-the-penguin-book-of-witches

Movies you’d watch when you were certainly too young to have seen them and your dad pretended he didn’t notice as long as you didn’t wake your parents up when you were absolutely certain someone was standing outside your window on the next stormy october evening… These are the vibes French graphic novelist Antoine Maillard brings to his debut Slash Them All, a loving tribute to the slasher genre with flavor notes of David Lynch and film noir to help bring out the uneasy tone of the story. Entirely grayscale pencil artwork that plunges the reader into the shadows, Maillard is best at creating an atmosphere that makes you feel like low swelling music is creeping out of the pages and an uneasy tension is roiling in your guts. It all explodes out of the mundanity of a small American town where drug traffic and poverty run rampant, and police are unsure if it is a serial killer wielding a bat to execute his teenage victims might just be another random violent occurrence. Slash Them All is a fun slasher story with great art that never can quite rise above it’s own genre, being a quick thrill without much reason to think about it later beyond the lurking terror of the dark and strangers.  [image]Small town sadnessWhile the atmosphere is pitch perfect in Slash Them All, the plot needed a bit of breathing space. Especially in the middle. There’s some great ideas going on, but most feel a bit thin. Don’t expect much explanation, Maillard keeps much a mystery, but the focus on the creeping dread does really carry the story through to the conclusion. We have characters living broken lives, the two focal characters both feeling stifled under their mother’s, and the interjection of a serial killer—the ‘bloody batter’—is almost treated like another nuisance in their world instead of a real threat. The story does have some thrills and plenty of kills, though a sexual assault scene felt a bit gratuitous though the goal is clearly to make the world feel like as grimy and threatening of a place as an actual serial killer. Still not into that being sort of tossed in though. It is unsettling at all times though, and the growing dread with Daniel fighting against violent urges keeps the tension always at the tipping point.  [image]Murder!The art here is fantastic and I really enjoyed the framework that makes the action come to life really successfully. This had all the feelings of a good slasher film, though does leave me a bit cold but then again most slasher films do as well (a few tweaks and this would be a great film however).

It is easy to root for this inclusive cast of characters—complete with a heart-wrenching queer love triangle—and their illicit acts feel like authentic rebellion and desperation when set against the backdrop of their small, conservative town. Their success brings them new attention from the popular kids, and the whole thing feels like a rickety bike picking up speed on a downhill, rattling itself apart towards impending disaster. The blunt and bleak realism here casts a heavy tone over the narrative, which manages to perform best under this emotional weight rather than be bogged down by it. Through smart writing that delivers humorous dialog and authentic interpersonal dynamics that strike out straight into your heart, as well as a dynamic plot, it somehow manages to avoid wilting in its own melodrama and be all the more beautiful from it, like moonflowers that only bloom at night.   [image]What this book does best is navigate the story within the larger context of Forest Hills itself, using a lot of interruptive text that succinctly peers into the biographical context of both major and background characters to present the local society as a mosaic of those in it. We get detailed histories of the major characters, told through lists of anecdotes that make for nuanced and lively emotional and psychological portraits of them. But through the collective weight of all the personal insights, we see a society riddled with trauma (both fresh and generational), racism, poverty, broken dreams and bad decisions in an economically depressed city that is crumbling as it tumbles towards the Great Recession. I found this to be a really unique and charming technique, all the more so invested in it juxtaposed with my recent readings of Annie Ernaux who has perfected the investigation of how the norms and judgements of a society interact with an individual’s psyche. This is a story of the four girls, but it is also the story of Forest Hills itself.  [image]Example of how biographical interjections help shape a narrative style that is larger than the plot.There is a deep irony that the most oppressive forces of customs and standards are enforced on the teens through religion by some of the most broken adults. We see the religion in this society used less as a space for personal growth and spirituality and more as a weapon to restrict, repress and control. But, like Leia warns in Star Wars: A New Hope, the more they tighten their grip the more people slip through their fingers, lashing out at the emotional bruising done to them. We see these characters, major and minor, as so bogged down by their fractured lives and the shortcomings of the adults that they seem doomed to fail. If this book feels hopeless, it is only because it is asking you what hope do people in these situations have? This is especially relevant as three of the four protagonists are queer women of color in a very white, conservative and patriarchal society. While their narrative works really well, and takes you through some teenage nostalgia complete with selfish and cruel popular kids and local hangouts, I have to say the side-plot with the bully, Hank, being a bully do to his repressed queerness and general lack of self-worth (that seems to be part of a larger struggle going on off the page), seems a bit tacked on and either too present or not present enough to be effective. Small one-two scene hits such as another boy dealing with anger problems and family issues work much better due to the dynamic simplicity of their presentation.But what really won me over here was the ending. While I see why this will likely not work with others, to me it was perfect. I really like when people attempt this style. The whole book is leading to it, showing you how everyone has everything working against them, showing how dreams are shattered in this town, and it is done abruptly and with gut-wrenching finality. It’s 2005, this is how it was. Life is coasting along and suddenly someone’s dad is laid off, your parents found your bag of weed, your upper-classmen friend that you sort of idolize because he was always nice to you at practice is suddenly reported dead in Afghanistan, or a suicide rocks the town. It’s swift and sad and perfectly encapsulates the message of the book. I’m not going to lie, its really heavy and really weighs you down, but its also very real and the quick snapshots of the future paints a sad reality that we all have failures at times, not everyone is a success or gets a happily-ever-after, but most importantly that this is okay because that is how life works. You just have to make the best of it. Not every book needs to be escapist and while this one certainly is not feel-good and I do tend to dislike tidy endings, I think this one really worked and was a bold and beautiful choice. Forest Hills Bootleg Society is a real win. I can’t wrap this up without just mentioning how much I REALLY love the art here. The simple color scheme, a dulled neon sort of greenish-yellow and a blue-grey combo, also helps build the tone. The character design is great too. This a really heavy book with a lot of triggering content, so readers beware, but if this is something you enjoy or are interested in, I would really recommend this. Thanks to hope for quite literally slamming this down on my desk and saying I would love this, you were correct (bring back recommended by shoutouts, please, goodreads?). This is a book where not everything works out, but also a book that reminds you everyone is hurting inside in some ways and that, perhaps, we should all give each other a bit more grace.

In my whirlwind of Winterson love this year, I held off on The Daylight Gate until I could properly read it in the dark nights of the Halloween Season and let me tell you, this was worth the wait. I had expected to enjoy it though I assumed it would be just okay. I should not have underestimated Jeanette because this book wowed me at every twist and turn. The Daylight Gate is Winterson’s take on the Pendle Witch Trials of 1612, a violent, fictional reimagining full of political intrigue and horrific torture, though in the midst of all the brutality Winterson delivers breathtakingly tender moments or love that endures all. The story follows Alice Nutter as her her intervening in a local witch hunt starts to draw a target on her, especially when a London lawyer arrives in Pendel hoping for a bloody show to impress the king and the local Magistrate’s hands are tied and must act. As he tells Alice, ‘There has to be a sacrifice—don’t you understand that?’ and it is a bitter truth everyone must learn. This is a story just drenched in dread that you simply cannot put down. The Daylight Gate is much more plot-driven and direct than their usual work but proceeds with a fierce tension and tone that will have your heart racing as Winterson examines the darkest corners of the human heart with it’s thirst for power and violence and reminds us of the lasting power of love shining in spite of it all.  [image]Pendel Witch TrialsFor maximum  enjoyment, I highly recommend listening to this song.‘This is a haunted place. The living and the dead come together on the hill.’Winterson immerses us into 1612 through her artistic spinning of real people (like John Dee), places and events into a devilishly good tale. As she explains in the introduction, the characters are real though their stories are mostly her invention, and it takes a true talent like Winterson to bring Shakespeare in for a small but effective cameo and not have it feel like a gimmick. Especially when he delivers warnings such as ‘do not be seen to stray too far from the real that is clear to others, or you may stand accused of the real that is clear to you,’ and mocks the lawmen to their own faces. Minor figures in the history get backstories, such as the critical role of Old Demdike, and suddenly the past is a literary playground. Set in Pendle Hill, Lancashire, where it is said girls are baptised twice: once in the church for God and once in the pond at the base of the hill for Satan, we find the women of two poor families accused of witchcraft after a man suffers a stroke in their presence out of fear of finding the women during dusk. For dusk, the golden hour, they believe is the ‘Daylight Gate’, a portal when the land of the living can pass into the land of the Devil.‘Putting a witch to death is not murder. It is the law of the Scripture: “Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.”’Though who needs a gateway to Hell when 1612 England boiling into a hell of its own as King James I is hungry to burn witches and catholics alike in the aftermath of the failed Gunpowder Plot in 1605 (‘remember, remember the fifth of November’). And with Winterson, history always becomes a malleable substance in which the seeds of ideas are grown, sprouting into a minor epic of lovelorn heroines and cut-out tongues. Have I mentioned the talking skull enough? Because there is a putrid, rotting, talking skull. Lancashire happens to be the suspected hiding area for the Catholics involved in the Gunpowder Plot, and for Thomas Potts there is no difference between witchcraft and Catholicism.’What is worse, sir? A High Mass or a Black Mass? To practise witchcraft or to practise the old religion? Both are high treason against the Crown.’With the sister of a certain Plotter locked up on accusations of witchcraft, he hopes to draw his adversary back to Pendle. While the novella concerns witch hunts under the Protestants, all four major western Christian denominations (the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Calvinist and Anglican churches) persecuted witches to some extent. Witch hunting had been going on a long time, notably with the  Witchcraft Act of 1541 passed under Henry VIII, and then King James I’s act in 1603 after publishing his Daeomonologie in 1597 (read it in full here). As we see clearly in The Daylight Gate, accusations of witchcraft can befall anyone if they violate social norms or have an enemy with something to gain. Here we have the unliked, poor and secretly Catholic families of Pendle, both men and women, brought to trial as a spark for a larger political push. As Mona Chollet explains in her book on witch hunts:’Women represented on average 80 of those accused and 85 percent of those condemned…men made up 20 percent of those accused, but they originated 50 percent of the appeal cases…however, the great majority of victims belonged to the lower classes.’Winterson represents history here as a war against women, but also as a war against the poor and opportunism to violently crush political enemies.   [image]Statue of Alice Nutter in Lancashire, England.In the middle of this all is Alice Nutter, a woman curiously young looking for her age and a mysterious past that only slowly comes to light. Inserting herself into the local politics of witch hunting has marked her, though her status keeps her safe. At least initially. Alice’s own situation is fraught with politicking, as the magistrate Nowell had previously lost a land dispute to her in court and a single woman with wealth, especially childless, tended to be prime targets to be eliminated through witchcraft accusations. Add to that the fact that the Catholic revolutionary on the run is her lover hiding in her chambers and you’ve got yourself a tense situation that we get to watch Winterson exploit with their literary magic. I mean this book just rips through scenes of tense interlocution, graphic torture, and witchery. Also a talking skull with a rotting tongue pinned inside, in case you missed that. It’s nonstop and will leave you breathless.‘She was my memory. There was no one else to remember.’Winterson is first and foremost a romantic, and all the bloodshed and darkness of their novels orbits in contrast to gorgeous investigations of love.This book is vicious—be forewarned—yet in the middle of stomach turning violence and queasy tension are suddenly moments of blossoming beauty that cast the shadows back into their corners. ‘She knew that love leaves a wound that leaves a scar,’ Winterson writes, and the novel traces the lines of the scar like a lover’s finger down their partner’s back. In the backstory moments we find classic Winterson lovers tropes, adorned now in black magic and beset by sacrifices to the ‘Dark Gentleman’. While much of the novel feels like the brothel murder scene in Sexing the Cherry, there are moments that question the meaning of love that harken back to my personal favorite, The Passion. ‘He would love her if she were a wolf that tore out his heart. And he wondered what that said about love.’ The linguistic interplay of woodsy violence and romantic introspection here is so thematically succinct for the novella and is fully in Winterson’s wheelhouse of excellence. And if you've made it this far now you should probably throw on this song.‘Love is as strong as death.’Framed as a historical novel, the critiques against the hunger for power and institutionalized religious oppression as a way to acquire and maintain fit perfectly in Winterson’s oeuvre. There is, of course, the hypocritical sense of using religion as a way to harm and control the poor, and Alice even calls out a comrade for losing sight of ethical standards: ‘Are you like all other men after all? The poor should have no justice, just as they have no food, no decent shelter, no regular livelihood? Is that how your saviour Jesus treated the poor?’Those who appeal most to the crown and cross tend to have the seediest natures, such as pedophile Tom Peeper who committed heinous deeds ‘on a Saturday night and stands in church on Sunday morning.’ We see the poor starving and backed into corners, then massacred when they act in desperation. We see them used as political pawns. We see corruption and vile deeds done for the sake of duty. And then we must ask ourselves who the real villains are, them or those who obtain dark magic to protect their community.‘You are stubborn,’ said Roger Nowell. ‘I am not tame,’ said Alice Nutter’This is a perfect book for spooky season, or any other time of the year, and Winterson once again turns history into a fantastical tale that pulls at your heartstrings with a ravenous passion. While very plot-forward, this is a complex tale where each strand traverses a minefield of political and social contexts where bloodshed is all but inevitable and cruelty is the fastest route to keeping your life. While this is likely not the ideal entry point to Winterson, its as good as any though it does lack the brilliant philosophical tangents and stylistic leaps that send you into the stratosphere of her other works. Yet it still stands tall amongst the rest and is an addictively engrossing read. I’ve yet to pick my jaw up off the floor. 4.5/5‘Life was an intervention. At every moment the chances change.

The collection begins with brilliant ekphrastic poetry of the photos from Chinese journalist Li Zhensheng, who hid negatives of his photography that captured the public demonstrations and abuses during the Cultural Revolution under the floorboards of his apartment preserving them so they can be seen today, and moves into investigations of herself returning to China after decades in the United States as well as of her grandmother who would take her own life after the Revolution. With breathtaking poetry, Xie plunges us into moments when we feel history, feeling its gaze fall upon us like a heavy weight as we gaze to the future.  [image]Li ZhenshengXie’s work often examines what she believes is that sight is ‘constructed and enabled and reinforced’ by the context around it. ‘Vision and connected forms of perception map the coordinates of what we know, while simultaneously directing our attention toward what remains unseen,’ she said in a recent ’ interview. This idea takes on multiple meanings The Rupture Tense, particularly in the idea of historical events and the way our context is shaped by those who want to direct how we see it. Take the opening poem for example, Red Puncta, written about Li Zhensheng’s photography:By negative space, by forgetting's lining. Bybackground: fabric where things seethe. Wherefugitive looks and tung trees scrape open looseseams. In the far off, shame plants in earlobesand draws color. See how the background leaksout watery faces that haven't been rifledthrough. Such as the man in the crowd ofthousands, running his tongue over the filmscarring his teeth. Such as the woman, her fattylids betraying her drowsing. The ones fartheroff, their heads angled away, mouthing theunrecoverable. The background is milky fog, issolitary, is sight that is untold. Edge closer.Friction from the future lies in the folds.While Zhensheng’s photos captured the events of the Cultural Revolution, Xie tells us ‘a photograph is no place to keep the dead,’ and through the photos and these poems they ‘anchor’ inside the viewer/reader, a reminder of history that resonates forward. It is a reminder not to let the past repeat itself, such as in Postmemory when she warns ‘Nature reuses / plotlines / not wanting / to waste / a thing,’ but also that the past informs the present.  [image](photo by Li Zhensheng)‘There are others. The brutalized. The hanged. The stoned. The lashed. The suicides. The betrayed. The paranoid. The disappeared. The executed, slender backs to the firing squad. How close Li had to stand to acquire their expressions, close enough he could smell the spume of blood and of brain matter.’This is a sharp collection that finds interesting ways to continuously circle back into it’s themes. Xie uses a variance of styles, such as a poem written as instructions to a game and gives close attention to the use of white space. Many poems leave large gaps between lines that remind us of how even with gaps in time everything is interconnected, past and present as we forge towards the future. These gaps are felt in her poems about returning to China, felt in the titular rupture tense between past tense and present tense where she finds it is ‘no surprise that I’m more verb than subject.’ Xie looks at the idea of identity that is rooted in a country that now feels forgeign to you, with all its past moving within you.Meeting PlacesThe world clangs!Death barks back in the furred dark.In the recesses of newsprintyou trace the ragged linewhere one country joinswith another by torturous stitchesand feel convulsionsalong your midpoint.The world stops clanging.Death licks at its privates.And then you turn the page.There is a lovely reflection on heritage going on here, but also the pains of feeling removed from it. ‘How can I be trustworthy with this mouth,’ she asks of being an English speaker. Luckily for us, the readers, Xie uses it to great poetic success. Shortlisted for the National Book Award, The Rupture Tense is an outstanding collection of work that brings past, present and future alive.5/5‘When spring comes around, you carry the weight of spring.When summer comes around, you carry the weight of summer.When fall comes around, you carry the weight of fall.When winter comes around, your pages fall open.And you, all future tense, leak through.’...more",Notes are private!,0,102,1,not set,not set,"Oct 15, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/59808546-rupture-tense

Ernaux has such a strong, defined voice and personality that it feels as if it's always leaping out from the pages as if her own perfectly chosen words can’t even contain it. What she does best is occupy the space of an emotion and brilliantly map it out like a landscape; here she deftly maneuvers through feelings of jealousy and obsession that have taken hold of her, possessed her every being. ‘I was being inhabited by a woman I had never seen,’ she writes of the ‘Other woman’ with whom her former lover has now decided to live with and over the course of this slim book we witness her project the Other woman into all the women around her as she obsesses with discovering her identity. Brimming with emotional intensity, yet restrained and almost clinical in her examinations of them, The Possession is a sharp book that will sear right into you as she opens the doors to interrogate herself at her most vulnerable and insecure, all while demonstrating the healing power of writing.‘The strangest thing about jealousy is that it can populate an entire city - the whole world - with a person you may never have met.’Ernaux’s The Possession manages to be a sweeping portrait restrained into a singular idea and series of events. Framed as being written years later, reflecting upon the past, it opens as her younger lover, with whom she had a lengthy affair, has moved in with another woman and sets the new terms of their friendship. She had been hesitant to commit after divorcing and now he has moved on, once again with a woman older than himself who he refuses to name. ‘This absent name was a hole, a void around which I turned in circles,’ she says as she becomes obsessed with thoughts of this woman and ways in which she could identify her. ‘It seemed to me that to put a name to this woman would allow me to construct, out of what is always awakened by a word and its sounds, a personality type: to hold an image of her—even if a completely false one—inside me. To know the name of the other woman was, in my own deficiency of being, to own a little part of her.’There is a mutli-faceted idea of possession here, being possessed with wanting to track her down (as it’s own way of possessing her) and the jealousy of no longer being possessed by her lover as the Other woman now is. We see her mind spiraling, the ‘incessant de-coding’ of everything he says to her, her plans and actions of finding out more and obsessive internet rabbit-holes of information to put together an impression of her Other. ‘I discovered that these details by which society defines a person’s identity, which we so easily dismiss as irrelevant to truly knowing someone, are in fact essential,’ she writes, ‘they were the only way to…conjure up a body, a lifestyle; to construct the image of an individual person.’ Much like the way Ernaux examined all the external details of society to discover the shape of her shame in Shame, here Ernaux attempts to define the shape of the Other’s void with personal details. 'It was as if, in this neighborhood which I had filled with the other woman’s existence, there was no room left for my own.'While projecting the Other into every woman she encounters, she finds herself ‘an echo chamber for all pain everywhere,’ and ‘projected myself into all those who—crazier or more audacious than me—had in any way “blown a fuse.”’ A favorite moment is her sort of sick satisfaction in wonderinging--possibly hoping--her own behaviors will be some sort of cautionary tale men whisper in bars when discussing exes. There is a sense that she acknowledges the self-destructive urges that are slowly pulling her closer into action, but she finds a sense of power in them that she seems to find darkly delicious. She restrains herself, usually out of self preservation, but the book always feels teetering on the cliff of scandelous disaster. ‘Writing has been a way to save that which is no longer my reality—a sensation seizing me from head to foot, in the street—but has become “the possession,” a period of time, circumscribed and completed.’Nothing satisfies and she becomes increasingly frustrated, thinking ‘But something more was needed, and I didn’t know where it would come from—from chance, from the outside, or from within myself.’ An aspect I loved is how she turns to writing as a sort of exorcism that removes the desires from the self and onto a page to share, be it a letter to her former lover or to us, the reader of this very book: ‘it is no longer my desire, my jealousy, in these pages—it is of desire, of jealousy; I am working in invisible things.’ While each page is a gem, it is when she discusses her own memoir mechanics that I was most enraptured by her brilliant mind:‘I am writing jealousy as I lived it, tracking and accumulating the desires, sensations, and actions that were mine during this period. It’s the only way for me to make something real of my obsession. And I am always afraid to let something essential escape. Writing, that is, as a jealousy of the real.’This is such an accurate look at what Ernaux seems to do with her autobiographical writing, reconstruction of the real in order to pass the emotional resonance directly into the reader while acknowledging that words are a flawed net with which we can attempt to define the shape of the reality that is forever eluding us as we are plunged forward by time.‘The existence of this woman had become a reality, indestructible and atrocious. It was like a statue emerging from the mud.’Short, easily read in a single sitting, but with a raw emotion that lands in blow after blow, The Possession is a real treat. Ernaux has such a gift of voice that makes these relatively plotless investigations of memory into gripping reads that engulf you. Needless to say, I will be reading many more.4.5/5‘In the self-erasure that is the state of jealously, which transforms every difference into a lack , it was not only my body, my face, that were devaluated but also my occupation – my entire being.’...more",Notes are private!,1,225,1,"Oct 14, 2022","Oct 14, 2022","Oct 14, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3597353-the-possession

A follow-up to Paulsen’s Garlic and the Vampire, this second installment revisits the witch and her living vegetables that works in her garden, but could be plausibly read as a stand-alone. When the witch struggles with a potion for the Count, the vampire we meet in the first book, Garlic is sent on a mission to the magic market while struggling with the realization she is slowly turning into a human. This is a lovely little graphic novel aimed at younger readers and is sure to be a success with them through it’s heartfelt message and gorgeous artwork, and a charming tale about recognizing that change is a fact of life.  [image]Garlic adventuring with the CountWhat I loved most about this story is that it was upfront in it’s message about the inevitability of change and framed as something that is in fact frightening. Paulsen shows how change can also be fun and rewarding, but she doesn’t try to imply that the uncomfortable feelings are something we shouldn’t let ourselves feel and I think that is a great lesson to teach. Yes, change is scary but we have to deal with it as best we can and often it can be for the good, as we see here. It was cute to see all the vegetables become human versions of themselves and see the attempt at inclusive depictions of different races and body types.There is a cute romantic plot hinted at between Garlic and her very caring and supportive friend, Carrot, and the relatively low-stakes adventure still has some cute tension and twists. I also loved the vampire, who is subtly represented as gay and mentions that he also had to learn to love himself for who he is, so big win there. Admittedly I didn’t quite catch that Garlic realized she was turning human by growing a fifth finger, so it can be a bit confusing I guess but overall its very cute. It could easily be read without having read the first, though it pairs well as a sequel and gives the backstory to how the living vegetables came to be. A bit slight, but definitely aimed at younger readers, this is an adorable cottagecore-esque graphic novel that is perfect for the Halloween season but great any time of year.⅘...more",Notes are private!,0,108,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59811239-garlic-and-the-witch

Legends of vampires have been around for centuries, going back even to cultures of Mesopotamians and the Romans where there were stories of creatures that drained the blood of sleeping victims, but The Vampyre by John William Polidori is credited as the combining them into the first modern vampire tale and published in New Monthly Magazine in 1819. It was originally attributed to Lord Byron—Polidori’s The Vampyre did in fact borrow a lot from Byron’s unfinished vampire story Fragment of a Novel—which adds an extra layer of humor seeing as the vampire in the story is quite literally based on him in several ways and Byron himself is referenced in the opening. A fun little story, The Vampyre brought about the idea of these undead creatures as seductive aristocrats as we watch the narrator, Aubrey, slowly realize the wealthy gentleman he has accompanied across Europe may be preying on women more than just sexually. A bit dense and told at a remove, this is still a cool piece of horror history and at only a handful of pages, well worth the read.The creation of the story is nearly as exciting a tale as the vampire story itself. During the summer of 1816, Byron, Polidori, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Mary Shelley and her sister Claire all stayed together in Geneva. Due to non-stop rain, the group decided to entertain themselves by each writing a ghost story (which is also the origin of Shelley’s Frankenstein), which they figured would pair well with the copious amounts of wine and laudanum they were consuming. Byron began his Fragment of a Novel, which was never completed and Polidori crafted The Vampyre were much inspired by Byron’s tale. Though one will also notice that the opening of the story very much aligns with Polidori’s own experience: Aubrey accompanies Lord Ruthven around Europe much the way Polidori followed Byron around as his personal physician, both Polidori and Aubrey finding their companion to initially be very seductive and charming but slowly revealing themselves in immorality and debauchery. Ruthven brings the downfall of young wealthy persons they encounter and brings women to vice and ruin. Those who except money or aid from Ruthven meet bad ends, and there is a theme of disillusionment running through the story as well as a theme of unstoppable destruction with no concern who will be harmed in its path. Which is not far off from Byron and what happened to Polidori after being his friend.In fact, Ruthven is very intentionally written to call Byron to mind. The name is borrowed from the novel Glenarvon by Caroline Lamb, who was a former lover of Byron’s and her character Clarence de Ruthven was written as a blatant and unflattering portrait of Byron (there are notes that Polidori has intended to change the name to Strongmore but he took his own life with prussic acid before that could happen). The brilliance of all this is (beyond that dunking on Lord Byron is always a great time, I mean I wrote a whole  about it) that the image of a vampire was transformed into a criticism of aristocracy as symbolism of the wealthy as draining the life blood of society. This became a good metaphor that even Karl Marx would draw upon writing that capital was vampiric. There is some wonderful characterization going on in the story, with Ruthven constantly being described as death-like, such as his ‘dead grey eyes’ on a face that is described as having a ‘deathly hue.’ Yet despite this, he is able to woo any man or woman he desires (not unlike Byron) and ‘his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society.’ We see in this the modern mold for vampires and the next two major vampire stories, Carmilla and Dracula, would follow suit with their vampire presented as a wealthy aristocrat preying on women. This is a short and fun read, though admittedly a bit dry. It is told at a remove from the action and the emotion doesn’t quite pop the way something like Carmilla does, though it is still an engaging story with a body count. It is almost Halloween, so check out the first vampire tale and enjoy!3.5/5...more",Notes are private!,0,244,1,not set,not set,"Oct 07, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/21391994-the-vampyre

Shame, originally published in 1998 and later translated into English by Tanya Leslie, is a snapshot of French society in 1952 that grapples with many of the themes Ernaux is celebrated for: the clinical investigation of the self and memory and, as the title would suggest, earnest examinations of feeling shame. ‘My father tried to kill my mother one Sunday in June, in the early afternoon,’ begins Ernaux’s novella where this incident on June 15th, 1952, becomes ‘the first date I remember with unerring accuracy from my childhood,’ because it ‘introduces the era when I shall never cease to feel ashamed,’ a feeling that she carries with her all her life. While the novella is fiction, it reads very much like a historical memoir and is less a narrative and more an account of the social conditions of the narrator’s town and private school as well as the world events occurring that summer of 1952 that forever reshaped her own familiarity with herself. This slim novel is an intriguing look at narrative possibilities, with a brilliant depth of examination and a coolness of tone paired with precise and powerful language that reconstruct a dynamic portrait of life in a specific time and place that manages to resonate with universal emotional impact.‘Shame became a new way of living for me. I don't think I was even aware of it, it had become part of my own body.’The catalyst for the book here is a brief but lasting moment of violence that will ‘breathe disaster’ through every aspect of the narrator's life. ‘Now everything in our life is synonymous with shame,’ she writes, seeing how this one moment refocused all she thought and knew about life. Much of the shame felt in the novel comes from the idea that ‘ “no one except us” behaves this way,’‘ which is all the more a threatening feeling in a society that promotes conformity and fears aberration. ‘To be like everyone else was people’s universal ambition, the ultimate dream,’ she tells us, ‘those who were different were thought to be eccentric or even deranged.’ In order to portray just the sort of society this is, Ernaux goes into great detail to reproduce 1952 for the reader. I shall process them like documents, examining them from different angles to give them meaning,’ Ernaux writes, ‘in other words, I shall carry out an ethnological study of myself.’ While the style of this ethnological study does read as a listing of facts and observations, first delving into the city and the social structures within it before turning attention to the all-girls Catholic school she attended, the cumulative weight of insights and explanations begins to produce a very nuanced and detailed portrait of a society that you begin to feel yourself immersed within. Told from the adult perspective in 1996, this is ‘the bond between the little girl of 1952 and the woman who is writing this manuscript,’ through which we see life as a collection of events following one another, shame always a shadow over them.‘Everything that cements this world is encouraged, everything that threatens it is denounced and vilified.’We get an excellent depiction of post-war France, and the social and cultural norms down to linguistic choices that define the city of Y in the year 1952. We see the ways social classes interact and the narrator’s space here (her parents being shopkeepers), though the most of the hierarchies examined are those of the private school she attends. ‘Instruction and religion are inseparably linked, both in time and in space,’ she informs us and everything is strictly rule oriented ‘yet these rules are never perceived as being coercive.’ That said, she feels ‘compelled to use the present tense to list and describe these rules, as if they have remained as immutable as they were for me at the time,’ and it is evident how this sort of upbringing and extreme hierarchical perspective on society (even hanging out with public school girls is considered a taboo) would make the narrator view the violent event of her childhood as something that has shaken her loose from the perceived safety of her social position and piety. ‘Now I can see the good little girl who goes to private school, enjoying the power and ideology of a world symbolizing truth, progress and perfection, a world which, in her eyes, she would never fail.’This belief in a fall from grace takes on a deep emotional and moral tone as if she has discovered she doesn’t belong in the society around her. ‘Was I doomed to pick up every single sentence that reminded us of our place in society?’ she wonders, which is a really personal feeling that I think we all have once we notice ourselves out of place. Which is what lands so well in this novel: the idea that shame is something that is so personally felt and specific yet also universal. This was particularly interesting to read on the heels of completing several works by Simone de Beauvoir, particularly Inseparable which, also an account of French private schooling, demonstrates how religious hierarchies weaponize shame and guilt as a method of obliging obedience at the punishment of being outcast. Equally important to this book is the idea of memory, and how each compounding event across our lives recalibrates our relationship to our past. When looking at photographs from her twelfth year she finds she can barely link the young girl in the photo to the self writing the book in 1996, but surely they are the same. Time and our experience make memory a frail thing, and the idea of examining memory through the newspapers of 1952 in an attempt to recreate the world as it was is an interesting way to refresh the background thoughts that would be in everyone's head at the time. ‘This can be said about shame: those who experience it feel that anything can happen to them, that the shame will never cease and that it will only be followed by more shame.’Ernaux is a gifted writer and I am excited to have read a novel from the newest Nobel winner, all the more excited that I have quite enjoyed it. It’s brief and quiet, though the pieces really fall into place and my enjoyment of it only increased the following day after finishing it as I found myself thinking about it frequently. ‘It was normal to feel ashamed: I saw it as an inescapable fatality,’ Ernaux writes, and this novel takes a clever approach to examining just how much society is bent towards inflicting shame upon us, with Ernaux reminding us that it is something we all inevitably endure and in our shared experiences of shame and frailties of memory we find ourselves joined as fellow humans.An interesting book, one written with a very clinical approach to the subject that performs wonderful artistry. This was my first experience with Ernaux but it will certainly not be my last.4/5‘In his writings, Proust suggests that our memory is separate from us, residing in the ocean breeze or the smells of early autumn—things linked to the earth that recur periodically, confirming the permanence of mankind. For me and no doubt many of my contemporaries, memories are associated with ephemeral things such as a fashionable belt or a summer hit and therefore the act of remembering can do nothing to reaffirm my sense of identity or continuity. It can only confirm the fragmented nature of my life and the belief that I belong to history.’...more",Notes are private!,0,240,1,"Oct 06, 2022","Oct 11, 2022","Oct 06, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/399256.Shame

While not as problematic as the second book, this one is overly long (mostly because the characters never just talk but make grand speeches at EVERY opportunity) and sort of misunderstands what was so good about the characters to begin with. Plus the two men, Tedros and the Schoolmaster (now a walking teenage tantrum) are so irritating its hard to believe Agatha and Sophie are actually into them. Tedros has no redeeming qualities beyond being the heir to Camalot (so I guess once Agatha is queen she can decree him to shut the hell up finally?) and the Schoolmaster is just a walking shitstorm of red flags that Sophie casually ignores because he’s hot. Also Hort is now ripped but a full blown INCEL. Professor Dovey and Lady Lesso still rule, but then there’s the whole ”oh yea by the way I have a surprise son who is a sociopath and now I should probably murder his ass” that is somehow one of the only good parts of the book? And the BIG twist is terrible and the most shocking part of it is that it could be so terrible.At first the introduction of all the older fairy tale characters seemed cool but they are entirely used only for a “look at how clueless and useless old people are” joke that they beat the dead horse with so many times it becomes super ageist and weird. And the relationships just don’t vibe at all. The Agatha/Tedros one is entirely unconvincing and can’t even pull off the awkward pairing but cute dynamic, and while the Sophie one sort of makes sense with her character it’s a huge bummer she accepts so much abuse after having been such a strong character until now. Her ending is maybe the only thing I actually enjoyed. And maybe some of the kind of creepy parts, there was some good stuff with that.Well, I read all three of the original arc because it was still fun to read it with my child but even they didn’t like this one. By the time you get to the climax it’s almost impossible to care. Thankfully I read the Netflix adaptation is entirely doing away with anything that comes after the first book so I hold out hope (the first book rules, I still recommend that).

Major shoutout to Dmitry Chukhrai for these lush and colorful landscapes and full panels that really breathe life into the story. I mean, look at this:  [image]I love the way this captures depth and mood.The battle scenes have a lot of energy in them and having so many full page panels is wonderful. This book is a visual feat and I love simply flipping through it. Credit to the publisher for valuing the art and having this printed on quality paper.Reading this got me thinking, however, about how the enjoyment of a book is often tied into your overall reading experience with it. War and Peace is an epic masterpiece and when reading it years back it became more a companion through the winter than merely a book I was reading. Lugging around the dense volume (I had the beautiful Pevear/Volokhonsky translated edition), I felt like I was living amongst the characters who became almost familiar friends I would visit daily. When I finished, I had a sense of melancholy when I realized I actually missed reading the book the way one misses a friend. Now Alexandr Poltorak does a good job adapting a thousand page epic into a 200some graphic, but that sense of familiarity that can only come from having spent a lot of time in a book cannot be replicated. Unfortunately, the story here feels rather rushed and major events happen in the blink of an eye, and even the most dynamic of artwork can’t capture the feeling that is being fully immersed in Tolstoy’s prose as he constructs a massive work. Which isn’t anyone’s fault, its just this is an adaptation where the best parts have to be left behind in adapting it. I’ve often felt that movies and books aren’t as compatible as people want them to be, and some graphic novels can really draw out aspects that can’t be done in a prose novel, but this was just one that didn’t need it. It just feels like the sparknotes version and cannot really capture the emotion as well. The closest I think anyone has ever come to replicating the novel is the 8hour Sergei Bondarchuk adaptation, which filmed over 6 years to capture the passage of time in the faces of the actors. There were also a few aspects that bugged me as well, but are admittedly rather subjective. The art never really conveys the passage of time. Pierre is drawn exactly the same throughout the entire novel, looking too old for his character at the beginning and lacking the dramatic physical change that occurs during his hardships during the war at the end of the book. Illustrating the characters in a way that reflected change would have been preferred (and perhaps the lack of it is part of the reason the epic aspects never seem to stick). He also looks like Benjamin Franklin and we don’t get to see him riding the bear. The translation of Prince Andrei to Prince Andrew was also not my favorite choice. It is very dialogue heavy, though some of the panels have too much dialogue in them for a graphic novel, but the other option was just to have more panels of people sitting and talking which would become rather repetitive in a visual art form. Just another reason this works better in prose.  [image]This isn’t bad, honestly for what it is and set out to do it is well done but it also just cannot capture what makes War and Peace such a beloved classic. It feels so rushed and I suspect that readers who haven’t read the original will find it a bit hard to follow. It is very focused on Pierre, rushing through a lot of the other character’s stories, which also fails to capture how the novel is such a tapestry of lives during a historical period of great change. Credit to them for trying, and this would make a nice gift to a big Tolstoy fan, but rather than being a graphic novel I’d rather see a new edition of the actual novel with the best of the full page panels from here printed within it. Still, this is certainly worth a read. 3/5  [image]...more",Notes are private!,0,115,1,not set,not set,"Oct 01, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/60320131-war-and-peace

Not great. Did the first book need a sequel? No. But I get it, it’s publishing and they built quite the empire from this series with a slew of books and now a feature film. But did they have to retcon the best moment of the first book by ensuring that, no, Sophie and Agatha aren’t romantically attracted to each other and then launch into some very heteronormative reinforcing where a big portion of the character’s development and sense of self is based on if they can secure the affection of the man they fancy. The whole novel actually begins because Agatha regrets the ending of the first book, wishing she'd stayed with the insufferably dull but apparently sexy prince instead of have a well-adjusted and supporting friendship with Sophie. Who IS GREAT, Agatha! While, sure, I did like the aspect that often good ideas get co-opted by those with evil motives in order to achieve their personal wishes at the expense of destroying the ideals, but so much was all muddled up in some pretty problematic depictions of women’s empowerment and scapegoated all of that for the benefit of the ‘boys will be boys’ toxic characters and yeeesh. Also, boys looking hot without a shirt on gets them way too much leeway from the two main girls who shrug off major red flags. Which like, realistic I guess, but also Tedros is so beyond irritating and flagrantly dull that no amount of oiled-up chiseled abs could ever make up for it. We have Agatha more or less abandoning her personality because she can be the cute girl that gets the hot guy and it's rather eye rolling when this is presented as character growth instead of something to overcome. Top that off with the whole reverse sexism thing and ughhhhh.What a disappointment after a rather fun and exciting first book, and there is fun to be had here but a lot of it is a rehash of what made the first book so engaging (a repeat of the Trials occurs, but with higher stakes). It falls pretty flat in the pile of uninspired sequels that becomes simply a bridge to get to a bigger third volume where at least there are fresh ideas. The problem with that direction, however, is that it defaces a lot of what was so charming about Sophie and Agatha in the first book, especially Agatha who went from snarky and strong-willed to very wishy-washy and meek.

I read this awhile back with my child when they were 8 and we had a blast. If it is saying anything, I stayed up late and finished the last 100 pages by myself after they had fallen asleep because I had to find out what happened and the ending gets wild. My child loved it and it became a game we would frequently play. Days after finishing the first book we had a massive snow storm that kept schools closed for a week and I even got out of work a few days, so we turned the house into the School and had a class list based on the book (but it was like, doing crafts or making food coming up with ways to tie it into the book) so I will always have a soft spot for this one.This book is far from perfect, but for what it is and who it is intended for this is an exciting take on fairy tales that plays with a lot of familiar names and interrogates outdated roles of good and evil as well as assumptions of beauty. Which does get problematic despite good intentions at times, though it makes for a fun story nonetheless. ‘It doesn't matter what we are, it matters what we do,’ becomes a major theme in this novel. The book follows Sophie and Agatha as they are kidnapped from their village and brought to the School, where the town beauty, Sophie, finds herself in the school for evil while the outcast who lives in the cemetery, Agatha, ends up with the princesses in Good. There is some comedy watching them recoil in horror to be immersed in such stereotypical representations of fairy tale Good vs Evil, though as the novel progresses they start to come into their roles. While the Agatha story is meant to be empowering with the whole aw you were always beautiful you just didn’t see it (which like, for a book trying to subvert roles attached to beauty, it harps on it far too much), and its cool and all but Sophie’s story is where the real excitement is. Sophie embracing her role as a witch is just too much fun, with her giving beauty tips to all the girls in Evil and becoming a fashion icon along the way. This is teen high school comedy vibes and I was here for it. Also the whole bizarre death game tournament that happens in the middle of the book is some edge-of-your-seat entertainment.As mentioned earlier, this book obsesses way too much on body image for a book that is also trying to subvert that. It becomes a big thing where we are supposed to say oh yes, their image doesn’t matter, but this happens after a lot of body shaming used as comedic relief and the messaging gets kind of murky. I really like the two lead characters, Agatha is sassy and fun and Sophie is awesome in a Mean Girls character sort of way. I really enjoyed her learning to be content with herself as well, she's my favorite by far. Honestly, I enjoyed this a lot but stop after this book. The ending SLAPS and just imagine its a good queer happy ending because the sequel was kind of awful (and SUPER problematic). I am excited to check out the movie version with my child though, as the characters in this book are really endearing. Especially some of the teachers, the interplay between teachers that are friends despite being in opposite schools is pretty great.

This has been a question that ‘ I’ve never felt more foreign than I have this summer, with this child at my side.’How does one express the ineffable? This has been a question that the vast variety of art forms have grappled with, shaping and reshaping attempts to capture elusive existence in their artistic nets. Elisa Shua Dusapin, author of the 2021 National Book Award Winning novella Winter in Sokcho, is perfecting a technique that manages to wrangle emotional resonance with the slightest of touches that truly comes alive in Pachinko Parlour. In jazz you often hear how the notes not played, or the space between notes, are just as key to the song as those you hear and Dusapin has managed to capture that through her array of repeated imagery and motifs of identity, language, and abandonment. Her images are juxtaposed in the sky of narrative as if like constellations, and the imaginary lines our mind draws to connect them into a form are what Dusapin weaves into her net to scoop up the emotions and tone that we can’t quite touch otherwise as she uses atmosphere and tone to define its shape. This is rendered beautifully into English through Aneesa Abbas Higgins’s translation, partnering again with Dusapin’s prose after having won the translation prize last year. Deceptively simple, Pachinko Parlour follows narrator Claire during her summer stay with her Korean grandparents in Tokyo as she juggles tutoring a young girl named Mieko and attempting to overcome her elder’s inertia to plan a trip to Korea together. It is a highly nuanced story that blossoms almost exclusively on vibes and a kaleidoscope of images that probe into a deeply moving interrogation of cultural identity—and feeling extrinsic to one’s own heritage—trauma and authenticity in a world that seems to be replacing itself with imitation, and it is another major success for this sharp and exciting young author.There is an ethereal quality of Dusapin’s writing that allows it to seep under your skin so effortlessly, leaving the reader caught in the grips of unease and melancholia that permeate the atmosphere of this slim novella. There is a similar meandering pace and general sense of ennui that seems like shrapnel still flying from the blast of the Korean War into the current day lives of characters as there was in her marvelous first book, Winter in Sokcho, though the emotional resonance in Pachinko Parlour stems from a different sense of unease. Whereas the former was a sense of cold, damp alienation, Pachinko Parlour exists under oppressive heat with a sense of life grating up against the narrator, altogether too loud in the sense of dislocation. Food and weather are once again a major motif, with Claire finding an inability to enjoy any food while in Japan and fish being a central symbolism in the novel. Dusapin is playing with variations on a theme, giving the two books a complimentary sense while managing to still feel unique. ‘We do still have our language.’There is a brooding estrangement dangling on the precipice of a rupture at the heart of Pachinko Parlour, most markedly with Claire’s internalized struggle with cultural identity. Like Dusapin, Claire has been brought up in France (now living in Switzerland). Her grandparents her only link to her Korean heritage but they have been living in Tokyo for 50 years amongst  ‘Japan’s Korean community: exiles, people who came, as my grandparents did, to escape the Korean war, and others, who were deported during the Japanese occupation of Korea.’ Language is central to how Dusapin navigates cultural identity in the book, and there is a growing sadness at the language disconnect between Claire and her Grandparents. ‘I used to be able to speak Korean, but I lost it when French became my main language. My grandfather used to correct my mistakes, but not any more. We communicate in simple English, with a few basic words in Korean and an array of gestures and exaggerated facial expressions. We never speak in Japanese.’This divide is also felt by her grandparents who fear Claire is drifting away from them both emotionally and culturally (the fear of growing distant from loved ones is juxtaposed with Mieko and her mother who have quite literally lost all contact with Mieko's father). Retaining language is a mark of pride, especially for the grandmother who’s mother cut off part of her tongue rather than speak Japanese under the occupation and the grandmother avoids any situation where she would have to speak it in Tokyo. ‘We were still nationals of a unified Korea…called Choson,’ the Grandfather explains late in the novel, ‘people from a country that no longer exists,’ and there inaction on planning the trip may be connected to the inability to truly visit the Korea of their past.‘On every face the same tightly stretched grin, the same vacant, happy look.’This idea of the replacement of the ‘original’ is repeated throughout the novel with various uses of clever symbolism, with various instances of stuffed animals instead of live ones (the parallels of the taxidermied animals at an exhibit Claire visited as a child with the live animals kept in cages she visits with Mieko and the wild deer later on is a pretty powerful metaphor), artificial food, kokeshi dolls that ‘people used to make them to remember the babies they killed because they couldn’t feed them’, and the Heidi theme park. The latter, with windows that are ‘only a façade, made of plaster, supported by a metal frame,’ is one of the many ways Dusapin takes something as a pale imitation of an idea or thing and mines the imagery for strong emotion and thematic purpose. Mieko’s bedroom which is actually an empty pool in an abandoned hotel is another foreboding use of imagery, and only Dusapin could craft a depiction of Disney Land that feels as hollow and melancholy as she does here. In fact, most of all the scenery is described in claustrophobic or disquieting ways: ‘I look out of the window. Mount Fuji is shrouded in darkness now. The city has become no more than a leaden mass, lifeless. Lines are starting to blur inside the apartment too. I feel as though I can hardly move. Without the view from the window, it would be unbearable. You’d suffocate.’Best is when Claire, who is frequently criticized for poor Japanese speech, is told by a cast member at the Heidi village that her Japanese is very good, a compliment that can only be received as considering herself also a facade of her own cultural heritage and self that only in the land of artifice does she fit in. While she grows close with Mieko, which make for some very tender if not awkward scenes in the book, she is reminded ‘you’re her teacher, not her mother,’ and she can only be a false stand-in just as much as the recordings of Claire’s father playing organ are a stand-in for a live performance. This adds to the feelings of alienation and an outsider, and even her link to her cultural identity is something she is made to feel ashamed of as her grandparents who’s ‘lives begin and end with the pachinko parlour’ that they run as pachinko is looked down upon as immodest. The scenes with Mieko are some of the most enjoyable moments in the novel, though the sweetness is so cloaked in darkness. Mieko’s father has run off, she rarely presents herself as enjoying the activities they do and spends a lot of time worrying about the world headed towards destruction. ‘There aren’t nearly as many as there used to be in the city,’ she tells Claire, ‘one day they’ll all be dead, and then we’ll all die too. Though the fish symbolism, used earlier as an image for the trains her father build that took him away, return as the ideal for a more environmentally friendly world with the image of a pleco fish that eats the grime from the tank. Though it is noted that one must care and feed those who fight against the grime, and ideas about caring for the innocent such as children (or grandparents) and the unhoused are subtly injected into the story such as when Claire finds a copy of Ernest and Celestine amongst Mieko’s mother’s picture books. This is interesting in a book where brand names are frequently mentioned, particularly in conjunction with ideas of artificiality and the harsh glow of neon lights, and hint towards a rejection of capitalism as a method to uphold society and returning to a more pure and humane solution. The removal of artifice and leaving as transparent and vulnerable is Mieko’s idea for a better world:‘We ought to shed our skins, like animals. The older we got, the more transparent our skin would become. In the end you’d be able to see all our insides through it. Veins, bones, feelings, everything. Our skin would be a mirror too, people would be able to see themselves in it. Eventually we’d become completely transparent, and when that happened, we’d give our last breath to our child.’This becomes even more impactful when later Mieko calls attention to the closeness of Claire’s name with the word for clear: ‘“Calearo,” she repeats. “Like your name. Calairo.”’Pachinko Parlour excels through its quiet beauty, juxtaposes scenes in ways that speak volumes about human connectivity without ever overtly drawing the connection. Dusapin carefully pairs ideas to maximum potential, with an unsettling tension slowly creeping as the pieces all fall into place not unlike the tetris game Claire is always playing on her phone. The world is passing by and the characters feel such little control over it, but the small ways they exert themselves seems best exemplified in the description of playing pachinko: ‘The only control a player has over the machine is to adjust the force at which the balls are ejected by slowly turning a knob that fits into the palm of the hand. The knob turns both ways.’ How one exerts their force, through action or inaction, speaks volumes here. This book is so elegantly written and gorgeously translated that it fully engulfed me with its potent atmosphere and tone. A short read, but one that takes up a lot of space in your heart and mind. Elisa Shua Dusapin is a brilliant writer and I cannot wait to read everything she comes up with.4.5/5‘People say the name pachinko comes from the noise the balls make in the machine, pinging against the glass, swooshing through the plastic tubes, clanking against the bumpers, the shriek of metal, the final clang as they fall into the tray.The door slides shut. Silence.’...more",Notes are private!,6,261,1,"Sep 28, 2022","Oct 04, 2022","Sep 28, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/59825231-the-pachinko-parlour

I mean, I'm Glad **Winner of the 2022 Goodreads Choice Award for Memoirs!**Chances are, if you have a TikTok or Instagram you know what this book is. I mean, I'm Glad My Mom Died was on back order already the morning it was published and was a sought after title all August and is a book you just cannot avoid if you have an internet connection or local bookstore. Nor should you. Jennette McCurdy, the former iCarly actress, speaks so openly and candidly about a lifelong cycle of abuse and dependency with her mother (who passed in, as the title likely led you to assume), chronicling trauma and serious mental health struggles such as eating disorders that all were brought upon her through the need to serve her mother’s wishes. It’s one I’ve had right in everyone’s faces at the bookstore since we finally got copies, as the title is sure to solicit reactions and I privately enjoy seeing them, but also it is an important look at abuse and recovery. I had to finally read it. I mean we all deserve a Hot Girl Summer but can I truly say I had one if I didn’t read any Colleen Hoover, Beach Read or at least this, the most popular book of the end of summer? No. And I’m glad I did pick this up to read at work because this deserves all the hype and more, and I hope this is another success on McCurdy's road to improved mental health. While she loved her mother, their relationship was often abusive and left a lot to detangle in adulthood. Deeply personal and moving, this is a look into McCurdy's life as well as a necessary warning about the ways young girls are objectified, commodified and exploited, even by those closest to them.‘I realize that she’s happy and I’m not. Her happiness came at the cost of mine. I feel robbed and exploited.’That line says it all, honestly. This is an upsetting account of McCurdy's life, and one where all the warning signs were out in the open and ignored. Especially by Nickelodeon who don’t exactly come across well here. We’ve heard horror stories about the treatment of child actors for as long as there have been child actors, though this isn’t simply another case file of grievances but a really heartfelt self-examination and testimony. McCurdy comes across as very open and honest, and it really paints a positive look at her as a person who has gone through so much. There are times when she discusses the anger she felt, which feels justified and as Soraya Chemaly talks about in the book Rage Becomes Her: The Power of Women's Anger, sometimes anger is the appropriate response in order to not be silenced or ignored. It can be an important tool, or an armor as McCurdy describes: ‘I became an angry person with no tolerance for anyone. I'm aware of this shift and yet have no desire to change it. If anything, I want it. It's armor. It's easier to be angry than to feel to pain underneath it.’She also expresses feelings of regret for having lashed out in these times, looking at how abuse shouldn’t just beget another cycle of abuse, and these discussions seem to come from a place of maturity and healing. It is likely very encouraging and empowering for victims of abuse to read much of this book, though heads up, it does get into some very triggering situations and topics.‘Mom only sits in when I’m being the thing she wanted to be.’McCurdy shows how so much of her life was lived to be what her mother wanted, and much of this became painful. She was raised in a Mormon household and was homeschooled by her mother, a mom who wanted to always present a perfect image and often lashed out hurtfully. In short, McCurdy is open about her mom having narcissistic tendencies, and while she is still caring for her mother (she does make it clear she very much loved her mother), the scars are quickly apparent. From years of life like this, McCurdy felt she lacked an authentic self, and this carried over into struggles with body image from seeing one’s own self as an object that serves others instead of something personally only yours. This is a major theme in the essays in My Body by Emily Ratajkowski for those looking for further reading on the subject. When fearing her breasts would grow during puberty, the mother encouraged extreme calorie reduction and dangerous dieting practices. While discussions of the mother bookend this memoir, the bulk of the middle portion is about eating disorders. Most tragic is the moment in the hospital with her siblings saying goodbye to her mother when she says the one thing she thinks could actually make her mother proud of her: ‘I'm in the ICU with my dying mother, and the thing that I'm sure will get her to wake up, is the fact that in the days since mom has been hospitalized, my fear and sadness have morphed into the perfect anorexia motivation cocktail, and finally I have achieved mom's current goal weight for me: 89 pounds.’There is a lot to be said about the ways this reflects a general attitude around young women and girls, especially in the entertainment industry and how it robs them of their own agency. ‘I was conditioned to believe any boundary I wanted was a betrayal of her, so I stayed silent,’ she writes, and in this we see how these systems perpetuate themselves: silence. Young women and girls are broken down to believe they are in service to another (we could get into a long discussion on how this is the social framing inflicted by the intersections of misogyny and capitalism) and silence is induced by making them first feel they wouldn’t be believed or listened to but also that they deserve it, it’s for their own good or that they don’t even have the agency to speak out. It is truly tragic how often victims of abuse are silenced when they do speak out, which is another tool in oppression.So this book is a lot, but it is also very good and seems very healing. I was under the impression based on how it was presented and marketed that this was more of a comedic memoir, so heads up if that was what you assumed as well, but the weight and power of her words as she discusses a lifetime of abuse is definitely worth reading for. It does read very plainly, almost like a “class assignment” type of tone recounting events, though they are certainly difficult memories to have to revisit. I hope McCurdy is doing well, and it is very honorable of her to use her experience to reach out and help others in this way. There could have been more depth to some of it, but this is less a look at the causes and social critiques and more at the personal effects she endured. There are great reminders too about how to move forward and not get bogged down in being perfect, such as when she writes that ‘slips are totally normal. When you have a slip, it’s just that. A slip. It doesn’t define you. It doesn’t make you a failure. The most important thing is that you don’t let that slip become a slide‘. I won’t get too much more into it, as you should probably read the book and this is McCurdy's story to tell, but I am very glad I read this.'My mom didn't get better. But I will.'...more",Notes are private!,1,351,1,"Sep 27, 2022","Sep 27, 2022","Sep 27, 2022",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/59364173-i-m-glad-my-mom-died

Call it my pagan autumn ritual as I shake like a leaf, and I certainly will be now because Stephen Graham Jones is a modern master of horror and The Ones That Got Away, a collection of his early stories, is a frightfest of fun. Jones feels so at home in familiar realms of horror that he quickly rearranges the furniture and customizes the decor into something fresh that lets the fear inside in unexpected ways. These stories, predominantly featuring working class settings and characters, often are reflections back into childhood, pulling the reader back into that pure, primal terror born from the uninhibitated imaginations of children and examining moments that cast shadows even into the character’s adulthoods. Sinister and surprising, The Ones That Got Away is an intense collection that will keep you turning pages and checking under the bed.‘When you’re twelve, your superstitions are pure like they’ll never be again,’ says one of Jones’ protagonists, and this idea is key to so much of the charm in these stories. In the notes section at the end of the book (which is honestly one of my favorite parts of the book and makes me just really enjoy the author as a person), Jones talks of an upbringing on Stephen King novels and the influence is evident though Jones does manage to make everything his own. Like the vibes from books like It or stories such as The Body, many of the stories here (most notably Monsters and Raphael) are immersed in a sense of nostalgia, reflecting back on the people and places of days lost to time such as ‘the hamburger joint that used to be the concession stand for the drive-in, when there’d been a drive-in,’ for example. I’ve always found stories set like this rather comforting as they do trigger nostalgia, though it is interesting to consider that the nostalgia is for reading books that utilize this nostalgia that are references to an era just before my own childhood—a feeling of nostalgia for someone else’s nostalgia, if you will. The sense of place is practically a side-character in these stories, an era dying away along with the loss of innocence that interrupts the stories.It is precisely because of this cozy veneer that the creeping horror is able to be so shocking and alarming. Raphael opens with some fantastic coming-of-age narrative building with middle schoolers who band together while feeling themselves ‘invisible’ to the rest of society, all crushing on the one girl in their group and telling scary stories before a moment of terror changes their lives forever (well, those who still have a life after). Monsters, a favorite in the collection, is another cute coming-of-age framing around a summer fling between two young people where the tension about if they kiss or not to end the summer is dramatically and violently tossed aside when a vampire enters the picture. I love it. It’s hitting you with fear right in the most comforting of narratives, something I found Jones to do quite well in his novels and second short story collection.‘What I was doing was willing myself to grow up.’The moments of terror in many of these stories become the cautionary tale for the survivors, such as in the title story where the narrator admits without the death of his friend he may have continued to spiral down a path of drug and degredation. Childhood cool rarely translates into adjusted adult though there is something beautiful about when Jones describes those moments of coolness in the calm before the coming storms that would linger in the memory of bystanders, the self eternal in youth in their minds: ‘The girls we never married would still be talking about us. We’d be the standard they measure their husbands against now. The ones who got away.’However, we find many of these characters instead wind up the reason to correct course and survive. ‘I might never have gone on to college without the warning he’d been,’ the narrator says in Til the Morning Comes, a shockingly effective tale about being scared of an uncle’s Grateful Dead posters as a child, or the repeated idea of survivors guilt that ‘It’s a good life. One I don’t deserve, one I’m stealing, but still, mine’. As most of the stories are told in the retrospective, such as the showstopper Raphael where the narrator recounts the possible stories of what happened on one violent and tragic day and realizes ‘the other story I told myself was that I could make up for it all,’ living his life as a great father in response to the abuse a friend had received from her own, and we see how the interjections of terror resonate across an entire lifetime. While these are scary stories, there is something so literary too them, something unique and engaging that make them feel almost like classics the first time you read them.‘Isn’t that what fairy tales are, anyway? What we tell ourselves about ourselves, just in an indirect way, with elves and magic and monsters to make it all safe?’There is a wide variety of stories here too, which adds to the fun because you are never quite sure what you will get next. A boy learns the lengths his father would go to help them survive, teen mean girls find a weight loss method that has deadly consequences, a snake-oil salesman faces off in a zombified wild west, a deadly rodeo bull might be the trapped soul of a serial killer, and even baby monitors and dolphins are used to instill fear. Jones is able to genre bend and blend in really interesting ways, and even when some of the stories fall flat it is still fun to see him experimenting. One particularly well-done story is Captain’s Lament, where a tale becomes the backstory to a well-known urban legend, but Jones navigates it so well that the surprise twist is when you connect it to what story he is referencing. I was impressed.As most of these stories are collected from various magazine and anthology publications, there is a bit of repeated themes or techniques, though Jones is effective with them so it hardly matters. I do enjoy the way he often tells you what is coming before it happens, but without context so it registers more like a dire warning it is too late to heed. It is interesting, too, that the title of the collection is The Ones That Got Away though the story it references is titled Ones Who Got Away, but whatever. While I found After the People Lights Have Gone Off to be a slightly stronger collection, this was incredible fun and full of lots of spooky good times. These are stories that are certain to get under your skin.3.75/5‘I swallowed, my eyes full with what had happened, with who, or what, I’d led to Elaine, with what he might be picking from his teeth right now in whatever dark place he was holed up in for the daylight hours, and then, to make up for it, to start making up for it, I draped my new granddad’s arm across my shoulders, to help him up the hill, and understood a little even then, I think, about what it might be like to have spent your whole life alone, so that just one person reaching up to help you along could mean the world, and save your life, and make everything all right for a few moments.’...more",Notes are private!,0,134,1,"Sep 24, 2022","Sep 26, 2022","Sep 24, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8889080-the-ones-that-got-away

A surreal and startling collection, Bliss Montage by Ling Ma is a true treat of small, claustrophobic tales that exist like liminal spaces. Populated by lonely protagonists, there are drugs that make you invisible, a sexual romp with a yeti who wears human skin as a disguise and is an avid record collector and chain smoker, a woman lives with her husband and 100 ex-boyfriends, passages into mysterious worlds and so much more that one can never be sure what surprise awaits at the flip of a page. As a character remarks, ‘It is in the most surreal situations that a person feels the most present, the closest to reality, ’ and Ma excels at embedding social investigations into the strangest of spaces. Through distorting reality into the weird and wild, Ma looks at the ways we navigate relationships, dislocation, family, loss and love while examining aspects of immigrant culture and storytelling itself across eight stories that will leave you haunted yet delighted.Ling Ma returns here after her widely loved Severance, a novel that seemed to eerily predict the pandemic, and leans into offkilter realities that so succinctly reflect ourselves back to us through her distortions. They exist in the real world, occasionally ‘a different, if not inevitable, time’ in the near future, but most quickly morph into the fantastical. These stories thrive on vibes and often leave the reader to piece things together themselves, though readers who tend to want a sense of resolution may find the stories stopping too soon for their tastes. Ma is interested less in the aftermath and more in the tension that builds, her stories are like watching the strain on the strings of a slingshot as it pulls back its projectile towards inevitable release rather than the target it may or may not hit. Her prose is fluid and fun, handling bizarre situations with the same calm as the mundane and her marvelous imagination is on full display to enjoy. The women in Bliss Montage, predominantly Asian American women, tend to exist in a state of loneliness. Married, unmarried, or following their violent ex-boyfriend to tell his current girlfriend the dangerous truth about him, they find themselves removed from those around them and are often just trying to get by and unsure how to navigate that as time seems to be slipping past them. In stories such as G, in which a drug makes the user invisible (there is a great aspect about vulnerability here, as they must be fully nude while taking it), the narrator remarks ‘my adult sense of self formed in the complete absence of my reflection,’ and the idea that the sense of self is often imposed by the world around them is a prevailing theme.‘Look, we’re not like Americans, we don’t need to talk about everything that gives us a negative feeling.’It is less society and more the mother figures that impact the sense of self most in these stories, such as the narrator resisting her mother so much in G as to make her teenage persona a complete negation of what her mother wants her to be. In Peking Duck, a story within a story dealing with an Chinese immigrant mother and a discussion on who a story belongs to, the mother resents her daughter using her personal struggles as part of her own identity and stories. One of the more disturbing stories, Tomorrow, centers on a mother who’s unborn child is already sticking his arm outside her body, a reminder that becoming a mother can be a literal nightmare, not just a nightmare for those they raise. Much of this plays into Ma expressing ideas on Asian American culture and unique expectations on daughters within it. The friction in G is created by the mothers of the narrator and her friend, but the friends perpetuate into another generation these expectations imposed on them onto each other, such as judging one another’s weight and beauty. ‘The immigrant imperative was to buy property and to propagate,’ the narrator writes in Returning, a story about feeling caught in expectations and either resisting or engaging in transformations. This was one of my favorite pieces, feeling Jorge Luis Borges-esque with the plots of several fictional novels (written by the characters) being important to the message, each focusing on ideas of immigrant identity or marriage. There is also frequent insight into the ways Asian Americans are Othered in society, such as a doctor assuming a woman didn’t grow up in America (‘why wouldn’t he assume that she was a second- or third-generation immigrant?’), or the incident at the heart of Peking Duck where an assumption of a Chinese mother as subservient and that a man ‘can tell you don’t belong here,’ leads to him becoming aggressive and demanding in a string of incidents leading to her being fired. Peking Duck is easily one of the most powerful stories in the collection and is one of several stories where conversations on authenticity come into play. The narrator is told by another Asian American classmate that her MFA assignment story is ‘unrealistic,’ and ‘a kind of Asian minstrelsy,’ that engages in stereotypes that makes her story offensive to Asian Americans, though the story is biographical about the aforementioned firing incident. In Office Space, a surreal academic drama with large nods to The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, the narrator’s film class discusses Ghost World and interrogates if it is possible to truly escape to an authentic place for her class titled Disappearing Women, foreshadowing a truly bizarre space she will come to occupy. While much of the content in  Bliss Montage is humorous and whimsical (the husband in Los Angeles only speaks in dollar symbols, literally with ‘$$$$ $$$ $$$$$’ written in place of dialogue), there is a real heavy grounding that reminds us so much of how women are pushed from the frame such as in the films in the academic story. The two opening stories deal with domestic violence and assault (the recurring name of the abuser is a curious choice) and Yeti Lovemaking is a comic look at the mistakes one makes post-break-up, quite literally sleeping with a monster. Combine this with the frequent examinations of body image, alienation and family dynamics and Bliss Montage is quite a powerful punch delivered in a sweet satirical coating.Ling Ma is such a gem and Bliss Montage is quite the experience. From literary discussions to insights into identity, Ma charms with her fascinating imagination in stories that are as fantastic as they are fantastical.4.5/5...more",Notes are private!,0,298,1,"Sep 23, 2022","Sep 23, 2022","Sep 23, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60243188-bliss-montage

Best known for her monumentous work The Second Sex, which lit the spark for second-wave feminism, or her Prix Goncourt winning novel The Mandarins, Inseparable is a very intimate look at de Beauvoir’s real-life friendship with Élisabeth Lacoin, called Zaza, who appears in the novel as Andrée Gallard (Simone appears as narrator Sylvie Lepage). Zaza, who tragically died just before her 22nd birthday, was a major figure in Simone’s young life, the two of them deemed to be ‘inseparable’ by their teachers, and in this story we see the early gears of thought in young Sylvie’s mind on the confines of a religious and patriarchal society on young women and those who choose to seek an independence and uniqueness of self. Having been deemed too intimate for publication in the 50s, we are now graced with this moving portrait of friendship and struggle that foreshadows the philosophical works the great feminist existentialist would write throughtout her lifetime, being a sharp criticism of oppressive systems and religion that Beauvior found suffocating to being an authentic person.  [image]Zaza and Simone (Andrée and Sylvie)While the official story is that Beauvoir thought the novel too intimate and claimed it had ‘no inner necessity and failed to hold the reader’s interest,’ there is much speculation that it was the dismissal of the work by friend and philosopher contemporary Jean-Paul Sartre that caused her to lose faith in it. As Margaret Atwood states in the book’s introduction (she does not hold back against Sartre) that Sartre found the book trivial, shocked that ‘for a materialist Marxist…the book is intensely descriptive of the physical and social conditions of its two young female characters,’ and that it was inconsequential when ‘serious’ literature dealt with the means of production of factories and agriculture. Written five years after The Second Sex, it is tragic to see the points within her great work of philosophy be made so blatantly against her own novel and the notion that the interior life of a intelligent young woman be deemed trivial. The novel is quite engaging in fact, and Beauvoir’s prose (gorgeously translated her by Sandra Smith) is very fluid—something I’ve enjoyed with her philosophical works and have found them very readable and accessible. So without further adieu, let’s talk about this work that we are finally able to read because it hit me right in the gut and I love it for it.‘Andrée was one of those child prodigies whose lives would later be recounted in books.’The dedication to Zaza at the start of Inseperable reads ‘If I have tears in my eyes tonight, is it because you have died, or rather because I’m the one who is still alive?’ Which, spoilers much? but also the framing of the novel knowing the tragic end even before beginning allows the reader to focus in with heightened attention on the emotional turmoil bubbling within the two characters that will lead to the untimely end of Sylvie’s great friendship. ‘When I was nine, I was a very good girl,’ the story begins, and Sylvie is soon acquainted with Andrée who’s bold and direct way of speaking beguiles and intrigues her as does her freedom to roam about the streets alone. The two become inseparable and while they both are top of their class their attitudes are deemed impertinent. Sylvie decides she will pursue individual freedom, inspired by Andrée’s own actions and beliefs such as when surreptitiously smoking she remarks ‘Mama forbids it; but when you start to disobey . . .’ which leads to her falling out of Christian faith. ‘I was resolutely determined to continue to eat, read, speak, and dream in whatever way I pleased. “I don’t believe in God!” I thought. How was it possible to believe in God and deliberately choose to disobey Him? I sat stunned for a moment by this revelation: I did not believe.’This lack of belief changes her perception on the world and in her outsider status as a non-believer she begins to observe how much human nature is restricted by notions of sin, especially women.‘I still haven’t told Mama that I disobeyed her, and the worst part is that I’m not sorry.’While initially rebellious, the confines of society begin to close in around Andrée. At home she is hardly afforded a moment to herself, beleaguered by an ‘enormous family: a prison, whose exits were carefully guarded.’ At the head of the household is her mother, Madame Gallard, who is said to have refused her husband twice before being obliged to marry him, and through Sylvie we witness a view of how once independent women are not only torn from their beliefs, but social expectations corner them into being authoritative parents that then perpetuate the oppressive behavior upon their daughters. The belief that getting married is the purpose of a young girl’s life is shown here, though Sylvie observes that even a partner in marriage is less a choice and more an obligation imposed. Her friend is twice removed from someone she is romantically involved with due to parent’s belief that it is not the right match, and religious beliefs inform much of the resistance. This even applies to Pascal (a stand-in for French phenomenology philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty), a man who ‘could be categorized as “a young man suitable in all respects”’ The mother demands Andrée be sent away until marriage so as not to be tempted to be in Pascal’s company, something that causes her extreme emotional distress and pressures Pascal to consider a marriage he does not find himself yet ready to enter. Which is all perpetuating a sad society of people being socially locked into actions that they are not emotionally ready for all for the sake of social manners and a fear of being ‘sinful’ if they follow their desires. This instilled fear of temptations of the flesh is part of what makes women view their own bodies with shame, de Beauviour writes in The Second Sex, adding a layer that the attraction of their body is sinful only burdens young women further and objectifies them even more.‘Do I have to spend my life fighting with the people I love?’In The Second Sex, Beauvoir examines how narratives have contributed to the Othering of women, from myths to religious stories that have been used to treat women as subservient to men and enforce moral behavior. While Sylvie feels herself free from these worries of sin, she sees the obligations imposed on her friend’s relations as a restriction of freedom, a caging of women and men into unhappy lives and marriages for no reason beyond upholding a narrative. Andrée is an interesting person in this respect, loving out of pure intentions and upholding religious beliefs out of love while acknowledging many use religion as an instrument of oppression. ‘She had discovered, with outrage, the chasm that separated the teaching of the Gospels and the self-serving, egotistical, petty behavior of self-righteous people.’ In the afterword by Sylvie Le Bon-de Beauvoir, Simone’s daughter, she writes that for Andrée: ‘faith was not, as it was for so many others, a complaisant dependence on God, a means of being right, of self-justification or fleeing responsibilities but the painful questioning of a silent, obscure, hidden God.’Her belief in wanting to be good and wanting to be happy is frequently blocked by people who claim to be doing it for her own good. ‘We were only the instruments of God,’ says Monsieur Gallard when it is already too late, and here we see how religion also becomes a scapegoat to wash one’s hands of their complicity in oppression and Andrée’s own demise. She also demonstrates how it becomes a way to avoid acknowledgement of class oppression, seeing the poor as unclean and being that way due to sin, their status as upper class being a gift from God and under no obligation to deconstruct the class structure that they profit from and use to keep others beneath them. In The Ethics of Ambiguity, Beauvior writes ‘If we do not love life on our own account and through others, it is futile to seek to justify it in any way,’ condemning the way religion forces young women to push aside their identities and convictions to create one through the justification of religious narratives. The aspects of Sylvie being condescended by Pascal for not being a believer felt all too true living in a community where I see this in my daily life. To be clear, Beauvoir’s criticism is not with religion itself, but in the ways it is wielded by others as a tool of behavior modification and subservience. She demonstrates how the narrative is used in ways that instill guilt and fear that is used to uphold systems that are in need of ethical refurbishing in order to be more equitable and humane. Most impactful is when Sylvie observes ‘The grave was covered in white flowers. In some strange way, I understood that Andrée had died, suffocated by that whiteness.’ The book is a sharp critical look at the way whitewashing life and human nature restricts freedom and suffocates people, men and women alike. This is very indicative of its time, of course, and the sexual revolution was still a decade in coming, but the lessons still echo in our world today.‘Zaza died because she tried to be herself and was convinced that such a desire was evil,’ states Le Bon-de Beauvior, and the novel functions as a chronicle on how Andrée’s desire to be good under the restrictions of social enforcement of behavior clashed with her desire to be a unique, loving individual and the friction of this due to her self-analysis as being sinful for simply being herself causes her to fracture mentally and physically. The book is a beautiful tribute to a friend now gone. As Atwood observes, the lessons Beauvior took from the time of friendship with Zaza blossomed into her philosophical lessons. ‘Perhaps she herself worked so hard to become who she was as a sort of memorial,’ Atwood writes, ‘Beauvoir must express herself to the utmost, because Zaza could not.’ It took decades to reach a mass audience, but I am thankful Inseparable has finally made it to print. This is a quick read but one that had me by the throat the whole time, all the more engaging as I am currently half-way through The Second Sex. This is a moving book and a loving look at a friendship that helped shape the philosophical world forever.4.5/5‘At every instant, blessed eternity was in play, and no clear sign was given to indicate if you were about to achieve it or lose it!’...more",Notes are private!,4,284,1,not set,not set,"Sep 22, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56197486-inseparable

Dewdrop by Kay O'Neill is done in a graphicGreat news: the author of The Tea Dragon Society has a picture book for little readers and it is ADORABLE. Dewdrop by Kay O'Neill is done in a graphic novel style and is fun for both kids and parents. When the pond has a sports day competition, Dewdrop the axolotl and all his friends sign up to participate or help but as the day approaches everyone is feeling anxiety that they will not be good enough. This is a cute story about supporting your friends and doing what is right for you that will certainly become a bedtime staple. I mean, look how cute this is:  [image]Picture books are great, though often I find that the ones that really appeal to adults tend to be written more for them than the actual kid, and some that kids really enjoy become a bit much when you have to read it over and over again. This one fits right in the middle, being fun for everyone and having a great message to take to heart that doesn’t feel patronizing or over the child’s head. Plus it has O’Neill’s signature artwork that is cottagecore-esque coziness and warmth that is fun just to look at.The story is very sweet, with Dewdrop going to all his friends and encouraging them to do their best. There is a great message of not worrying what other people think or do, doing what makes you happy and being proud of yourself for trying your best. Plus Dewdrop doing his cheerleading routine is cute. There are also extras at the back giving fun facts about the different animals seen in the story, like turtles and newts. The book is short enough, too, so when a child says ""again!"" at the end, it isn't a big amount of time to reread. This is a fun and colorful little story that is perfect for kids, my 2 year old demands it all the time!
