I put it off ’til my 40s, having been lied to by so many people for so long that I believed reading it would be like eating my vegetables - good to have done, sure, but not an enjoyable way to spend my time. People actually describe this dizzy book as a slog. I think people got off on the wrong foot, thinking Moby-Dick was supposed to be this dour, dignified affair and because of that never actually grasped what they were reading. So here we have our narrator. Old man Ishmael, a real eyeful. He’s basically one of those old guys at your local coffee spot who is there at 5:30 every morning til about 11:00 in the same chair at the same table and he always has a flock of 15-minute friends flitter by for a story or two and boy does he have stories and boy will he tell them. He’s got opinions by the boatload and only a quarter of them are political. He drives you nuts but you love him, and really everybody loves him, and even the people who shout “F★★★ off!” and storm out after talking to him are there the next day for more of his wacky stories. That’s Ishmael, this old salt tattoo’d stem-to-stern except for a bare spot reserved for a poem he’ll maybe one day write, perhaps a rhyme about Nantucket. He’s by this point sailed every sea and survived every kind of voyage, but now he’s going to tell you about one of his first. But damned if he’ll let the story get in the way of his telling of it. Ishmael careens from decorated wall to decorated wall in his telling, now he speaks of the beauty and terrible uncanny awfulness of whiteness, now he justifies his opinion that whales are FISH THAT HAVE LUNGS, now he explains the jovial natural depravity of those who work the Erie Canal, now he calls the dictionary Noah Webster’s Word-ark (Noah’s word-ark! heavens!), now he scoffs at the drawings of whales found in Authoritative Books, now he has Stubb say that whales, for all their malignancy, naturally handle their foes the whalemen with mittens. And now suddenly he’s telling us the story of how he years later told some sailors in Peru the story of a mutiny on the Town-Ho that he was told by the sailors involved. Instead of, you know, telling us the story of a mutiny on the Town-Ho. Here’s a narrator so in love with the way he once told a story that he tells the Story Of That Telling rather than the object of that story but somehow includes the object story within the story of that story? Dizzying! And then he ends a chapter discussing whale skeletons with this awesome bit: The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied verbatim from my right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild wanderings at that period, there was no other secure way of preserving such valuable statistics. But as I was crowded for space, and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem I was then composing - at least, what untattooed parts might remain - I did not trouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed, should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale. Picture it! Ishmael, having discovered the skeletal dimensions of the sperm whale, gets them tatted to his arm so he’ll remember BUT he is careful to shave off inches so he’ll have room to tat on a poem he was thinkin ’bout - and too much of him was already inked. And people call this book a slog! Imagine that....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,not set,"Jan 20, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/153747.Moby_Dick_or_The_Whale

There’s Ducks by Kate Beaton and now there’s Ducks by Kate Beaton. Kate Beaton’s 2014 comic, Ducks, was roughly between 27 anThere are two Ducks. There’s Ducks by Kate Beaton and now there’s Ducks by Kate Beaton. Kate Beaton’s 2014 comic, Ducks, was roughly between 27 and 40 pages long (depending panels per page), and at the time I described it as “sad and funny and poignant and altogether human.” Kate Beaton’s 2022 comic, Ducks, is torrentially longer, expanding most of the original work into a 436-page heavyweight. It also, by nature of the expansion, becomes less funny and poignant as those elements retreat further into what is an absolutely harrowing recitation of grim realities (partially enhanced by having known a version of Beaton and her family through the stories she’s told for years on Hark! A Vagrant).[image]As if anticipating the dissonance felt between the two Ducks, Beaton includes on pages 265 and 266 of her 2022 Ducks a brief anecdote that almost feels out of nowhere save for to explain how these two very different Ducks by Kate Beaton could exist. As young Kate relates to George, her boss at the museum library, that there is an author named Helen Creighton who removed all the off-color stories from her own book written in the Fifties, a collection of folk tales from the Maritimes. Creighton’s reason was that they weren’t suitable for reader’s eyes. Thinking on this, young Beaton in that library (as told by Beaton-the-author) is thoughtful: “Makes you wonder what was left out though, doesn’t it? It’s nice, but it’s not the whole picture. And what good is that?”[image]It’s a strange moment and if you’re coming to Ducks for the first time in this 2022 incarnation, you might just think that it’s included as a statement of intent. With the additional context of what Beaton produced as Ducks before though? It reads as repentance, as a righting of the ship. Ducks, as it was, is “sad and funny and poignant and altogether human.” Ducks, as it is now, as true and whole a Ducks as we will see, is dark. I’ve mentioned grim and harrowing already, but throw in some other descriptors: heart-breaking, rage-inducing, tragic, awful. There are moments of humor, moments of poignancy, but the whole thing is smothered by the absolute, unquenchable awfulness of men when they are not at home.[image]While Beaton’s earlier attempt at telling stories from the Albertan oil sands (she worked for Syncrude and Shell) focused on the inhumanity of the work, the environmental impact of the oil extraction process, and the essential humanity of the workers cut off from their homes and families, in the present telling, Beaton tells more of the whole story, and that is a story of how a project focused on stripping resources from the land as efficiently as possible unsurprisingly also builds a world steeped in misogyny, sexual objectification, harassment, assault, and rape. As a result, many of the things that felt central to Ducks (2014) fade into the background of Ducks (2022). Beaton still includes most of the stories she used in the earlier Ducks, but the horror of asshole men is so exhaustingly pervasive that it dominates the book. [image]And that’s not a criticism. As young Beaton asks, what good would Ducks be if it elided the most everyday and constant of Beaton’s experiences on the oil sands? Ducks (2014) reminds us gently of the human cost of industry. Ducks (2022) will not allow us to forget the human cost of industry. It’s like Grave Of The Fireflies like that. Maybe Ducks‘ll be the lever that turns some kid toward empathy (Grave Of The Fireflies was one of a few works that did that for me)—and wouldn’t that be something!Beaton juggles a lot here—and most of it successfully. We’ve got, of course, the culture of casual female assault here, but also the effect of being torn from home, the humanity of the individuals who get sucked into the oil sands vortex, the effect of dehumanizing labor on those individuals, the economy that prompts people to sacrifice themselves to industry like this, the importance of family, the difference between real world and the camps and if there’s actually a difference, and the issue of environmental calamity and how that calamity affects disproportionally the native populations that Canada has never properly cared for or valued. As I said, there’s a lot to juggle here. [image]Some of it gets a lot of space, and some of it just a couple thoughtful pages of ruminations from men in trucks. The only time I felt I wanted more was in Ducks’ discussion of the environmental crisis. There’s a moment, almost out of nowhere, where young Beaton turns on a Youtube video (after discussion of whether the company has blocked the site like it’s already blocked Facebook) and we get a 3-page interview clip from Celina Harpe (this clip in fact!) about the affects of the industry on the local population. It’s set differently from Beaton’s style of dialogue beats so I kind of, uh, tuned out. I realized it was important because it ends with a 2/3-page panel, rare in the book’s usual 6- and 9-panel grids, so I went back to pay closer attention. It’s good, but it still feels abrupt to me—especially with so little prior interest in the environment shown in the narrative.That quibble aside, Beaton’s done something wonderful here in taking a familiar work and exploding it out into something truly daunting. Ducks is physically uncomfortable to read, being an heavy-with-ink hardcover but also having a jacket that feels coated in sandpaper—which kept me texturally unnerved for the duration. But all that is just foreshadowing for the discomfort and anxiety that comes from actually reading, thinking constantly, Oh, Katie, this is bad. Oh no, how are you going to get out of—oh. oh. oh no. oh no. [image]Our world is full of bad men. And of men who are bad but don’t think of themselves as bad. I am one of their victims and chances are you are too. I know that I know a lot of their victims. I’m glad Beaton drew the curtain back on Two Years In The Oil Sands, and I’m sorry she was able to have something to write about it at all. I don’t know if I’ll reread it. I haven’t rewatched Grave Of The Fireflies either. Ducks is good. Ducks is great. And it breaks my heart into this rage-shattered thing. I try to be a pacifist, but I’m not very good at it, and books like this just evaporate my inclinations toward peaceful solutions to the terror that people inflict on others.____One curiosity with the expansion of the work is that the titular ducks are no longer quite as large a part of the story. Their death in the Syncrude tailings pond occurs late in the book, once Katie is working for Shell and it’s kind of there and gone. Still, with the new book’s more expansive purpose, the title becomes something more. This is not just the environmental tragedy of sixteen hundred ducks dying as a sacrifice to human greed. Instead, the ducks are people like Kate, assaulted by the world that greed creates. The ducks are the workers who use drugs to get through and then get destroyed by them along the way. The ducks are the Cree, the women, the families, the destroyed marriages. The ducks in Ducks are those people sacrificed on the altar of Lord Mammon, careless castoffs that the corporations will never know or care about.____[note: if you’re concerned about the sensationalization of sexual assault, this book is not that. There is nothing exciting or titillating going on here. Beaton’s lens averts its eyes so that we get the before and the after but not the during so much. It’s careful in that respect, but perhaps no less traumatizing to read.]...more",Notes are private!,0,47,1,not set,not set,"Sep 27, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59069071-ducks

Driftless, they ingratiate themselves to a Crazy Horse's Souix tribe and become fast friends through shared values.

Further, Hiko and Manzo fully dwell within their part within the Souix citizenry - as with many naturalized citizens, they find themselves eager to be the best representatives of their adoptive nation.The book ends with a letter from Taniguchi, penned in 2009, wondering what American audiences would think of his mucking around with their history and culture.

It's missing McCarthy's lovely bleak writing but has in its place Gipi's lovely bleak writing-with-pictures.In some ways, this post-apocalyptic story is like all the other post-apocalyptic stories and we know what to expect. Societal collapse, anarchy by way of pocket monarchies, cannibalism, rape, strength as right-to-power, and the last gasps of religion. That's all here, as one would expect from the genre. But there's a little bit more too that pushes the book to the surface to which the better post-apocalypses rise.Just as The Road is about a father's love, so too is Land Of Sons. And sons' love for their father. It's a bit more circuitous than The Road, but its also right there in the book's title. As well, Lino and Santo are largely referred to throughout the book by those who know them as ""the sons."" That the book is principally about relationship is clear despite how much of the page count the father and his sons spend apart from each other.Amusingly, there's a running quest throughout where Lino is trying to find someone who can read a notebook he's acquired. The plot hinges on its importance, but simultaneously, it could be read as Gipi making a small argument for the value of comics: in an illiterate world, people can still read pictures hopefully.___The only aspect of the story that I was on the fence about was the specialized fetishistic jargon the religious sect has adopted.

We, all of us, have just seen Swing Kids and there is something monumental welling up in us. We want to feel that excitement, that thrill, that passion—we want to feel whatever it was that made those kids dance in the face of the rise of Nazi fascism and shout out “Swing heil!” There was something in the music, contagious. Something in the moves. So we did everything we could to learn to dance. I mean, everything that didn’t involve actual lessons. We recorded out all the dance sequences from Swing Kids. I obtained footage from Hellzapoppin’. And we watched it over and over and over. Pause play pause play pause play rewind. And again. My friend and I practiced the moves with each other. I’d play the man, then he would. We got the spins, the flips, the twirls, the big air—we got it down, man. And then we spread the contagion among our friends. We taught everyone we new. We acquired the music. We hosted parties. Swing parties. Dancing, music, acrobatics, and occasionally even romance. But mostly dancing. Or our approximation of it anyway. I was great at the tricks. The throws, the flips, the twirls. I had no sense for the footwork though. Our videos didn’t teach that. Still, I won a contest (danced with my brother in a routine where we switched off the girl and guy roles) and had a lot of fun. I felt the fire. Haven’t danced in two decades now. But I kind of remember.[image]At first glance, Welcome To The Ballroom might seem like a niche read, something for fans of the craft. It’s ballroom dancing, right? and as the manga points out maybe at least once per volume, ballroom dancing is for upper-middle-class middle-aged people with nothing better to do. Fortunately Welcome To The Ballroom is much better than that and caters to a much wider audience. [image]This is a sports story and one of those sports stories about the prodigy player who got a late start on the sport and is going to quickly make up for lost time because he’s that good. It’s a common enough formula, but Welcome To The Ballroom performs its steps very well. It’s graceful on the fundamentals while throwing in some delicious variations for a pizazz that serves to elevate the rest of the story. In the five vols I’ve read so far (I’m enamoured enough that I plan to continue with the series as new vols are released), fifteen-year-old Fujita moves from entirely inexperienced amateur to gifted would-be competitor. He begins the series aimless and struggling to find an interest as he is being pushed to choose a high school to attend. Accidentally, he finds himself in a dance studio with members devoted to competitive ballroom dance. While initially embarrassed and hoping nobody discovers him there (male dancers have about as great a reputation amongst other teens in Japan as they do here), Fujita sees a video of what competitive ballroom dance is actually like and in set alight. He has a direction now and will rocket toward it through the rest of the story, meeting obstacles and overcoming them or using his defeats by them to improve himself. (See? That sports story formula. AKA life story formula.)[image]If you’ve read sports manga before, you’re probably familiar with the story beats, but where Welcome To The Ballroom shines is in its visual depictions of athleticism. In Polina, Bastien Vivès ably depicted his ballet dancers in spare, minimalist gestures, giving the dance a quiet fluidity emphasizing the grace and beauty of the form. Welcome To The Ballroom doesn’t remotely attempt this. Takeuchi’s dancers are vibrant, bursting with frenetic energy. They are electric and exciting and Takeuchi draws flourishes to highlight some of the emotional energy exploding beneath the skin. Fire will crackle off the clasped hands of a couple as they waltz. A character will be engulfed in flame to express his rage or passion. The skin of another will bristle and steam as their waning strength rejuvenates to pull out one last showstopper. And the sweat.[image]Takeuchi does one thing I’ve never seen in a comic about active characters before. They are drenched in sweat. Rivers of it pour from their hairline down their faces as they exert themselves. It’s an incredibly small detail but it goes so very far in selling the world of these competitions. The beautiful, gorgeous women in this book do not glisten. They sweat. Buckets. It’s perfect and real. [image]So far at least, Welcome To The Ballroom doesn’t escape its tropes or formulae, but it’s not trying to. Instead, the book is playing entirely within the established realm and doing so with verve. It’s nailing all the steps and avoiding many of the pitfalls. It’s sweeping across the floor getting it done and showing how to do it. Welcome To the Ballroom doesn’t have the emotional range or sweep of Cross Game but does make its sport thrilling even for those, like me, who don’t have much actual interest in the activity depicted.___[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,not set,"Jul 14, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17909717-1-ballroom-e-y-koso-1

Whether the Jewish Lilith, broxa, or Rahab. Whether the Greek cyclops, Minotaur, or Gorgon. Whether the sailors’ Kraken, the mermaid, or sirens. Whether the Japanese yokai, Chinese qilin, Australian bunyip, or Islam’s Dead Sea apes. Monsters abound, each fulfilling their own role in the structure of the societies they haunt. The Christian mythos, long dominant in the West, has its fill as well—many proliferating in the medieval era. Dragons are tied to the Serpent that tempted humanity in the Earthly Paradise, and were often only defeated by those in tune with the sacred call of the Divine (e.g. St George). Ghosts linger as remnant scatterments of the damned, exacting often arbitrary retributions as mindless graspings for revenge. Demons make their homes in the hearts of men, women, and children, causing mayhem and disaster, and are former angels, twisted from their original state of noble beauty for (or from) their violent rebellion against God. Even vampires, whose Western tradition arrived rather late, are in the West intimately tied the trappings of Christian faith, being subject to Holy Water, holy ground, crosses, sunlight, and faith. But among the more well-renowned monsters of the Christian folklore is Grendel (even more so than his mother, who is really only known as “Grendel’s Mother”).Whether “God-cursed Grendel came greedily loping” (Heaney, 711) or “Grendel gliding, God’s wrath on him” (Rebsmen, 711), reference to the Christian foundation to the myth is essential in understanding the role of the creature. Beowulf, though obviously apocryphal to the religion (it’s unlikely that you’ll ever wander into a church preaching through the saga), is founded in Christianity and traffics deeply in the the religion’s vernacular as coin of its realm. Grendel and his kind are the offspring of the first murderer, Cain the killer of his kin-blood who, being ever cursed by the Shaper and Measurer of our world, sired evil and cunning man-killers, banished from heartlove and born in hatred (Rebsamen, 106–112). From Cain came ogres and trolls and elves, but more—from Cain came Grendel. Monster of monsters. Beowulf begins with a hearty description of the Spear-Danes, whose heroic campaigns raised from a wasteland walls of glory. And yet these mighty men fall fully under the power of Grendel, a creature none can thwart. Has God’s light left his people (for yes, Christianity had infiltrated Northern Europe by this time and the great Danish Christian viking king Canute began his reign in AD 1017)? Beowulf‘s temporary answer at least is Of course not because, “Oh hey look who it is: Beowulf!” And indeed, reference to Almighty God and his graciouness pepper the narrative so that we remember that there by the grace of God goes our hero.[image]So yes, the Christian foundation to the story is entirely essential. Although, maybe not, since García and Rubín sever any reference to the mythos in their vibrant retelling of the fable._______Now let’s interject here with a short discussion of comparison of interpretations. Because there’s nothing so interesting as comparison. Beowulf, depending on whom you ask, opens as such:In Hall: “Lo! the Spear-Danes’ glory through splendid achievements. The folk-kings’ former fame we have heard of, how princes displayed then their prowess-in-battle.”In Heaney: “So. The Spear-Danes in days gone by and the kings who ruled them had courage and greatness. We have heard of these princes’ heroic campaigns.”In Rebsamen: “Yes! We have heard of years long vanished, how Spear-danes struck, sang victory songs, raised from a wasteland walls of glory!”In Gummere: “Lo, praise of the prowess of people-kings, of spear-armed Danes, in days long sped, we have heard, and what honor the athelings won!”In Raffel: “Hear me! We’ve heard of Danish heroes, Ancient kings and the glory they cut for themselves, swinging mighty swords!”In Liuzza: “Listen! We have heard of the glory in bygone days of the folk-kings of the spear-Danes, how those noble lords did lofty deeds.”In Alexander: “Attend! We have heard of the thriving of the throne of Denmark, how the folk-kings flourished in former days, how those royal athelings earned that glory.”_______[image]Translation, the adaptation of a text for an audience for whom that text was not originally intended, is a tricky business. There’s never really going to be a right answer. Plenty of wrong answers, but no right answers. The above is a comparison of several translations of the opening to Beowulf. What it shows more than just which authors are more talented is that there are always going to be a variety of ways to approach a text. And they can each be valid. That doesn’t stop us from having preferences—it just means that we prefer one vision or way of revealing a text to another.Like with the above, I definitely prefer Rebsamen. Compare with Heaney here:“Spear-danes struck, sang victory songs, raised from a wasteland walls of glory!”vs.“The Spear-Danes in days gone by had courage and greatness. We have heard of these princes’ heroic campaigns.”[image]The one is showy, the other is telly. In Rebsamen, the Spear-Danes are doing things; in Heaney, we hear rumour that the Spear-Danes once did things. Are both legitimate adaptations of the original text? Almost certainly. But they underscore, I think rather distinctly, how the purpose revealed in an adaptation is going to depend unavoidably on the goals of the translator. _______There are (now) two major comics adaptations of Beowulf1 In 1999, Gareth Hinds released in three issues an adaptation that makes heavy use of the actual text of Beowulf.2 Nearly 20 years later, we get a new adaptation—this one from Spain and adapted by Santiago García and David Rubín. And they are substantially different from each other.[image]Gareth Hinds does a good job showing Beowulf old and broken at the end of things.Where Hinds’ illustrations are relatively static and artfully posed, Rubín’s are wildly dramatic and bursting with life. Hinds feels noble and distant and Rubín feels visceral and present. Hinds’ palette is subdued and by the final third nearly entirely desaturated (which does go a long way toward drawing the reader into the stiffness and age-pain in Beowulf’s limbs). Rubín’s pages burst with colour, especially heavy, groteque reds, emphasizing more trenchantly the violence of the time, of the events. In Hinds, bodies are strewn with thick black splatter connoting the gush of lifesblood; in Rubín, viscera is spilt in vibrant crimson and the organs fly in a tangle of stretching innards that would compare well with Michael Avon Oeming’s gratuitously explosive work in Powers.[image]Pray to St Oeming, that your organs might find their way to heaven.Curiously though, as far as creature-design goes, neither Hinds’ nor Runbin’s Grendel is much removed from the other. Both are dark, hulking abstractions from the human frame, built of seemingly exposed sinews. Each has their sex emphasized: Rubín’s by overtly showing Grendel’s penis as he ejaculates onto Beowulf and initiates the fateful battle, and Hinds’ by hiding Grendel’s member in a mane of snaking thick pubic tendrils. These monsters are each clearly perversions of the masculine male, a twisting corruption of what could have been.Rubín’s Grendel:[image]Premature, Grendel. But don’t be mad. No shame in it, Buddy.vs Hinds’ Grendel:[image]One final note on Rubín’s art: it’s just fantastic. While thoroughly in the realm of what I’ve seen from him before in the Aurora West books and the more recent Heracles revamp (The Hero), Rubín’s laid out a more grounded (mostly) style than what we saw in The Hero (which is simultaneously more fantastic with its sci-fi/fantasy blend and its more cartoonish vision). Beowulf in his hands is still distant and distinct from realism, but it at least puts us in mind that this story is meant to have happened in our world. The size of these pages is great as well, really giving Rubín’s layouts the opportunity to breathe. Even if you don’t care for the story of this particular hero and the three monsters (plus Swedes) he faces, Rubín’s art may be enough to draw your interest.[image]But the differences are more than just in the art. Hinds pulls directly from the text, using only narrative boxes and eschewing dialogue balloons. These text blocks are heavy and depending on what you’re reading for may either be a joy or a chore. For me personally, they sit at odds with and distract from the story being told in the art. I felt this in 1999 and I feel it today (usually now when reading Hinds’ adaptation, I’ll skip entirely reading any of the text and focus wholly on the images—thankfully I’m familiar enough with the Beowulf text that this is plausible for me). For this new work, however, writer Santiago García (whose dream this edition realizes) uses no direct quotation save for in its curious postlogue. Apart from a single “12 years later”, I don’t believe I remember any other use of narrative balloons. Everything is revealed through direct dialogue. In this sense, Hinds is more similar to the telly Heaney and García to the showy Rebsamen. García’s adaptation mirrors Rubín’s (they make a good team!) in that both work to promote the action of the story at the expense of (or perhaps to counteract) the distance of one thousand years. In Hinds, the reader feels the ancient quality of the story, that we are privy to something old and foreign. In García and Rubín, there is immediacy. This is no longer something distant nor something foreign.[image]Gareth Hinds and his narrative blocksAnd then again, the difference is in more than just the art and the writing style. Just as the variety of prose translators choose to emphasize each in their own manner and direction, García and Rubín create a very different kind of Beowulf story by entirely revoking the Christian mythos as the story’s foundation. While every prose translation underscores both the hand of God as well as Grendel’s biblical origin, and Hinds retains the presence of the Almighty lurking behind the scenes (though only remarking that Grendel derives of a cursed race), García and Rubín have none of it. Their monster is without origin and their story is entirely secularized. It’s probably a good question: are monsters better when they merely are or when there is a reason for their existence? Godzilla exists because of the hubris of humanity, but Kong exists simply because he does. Dracula exists because of manifest perversions. Krueger exists because of manifest perversions. Frankenstein’s monster exists because of humanity’s hubris. The evil dead come to be from humanity’s hubris. Jaws exists simply because it does, maybe as an allegorical nudge for humanity to remember their domain and not infringe on the domain of others. Are the monsters that are monsters for a reason better monsters? I don’t know, but in this case, I think Grendel is more interesting if he has some tie to the origin of the human species than if he is merely some wandering brute. This is, from my view, the only one of two missteps in this new adaptation. (The other is probably Grendel ejaculating on Beowulf. I still can’t decide whether it was spontaneous or if the creature was caught in the midst of masturbating onto the hero. Either way, it probably doesn’t matter, but the moment is so strange and unheralded a departure from the source that it sticks out perhaps overmuch as a distraction—in fact, I’m still trying to figure out its purpose and value to the book maybe it is enough that it simultaneously underscores Grendel as a part of nature while also highlighting how apart he is from civilized interaction.)[image]One of the most interesting aspects of García and Rubín’s Beowulf is that in its conclusion, the creators transition the reader from myth to fact, from reading the adventure of this monster slayer to being pulled exteriorily into experience a kind of tl;dr rendition of the book’s production. We move from seeing that famous Hwæt wê Gâr-dena to a panel of the saga’s opening lines (strangely using the Lesslie Hall translation rather than the Heaney one that García references in the aftermatter as the book’s source), then to a script description of the eight panels on this book’s first page, then to page 1 pencils, then to inks and colours, then to layout of the cover, then to Rubín’s email to García that the book is complete, then to it’s print and publication and sale and acquirement by a reader and opening by that reader, and then finally, with the book having been opened (within itself!), the book finally ends with FIN. As if Beowulf’s life and death, his whole adventure, can only truly conclude with the consumption of his life and death by the reader. Beowulf’s goal here is eternal glory and he finally achieves that with each new reader—ironic that in a book that steadfastly elides the hero’s religious origins that he must be consumed body and blood by the reader to achieve his final, lasting victory._____[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_____NOTES:1) This discounts the more fanciful and less faithful adaptations of the story, like Kid Beowulf, in favour of what we may consider largely “straight” adaptations.2) Originally using text from Gummere’s translation, but switching to Church’s for trade paperback collection....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,not set,"Apr 24, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18754825-beowulf

Inside the darkness, I saw rain falling on the sea. Rain softly falling on a vast sea, with no one there to see it. The rain strikes the surface of the sea, yet even the fish don't know it's raining. Until someone came and lightly rested a hand on my shoulder, my thoughts were of the sea"" (from South of the Border, West of the Sun).While better known for his epic, bizarre excursions into real-but-magical worlds of talking animals, dreams that infect the day, and empty-shelled men and women who might never be whole again, it's often in Haruki Murakami's quieter works that I find his best expression. For a long time The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle was my favourite of his bibliography. It may still be—that's a hard thing to decide. But after reading about ten of his works, I came across South of the Border, West of the Sun, and I was floored. I had understandably grown accustomed to his writing, his themes, his tics. I was still appreciative of his work but no longer excited. Everything felt familiar. But with South of the Border, I felt as if I were reading the best distillation of the map he wanted to leave us to find entrance to his world. It's a terse work. 213 pages. Nothing like the 600+ page works that mark the usually noted high points of his collection (Wind-Up Bird, Kafka on the Shore, and 1Q84). South of the Border is mundane by Murakami's standard, a love story and a story of love sustained in absence. It's a story with pockets of frank eroticism—in place much less to titillate than to unveil character and purpose. And then, at the end of the day, South of the Border, West of the Sun's love story is not actually even the point, and instead we find we've been present for a coming of age story that is stretched across four decades. Through an evocative coda, life-bringing rain cleanses in the midst of a psychological turmoil and peace settles through the mundane act of simple human contact. A winding, fraught journey of fumbling and longing ends in a simple realization, unstated and understated.[image]When I read the American press for Inio Asano's A Girl on the Shore, I was thrilled to find that the book was apparently inspired directly by Asano's experience with Murakami's Kafka on the Shore. That is an invocation brimming with mystery, for Kafka is almost certainly the strangest of Murakami's works. It was the first Murakami I ever read and spurred my reader's imagination in new ways—I had never encountered anything of the like. However, I've poked around and haven't been able to find any corroboration for the cited inspiration. Googling in English only returns references back to the original press release. A friend who lived in Japan until she was 25 or so searched that corner of the internet for me and after forty-five minutes (an admittedly brief dive into the web) could only uncover piles of people discussing how very like a Murakami novel Asano's book is. Still, whether A Girl On The Shore is actually inspired by Murakami or not, it's certainly very plausible. Interestingly, the book only holds a glancing likeness to Kafka on the Shore and seems much closer paired with South of the Border, West of the Sun. A Girl on the Shore opens with an awkward post-coital walk along the shore of a somnambulant little town in which two ninth graders discuss whether to forge a romantic relationship out of what the girl viewed as a virginity-losing one-afternoon stand. The girl, Sato, wanted a bit of sex in order to feel something, to rage against the way another boy (the one she pines for) abuses her and is dismissive to her. She instinctively reaches out for a measure of control and convinces Isobe, who's long been attracted to her, to put a little sugar in her bowl (to euphemistically borrow from Nina Simone). She knows he will, and so she takes advantage of that attraction. She's still unfilled, but she's awakened a curiosity and a need. [image][Misaki is a fantastic choice to have a crush on]All of this happens before page 1, and Asano allows us to join them in media res as Isobe asks Sato if she wants to be his girlfriend. But she doesn't think of him like that and cannot be involved with him romantically while she is hoping against hope that Misaki, the cad of her dreams, will finally return her affections. It takes a couple days, but Isobe and Sato iron out a kind of rhythm in which they engage in frequent, escalating, no-strings-attached sexual exploration. The trick of course, as every story ever has taught us, is that we can't always see the strings that guide us, bind us, and draw us. Especially not when our eyes are glued tight in orgasmic ecstasy.[image]Things play out as they will as the kids head toward graduation and on to high school,1  1]Remember that what is the first year of high school in the US is last year of junior high in Japan.]] and everyone discovers that the things they believed so deeply and strongly were most likely only their eager imaginations, fueling and burning in engines of youthful madness and indiscretion. There's a certain profane beauty and chaos to it all. In some ways it reflects the common boy-girl experience and in other ways is horrifyingly unique. There is nothing healthy being explored, but the whole experiment was never about health. It was about overcoming alienation and extorting life into healing without bandaids or antiseptic._____One of the marks of Murakami's fiction is his very dry, almost lifeless descriptions of sex. Those unfamiliar with his style and its use might mistake his sex scenes for clumsy because if there is one thing they are not, it's sexy. They are descriptive, spare, and get the point of the encounter across without making the scene lurid. Here's a sample from Kafka on the Shore. [image][from Murakami's kafka on the shore]The point of Murakami's sex scenes is either a) to convey human proximity and establish the intricacy of the social realm through non-expository means; or b) to investigate an abstract through the concrete act of the sexual encounter. I'd say that sex in Murakami is sometimes probably just sex, but I can't actually think of any candidates from his books where that would be the case.In A Girl on the Shore, Asano's fashioned a curious work in that it conveys with a certain coy frankness a relationship that many of us are uncomfortable seeing depicted. Asano skirts around Japanese censor restrictions by drawing Isobe's penis as an outline admitting no detail and by indicating penetration through artful use of negative space. Despite his restrictions, one feels the cartoonist's lens has not blushed away from the activities depicted at all. And yet, because these scenes are not in place to titillate22]Though they may very well enflame the prurient interest quite as well as had that been their sole purpose.]], the scenes are not gratuitous. Like Murakami, Asano has installed these episodes to an end—in his case, to investigate an abstract through the means of establishing character proximity.[image]Sato and Isobe begin with plain vanilla sexual exploration. Isobe's clearly done this before, but apart from a blow job she gave to Misaki (only given in hopes that he would ask her to be his girlfriend), Sato begins the story as a virgin. As their encounters increase in frequency, there begins a sort of staleness. At one point Isobe has his head installed under Sato's skirt to stimulate her orally, but Sato just browses photos on a camera, bored by the whole endeavor. Still, while motivated in entirely different ways, they are fueled by a relentless hunger for sexual expression apart from love (though in fairness Isobe begins by hoping their sex will lead to something more). They, in this way reflect an episode from South of the Border, West of the Sun, in which the narrator Hajime describes his relentless sexual relationship with his girlfriend's cousin:[image][from Murakami's South of the border, west of the sun]That passion is essential to the story being told and were this a more moralistic fable, we'd see it devour them. By the end, their sex gets more and more exploratory and almost entirely compulsory, but if there's going to be a destruction of what they have, it's not going to be the sex that does them in. Rather, the sex is merely symptomatic of larger struggles, of grander more encompassing needs. Needs that are at odds with each other's._____Asano's illustrations are better than ever and surpass anything yet seen in his US-adapted works (What a Wonderful World, Solanin, and Nijigahara Holographic). His character work is detailed and lively and he conveys expression wonderfully. I'm not sure the exact technique used to derive his backgrounds (they appear to be some sort of high-contrast scan of reference photos blended with honest illustration),3 but whatever the method, Asano composes some lovely scenes and really only on the final page of the book does a character feel pasted in atop a stage set. [image]I also feel his writing's stronger here than the rest of his revealed oeuvre, but that may be because the last of his works I read was Nijigahara Holographic, which was kind of a shambles. (I barely remember Solanin at all, actually, as it's been about seven or eight years since I last read it.) In any case, the dialogue worked fine and the evolution of events and characters built well toward the book's conclusion.There is—for me—always a fairly strong element of disbelief suspension that necessarily goes along with most stories of sexual flamboyance. Ignoring for a minute the fact that when I was fifteen, I was struggling to tell the girl I liked that I liked her. Nevermind that I wouldn't have ever considered shoving my hand down her pants to finger her. Forget all that. Certainly there are kids whose self-expression along these lines appears far more confident than anything I could have mustered. But what really baffles me is the sheer endurance and prowess of these characters. Teenaged Garcia Madero from Roberto Bolaño's Savage Detectives has what seems like hours of wild, mind-expanding sex with an architect's poet-daughter one night. He climaxes and immediately goes in for seconds. Thirds. Fourths. It's mythical and legendary and epic and I can't begin to imagine. At that age, I likely would have blown my top in minutes and been done in for hours. Similar to poet Garcia Madero, fifteen-year-old Isobe is a juggernaught in the sack. He'll masturbate, then have vigourous sex, then get a blow job. All in the space of a couple lazy hours. Maybe that's entirely possible and even normal and I'm just revealing some previously unknown inadequacy of my own, but when stuff like that happens it seems so far from plausible that I can't figure out how writers keep writing these scenes.Also, I get phantom soreness just thinking about it. 'Cuz, man, that would honestly get pretty raw._____As with an earlier work, Solanin, Asano here bookends his story with some thematic text. After a brief prologue, he presents a black page with seven short sentences that will remain suitably vague until the book's conclusion, where they are repeated in dialogue that will lead directly into coda and resolution, which carries similar function to that bit of South of the Border that I quoted at the beginning of this .[image]While one could be forgiven for thinking A Girl on the Shore is about a very young man and a very young woman having sex, a more legitimate back-of-book description would involve some attempt to express the characters' efforts to find what they're looking for, even while they have no real idea what they're looking for. Love. Solace. A good bone. Meaning. Purpose. Catharsis. Control. Freedom. A reason not to float away into nothingness. A Girl on the Shore is predicated on the idea of finding things unsought. In their evolution from children to adults, Sato and Isobe will see their heavens rolled back as a scroll and epiphanies will rain down on them in the most mundane and everyday sorts of ways. But that happens to us all. The only remaining question then is what these two will do with their own unique revelations._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) Remember that what is the first year of high school in the US is last year of junior high in Japan.2) Though they may very well enflame the prurient interest quite as well as had that been their sole purpose.3) UPDATE: Since posting, German reader Karsten has pointed me to this wonderful episode of Naoki Urusawa's mangaka interview series, featuring Asano and his illustration technique....more",Notes are private!,0,61,1,not set,not set,"Feb 26, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25430821-a-girl-on-the-shore

Like, real heavy.I knew going in that reading a book devoted to a French soldier’s perspective on World War I would immerse me in a certain bit of melancholy, a certain bit of distrust in the worthwhileness of the whole human endeavor. As civilian mass shootings bloom and blossom across my nation, as unarmed men and women die at the hands of my nation’s peace officers, as the world continues to collapse into war after war—it’s always art that brings that sickness home to me. [image]Snow Falling on Cedars makes the plight of Japanese Americans in the days during and after WWII come home to me. Watching Winter on Fire last night made a sour pit in my gut. Grave of the Fireflies, Town of Evening Calm, Palestine, Safe Area: Gorazde, Footnotes in Gaza, Epileptic. These are the things that break my spirit and my heart. News reports of tragedy are one thing, making an art of it another. And so Goddamn This War! breaks me all over again. It’s powerful, raw, cynical, perfect.The third time I accidentally ran into the woman who would become my wife (and the last time before I began to pursue a relationship with her), we saw a movie together—Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s A Very Long Engagement, a dark and humourous detective love story set against and amidst the French trenches of WWI. It was a wonderful film full of light and romance and the dark hideousness of war. Scenes of those depravities have lingered with me for more than a decade now. And it wasn’t until after finishing Goddamn This War! that I discovered that one of its contributers, Jean-Pierre Verney, was an expert consultant employed to keep the fantasy landscape of Jeunet’s film from straying too widely from reality. That the writer from the book I had just found so moving and important also played a role in my introduction to my wife seemed a special kind of serendipity. I’m glad I discovered this after the fact—I feel my ignorance kept me from an honest romanticism.[image]Goddamn This War! is my first experience of Tardi (the book’s principle creator[1]). Fantagraphics has been recently bringing his works to American audiences, but because none of us can be aware of all things, I had never before heard of him. I happened upon the book as I was browsing the graphic novel section at my local library branch. As something near a pacifist and non-interventionist,[2] I don’t tend to enjoy war narratives. I did when I was younger, but not any longer. I don’t, I believe, any longer have the stomach for glory. Still, Fantagraphics’ packaging of the book was so handsome and well done that I thought I’d give it a shot.Bang. A shot. Fired with reckless precision.I don’t rightly know how to describe Tardi and Verney’s book without gushing. Descriptors like tour-de-force are clichéd and dulling. Still, it is what it is I guess. It certainly bowled me over.[image]Goddamn This War! follows a young recruit into the French infantry at the start of the first World War. He against odds survives to the war’s conclusion—which is why he’s able to narrate the whole thing from after the fact. We see other characters as he sees them: occasionally and as fodder. The soldier-narrator is dry and cynical and wise, likely a product of having the privilege of recounting everything from well after the war’s close. And by the end we wonder, if they weren’t already steeped in savagery before the war, how the decades could unfold afterward without the human race floating belly up in a sea of barbarism.[image]Tardi’s writing (or at least Helge Dascher’s translation of it) is crisp and natural. The book strays from the typical revelation of the comics mode in that there are no word balloons, only narration blocks. In a way, it’s as if we’re reading an illuminated work of prose memoir. On first flipping through the book, I was skeptical. I’m generally not a tremendous fan of the technique, but the collaboration of words and pictures here is so fruitful that within pages all my misgivings evaporated and I found myself wholly invested. [image]A large part of the goodwill that eventually subsumed my experience of the book is due Tardi’s magnificent illustrations. The sublime horrors of the war are more than adequately captured in every panel. He moves us from the lovely green hills and bright blue and red uniforms of 1914 through to the blue-grey muck and madness of 1918. His use of colour is exquisite. It’s a grim and human work featuring grim and human art.[image]While the title alone should probably be hint enough, let me underscore: Goddamn This War! is a cynical work, broadly condemning not just the atrocity of warfare but more the politicians and bureaucracy that spend so prodigally the blood of the young, the naive, and the idealistic. Damn this war, yes, but damn also those who would wage it, those who would put our sons and cousins and nephews and fathers in front of bullets and gas and bombs and missiles. For honour, for oil, for glory, for land, for God, and for country. Damn them and damn the reckless negligence that turns human dignity into a soup of viscera and terror. Or maybe, Tardi might argue, there was never any dignity to humanity to begin with._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) As I understand it at least. Initially, I believed Verney to be the writer and Tardi the artist, but the supplemental material makes it sound like Tardi is responsible for the story and art while Verney provides the rich appendix of history/chronology for the book.2) I’m actually neither a pacifist nor a non-interventionist, but I’m certainly sympathetic to their ideologies....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,not set,"Dec 30, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/14475443-goddamn-this-war

Highly debatable statements, ahoy. I will say this: while I was a voracious reader as a kid, quality comics were the best thing I could imagine. By fifth grade I was reading War of the Worlds, Dante’s Inferno, and The Odyssey (none of which were assigned reading), but my true love lay in memories of sitting on the floor in bookstores in second grade reading Tintin in Tibet and Carl Barks’ Uncle Scrooge. I never for one minute imagined that reading comics was some sort of gateway to reading better material. For one, I wasn’t naive. But for another, really I couldn’t imagine something better than the artful blend of text and illustration.[1] Comics are as much perfect for kids as they are for adults. And today, there are so many choices. For every kid, there’s going to be at least one perfect comic out there.And that variety is one of the things I love. You’ve got the buoyant, adventurous danger of Zita the Spacegirl. There’s the epic and comic longform story of Bone. The whimsy of Hildafolk. The heroing of Leave It to Chance. The excitement for exploration and scientific discovery of Primates. The precious, friendly warmth of Owly. The deaths, murders, and horrors of Tezuka’s Twin Knights. The fanciful investigation of Japanese history in Usagi Yojimbo. Again, something worthwhile for everybody.[2]The things children’s comics creators will do with their characters are always especially interesting. Generally, there’s some sense that the builders of these fictional realms are emphasizing particular kinds of things because they either think readers will benefit from the focus or because they think readers will find some sort of resonance with the world and characters that appear. In my own children’s book, I feature an unflappable, joyful, immortal girl who knows no sense of danger and encounters terrible terrors (like volcanoes and tsunamis and tigers) as opportunities for play—because I want kids to feel wonder and the magic of living through someone who is blissfully unaware of the trials of real-world living. Robert Goodin, in The Kurdles, aims for something very different by proposing characters who are sometimes sarcastic, sometimes reactive, sometimes clever, sometimes grumpy, and sometimes chill and helpful. And because kids can probably relate to all of that,[3] it works great. [image][Stone cold]Sally is a bear, a stuffed children’s toy. Abandoned on the roadside on a muddy, rainy night. She’s got a right to a cynical view on life. She fends off predators with a stick and nearly bashes a dog in the head with a stone before discovering he’s friendly. She regrets it but is more defensive than effusive in her apology. She’s almost even self-justifying. I loved that—it struck me as believable, even if not laudable. But who looks to literature for laudability? She then wavers between helpful, sarcastic, afraid, philosophical, and compassionate. I at all times felt a kind of verisimilitude in these characters. Even though Sally’s a teddy bear and Hank is a unicorn with stubble and Phineas is a scarecrow (probably) and Pentapus is… something else. These were characters I could believe in because I’ve met them. [image][The remorse here is palpable]Goodin’s illustrations are pretty and his colour choices are great. I don’t know if he paints digitally or with traditional watercolours, but in either case he gets mood and time of day right. Check out this full-pager of some night doings:[image]There’s this hazy, low-saturation vibe that extends throughout. I’m always a bit envious of artists who can pull that off and make it look good (my own work is all about bright bright colours because that’s where I’m comfortable). Goodin also performs these subtle colour changes (such as with Pentapus) that at first look like mistakes until you realize they’re intentional—and that was a pretty exciting moment for me.[image]The writing’s nice. A bit deadpan. It’s got that dry sense that will be funny to some but doesn’t destroy the flow for those who aren’t in on the joke. The kind of stuff that astute kids will pick up on and enjoy and the kind that will amuse parents whose kids still want them reading aloud. I don’t know whether your kid will love The Kurdles or not. (That gets back to there being the perfect comic for every kid and every kid being their own thing.) But it’s a good book and I recommend checking it out. It’s pegged at ages 6–9, but my 3- and 6-year-olds were amused by it._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) Note: it’s unlikely that I composed my thoughts about comics in quite that sense in fifth grade.2) The idea that there are great comics out there for every kind of reader is part of the raison d’etre for Good Ok Bad. 3) It’s a pretty fair description of my own children, if we throw in sometimes funny and sometimes sweeter than anything you’ve ever encountered....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Dec 30, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25264704-the-kurdles

Rather than as a battle, with the requisite victors and losers, mounting casualties, and abiding sense of aggression, we should look at argument as an evolving cooperative effort. Two sides—two people—with their oppositional stances (in that they stand opposite each other) collaborating in a joined back-and-forth. Together, the participants artfully maneuver and through their conjunction arrive at new places, even if often remaining at distinction from each other. It’s a beautiful picture and I don’t think I’ll ever wish to see argument as combat ever again. So: it is in my infatuation with the dancers’ image that I approached Sousanis’ own argument.Unflattening is a thick work. If you don’t count the pages and pages of end notes and bibliography, the book might seem a bit lean at a slim 152 pages. But the pages are large and they are full—not just packed with words and with images, but with ideas. This is, after all, Sousanis’ dissertation,[1] so some sort of thought project must lurk within. I needed enough time with his discussion that I read it once myself, then had my wife read it to me in the car so I could (blasphemy!) focus on the words without the pictures getting in the way.[2]Honestly, I’m not perfectly sure how to approach Unflattening: as a critic or as a er?[3] On the one hand, the most interesting discussion of Sousanis’ book and its ideas can only be written of from the critic’s view. On the other hand, I suspect that few have yet picked up Unflattening, and so any discussion of its arguments would sit in a vacuum. Dead weight waiting for some moment when a future reader of the book accidentally trips across the critique and, really, how likely is that? So  it is. But how do I  a book that is essentially an extended argument for ways of seeing?Reiterating from above, I honestly don’t know.Unflattening begins with an apocalyptic[4] claim that we are something of a doomed society of people labouring under the illusion of free thought. That is the problem Sousanis seeks to solve. He compares the combined human experience to that of the flatlanders of Edwin Abbott’s Flatland (a book I haven’t read in twenty years but for which I still hold a remnant appreciation), a people who only see and conceive in two dimensions, only able to experience depth through circumstantial evidence and who have no sense of height at all. Of course we in the three-dimensional world are able to perceive these things with ease but would scarcely be able to explain them to a flatlander without sounding either mad or unintelligible—or perhaps just resembling a wild fantasist (maybe a hokey sci-fi author). Sousanis, as Abbot before him, suggests that we are like flatlanders and require unflattening in order to understand the world in ways that would approach The Way Things Really Are.[image]Sousanis’ solution (by my reading) seems to require in many ways a kind of mundane deus ex machina. He doesn’t ask for a divine injection of new ideas, but he does propose that in our ties and bonds to the rest of human society we find a constant injection of new points of sight by which we might escape the ruts of perspective we travel daily. (That’s a deeply simplified version of 152 pages of more nuanced discussion.) And while I don’t think Sousanis’ proposal escapes the dire problem set forth in his introduction, there really is something beautiful and testable in it.Willard Quine, from what I understand, suggested something similar. According to a holiday discussion I had with a friend fifteen years ago, Quine described a person’s core body of knowledge as a web in which everything more or less connects.[5] New information is acquired and woven into the web in ways that fit with preexisting beliefs. Occasionally, new information is obtained that cannot fit with the web. These recalcitrant experiences act as stones thrown through the web, collapsing portions of it entirely. The web of belief and understanding then must be rewoven in a fresh way to account for the recalcitrant experience. (I actually describe in my Footnotes In Gaza  how Joe Sacco’s earlier book, Palestine, was the recalcitrant experience that instigated my own reconception of the Israel/Palestine problem.) This possibly Quinian explanation of the acquisition of new perspective fits well with what I think Sousanis is seeking to do with Unflattening. [image]For the most part, Sousanis makes good use of the form and presents a lot of good ideas bolstered with a lot of good pictures. One or two of his examples ended up falling flat[6] for me, but those’re kind of just drop-in-the-bucket complaints.Earlier though, I did mention that I required a word-only read-through to get a better taste for Sousanis’ argument. That makes it sound like the book is at least in some sense a failure to incorporate the combination of word and picture that usually makes comics such a rewarding and facile experience. And it’s true that I didn’t really become comfortable with my grasp of Unflattening‘s argument until I divorced the book from its visuals.But (!) even while I listened to my wife read Sousanis’ words, the visuals he employed played across my mind’s eye, reuniting with the words they were meant to pair with. The visuals so strongly inform the reading that the text is lesser without them. [image]I blame my own impatience and distractibility for my original struggle. Sousanis fills his pages with so much visual information that the text became disjointed for me on first reading. I would read a text bubble, then focus on the illustration or illustrations that inform the text, then move on to the next piece of text—and in the meantime, I’d found that the specifics of the prior text bubble had begun to blur. If I had focused less on the illustrations, I likely would have better grasped the pace of argument on my first read-through. Different readers are going to have a harder or easier time depending on their own attention spans and methods for engaging the comics form. I am visually dominant and my wife is verbally dominant. She, reading Unflattening aloud to me while we drove from place to place, had little difficulty tracking with Sousanis’ flow. (She also has a better attention span than me, so there’s that.) And again, despite the fact that I required multiple reads to fully appreciate Unflattening, several of the word-picture combinations will reside in me for some time. The dance sequence with which I introduced this piece. A comparison of how we view a coastline vs how an ant would see the same. A page of nautical knots and rigging discussing liberty through bonds. An eye-tracking rendering of the Mona Lisa. These are a handful of moments in Sousanis’ tapestry that touched me and affected me in, I hope, lasting ways.[image][image]Unflattening, as a doctoral dissertation (with its continuous use of citation and its existence not as narrative but as extended argument) is a deeply ambitious project. And probably even an almost entirely successful project. It’s worthy of your time and its greatest value may be in discussion of its ideas with others. I recommend it to you and recommend (as the best reward for the use of your time) that you engage in the critics’s work yourself.[7]_______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) Or maybe a revision of that dissertation. I’m unclear on that—not that it really matters.2) More on this in a bit.3) For those who’ve never encountered the distinction, the er discusses the value of a work with the idea of the consumer in mind. The er encounters a book or a movie or an album and discusses, from their own subjective vantage, whether the thing is any good or not. The goal of this (and why people actually read ers) is twofold: 1) to help readers know whether or not a work is something they’d be likely to happily spend their money or time engaging; and almost more importantly, 2) to help readers understand their own expenditure of money or time. Expanding on the second point briefly, if a person appreciated a work, they want to read s that confirm their own tastes. Likewise, if they hated a thing, they hope to read a er excoriate that thing. There is little more satisfying than to read that someone you respect holds the same opinion as you on a work. And then, outside this main group are the undecided who are looking to have their own tastes clarified through the mediation of a second opinion.So to : ers speak to the consumerist aspect of whether a thing was good or not. The critic, on the other hand, may not be remotely concerned with whether a work was enjoyable or emotionally satisfying. The critic is most concerned with the work presented and how in sits in the stream of all works. The critic investigates the thing’s influences and how it might influence. The critic is concerned with meaning, with how the technicalities of the craft work to express the book/movie/song’s purpose. The critic isn’t interested in telling you whether or not a thing is something you’ll be happy to spend time or money on. Instead the critic wants to help you understand the thing under the presumption that you have already consumed it. The critic is therefore unconcerned with spoilers because they have in mind the idea that there is no reason someone would be able to engage actual criticism without having a working knowledge of the thing being criticized.4) Apocalyptic in both the common sense as well as in the literal sense. Common in that there is end-of-the-world seriousness to Sousanis’ opening conclusion that the entire population essentially “exists as no more than shades, insubstantial and without agency.” Literal in that he means it as an apocalypsis, an unveiling of what is, a pulling back of the curtain.5) The Quine in my imagination here may actually be overestimating the degree to which the average person’s knowledge and beliefs actually form a coherent whole.6) Ar ar ar.7) Or even better, in the company of likeminded readers, perhaps in a classroom or bookclub. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Dec 29, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/23503006-unflattening

He vividly remembered speaking with a friend who was wracked with guilt and confessing sins. Possibly a common experience in so religious a setting as a seminary—a place intended to prepare young men for religious service.  The curiosity was that this repentant man was broken up over and ashamed of sins he had committed in his dreams. The man telling the story was completely blown away by a person who would be so devastated by the actions of his subconscious self (as expressed in dreams) that he would feel the need to confess those actions. The story stuck with the man I heard, and it was wild enough that it stuck with me as well. At the time, the whole idea seemed ludicrous. After all, we couldn’t possibly be held accountable for the murders, careless thefts, and sexual dalliances of our dream lives, could we? Fantasy is, after all, fantasy. Yet now, even those who lack any religious fervor are exploring the intersection of ethics and the imaginary. Are our fantasies harmless or do they encourage certain moral poisons to infect us? Are our fantasies merely products of the us who exists or do they encourage us to act on nascent sparks of interest? [image]One of the principal modern engagements in fantasy worlds, videogames, labours under near constant suspicion. Do violent games breed violent temperaments? Or do they merely exacerbate existent proclivities? Or do they do even that? What about the systemic sexism that expresses itself across videogames’ treatment and portrayal of their stand-ins for the female and the feminine? Does that speak to the broad social assumptions of the civilization? Does it encourage a particular way of viewing women? Does it encourage unhelpful sexual objectification and sexual alienation of the female?The question of whether and to what degree we are responsible for our fantasies is a huge issue of the contemporary ethical landscape. We wonder what participation in fantasy says about the participant—and the power of what it says to the participant. We need to understand fantasy worlds and what they say about the real world, but we seem pretty torn between liberty and responsibility. We dismiss some concerns but highlight others.[image]In one sense, we’re pretty certain that fantasy doesn’t have to have any particular moral quality to it. If I’m playing Super Mario Brothers, I’m engaging in regular, careless-and-perhaps-malicious destruction of turtles by stomping them to death. But I believe deeply in not carelessly harming animals and would never stomp on a turtle in real life. So what kind of weight do we give the fantasy game violence in that case? Negligible moral weight probably.But if I engage in preteen rape fantasies? Is that worrisome? Does that say something about me? We generally agree that it probably does. Obviously better to express in the fantasy than in the reality, but it still speaks (we think) to something broken within the fantasizer. (Pedophiles who do not act on their desires and fantasies are still—probably legitimately—seen as a major concern to the community around them.) And if I express those pre-teen rape fantasies through comics so that others can enjoy and take part in them, is that moral or responsible? Or is that a neutral non-malicious act, or is it rotten and soul-corrupting? By spreading my fantasies and sparking the fantasies of others, am I helping to forge a new framework for people? The hypothetical Me here (the Me that’s published these awful hypothetical comics) has in some sense challenged the notion that preteen girls aren’t to be objects of adult sexual fetishment. And so what are the repercussions of that challenge? Does the idea die with the fantasy or does it, like so many ideas, bear further fruit?[image]This is the world that Dylan Horrocks explores in Sam Zabel and the Magic Pen. He investigates fantasy as healthy release vs responsible fantasy vs focus on the “real” world. Horrocks highlights his purpose in two places early in the book: 1) in his dueling epigraphs, “In dreams begins responsibility” (Yeats) vs “Desire has no morality” (Hartley); 2) when Alice summarizes main character Sam’s subconsciously delivered speech as being concerned with “the pleasures and dangers of fantasy,” the purpose of stories, and whether art is a lie that conveys the truth or merely a lie. This is Horrocks’ fantasy playground, and though he doesn’t actually deliver to us anything like a conclusion, he does pack in enough bookclub’s grist for discussion to keep wheels spinning for a couple hours of heated argument.While only a little more than 200 pages, Sam Zabel is a bit of sprawling adventure-by-way-of-tourism. Sam finds himself sucked into a comic drawn with the titular pen. And then into another and another and another. There’s a bit of plot and danger to move us from here to there near the climax, but largely the book is concerned with Sam and his interaction-with-slash-fear-of fantasy expression. The character is torn all over the place, enjoying and engaging in fantasy flight but then feeling bad and uncomfortable with aspects of it. He’s as confused and contradictory as our own society is—and while he comes to something of a conclusion for himself, it’s more an issue of what’s comfortable to him rather than the larger question of right and wrong. [image]Horrocks seems pretty well aware of his character’s hesitations and often interjects as the omniscient narrator with notes that Sam was supposed to have responded in a particular way but waffled, so the fantasy goes in a different direction. One moment of Sam putting significant effort into untangling the question of responsibility vs fantasy is rendered self-consciously suspect by the fact that it occurs in the midst of one of Sam’s own fantasies (as the fantasy is quick to point out to Sam).[image]It’s a curious book and I would have preferred Horrocks’ ending with less ambiguity (and maybe even coming down straight on the question), but like so much art, Sam Zabel is less Art As Statement than it is Art As Question or Art As Exploration. I largely found myself satisfied with Sam Zabel (though the tremendous amount of nudity[1] made public reading in Starbucks a bit of a dicey affair). There is, however, a chief deficit when interacting with Sam Zabel's primary discussion. It’s a problem similar to that proposed in Duncan the Wonder Dog. In Duncan, Adam Hines offers a fantastic tool for learning to empathize with animals—if a reader will allow themself to be convinced. Duncan's conceit is that all the animals in the world speak and can communicate with humans. Because of this we get a greater sense of their often tragic place in human society. It can be heart-wrenching book. The problem is that because animals don’t actually talk and we don’t really in real life see them able to conceive of their circumstances as sentient beings would, many of the situations feel contrived. So the argument loses its force. The same is true of Sam’s moral rectitude when it comes to the cartoonists’ responsibility for their fantasy creations. He worries that because the magic pen made these comics come to life, the artist has a responsibility to these living things. He means for the argument to carry over, but it’s hard to buy it as there’s not really any actual tie between his argument and our real world. But maybe that’s part of Horrocks’ aim—maybe he intends to undermine his own point.[2] Because if one wishes to say that any fantasy creation has within it the same breath of life as those created by the magic pen, we run into the extremist argument[3] that all fantasy is real. Whether intentional or not, it kind of takes the wind a bit out of the sails and pushes the reader to take the stakes of the book with a little less gravity.[image]The other bit that probably did the least to win me was the dialogue, which sometimes felt like trading monologues devised from well-intentioned Tumblr posts. It’s never awful or even bad. It just never remotely approaches verisimilitude. I won’t ding the book for it though because I’m not even sure that realistic dialogue was ever meant to be on the table. There’s a little something nod-nod, wink-wink about even the “real world” segments of the book—stuff that makes you aware that you’re still reading fantasy—so the dialogue is probably just more of that fantasy bleeding through. It’s a smart book and deserves discussion. I’d highly recommend it to the book club set. I waffled a bit on whether I thought this was Good or Okay. I’m still not sure that I got it quite right. Which may mean that it’s just Okay. But then maybe I’m undervaluing it. Whatever, the stars mean so little anyway. There are probably three kinds of people Sam Zabel is meant for: 1) those who have a community with whom to discuss the Idea books they run across; 2) those already invested in the book’s principle question regarding the nature and place of fantasy; and 3) those with a special interest in nude green women. And man, if all three of those describe you, consider this book a slice of your heaven._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) Really, what can you expect from a book that critiques male cartoonists’ fantasies by exploring visually their cartoon fantasies?2) He does this overtly and with tongue in cheek at several points throughout the book.3) Extremist enough that I’m not sure anyone would actually make the argument....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,not set,"Dec 29, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20775041-sam-zabel-and-the-magic-pen

[image]And at this point there’s not really any sense bothering to ask, Do I like these kinds of books because they are the best books or do I like these kinds of books because I want to be the kind of person who likes these kinds of books? By now, it hardly matters. Whether there was any kind of pretension in my initial interest in thoughtful books, they’ve long since become my preferred playground in the medium. It’s one of these I-yam-what-I-yam sorts of things. Irrevocable, probably.But every now and then, I run counter to the programming and really just want something fun to occupy myself. Something light, something thrilling. Something entirely plot-driven. Something… not pregnant with meaning.For a long time, I tied my long-waned interest in superhero books to the fact that they were ultimately low-value trifles. They were, mostly, just dumb fun books—and who has time for that when there are more solid, worthwhile graphic novels out there than any of us will ever have time to read? But I was wrong. I misplaced the origin of my distaste for superheroes. It didn’t have anything to do with their plot-driven sensationalism. After all, I adore Korean dramas, don’t I? The trick with Marvel’s and DC’s hero books is that they don’t feature characters so much as they forward story-engines.[1] Where characters have arcs and growth and progression, the whole point of Spider-Man or Batman is to tell Spider-Man or Batman stories. They can never be allowed to stray from archetype because they are not characters, but product generators. That’s why I couldn’t stay invested. There was nothing to invest in. There’re only so many times that you can read the biographies of Abraham Lincoln before you—for your own sanity probably—have to move on to other biographies, to other persons. [image]So what I needed then was plot-driven adventures to fill in the role of mindless summer reading, but they had to be plot-driven adventures with a beginning, middle, and end. An arc. A purpose. I had to believe the characters I would become involved with could grow, evolve, age, progenate, or even die perhaps. And not in the superhero-comics meaning of death (i.e., a temporary writing trope meant to push sales). What I was looking for and what has fit my bill lately, is something like Ajin: Demi-Human.[2] Ironically, I guess, the characters in Ajin die and resurrect with much greater frequency than they would in superhero books.Though here, that’s kind of the point.[image]Gamon Sakurai’s created a world in which a rare subsection of the populace is functionally immortal. By volume 6, the series lead has died (often gruesomely) well over a hundred times. These demis have been living largely in secret for decades, camouflaged as normal humans. Rumours of their existence flit through society, but most people are pretty sure it’s all a hoax. A few volumes in, a war erupts between a group of demi-humans and the Japanese government, leaving probably few who doubt the existence of the demis. Demi-humans, in addition to resurrecting over and over and over again, manifest a strange shadowy ghost figure that looks like some sort of clawed, oozing mummy. Each demi’s manifestation is slightly different based on practice and focus. These ghosts, while invisible to non-demis, maintain very real interactions with the physical world and can kill and destroy with little trouble. There are a number of weaknesses and strange properties to the ghosts that are gradually revealed through the series, and Sakurai makes wonderful use of those fragilities.[image]It’s a thrilling ride and I’ve been comparing it to the clever excitement of Death Note[3]. There’s some fantastic cat-and-mouse going on here, and Sakurai keeps things fresh by coming up with new ways to utilize the same basic set of powers. I not infrequently found myself smiling at the ingenious way the creator chose to get his characters into and out of scrapes.The pace isn’t nearly so relentless as Death Note's. In the first five volumes, there are two major action set-pieces. These are pretty tremendous, but much of the series is psychological and relational in nature. So far (in six volumes), I believe this staggering of tensions has really worked in favour of the series, but we’ll see if that continues to be the case. At this point, I’m pretty well along for the ride and the series would really have to drag out (like to 25+ vols) or go south pretty quickly for me to lose interest. For now, I’m just having a lot of fun.[image]_______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) I feel I’ve mentioned this recently. Forgive me if I’m treading the same ground over and again.

I have always felt a care and a closeness and, so far as it matters, an honesty between us. So far as it matters.Certainly there are things about his past that I’m interested in but unwilling to inquire into. He was a mad hippie in the late ‘60s, a drug fiend who spent debauched days living careless amongst the surf communities of Kawaii and Southern California. The era of Janis and Jimi, of Woodstock and Monterey. In the months after a cataclysmic bad trip on Christmas Day in 1970, he reformed, a newly minted member of the Jesus People movement, hippies high on the Holy Ghost rather than on tabs of sunshine. That’s the father I grew up knowing, the ardent believer, the artist dedicated to the cause of Christ. Even today, an old man, he surfs on his vacations back from his missionary work in Eastern Europe. He will die a convert, his former life in the hippie movement dead and ghosted for more than four decades now. And it’s a life I’m curious about—but will never ask after.There are boundaries, and I know enough to respect the privacy of people in regard to their shames, their guilts. There are some things that hurt too much to relive, to admit in the light of day. And I get the feeling that some of my father’s past may settle in those trenches, even as some of mine does and even as some of yours doubtlessly does. Truth and dare is a great children’s game because children have so little to hide. I get hints of what that era was to him, usually the highlights (seeing Cream live, with Ginger Baker wailing an obscenely long solo) or the funny stories (how swimmingly high he and his three comrades were while handling bomb ordinance in the belly of the USS Forrestal during Vietnam[1]). Very occasionally, I would get some sense of the long past troubles that haunted him—his staunch recollection of his involvement in the hippie movement not being characterized by love, peace, and freedom but instead by darkness and turmoil. That always sparked my curiosity. I wanted to know what he meant: in specific terms (whenever I learn of anything, I like to understand it in as much detail as I can easily obtain). But that always seemed a bridge too far, so I tamped down my interest.Still, despite what may be counted in some sense a secret life, I never felt my father was hiding anything from me. We just had some sort of mutual sense of discretion and privacy. Good for everyone involved probably.[image]That makes Matt Rizzo’s story doubly fascinating to me. Not only is it a gripping exploration of a very real intersection between an unfortunate, haunted young man and a famed criminal, but The Hunting Accident is also (and perhaps primarily) about fathers and sons and that turmoil that builds when hidden pasts are not encountered in an environment built on trust.The Hunting Accident in the main spans around four decades, moving us from around 1930 to 1970. Some episodes occur earlier, and the epilogue travels all the way to the present day. Matt Rizzo has a problem with his son. In 1959, Rizzo’s son arrives from California where his mother has just expired. Rizzo is blind and an unsuccessful writer, but he tries to do well by his son. He explains his blindness as the result of a hunting mishap when he was a child. There’s more to it—much more—but Rizzo feels compelled to hide the truth of it from his son as much in order to protect the young boy as to protect his own heart.[image]Eventually, it comes out that Rizzo spent time in prison as a young man, cellmate to Nathan Leopold Jr (of the famous Leopold and Loeb). From there begins a raucous, wonderful exploration of mid-twentieth-century history, prison life in the same era, great literature, and the struggles that sons have with their fathers. The story is dripping with fathers and sons—and while all of those relationships resemble not even remotely my own relationship with my father, there’s still a little something that sounds familiar. The world is recognizable.Writer David Carlson does an admirable job taking what could have been a story told via a wikipedia summary and twists it into something ranging and delicious, a complexity revealed by pieces and parts through visions and allusions. It’s an informational book that educates while it goes. Don’t know what a glim box is? You’ll soon learn. The history of Bentham’s panopticon? Covered. Want to know more about Braille? This is your book. Education is only employed so far as it will make the story come alive, but for that Carlson chooses exactly the right things to highlight. Like a map of the railroad lines circa 1929. Just a bit piece, almost entirely unnecessary. But it informs and magnifies the work.[image]As well, The Hunting Accident is a very literary work. Those of you who’ve read my  of Fun Home may recall that I was skeptical of Bechdel’s use of the literary allusion, that I found it skirted pretension too closely for me to be entirely comfortable with it. It often felt tacked on and sometimes gimmicky. With The Hunting Accident, we feel none of that because the profusion of Homer and Virgil and Dante and Emerson and more obscure authors are intimately connected with Rizzo’s own Infernal descent through the hell of Stateville prison. And not only do we find lengthy quotation from those well-regarded, well-established authors, but Carlson spends significant time in the writing of Rizzo himself, a complicated, dizzying exploration of worlds and purposes, inspired by Dante and Milton and others. This is a thick work. It could have been simple and dull, but Carlson makes The Hunting Accident something grand and beautiful—a story of reinvention on a massive scale, made concretely evident by our excursions into the narrator’s own body of work.Sometimes, when you have a larger-than-life figure, the best way to approach them isn’t through straight biography; sometimes you want to sneak up on them obliquely. My favourite treatment of Hollywood legends is David Niven’s Bring on the Empty Horses. Niven collects a series of personal anecdotes to paint the portrait of a bucketful of Hollywood names. Clark Gable, Errol Flynn, Bogart and Bacall, etc. The story is resolutely Niven’s but through him, we unveil full and real lives for these other giants of the era. It’s delightful and probably far better than a straight biography would have been. And that’s exactly how we see Leopold in The Hunting Accident. He’s not the star. He’s not the focus. But he’s so much a looming presence—and so essential to the development of Rizzo’s story—that the book can’t help but pull back the curtain on who he was a bit. The Hunting Accident is never not the story of Rizzo and his son, but since Leopold plays such a tremendous role in that story, it becomes his story as well.[image][Landis Blair, in the process of ruining his wrist and eyesight for all time]Artist Landis Blair gives a bravura effort, packing 423 large square pages full of detail. Blair is a bit of an unconventional comics artist, placed solidly in the indie stream of the medium. He seems aware of the weaknesses of his art and uses both his tremendous design sense and ultra-patient hatching technique to mitigate what could otherwise damage the story. Instead of being a hindrance to The Hunting Accident, Blair ends up being perhaps its most evident grace, delivering a work of beauty and intelligence. In a lot of ways, The Hunting Accident unveils itself to be something like a working class Habibi—with all of the invention of Craig Thompson’s drawings minus their rarified elegance. His pages are endlessly creative and he does as well illustrating the literal horrors of Stateville Prison as he does the dreams, the visions, and the metaphorical. By his hand it’s made evident that The Hunting Accident could likely exist only in the comics medium (possibly in animated form, though much would likely be lost).Really though, check out these page designs. It’s pretty magnificent work:[image][image][image][image][image][image]In the end, there’s really only one problem with The Hunting Accident. It’s just not available. I happened to see it being Kickstarted and jumped on because I thought it looked interesting (and it ended up being much better that I expected, which is always nice). But apart from those original 500 copies, it’s (hopefully very temporarily) out of print. The authors do not wish to self-publish and, as of their last update on 19 June 2015, are looking for a legit publisher to take it on. It’s a worthy book and one of the best comics I’ve read this year so hopefully someone like Drawn & Quarterly or Fantagraphics or Pantheon or whoever will take it on. I’d love to see this get wider play.[image]_______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) The Forrestal would ignite later in his tour and twenty years later he would recount to me the smell of burning flesh and the fact that cars backfiring would send him wild-eyed with nascent terror.[image]...more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,not set,not set,"Dec 15, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25839838-the-hunting-accident

Vibrant with hope and wonder, completely without guile. They are set in his face like saucers from space. Only identifiable at all because they hover so serenely with no intentions toward darting or flight. He looks into you. And about you. And through you. He is amazing. And you have romanticized every bit of him. Even though his eyes, while lovely, are really just normal lovely child-eyes. You have turned him into a unicorn, a rarity, a celestial gift. Because he’s dying. Or if not dying then at least close to it. Or if not close, then at least he is in some sort of danger. He lives under threat. And I mean, as do we all, right? But maybe he’s more at risk than you or anyone else you know. Probably. Maybe. And your heart breaks.It was 1983 when I first heard about AIDS. I was in fourth grade. It would be another couple years before I realized it was an actual thing and not just a playground game the children played to ostracize their fellows according to the arbitrary rules of the schoolyard—a kind of cooties for the Reagan era. It had something to do with being gay or being a homo, whatever that was. But by the sixth grade I knew everything that anyone knew about AIDS and HIV. I knew it several times over and so did my classmates. We had the privilege of a handful of mandatory school assemblies devoted to the subject. I only actually remember two assemblies through junior high: the drug one and the AIDS one. And we had those two assemblies at least five times each. Probably more actually. I was a sixth-grader who had never seen real drugs in real life and had no idea how one could obtain them, but I knew all about pot and ludes and angel dust and coke and heroin and acid and how, basically, if I took any one of them, I’d probably be swallowing a mug of Drain-O within three months. I also knew about condoms and monkeys and sailors and homosexuals and dentists and needles and toilet seats and oral sex even though it would be a millennia until I would see a real girl in real life for real naked. It was a weird and awkward time. AIDS and drugs were all anyone ever talked about for a while. The Russians too, I guess. And then eventually, the LA gangs and their inevitable spread south. But for a while, it was AIDS and drugs. Then I was in high school and nobody talked about drugs anymore. Mostly because they were all procuring and consuming drugs, probably. (I still had no idea how one could obtain drugs.[1) And then I was in high school and Magic Johnson happened and suddenly no one cared about AIDS anymore either. I’m sure it was still a thing. It had to be. I just hadn’t heard about it in forever. No matter, I knew everything about it. After all, I was in junior high once.[image]The fact is, I don’t believe I’ve ever known anyone with HIV. I’ve known people who’ve died, sure. Old age, cancers, hiking accidents, suicides, ODs, even spontaneous exsanguination. Nobody AIDS though. And Magic Johnson is still alive, so maybe it’s not hard to stay alive with HIV. But he’s rich. And who knows. Maybe that matters. And of course it’s possible that they just haven’t told me they’ve got it. Not for fear of judgment likely, but maybe more just for whatever the reason is that people don’t talk about the very serious things that exert a kind of rule over their lives. Awhile back, I was afraid I was going to lose a nut or two. I didn’t really talk about it. If you’re reading this, it’s likely the first time you’ve heard of it. Even if we’re best friends. And man, as I write this it’s becoming increasingly clear that I really don’t know anything about HIV. And of course this is all a put-on. I was well aware exactly how much or little I know about HIV before sitting down to write. But there’s still a scent of honesty here because it’s the book we’re talking about that alerted me to my deficiency on the subject. Blue Pills, even apart from and above being a fantastic comic, dropped hammers into the ceiling of the greenhouse in which I kept and cultivated the entire treasure of my AIDS and HIV knowledge.I didn’t know that Blue Pills was autobiographical when I began it. And now I’ve ruined you for having the same experience as me. I didn’t realize it until maybe two-thirds through. Then it clicked and the whole thing became amazing. That Frederik Peeters was writing this story and writing this story about himself and those he held dear staggered me.Backing up slightly.[image]Fred meets Cati a few times over the years that comprise their young twenties. He’s a sometimes shy, sometimes exuberant, sometimes moody guy trying to figure out life. She’s young and free and, well, Fred really knows so little about her that he can’t really describe her with any accuracy but to say: “One: What kind of girl is this who allows herself to drink champagne in a swimming pool with a wet t-shirt, while managing to remain classy and in good taste? Two: Good God… what magnificent breasts!” After crossing paths several times, he runs into her at a party and they strike up a comfortable rhythm and remain together for the rest of the book. Despite Cati dropping the other shoe soon after the party.It’s 1999. Cati is divorced with a child. And that’s not the shoe. The clunk or thud or whatever sound that echoes through the rest of Fred’s life (and a thud that Cati certainly heard years earlier) is that both Cati and her son are HIV-positive. And Fred—who knows about what I learned from a bunch of junior high assemblies in 1986—is so entranced, comfortable, and at home with Cati that he says with a kind of passive-aggressive eff-yoo at fate: “So what?” Sure he’s terrified and confused and has no idea the import of what he’s agreeing to,[2] but he knows he wants into this life that is Cati’s. He wants a piece and a part. And so they work at it and they make things work.[image]And all of that, the fact of the set up and the fact that they love each other dearly and the fact that there’s a sick kid in the picture and the fact that fifteen years later they’re all still alive and that Frederik and Cati have an HIV-free child[3] isn’t really the point of the book. The plot elements merely build the foundation for the point of the book: the evolution of Fred’s thoughts on the whole situation.[image]What does it mean that every time you stick your penis into the person you love more than anything—an act you mean for pleasure and to give pleasure—you might be pulling the trigger on your own demise? What does it mean for the woman you’re with that every time you have sex, she might have accidentally killed you? What about this sweet little boy? How will he get through those awkward teen years? It’s hard enough to talk to girls you’re into when the culmination of your youthful horniness won’t kill them. And what if that kid doesn’t even survive to be a teenager? Nothing, after all, is certain. And the anger. At science, at fate, at friends, at society. At death. What do you do about the anger?[image]This is what Blue Pills is about. The stuff that often matters so much more than the summary of events that make up our lives (and deaths). And Peeters does a good job keeping this from feeling pedantic—even when by the end he’s strayed almost entirely into rumination. He keeps the book feeling real, feeling close, feeling intimate. And that’s why when we look into the kid’s bright wide eyes, we can’t help but romanticize. Because there’s magic there. A magic that Peeters, through art and through script, unveils. And Peeters could have done that thing that everybody does when telling a story about something tragic like HIV: he could have made it tragic. He could have pulled at hearts and strings. He could have cultivated pity and mournfulness in the reader, but that’s the last thing he wants. Blue Pills is not a sad story. And there’s magic in that too._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) I was so cool.2) Not really he doesn’t because, like, who could?3) These last two things aren’t revealed within the book (as it was published in 2001) but through simple Googling. Still, this is one of those things I didn’t know about HIV that is unveiled through the course of the story: HIV can be manageable enough that a man can safely reproduce with a woman who is positive. Safely for both himself and for their child. That’s like a lightning bolt revelation to me—and one that I might have been aware of had I actually known anyone with HIV.]...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,not set,"Dec 14, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1390442.Blue_Pills

That’s as broad and general as saying that a little over thirty years ago, I began a love affair with women. It’s just general and non-committal enough to be nearly entirely meaningless. Really, it probably began the moment I picked up my first issue of Power Pack as a fourth-grader and realized that comics stories could present evolving storylines. Maybe it began earlier, when I read The Chronicles of Narnia as a second-grader and realized that stories could be long, could skip around chronologically, and didn’t even have to follow a single character throughout. Maybe my love affair with manga began the moment I first tied a string of letters together to form a word—just like my love affair with women began that moment in kindergarten when I saw one of the second grade girls in a choir performance and her hair was just, just perfect and my heart caught. Neither were what they would be: the girl was not a woman and the word was not manga. But the seeds were there. The origin has a story.I began a broaching familiarity with manga early on. I read Area 88 occasionally in the early early ‘90s. I read Akira as Marvel released them across the late ‘80s and early ‘90s. I picked up a handful of Robotech comics, which I now realize probably don’t actually count at all. But it wasn’t until the early-to-mid 2000s that I began actively purchasing manga along with all my other comics and graphic novels. My tastes had yet to refine[1]  1]In ten years I’m sure to read this and scoff at the idea that I would consider my tastes to have refined by age 40.]], and I was simply picking up series just to, you know, just to see.Love Hina. Naruto. Death Note. Plenty of single volumes from those piles of abortive manga detritus that Tokyo Pop was shooting out like a t-shirt cannon with unlimited ammunition. (Gothic Sports!)Among all the things I love most about manga[2]2]Now may be as grand as any place to remark that I don’t typically refer to manga as manga. I just call them comics. I don’t typically say graphic novels either. I don’t find the differentiation usually very helpful. I will, however, occasionally condescend simply because others will find the shorthand useful. While I don’t want to underscore in any sense that Japanese comics are fundamentally different from American, Canadian, Hungarian, Korean, or French comics, there is some small social sense in which “our” perception of Japanese comics differs. So to that end, I’ll begrudgingly speak of manga. Otherwise, it’s merely a marketing category and I don’t actually think those do anybody any good.]] is that these books often allow for (and sometimes actively pursue) deeply evolving story worlds. Status quo may be decimated at any time. [image]Marvel and DC superhero books don’t actually feature Character in any honest sense of the term. Instead, they feature storytelling engines. Or maybe better, storytelling prompts. A reader of Spider-Man in 1970 can more or less jump into Spider-Man in 2010 and pretty much know exactly what’s going on. Only the trivialities (like who is punching Spider-Man now) have changed. Same with Superman, Batman, Captain America. (Maybe not the X-Men? But then again…) Now take something like 20th Century Boys. If you read through volume 4 and then skipped to volume 8, you would both have no idea what was going on and have no way of figuring it out. The world shifted. Same with Akira. Otomo reinvents his entire storyline at least four times throughout the book. Chapter 6 looks entirely different from chapter 14 which looks entirely different from chapter 19. It’s exciting, and the books often aren’t afraid to change everything along the path to their finale. While Spider-Man is merely a series of tacitly connected short stories set in the same world and using the same set of characters[3]3]It often feels like these stories are the product of a creative writing prompt that generates a pile of stories and then those stories are just published one after another. Then the writers in the study group get another writing prompt that is almost identical to the first and are asked to do that same thing again. It occasionally generates some good stories, but there’s not really any reason to keep following the series. You can really just wait until you hear about a particularly good story or anthology and pick up that one.]], you can sink your teeth into the stories featured in many of these manga. And if you’re going to read them, you’ve got to keep up. Biomega and Knights of Sidonia writhe and shift and go all over the place. Same with Monster and 20th Century Boys. And Negima and Children of the Sea and Flowers of Evil and even Death Note.Which brings us to Balak, Sanlaville, and Vivès’ Last Man series.[image]With volume 1, Last Man revealed itself to be a superbly designed and deftly paced Fight comic, betraying a certain connection to one of the modes by which shounen manga likes to assert itself. In a way, that first volume felt like it could be a wonderful extrapolation of Negima's Mahora Martial Arts Tournament. It was beautifully scripted and fluidly rendered. Still, not being a particular fan of fight comics, I wondered how the creators could develop the story of a tournament over a full twelve volumes (the length of the series). Volume 2 answers that in the best way, following in one of my favourite manga traditions by decimating what I had imagined was status quo. By the end of the volume, we realize that the last two volumes are mere prologue for what should prove to be a much larger, more satisfying story. And I am blisteringly excited to watch it unfold.Given the opportunity to ask a few questions of the creators, I broach the question of manga:[image]Question: I’ve read in other interviews that the storytelling for Last Man is at least somewhat influenced by manga. What aspects of manga in particular are you drawn to and which have you woven into Last Man? (Will we see a manga-style time-skip!)[image]Answer: HA! Busted with the time skip. Well, what we like about manga is how they handle the storytelling. It’s very cinematic. You have the time to create a universe and at the same time, you are very close to the characters’ emotions. The pacing of the story, how the panel are laid out, that’s a huge inspiration to us. And, of course, the boobs. Japanese artists draw the best boobs._______With volume 1 of the series, we note a heavy emphasis on Hope as a thematic direction. By volume 2 we’re seeing the fruit of that and then an evolving exploration of Loyalty. Aldana has at least a temporary loyalty to his young partner Adrian and an abiding loyalty to his own sex drive. Elorna’s ties to Gregorio are tested. The queen gives up rooting for the Hometeam to cheer for the Visitors. A pair of lovers are one of the combat teams and have their dedication to each other measured. Marianne has her own interests that bind her to certain paths of action. And Adrian is, of course, guileless and forthright in his passions. These loyalties propel the action in volume 2 and will hold consequences for the remainder of the series.One of the things I hoped to convey in my  of the first volume but pretty much entirely didn’t touch on at all is just how entirely exciting this book is. There is so much going on. One page leads into the next with so much pregnant purpose that it virtually becomes a magnificent feat to put the book down before arriving at its final page. When I finished volume 1, I thought Wow, omigosh. I cannot wait to read volume 2. At the end of volume 2, I thought Wow, omigosh. I cannot wait to read volume 3. And it’s not just because these end on cliffhangers. Because they don’t. Not really. It’s just that you don’t want the story to end. You want to devour it all. You want to inhabit their world and see how everything shakes out. Is Adrian going to have to fight Elorna? Will Aldana punch out a woman? What if Adrian has to fight the likes of Cristo Canyon? Will the honey badger have a speaking role? Why is Adrian’s mom on a motorcycle on the cover to volume 3??[image]Obviously, there may be some readers who won’t be excited by the book. Hypothetically they must exist. Even if only in our imaginations. But in the small segment of my friends to whom I’ve leant the book, nobody does not devour it. My wife, who is even less invested in fight comics than me, loves it. My co-worker, who probably has an unhealthy interest in comics featuring terrible fights (he adores Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure and pushes it on me regularly), loves it. I love it. You probably will as well. Last Man is the ongoing series that most excites me at the moment.[image]Question: Do you see Last Man as wholly an adventure? Or as an exploration of ideas in addition to being a kick-ass compulsively readable adventure? Or something else?[image]Answer: The initial idea was to create a huge adventure. Wait. No. Basically, the initial idea was to make our personal Star Wars. Wait, actually, no. To be honest, we wanted to make a porn comic book. Then we chose to go for a big non-porn adventure (we don’t really remember how and why that transition was made). But in the end, we saw this as an opportunity to create THE comic book we always wanted to make. The kind of book that we loved as teenagers. So there are a lot of nods to what we liked, from Die Hard to Fist of the North Star._______Even a cursory read offers ample evidence that Last Man would have actually made a hot hentei comic had the creators wished to move in that direction. Vivès and Sanlaville draw ridiculously good-looking people who exhibit a sensuous kind of physicality. For all its PG-rated coyness,[4] Last Man is a pretty sexy book. Aldana is all muscles and masculinity and has a bathing scene that pretty obviously smokes. I don’t know whether it’s intended to appeal to the female gaze or the gay male gaze (though the two seem to increasingly blend and blur), but I doubt there are many from either side of the coin who will be sad. [image]All that aside though, I’m glad they decided against making a porn comic because then I wouldn’t be talking about the book here. And this is such a lovely, exciting book that I need to talk about it. The artists portray so much elegance of motion that even heavy, stomping, oxen men move with a kind of liquid energy. Certainly more like a crashing wave than something more gentle, but still. More lithe figures like Adrian exhibit the same sense of weightlessness as the dancers in Vivès earlier work, Polina. The backgrounds, too, are skillfully devised with all manner of unexpected detail. A dragon here, a crowd reaction there. Altogether lovely.[image]Question: Last Man seems a seamless effort of a single artist, but to know all three of you worked together in some sense blows my mind. How similar are your art styles naturally? Have you had to abandon common traits of your art to achieve such a unified aesthetic?[image]Answer: Bastien and Michael have a similar style, even if they actually don’t have the same drawing technique at all. They went to the same animation school (Gobelins) and have already made a comic book together in France (Hollywood Jan, about a kid who’s got Stallone, Schwarzenegger and Russell Crowe as imaginary friends). Balak draws the storyboard, so you don’t see his art on the page. It’s quite different from Bastien’s and Mic’s, (it looks more like your average Evangelion hentai fanart, TBH.)_______And without segue…[image]Question: From what I’ve read, the story of Last Man is is going to play out across twelve comics volumes, a videogame, and an animated film. How necessary will these non-comics additions be to enjoying the story and do you believe we will have them available in the US?[image]Answer: It will be an animated TV show, twenty-six episodes of twelve minutes, actually. Each media can be enjoyed for its own sake, but you will get a whole picture if you see/read everything. The animated series will shed light on some very big mysteries of the comic book. Hopefully, it will be available in the US, we would like it to be that way. The video game (LASTFIGHT) should be available everywhere by the end of the year._______One of the things I loved about Negima was the unveiling of a large and full cast of characters. That book had plenty of volumes to move about and explore the numerous personalities that comprise the core of its narrative thrust. By the time of the Mahora Martial Arts Tournament (a big magical combat tourney occurring about 1/3 through the series), we’ve had ten volumes by which to grow attached to all the competitors—essential for creating reader interest in the battles.[image]Balak, Sanlaville, and Vivès accomplish this in a volume or two. Readers are easily invested in Adrian’s and Aldana’s stories—and in Elorna’s as well. We know enough about Gregorio to know exactly how we want to see his fights end. Alyssa’s fight is a surprise and plays well off a moment from volume 1. And of course there’s the mystery behind the champions, Cudna and Cristo Canyon. All of this works so flawlessly because these are characters we know; we’ve been insinuated into intimate moments of their lives and persons through subtle expressions and body language. It’s all so very well done.[image]Question: Do you have a favourite character from the series or one who particularly resonates with you? Is it a character we’ve seen or one to be revealed after volume 2? (Elorna is a favourite of mine so far and I hope we’ll see more from her somehow.)[image]Answer: Ha, so you will be happy to know that Elorna will be a very important character in later volumes!Mic’s favorite character is Cristo Canyon, because he looks very calm and yet he’s very powerful. He’s a very complex and important character too. Bastien’s favorite is definitely Adrian Velba. The mother/son relationship means a lot to him. And Balak’s favorite is Richard Aldana, because he’s a “perdant magnifique” (“beautiful loser”), as we say in French._______It’s hard for me not to gush over Last Man. For whatever reason, I am tempted to pretend that I’m above passionately boosting for a series. All the same though, I’ve long argued for the essential subjectivity of the critic’s role—and even more than a critic, I count myself an evangelist for good comics. And Last Man is good comics. Actually, it’s very good comics. So maybe now I’ll have another book to recommend constantly and incessantly and breathlessly forever—right alongside Cross Game, the book I’m currently most known for hyping rabidly._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) In ten years I’m sure to read this and scoff at the idea that I would consider my tastes to have refined by age 40.2) Now may be as grand as any place to remark that I don’t typically refer to manga as manga. I just call them comics. I don’t typically say graphic novels either. I don’t find the differentiation usually very helpful. I will, however, occasionally condescend simply because others will find the shorthand useful. While I don’t want to underscore in any sense that Japanese comics are fundamentally different from American, Canadian, Hungarian, Korean, or French comics, there is some small social sense in which “our” perception of Japanese comics differs. So to that end, I’ll begrudgingly speak of manga. Otherwise, it’s merely a marketing category and I don’t actually think those do anybody any good.3) It often feels like these stories are the product of a creative writing prompt that generates a pile of stories and then those stories are just published one after another. Then the writers in the study group get another writing prompt that is almost identical to the first and are asked to do that same thing again. It occasionally generates some good stories, but there’s not really any reason to keep following the series. You can really just wait until you hear about a particularly good story or anthology and pick up that one.4) Or maybe PG-13, I guess?...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Dec 11, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/22718715-last-man

Magister Magi Negi. As the series (to my gratefulness) began to evolve away from its rather ecchi beginnings, it settled into a good fistful of volumes focused on the drama and ingenuity of the Mahora Martial Arts Tournament, a magic-infused kind of Bloodsport. To rights, I should have abandoned the series at this point—as it moved from one thing I disliked and onto another.My interest in personal combat was (and still is) small enough to be unmeasurable. My interest in athletic competition stories was (and is) similarly stunted. I’m not even particularly interested in violence for the sake of the excitement of violence (idealistically, I’m a bit of a pacifist, even if not entirely in practice). That I should be on seat’s edge waiting for the next volume of what amounted to over-powered magic fighters fighting against magically over-powered fighters was baffling. The narrative tricks were obvious and I rather find the concept of combat for entertainment repulsive. Still, and strangely enough, I was all in. [image][*sigh* Magic users, it’s like they’re legitimizing cheating.]I picked up volume 1 of Last Man on the strength of Vivès’ name. I’ve already ed Taste of Chlorine and Polina and if you’re at all familiar, it’s clear that I’m in love with Vivès as an illustrator. I didn’t even know what the book was. It had a Vivès credit on the cover—I was invested. Then, maybe a week before I sat down to read Last Man, I was glancing through Zainab Akhtar’s 20 most anticipated comics for 2015 and saw an entry describing it as an homage to shounen manga. The back of the book mentions prominently a gladiatorial competition. The two combined and I thought: Oh no.Fortunately, my next thought was: But, c’mon. Bastien Vivès. So obviously, I dove right in.[image][Adrian, you’re to young to understand, but I want to make your mom a mom. If you get my meaning. Nudge nudge wink wink?]This first volume of Last Man (“The Stranger”) captures everything I loved about the fantasy combat tournament of Negima while excising all the excesses that kept me wondering what I was doing wasting my time on the series in 2007. The team of Balak, Sanlaville, and Vivès craft a fantastic homage to the Japanese subgenre—one that fires on all cylinders and is reverential to the genre it cribs from while establishing itself as something unique on the playing field. It’s a thrilling introduction to what looks to be one of the best series currently being published. With only a single volume it’s obviously still a bit early, but the confidence, talent, and storytelling on display are somewhat awestriking. I am, flatly, in love with what’s going on here.[image][Adrian is so freakin’ guileless in that top row. I want to hug him.]The book’s illustrations (forged in a mysterious concert between the three creators, with I believe Balak mainly responsible for storyboards and Sanlaville and Vivès combining somehow for the final illustrations) are consistent with Vivès’ usual penchant for fluidity, which is fantastic for a fight comic. But even better than that—and if you can imagine for a minute the essentiality of fluid combat choreography for this kind of story and then consider that this is better than that—the illustrators hold utter mastery of the characters’ expressions. Their faces are simple but convey a wealth of intents and meanings. Child protagonist Adrian shifts from guileless to guarded to curious to excited to determined to overjoyed, and the purpose behind his countenance is never in doubt. Richard Aldana also modulates between a host of feelings and moods and interests. There is, at all times, the overt story being told through dialogue and action, but simultaneously there is another story told across the faces of this book’s participants, a narrative born in looks and in eyes and in mouths and in shoulders and in the space of physical proximity, one character from another. This is a rich tapestry and this trio of creators demonstrates mastery of all the elements of their stage.[image][Honey badgers, right?]The best part of the fights in Negima was that they were informed and given context and import because of the relationships between and amongst the combatants and spectators. The same holds true here, only many of these relationships are created in the quiet spaces that linger between dialogue balloons. When Elorna (one of Adrian’s fellow students at his fighting school) does well in one of her matches, we sense the value of the win through Aldana’s observation of her during the fight, from Adrian’s reaction from the stands, and later by her partner Gregorio’s response to her performance. Much of the book is a beautiful collection of subtleties that twine together to weave a narrative with more clarity than the most exposition-laden books that glut the market every week. [image][This is the face of frustration.]One of the odd charms of Last Man is that the rules for judging fights are never actually explained and so the reader is left with the same hazy sense of things as foreign fighter Aldana. We don’t yet understand what is foul and what is fair. It’s a mysterious world and its authors are not in any hurry yet to remove either its lures or its veils.[image][I don’t understand either, Richard. Let’s just punch some people.]Last Man is a series that I can’t imagine anyone actively not liking (kind of like Cross Game). It’s filled with charm and romance and mystery. I don’t know where it’s going to evolve over its twelve projected volumes, but this first volume at least is themed and grounded on the problem of Hope. It’s filled with characters whose dilemmas and desires are on the cusp of fulfillment. Nothing comes of those dreams by volume’s end, but why would we expect them to? Instead we get complications and hints of complications. It’s a vibrant beginning to what I hope will continue to be a vibrant series._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,not set,"Dec 11, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/21469096-last-man

They are good books and movies—and often times are even great books and movies. I recommend them because they are good or great. I am able to recognize their nearness to whatever we might be tempted to describe as objective quality. They are well-composed and well-accomplished. Their artistry is evident and clear. And more than that, they speak to some integral aspect of the human condition. They, through craft and talent and effort and grace, say something to the alert reader—and often, something valuable to the proposal of How should we then live?I recommend these books and movies often and without hesitation. Because it is right to do so. And yet these books and movies I’m talking about: I hate them. Because ignorance is blissful. Because I have a heart. Because I am empathetic. Because I am tuned in to our existence and its fragilities. Because I am not immune to horror or terror. Because the metaphorical nights are long and they threaten always the metaphorical days. Because I too, like many of you, can be undone by simple stories told well.[image]One of the great glories of the comics medium (and one that is continually being probed and explored) is its ability to propose a visual-narrative reflection of psychological phenomena. Dreams, visions, thoughts, emotives. This has been especially useful in comics’ navigation of mental disorders.[1] Comics offer all the toolbox of a relentless CGI but married to a character-driven Dogme 95 production. Comics can do anything and that paves the way to a complex psychological narrative—one that unveils effortlessly to the reader.Meaning that: authors can vividly convey states of being and mind that would be otherwise difficult or costly in other media. And Paco Roca uses this gift of the medium to wring out the experiential nature of the elderly in a home for those gradually giving in to the disenfranchisement of the mind—suffering through troubles as benign as simple senility or as aggressive as Alzheimer’s. He does a fantastic job conveying lives surrendered to permanent convalescence. He does such a good job, in fact, that I hate Wrinkles. I hate it because it is so good and you should definitely read it.[image]When I was younger, say twenty-one or so, my brother read me an account of an unpopular man in the 1600s who had been driven from a town while being pelted with stones. As a result of the injuries to the man’s head, his personality, character, and beliefs changed. He was unmade and remade because of a bad afternoon. Years later, he reverted again to his former self, but for me the damage was well accomplished. Before I had kids,[2] my only real fear in life was losing who I was to some catastrophe like brain injury—or to one of the many handfuls of maladies that assault those of old age. Cognition, the particular way that I perceive the world, who I am: those are the essentialities to my existence. After all, if I am not me then who on earth am I?[image]In Wrinkles, Paco Roca underlines, circles, highlights, and writes in the margins of my fear. His protagonist, Ernest, is an older gentleman (a former bank branch manager) who suffers from Alzheimer’s (though he rarely seems cognizant of his own suffering). The text begins with his admission to an assisted care facility equipped to interact with tenants of varying degrees of dementia. Ernest’s case, when compared with some of the other guests, seems almost benign. Ernest will live out the remainder of his days here, a life mediated through the fog of medications.[image]Roca uses the toolset of comics to seamlessly transport guests of the home into the world as they are experiencing it. In one moment a man is seventy-two and standing alone in a foyer, and in the next he is six and is stood up awkwardly before a room of his new classmates. A woman is pictured, seated by the window in her wheel chair, old and haggard; in the prior panel she is a young woman of beauty and elegance, riding the window seat of the Orient Express. Another resident sees members of the Legion everywhere. Another is transported again and again to the moment when he secured the heart of the love of his life.[image][This is excerpted from one of the the happiest, most sublime, most tragic moments in the book. It made my heart soar and drown simultaneously.]The drama of daily living with a fading mind is told with humour and verve and a lightness of being. And I found myself growing more and more anxious. These amusing anecdotes and funny bits and pieces of lives gone askew were toying with my deepest and tremblingest insecurities. On the surface I was enjoying Roca’s book and the story of Ernest’s progressive psychological collapse. It’s bright and colourful and lovely and well-illustrated and well-paced.[3] But in the midst of my enjoyment, the terror of existence roiled and rumbled. By the end, I was panicked and undone. Roca had done so good a job of exploring the gradual dissolution of selves that I was entirely exposed, my oldest fear made raw and calamitous—all within one hundred pages in which nothing incredibly terrible happens save for that a handful of people gradually forget themselves. And that’s the magic of story._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) EXAMPLES:Glyn Dillon’s Nao of Brown:[image]David B’s Epileptic:[image]Joe Kelly’s I Kill Giants:[image]2) Now that I have children whom I cherish, there are any number of terrors that stalk the corners of my waking existence.

You eat a refreshing morning meal, calculated to your tastes and nutritional needs. You’re ready for a day of doing things both that you love and that will contribute to the society. You are healthy, rested, secure, and fulfilled. Life is good and you feel good about it. And it’s all due to this wonder-filled civilization you’ve inherited, perfect in every way. You think. I mean, maybe there’s this little nagging something at the back of your mind, but maybe there’s not. It’s not like you could tell—not with how amazing everything is._____I haven’t read a lot of science fiction criticism—or really and honestly, any science fiction criticism—but I have to imagine the idea that utopia and dystopia are some kind of synonym is pretty commonplace. It’s pretty facile on the face of it, the concept that any man-made paradise is going to suffer from ultimate problems that render it a false Eden. Whether a utopian society is such because of its citizens’ willful ignorance of the flaws in the system (a la the Eloi in Wells’ Time Machine) or because of its citizen’s blithe willingness to exploit another group (a la Fritz Lang’s Metropolis) or because of its fascist management of thought and speech (a la Vonnegut’s “Harrison Bergeron”)—whichever the case, because of the natural pluralism of the human community, our only access to utopia could ever be through a negligent imagination, a kind of naive carelessness.[image]Some of the less inventive works pick at the easy fruit of dystopia, presenting broken societies from the outset, worlds in which the inequities are both made obvious and then capitalized on from their earliest chapters. Hunger Games' inequitous Districts make for a recent popular example. Blade Runner, too, presents an amazing futureworld, but even from the opening credits we know that the high-science future is dirty and grim and awful. More intriguing by a margin are those books and films that explore a perfect world only to eventually find cracks that turn to crevices. These are necessarily going to be rare because a beautiful world without conflict makes for a boring story. And then there’re the few books that present full-fledged utopias. I haven’t read in the niche extensively, but they’re difficult books to pull off—1) because story conflict has a hard time existing in a true utopia, and 2) because most readers will scoff at the author’s naïveté.Two interesting examples of straight utopian literature, both from Kurt Vonnegut, include Galapagos and “Unready to Wear.” Galapagos entertains the high-concept of being narrated from billions of years in the future by a ghost from the 20th century who flits above a world in which our humanity has long been extincted and replaced by a kind of peaceful human/seal hybrid. The implication, of course, is that in order for humanity to arrive at anything resembling a utopia, it’d first have to quit its humanity. “Unready to Wear,” an earlier work, prototypically explores the idea by positing an evolved humanity who have solved all of their problems by shaking off the sweaty, itchy, irritating bother of the human flesh. Again, humanity must become other than itself in order to have a hope of paradise.[1][image]For her part, Eleanor Davis spends almost the entirety of How to Be Happy offering a delicious exploration of the tie between utopia and dystopia, between paradise and infernal paradise. It’s a fine balancing act, funambulating between hope and despair, but she travels back and forth the distance with sure feet. On only two occasions amongst the collection of shorts does Davis overtly invoke the concepts of utopia and dystopia (once even going so far as to use the word dystopia itself), but for the most part she keeps the theme as mere atmospheric hum. One could be forgiven for not using the idea of earthly paradise as a governing filter for the work if it weren’t for the book’s title, How to Be Happy.Utopia, the word, is derived from two pieces. The first, eu-, means “good” and sees itself in common English use in euthanasia and euphemism[2]. The second, topos, means place and we see this term crop up in the cartographic practice of mapping topography. Utopia, then, is a good place, a kingdom of peace and security. Of happiness. A society coming to a place of peace via learning how to be happy is an essential piece of utopian presence. Without a general sense of happiness (no matter how broadly we define happiness) amongst the beneficiaries of a society, we have no utopia.[image]But while Davis occasionally speaks to the books’ ruling concept in terms of societal shifts (especially in the second short, “Nita Goes Home,” and on a smaller paleosocietal sense in the first story, “In Our Eden”), she mainly concerns herself with examining the attempts to escape dystopia in the detritus of much smaller-scale kingdoms. A boy seeks to perfect the world of his experience by maintaining ultimate control over a younger boy’s interactions with him by a mix of psychological and physical aggressions (“Thomas the Leader”). A musician exercises a pacific effect over the animals of the wilderness through the sound of his guitar and seeks to bring an animal woman into his domain through the same tools, even against her nature (“Sticks and Strings”). A woman submits herself to the tutoring (governance) of a personal growth guru in order to find peace and joy in the world through tears (“No tears, No Sorrow”). In another, a young man becomes friends and more with a young woman because of his ardent interest in the woman’s father, only to be discovered by the reader (in a perfect fourth-wall moment) capitulating to the woman’s sexual advances in opposition to What He Really Wants (“Summer Snakes”). There are other stories, but the final narrative note seems to underscore the thesis (and echo in a way Vonnegut’s solutions), suggesting that the human mind in its present state is the chief obstacle to utopia and we are better off freeing ourselves from its dystopic tyranny. She leaves the means to that end unstated and amorphous—whether by suicide or pharmaceutical intervention or altered mindstates or metaterrestial intervention—and the collection is probably more palatable for the ambiguity, because while we’re happy to be given an inkling of her answer, the American way is to bristle at any lifestyle solution that is offered as anything close to an actual suggestion.[image]I was originally mildly disappointed in Davis’ choice for the one-page final story, preferring the one-page story that immediately precedes it, a powerful and wonderfully conceived exhibition of perspectival shift that offers nearly the same conclusion, only slightly less overtly stated. After several readings, I’m satisfied that Davis’ choice actually is the better ending in that it more succinctly ties together the disparate threads of her otherwise conclusion-eliding narrative pieces. [image]How to Be Happy appears as a dialogue or argument between a handful of ideologies unaware of each other’s presence. They don’t interact directly and orate as if theirs was the only voice in the room. Davis emphasizes this sense by illustrating many of these episodes using entirely different techniques and employing entirely different styles. One story appears as a colourful screenprint with absolutely no linework. The next could have been drawn with a Uni-Ball and features an oversaturation of watercolours. One has very detailed illustrations with strong negative space and sepia tones, another is washed and gentle with mysterious and lovely creatures, another is straight black-and-white with drawings that call to mind the childhood adventures of Nate Powell’s Any Empire. And there’s more. Davis is clearly talented and diverse. If one wasn’t aware, it would be easy to mistake Davis for the collection’s editor and the individual stories as the anthologic production of a number of artists.[3]This is my first encounter with Eleanor Davis and her work. I appreciated my time in her worlds. She offers plenty of food for the hungry of thought—even if thought may ultimately be the root of our troubles. Davis invites readers into realms of nostalgia and of mystery and of existential terror. The portholes through which we can view these kingdoms of hope and pain are small and smudged, but we see enough. Enough to apprehend them, enough perhaps even to judge them. And certainly enough to enjoy the experience of their lessons.  [image]]_______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) Interestingly, the Christian story fits well enough with Vonnegut’s cynicism toward the human endeavor and also demands humanity to evolve into something we wouldn’t quite recognize as human—only a brave new species of humankind could ever traipse around a heaven or a new earthly paradise or what have you and not start a war within a year or a month.2) Eu (good) + thanatos (death) = euthanasia, and is concerned with people dying a good or peaceful death with dignity.Eu (good) + pheme (speak) = euphemism, the broaching of brute ideas via evocative but less volatile words, e.g. time of the month for menstruating.3) I picked up How to Be Happy on the same day as I did Emily Carroll’s Through the Woods. Both are short story collections, but the difference is striking by the proximity. Carroll’s collection evidences a kind of evolution of style, but it is always obviously obviously Emily Carroll. There is no mistaking her work. Davis, on the other hand, plays all over the map....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Dec 11, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18444218-how-to-be-happy

Discretion is left to the reader.][image]The Ancient Near East was a land filled with gods and cosmologies at war with all others. The inhabitants of every nook and cranny had their own deities and their own religious customs and their own emphases. And as with the religions of today, the zealous devotees of one god were not particularly interested in tolerating the gods of their neighbours. It made sense for a culture to have a god different from that of a neighbouring culture—after all, if you wished to war with and then absorb a neighbour, it didn’t make much sense to pray to a god you both worshipped and/or served. Gods of seas, gods of rivers, gods of land, gods of fire, gods of sky, gods of clouds, gods of rain, gods of sex and of war and of death and of life and of alacrity. Take your pick. Different gods for different needs. And all the different practices that go along with those needs.Still, almost across the board in the Ancient Near East, there was a great commonality. These gods received some form of visible rendition. Idols proliferated. Carved images, painted figurines, metaphorical representations. It’s probable that no Philistine actually thought Dagon looked like a hybrid between a fish and a dude, but people need something to hold on to, a little prop to turn mere metaphor into something vaguely solid and believable. But not the people of Israel. Their god, Yahweh, disallowed physical representation of deity (we even see this carried forth into the Islamic antipathy toward the visual expression of Moses, Jesus, Mohammed—and really, any of their prophets). The thing was: Yahweh was considered too vast and magnificent to be represented by something as inarticulate as an image. When the Israelites were cursed at the foot of Sinai for building a golden calf, it wasn’t for following another god; instead, they had minimized Yahweh by creating a Yahweh-idol that magnified only his strength (what a calf was known for in that culture). The problem with the golden calf or bull was that it crafted an inadequate portrait of Yahweh.[image][FYI: The images in this  read right-to-left, the Japanese way!]And that’s the trick. Art objectifies its subject. Inherently.[1] The nature of illustration, of painting, of cartooning is to take things—whether animal, vegetable, mineral, or ideal—from their multifaceted, multidimensional, highly nuanced reality and smash them down into a flat, inadequate representation of their actual selves. But we’re generally okay with this because, thinking people that we are,[2] we recognize that the intention of objectification is not to explore with ultimate depth and patience the full expression of the object of our objectification. When I draw a woman or a chair or a political ideology, I can reasonably only investigate a fractional portion of her/its multitude of properties. If I draw a Dollar Sign or the Uncle Pennybags[3] or an Illuminati Pyramid With An Eye and call it “capitalism,” you might get some sense of some portion of what I’m intending to describe about the economic ideology, but only that. And we’re usually okay with this because we recognize that the work of art was never intended to entirely explain capitalism. We might object to what I’ve said about capitalism, but our objection will always be because we think the aspect represented was poorly described, not because we expected the representation to entirely explore or explain the theory.[image]In the present circumstance in which the world finds itself circa the beginning of the third millennium AD, sexual objectification (esp. of women) has come under particular scrutiny—not so much because of its nature, but because the context in which it occurs plays into a harmful societal condition leading generally to a misogynistic culture that renders the female experience of life particularly less readily enjoyable than the male experience of the same.[4] There is nothing exactly insidious about the objectification of women in and of itself. As art the Mona Lisa is inherently an objectification—though not one we readily recognize as being harmful. The problem, then, is twofold: 1) the overwhelming singlemindedness in the tendency to reduce women for objectification along a single vector (sexual availability); and 2) the tendency for the members of the contemporary society to forget that objectification is meant only to convey a narrow portion of the object’s properties thereby allowing that narrow perception to govern the conception of the whole.[image]In short, women are largely and forcefully objectified along sexually titillating lines and the consumers of that objectification begin to perceive women wholly through sexual filters, breaking the tacit agreement that objectification is only meant to convey limited facets. This breach of the normal experience of objectification (say, the kind we comprehend easily when viewing a child’s drawing of a cactus or a dog) actually meets up well with the trouble Yahweh had with objectifications of his own self. In portraying Yahweh as a calf, a symbol of strength in the Ancient Near East, the fear was that his Israelite worshipers would begin to view him wholly as a a deity of bullish strength (much as the fire-and-brimstone preachers of legend gleefully viewed the Christian god principally as a being of wrath and terror). So the tendency of people to break the good-faith agreement between the objectification and the object is not new, and special care must be taken in the dismantlement of the problem.Moyocco Anno’s In Clothes Called Fat intimately concerns a world maintained and partly governed by the sexual objectification of women and reads as a good companion to Kyoko Okazaki’s Helter Skelter. The book revolves wholly around how the principal identity of a woman is founded in her attractiveness. Every new chapter (save for the finale) is abstractly heralded by the depiction of a lean, beautiful, and often nude woman—who is not (until the last chapter) the protagonist. The entire ecosystem of Anno’s story is populated by an ethos and ethic developed around the desirability of women.Noko is fat. She works in a business office, has a small taste of office social life, and keeps a handsome longterm boyfriend. But she is definitely fat. And while Anno’s portrayal of her obesity waxes and wanes, she is defined (and irrevocably so) by her weight. Early on, she deliciously describes herself: “It’s like I’m wearing a leotard of flesh that can never be removed.” Her position with regard to her social circle, female co-workers, boss, and boyfriend are all exactly circumscribed by the way she looks. She lives in a world where the sexual objectification of the female has run amok. That is, of course, to say: she lives in a world crisply reflective of our own.[image]I’m not certain of the intricacies of Japanese culture and how measured their reaction to an obese woman would be, but while the American reaction (probably) wouldn’t be outright bullying outside the cesspit interactions of YouTube and online forums, her measure as a woman would certainly be underlined and calcified by her weight. We value women in accord to their attractiveness. We believe that a woman can have use without looking good, but we’re more willing to believe her useful if she’s attractive. And then if she is attractive, we’re more willing to forgive her inadequacies. In this manner, In Clothes Called Fat reflects even the American ideologies pretty well and should make for a fairly seamless read for the Western reader.Anno delves into the experience and mystery of the culture’s fascination with beauty through unsparing episodes from Noko’s life. Her sex life, the bullying she experiences at work, her abortive attempts at self control. Noko is victimized by her own lack of self-confidence and inability to truly grasp the manner of the world about her. A dietician describes Noko: “Her soul is obese.” Anno allows the reader to dwell in Noko’s thoughts, giving us insight enough into the protagonist’s sense of the world and herself.[5]The principle conflict seems to be the question of whether Noko will be able to lose weight, thereby gaining confidence and a place in society, but Anno is canny enough to avoid a problem/solution pairing so pedestrian. Instead, In Clothes Called Fat wonders if it really is the clothes that make the man, postulating instead that no woman can successfully survive the ravaging of society and escape with her true self intact.[6][image]Visually, In Clothes Called Fat engages Anno’s theme through the ready visual objectification (and sexual objectification) of its characters. Noko spends substantial time in the narrative naked, often having sex and one time having her body poured over and lusciously examined by a paramour. Mayumi too is forcefully depicted as almost pure sex appeal and her identity is determined by her fulfillment of the male sex fantasy. Anno’s figurework resembles the loose grotesques present in Kyoko’s Okazaki’s books and whether intentional or not, this works to diffuse much of what would otherwise be titillating in the book. Both Noko and Mayumi are thoroughly and consciously rendered as sex objects, but we can almost immediately understand it as holding narrative heft (as opposed to much of what we’ve come to expect from the depiction of women in the visual arts).This is not a relishment in sexual objectification but labours instead as an indictment of it.[7] By the epilogue, we are neither pleased nor amused by the ends of any of the characters nor in the circumstances that prompt those ends. We do not enjoy or approve of Noko’s closing determination, but we can understand her resignation because we’re neither stupid nor blind to the way of the world.In Clothes Called Fat does that thing the best books do. It prompts renewed thoughtfulness about the world, the nature of civilization, and our place in both. We shouldn’t expect that Moyocco Anno will change the world with this small graphic novel, but we might as well hope. And at the least we can allow ourselves to be affected and renovated._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) And actually, literally, while we’re at it.2) Even if only on a subconscious level much of the time…3) [image]4) In the same way that the group of kids who will get stung by bees at birthday parties can be said to have a less enjoyable experience than the group who doesn’t get stung—even if through luck, circumstance, and outlook the bee-stung kids eventually happen to experience more joy at said parties unrelated to the bee stings.5) In an interesting turn, Anno presents three other minor point-of-view characters (Mayumi, Noko’s antagonist co-worker; Saito, Noko’s boyfriend; and Kiyo, Noko’s dietician), allowing the world to be fleshed out in still more interesting ways.6) It even hints that men too are damaged by the sexual objectification of women by temporarily engaging Saito’s personal struggles and inadequacies, completely invisible to Noko. 7) Which is totally the kind of thing that a lot of untalented, thoughtless sexual objectification pretends to attain....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,not set,not set,"Dec 02, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18843832-in-clothes-called-fat

Or perhaps not so much about myself (in terms of ego) but rather about my life, about the things I’ve experienced, the way things have been. A couple months back, I was trying to describe what I do at Good Ok Bad and I happened upon the description: memoir-based, low-brow lit-crit. The reason I spend so much time telling stories about who I am and have been is that I believe knowing a critic is essential to understanding how his evaluations will intersect with your own interests, tastes, and values. But also because I find the distinction between now and then absolutely compelling.I am not old but I’m not young either. I was born in the early ‘70s and so was part of perhaps the last bulk of free-range children. We roamed neighbourhoods in packs or on our lonesome. We hiked in the local wildernesses on our own or perhaps with a friend, rattlesnake buzzing be damned. Our parents routinely left us in the car to play while doing a half-hour of grocery shopping and no one was at all concerned. The smog in Los Angeles was so thick and constant that skies were perpetually orange and it often hurt a child’s lungs to play and on bad days you couldn’t see further than a hundred yards. Payphones were essential lifelines. Dialing a phone number containing nines and zeroes might have taken eternities. Not every middle class family owned a computer. People were afraid the D&D players were sacrificing each other in bloody masses in underground tunnels. And the difference between my childhood and my father’s immediately-post-WWII childhood is as vast as difference between now and 1980. Worlds tilt and shift and change, and if we don’t tell these stories, no one will remember to care.[image][Nice win/loss rating.]For this reason, Emanuel Guibert’s treatments of Alan Cope’s life are essential and fascinating. How the World Was follows on the heels of Alan’s War, which largely concerned itself with Cope’s place in WWII and its aftermath. How the World Was winds back the clock (another thing growing less and less common) to explore Cope’s childhood growing up in Southern California during the Depression. And it’s a world-and-a-half away from the Southern California I grew up in.In both Alan’s War and How the World Was, Cope exists as a strange mix of social aloofness and integration. On the one hand he often remains free from the racist, sexist, and homophobic influences around him. He seems less a product of his time and more a product of ours.[1] Yet on the other hand, he sometimes represents himself as being deeply affected (even on a lifelong psychological level) by particular people and interactions. At one point he relates how a warning from his mother combined with a hornet later that day brought him a lifelong religious aversion to touching his penis—even after he rejects religion outright as a young adult.[2][image][Here mom. Let me explain how peeing works.]And on a very brief note, Guibert recreates a number of Southern Californian environments now lost to time save but for the archival efforts of photograph collections and artistic renderings. They portray another kind of world and will be fascinating to students of human history and nature. Scenes from the early 20th century abound. Soda shops, old-town L.A. County, the boardwalk at Santa Monica, simple Depression-era housing. Leave it to a French work to inculcate a nostalgia for a thoroughly American world now lost to us for all time.How the World Was is less focused than Alan’s War. Where the former work had WWII as its principal point of contact with Cope’s history (only spreading out in the latter half of the book), the present work culls from the whole of Cope’s history in California as well as his family history. The episodes related are all engaging for sure, but the book does suffer a bit from feeling a touch scattered. Focus ranges from Cope as young child to Cope’s grandfather in the Civil War to Depression-era living to the introduction of Cope’s new stepmother to cousins and aunts and uncles and other extended family. It’s almost all dead fascinating, but I can’t help but wish the vista was at least slightly more directed.[image][Method acting.]In How the World Was, Guibert sometimes relies on large blocks of text. As with the prior book, Guibert tells the entire story (such as it is) through narrative text that floats outside the action of the book’s panels. It worked exceedingly well in Alan’s War and is mostly effective here, though there are times when I wished Guibert would have taken a couple extra pages for a particular story, just so that those large blocks of text could be broken up and spread across more panels of art. Because, for whatever reason, a proliferation of words feels too much like an obstacle when encountered in the comics medium. I felt similarly in Joe Sacco’s Palestine, and that was one of my chief complaints in the recently ed With Only Five Plums. [image][We did awesome/stupid stuff like this all the time growing up.]Despite these probably petty criticisms, How the World Was is a lovely and very often hilarious work. (There is an episode in which Cope relates how he would set up a writing desk atop a wagon and ride down a hill while calmly writing until having to bail out at ride’s end.) Cope’s life continues to enthrall and amuse and enlighten. I can only hope Guibert will continue to mine the wealth of Cope’s experiences and storytelling prowess. Even if future works are even more scattered, they will continue to provide a wealth of value to readers.A Note on the ArtI didn’t have time to mention it in my  of Alan’s War, but Guibert’s method for illustration is enchanting. He draws his line art with water and then drops ink in, which then spreads to fill the lines in a various and mottled effect. Here’re a couple samples demonstrating the method (completely worth your time!):https://youtu.be/zIMdBK8yr_ghttps://vimeo.com/90540711Additionally, Guibert uses a number of techniques to fill the greys that texture his work. His methods here remain a mystery to me. Some seem like spongework, but otherwise I am in the dark. All that matters is that his effects are universally lovely. [image][I thought so too.]_______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) It’s easy to retain a measure of skepticism that Cope hasn’t self-edited his history for our interlocutor, Guibert.2) Amusingly, even when he was motivated by a strong sense that God disapproved of him making physical contact with his penis, he is clear that he found ways to masturbate without breaking letter of the onanistic law.[3][image]3) Trivia! The sin of Onan in the Hebrew scriptures from which we get the term onanism was not actually masturbation. Instead, he was punished for withholding progeny from his brother-in-law’s wife by pulling out—perhaps the only time in history that the method actually worked as birth control! In that culture at that time, brothers would take their widowed sister-in-laws into their household in order to continue the hereditary line of the brother. Children born to the widow would be legally considered the children of the deceased brother. Onan, a happy product of the patriarchal zeitgeist, was happy to enjoy sexual consummation with his brother’s widow but was careful not to intend actual procreation, thus robbing his brother (and his widow) of the continuation of his line.So Onan’s sin, technically speaking, was greed (and perhaps envy of his brother—think “His Face All Red”) and its mechanism was Onan “spilling his seed on the ground.” From which, of course, we get the aphorism: “Better to spill your seed in the belly of a whore than to spill it on the ground.” Because leave it to horny religious people to find a loophole for a law they misinterpreted the whole time....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Dec 02, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18465542-how-the-world-was

The author’s avatar is a fiction because the author, not having a perspective outside himself, has not really the ability to determine plot and direction and who his character actually is or will be. Because a reader is primarily prompted to read biographical non-fiction for its interaction with real life and real events,[1] the story loses its most powerful draw by fictionalizing its subject. Removing true character arcing in this manner usually guts the biograph of its luster, turning the youthful memoir into a singular evidence of the author’s arrogance—a twenty-year-old man who tells you where his story is headed is full-up on the kind of hubris that pretends that we are the masters of our destinies’ directions.[2]Alan’s War, while avoiding this pitfall, provides pretty strong evidence for why autobiography is often foolish. As it is narrated by Alan Cope but edited and compiled and recounted by Emanuel Guibert after Cope’s death, we are greeted with a long-lens view of Cope’s life (even if much of the content comes from Cope himself). As with most all of us, Cope in his teens is different from Cope in his twenties and Cope in his thirties is different from Cope in his forties. And so on throughout his life. Alan’s War collects a handful of completely different Alan Copes. If the book was a Blankets-style memoir penned by a twenty-three-year-old Cope, it’s a sure bet that fifty-year-old Cope would reject it entirely. He understands why he was the person he was but also understands that Young Cope could never have imagined Old Cope. [image]Cope’s life was built of experiences, and the intimate intercourse with those historical meetings and states and phenomena altered him—as experiences always will. I’m not really any kind of determinist, but it’s easy to see how we are all forged by the moments we survive. I have not become who I am without the things that have happened to and around me. And neither are you. In my late twenties, on my fourth trip to Europe, I spent several days wandering around Budapest. I stayed in a dive hostel (where I was nearly impaled through the chest with a wooden stake). I met a pod of three young women who were traveling Europe separately on extended vacations from Australia, Britain, and New Zealand respectively. I had been traveling alone and had largely taken in the sights and adventured without sharing any of my experiences with others. Merely polite back-and-forth with other travelers and locals. Yet here in Budapest I made friends with these three.[image]We had a good time seeing the sights, doing pub crawls, being touristy. Eventually, two had to catch their trains and flights, leaving me and the remainder of the pod a day to take in the city once more, only by ourselves. We had a grand time. Museums, gardens, public baths, dancing, a cellar-level restaurant. I even pooped my pants accidentally (due to the cellar-level restaurant), and that just added to the fantastic spontaneity of the day. It was a colossal experience and one that stays with me even a decade and a half later.[3] And one that went totally against my nature as an entrenched introvert. And that’s part of what makes G.I. Cope’s story so fascinating for me. His entire life during WWII is essentially my few days in Budapest lived over and over, only in hundreds of places with hundreds of people. Cope talks to everybody and makes friends with everybody. He does as he will because the call of adventure is his lodestone. I wish sometimes I could live as Cope does, but I would sadly be in a perpetual state of exhaustion from all that lovely human contact. It is a true thing that later in the day after saying farewell to the final member of the pod, I was drained of all power and was overwhelmed in an uncharacteristic sort of homesickness (which contributed to me cutting short my European adventure by a full week). But Cope, he gets to know everybody and it’s marvelous.He makes friends with men and women of all nationalities and backgrounds. And because of those friendships, Alan’s War is tremendous for offering a number of perspectives and beliefs and approaches to living. Cope becomes an effervescent and participatory fly on the wall of many families across Europe and gets to see a kind of world that none of his G.I. comrades would ever have known. For that alone Alan’s War would be something of a treasure, but beautifully, the book holds far more bounty.[image]Now it may be the weaver’s privilege to edit his own history to portray himself in more contemporary terms, but Cope throughout his narration is almost entirely free from prejudice and any of the distasteful bad opinions that we commonly associate with our grandparents’ era. He even goes so far as to express disapproval and bewilderment at his parents’ occasional classist tendencies. The one point on which he represents himself in less than glowing terms is in evaluating his religious beliefs and evolution. In fact, it’s perhaps his relationship to his faith state that most governs the book.When I said earlier that Cope’s story couldn’t properly be told by stopping at the end of WWII, it was primarily his religious condition I had in mind. The war on the European front (the only piece of the war that Cope saw action in) concludes halfway through the book. This was strange to me, and at first I felt that the second half was just an extremely extended epilogue. After all, it was about Alan’s War, right?—about his involvement in WWII. Why then spend so much ink and sweat on filling in the blanks of the rest of his life? My suspicion is that the book’s title doesn’t actually aim toward describing Cope’s experience of WWII but instead advises the wary reader about something more cosmic going on. Cope as it turns out is participant, victim, belligerent, casualty, strategist, and beneficiary of the internal war within himself with God and religion and the concatenated ideologies of all the world.Cope begins his story as a faithful if minorly disaffected Christian young man. He is eventually assigned to duty with a chaplain but lets us know he was fine with it because—at that time—he agreed with the beliefs and practice of the minister. Eventually he is so taken with the man that he believes himself called to become a minister himself. Later, after the war, he begins a journey of apostasy, abruptly distancing himself from the church in the midst of one of his seminary classes. His antagonism toward religion only sharpens through time and puts impassable obstacles between himself and a number of his former relationships. Finally, on the outward edge of middle age, his dissatisfaction with theological structures transitions to an existential rejection of most social structures and he comes to something near a whole-life-repurposement. The world system, he decides, has governed and abused him for too long, so he hopes to find a way to win free from that.[image]That the bulk of the second half of the book directly concerns this journey of enlightenment solidifies the interpretation that this is Cope’s (or Guibert’s) purpose in the book. In the concluding matter, Cope relates a little diversion about stories:Pygmies have a tradition I like. They gather around a storyteller and yell out topics. For instance, when someone in the group says “Love!” the storyteller responds: “Love? It’s like this.” Or: “Hate? It’s like this.” And then he develops his story. You could call my story: “War? It’s like this.”I suspect when Cope says “you could call my story…” he’s not speaking to the episode in which he went to Europe as part of an armoured car crew. Instead, he’s talking about his life. His life as a very particular kind of war story. It’s a good story and hits any number of the expected high and low beats. And readers will be able to exult in and live vicariously through a young man who for all his inexperience was something of a man of the world.[image]Cope’s stories are almost exclusively engaging and worth the time you’ll spend in reading them. And collapsed together into a single volume, they absolutely merit the couple to few hours it will cost to read them in their entirety. Cope’s life presents the reader with numerous points for self-realization and self-examination. It’s a good and thorough work and I enjoyed it immensely. There is now a sequel, How the World Was, that is being billed as a companion. I’ll tackle it in my next , but as a minor spoiler, I’ll go on record as saying that it is also completely worth the reader’s time. Guibert is a lovely talent and I hope more of his work will arrive on American shores._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) Ignoring wholly the more philosophical question of whether there really is such a thing as Real Events.2) I mean, unless he’s just ingested a bucket of arsenic.

The perfection of society seems to be presented ubiquitously across the genre as nothing so much as veneer. Regardless their ideological differences, the humanists who explore our species’ potential through speculative writing find themselves warm bedfellows with Jesus of Nazareth when contemplating the state of the polished and good. Whitewashed sepulchers. Shiny happy edifices that look delightful and inviting but only serve to contain corruption, death, and rot. If you find in science fiction a perfect society, it is a certainty that this society will soon be unveiled as hopelessly broken—and may even begin functioning as The Antagonist.And these authors may even probably be onto something. Call it a generational thing if you like (having been born in the early ‘70s, I sit in the tail end of Generation X, a touch prior the emergence of Gen Y) or the product of a life spent being betrayed by idealism and trust, but I find myself rather affectionate toward the brand of cynicism that cannot believe in a utopian civilization. As much as dystopia resonates with me, a dystopia under guise of utopia feels even more at home in my sense of What Is.So when something like From the New World comes around, it’s almost a certainty that I will bear it a charitable disposition. The story begins a millennium from today, and with the twenty-first-century emergence of humans with telekinetic powers, society has evolved in vastly different directions from its current trajectory. From the New World follows five children who discover for themselves the nature of the idyllic society they’ve been born into. Kishi’s story functions as a kind of soft examination of power structures, oppression, and the question of reparations, and so might resonate well with an attentive audience who is concerned with the ethics of systemic structures and the normal citizens who unknowingly participate in those systems.[image]As I was waiting for a volume of the series to arrive in the mail to bring my collection up to speed (there are so far four available volumes), I poked around for information on the book—anything to provide a little colour for the  I hoped to soon write.[1] I discovered that there was a well-regarded anime series adapting the same novel. Intrigued, I decided to check it out on Crunchyroll.It was amazing. I had only planned to view an episode or two. I devoured the entirety of the show (25 episodes) in under a week. It may actually be my favourite anime series of all time. The experience of watching this world unfold in terror and hope was wonderful. I never knew what was coming and was always on my toes. The show was lovely and fascinating and philosophically rich. Though completely caught off-guard, I became an ardent fan. I couldn’t wait to get ahold of the manga version of the title.[image][This show is so good you guys.]Adaptation when done well is amazing and inspiring, mostly because you don’t expect it. Taking an existing work that is worthy of recapitulation and then reinventing it in a worthy manner for a new medium (and possibly for a new audience) is a brutally difficult endeavor. At almost its best, an adaptation will only ever reach the heights of Acceptable or Not Bad. Only on the rarest occasion will the reimagining meet the demands of the source and continue on to become something shockingly good. Films like Fight Club and Rashomon. The theatrical adaptation of Wicked. Murakami’s expansion of his own earlier short story “Wind-Up Bird and Tuesday’s Women.” Comics like 5 Centimeters Per Second and Brandon Graham’s Prophet. Adaptations of this caliber are a scarcity. We can hold hope that we might be privileged to run into them in the future, but they can hardly be an expectation.Conversely, on the other side, truly terrible transliterations of existing works—while not exactly rare—are still uncommon enough to defy prediction. When Marvel announces that they’re going to be doing a Jessica Jones adaptation on Netflix, nobody’s going to expect a terrible show. Fans of the Transformers probably didn’t expect anything close to cinematic gold from Michael Bay’s translation of the toy line in the 2000s, but few probably expected it to be as cataclysmically terrible as it was. [image][This extermination of a couple kids is really the least of the book’s graphic violence and horror. Tip of Iceberg stuff here.]Though most adaptations sit safely in the mixed-bag territory comprised of so-so and alright and everything between, avoiding the extremities of the Great and the Awful, From the New World doesn’t pussyfoot around. The manga realization of Yusuke Kishi’s novel is blatantly bad. Its missteps are numerous and sometime egregious. And unfortunately for the series, its problems are only magnified by the glories of the anime adaptation.On the more tolerable side, the art and storytelling are rather weak. The way the narrative unfolds is a jittery, lurching affair. The dialogue is uninspired and plain, and features characters communicating in impossibly expositional ways. For example, this painful series of panels designed to spell out exactly each character’s role in the group (reads right to left in the Japanese form):[image]The writing is bad for the duration. A small few pages later, Saki narrates: I would discover, amidst the endless despair and sorrow, why adults feared children so. That morning, we set out for summer camp, which triggered it all. Our fateful boats sailed on towards that day when so much would be reduced to ash…Fateful boats? This is the writing of a fourteen year old.While there are obviously big ideas at play, the manga adaptation does its best to downplay everything interesting there and instead focuses on a pandering sort of demographic-driven tawdriness. But maybe I’m just not the right audience for the book—I probably would have loved this manga when I was twelve.[2]Where the comics version of From the New World most deeply offends is in its depiction of its female protagonists. The story is told not just from a perspective lodged deeply from within the male gaze; instead it’s founded somewhere in the fractured imagination of some young heterosexual male who wants desperately to turn females into animate-though-barely-sentient sexual objects but lacks any real understanding of the anatomy or texture of the human person. At the start, these kids are about twelve years old,[3] but the book sallies forth with rather forthright nude lesbian scenes marked by iron-gripped groping and saliva streams and sweaty sweaty sweatiness. It would be comical if it wasn’t so repulsive. Any female character under age twenty is obliged to constant camel toe. Series lead Saki and support characters are given breasts that must be filled with some impossible substance. I’m reminded of Forty-Year-Old Virgin when Steve Carrell describes a woman’s breasts as being bags of sand. Here, the creator depicts them as something like tremendous waterballoons filled with grape jelly.  Fingers dig in and realities collapse.[4] Like so (click the below blurred image to see what’s wat in the realm of space horror—I don’t actually recommend this course of action):  [image]]Like probably every American er of this book, I’m going on record to explain that I’m no shrinking violet when it comes to sex scenes in the narratives I consume and engage. Utsubora (also published by Vertical) is fraught with steamy, sexy scenes that might even be more explicit, but they’re artfully accomplished and serve a purpose beyond mere titillation (even if the author still intends to arouse her reader) and I pretty highly recommend the book. Craig Thompson, in Blankets, depicts his avatar’s first sexual experience with a girl and the scene is beautiful, wonderful, and essential—and the book would be lesser for its absence. So it’s not the presence of sex that diminishes the book. It’s not even the underage nature of the participants—Blankets too features sexual contact between minors.The problem is that Saki, Maria, and Reiko are depicted as gratuitously sexualized objects for wholly prurient reasons. There are narrative reasons that they might be engaged in lesbian pursuits, but there is no reason for the character and quality of these scenes beyond giving teens weird jerk-off material. The producers are also certain to apportion out these scenes across the series to give readers at least one solid lesbian sex scene per volume—even if there aren’t enough female characters around to make it happen (pro-tip: thank goodness for flashbacks and dream sequences!). The end result is a book that makes DC Comics look like a hard-bitten bastion of feminist activism. I was embarrassed to be reading this book. I was embarrassed to be seen reading these in public. I was embarrassed to hand these to my wife to read for a second opinion uncoloured by a fervent admiration for the anime adaptation. I was embarrassed for the manga’s creators. And I was embarrassed for the subculture whose tastes make something like this book a marketable choice.[image][This is basically almost an exact representation of me as I realized how awful this book series actually is.]I’m not certain which adaptation is more faithful to the source—I have not had the pleasure of reading the original. It’s possible (even plausible) that the anime took great liberties with the story as laid out in the novel. Anime tends to do this. It doesn’t matter. The anime series stands as one of the great glories of its medium, a mature and indelible treatment of the human condition as written across millennia. The manga, for its part, likewise stands as emblem for its own medium—only as one of the great shames. These books are made repellent by the comparison. It’s such a deeply tragic missed opportunity. Due to inept handling, this book that could have been a fascinating mix of speculative fiction, horror, bildungsroman, and political ethics becomes little more than a rambling, childish exercise in pandering to an infantile microdemographic.This series is so badly done, so repellent, so great a disappointment after having seen the anime adaptation of the same story that I’m going to throw the books away. I don’t throw books away if I don’t like them. I give them to people who might like them, donate them to Friends of the Library, whatever. Not these. I want no one anywhere ever to read these.In the supplemental material for the second volume, the publishers run a minicomic giving readers a bit of a behind-the-scenes glance into the adaptations of the novel. The manga’s team visits the studio producing the anime and eventually the novelist Yusuke Kishi makes an appearance, praising the anime and cast. He then takes a moment to earnestly plead with the manga creators: “Please make the manga good enough to beat the novel and anime! I have high hopes!” It’s as if those responsible for producing the manga listened attentively to the admonition and then beat the author savagely, tied him up, and pissed all over his dreams._________Note: I’ve essentially stopped ing books I don’t at least sort of like. There’s enough negativity on the internet to sustain worldwide bile for another seven hundred years and I’ve stopped feeling the need to participate in that. The only reason I’m ing this From the New World is I want the opportunity to point out how wonderful the anime is and drive people toward it. You can view it on Crunchyroll. It is worth your time and consideration.Trailer: https://youtu.be/ybgzmTT_SuM_______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) I hadn’t yet read any of the manga, wanting to wait for all the books to come in.2) Not that my mom would have allowed me to read a book with this much smut in it when I was twelve.3) I can’t actually remember how old they are in the manga.

An American will be a product of either a) the decisions and circumstances of their past, b) the actions and position of the present, or c) the person one hopes to be in the near or distant future. Other cultures may offer additional options—an identity might, for instance, be derived from the community rather than the individual—but parcel and part to the American dream is the demand that we narrowly define ourselves according to the true and tried pieces and bits of the three basic tenses.It’s a struggle through which we move from pessimist to pragmatist to idealist even as our outlook shifts from past to present to future. And of course it’s not always a progression. Some of us will remain wholly enveloped in nostalgia, the essentially pessimistic view of the world that looks to the past for identity rather than engage the present or hope for the future. Others will embrace the identity of the moment, a wholly utilitarian device for exercising immediate control over one’s person and outlook—often in the guise of realism. The third group of us looks, fingers-crossed, forward to the us that we strive to be (or at least presume to hope to be), and rest our identity in that hypothetical us that may never come to be. [image]Harry “Herschel” Haft ping-pongs a bit between the three options, but—as we might expect from a survivor of the Third Reich’s death camps—the once-smuggler, then-boxer, then-grocer spends significant portions of his life being identified by his past. Even as he prepares to disembark onto American shores for the first time, Harry is overwhelmed by turbulent visions from his time in front of Nazi ovens. Inconspicuous moments are haunted by the memories from which his own personal history snakes out to grip him by the throat, offering both paralysis and catalyst. This is Harry at his most American. Occasionally spurred by a kind of romanticism and glimpsing a self he hoped to one day inhabit, Harry throws himself into his boxing—all to the end of finding again the love of his life and making true the faery tale. Only by beating and clawing at the lives of others will he be positioned to take on the identity he dreams for himself. This is Harry at his most American. Finally, the boxer surrenders his dreams to what he imagines must be reality. He takes up a new daily struggle and throws himself into the most immediate of concerns: food, shelter, companionship, progeny. His dreams no longer control him, his past no longer commands him. He is wholly devoted to the now. This is Harry at his most American.[image]Though of course it isn’t all so simple as that. Even while Harry is who he is in the present, he cannot shake the ghost of the past—ghosts that twist his dreams for the future. The former boxer is harried by the life he once hoped to live and those dreams built of a busted prescience only work to diminish the identity he finally settles into. He’s a man torn at by invented creatures beyond his control, and he is weak in the face of them. Yet simultaneously, this man—this boxer—is full of spit and fire and fight. And that’s actually where half the wonder of Kleist’s work resides. [image]You may as well discover my filthy secret now. I go out of my way to avoid Holocaust narrative. It’s not so much that I pretend that so many Jews, Romani, handicapped, and poor didn’t die all because a nation of people couldn’t any longer imagine itself to be poor and so would rather light the world afire, grabbing what they could in the chaos. That’s not what it is at all. It’s more just that I’ve been devastated by the story already. Over and over again. It was an important component in my public school education. We read books, heard stories, saw pictures, and met survivors. I’ve read Maus, seen Life Is Beautiful, read Anne Frank and Eli Wiesel, and seen Schindler’s List and Judgment at Nuremberg and The Hiding Place. I have been properly horrified over and over again. By the end of junior high, I never wanted to study the subject again—I was full up. And yet, I was returned to the Holocaust over and over. There’s only so much bludgeoning one can take before one’s heart begins to curdle. So I don’t seek out Holocaust stories anymore and, often, if I’m aware that’s what a direction will get me, I will choose a different path.[1][image]When I bought The Boxer I didn’t know its relation to WWII or the Holocaust.[2] When it arrived, I saw the concentration camp on the cover and dejectedly let the book sit on the mail pile for a week. At last though (obviously) I resolved to give the book a shot at weaning me from my terror. And Harry Haft succeeded. Wildly, too. The difference is one of spirit. The Holocaust tale is one of broken hearts and spirits, of human persons reduced to walking ghosts. It’s terror after terror and it breaks everyone, rendering them into the soulless. Beyond even the deaths and murders and rapes and incinerations and gassings, probably the thing that devastates me so entirely is the iron work of destruction the Nazi machine wreaks on the souls of their victims in these stories. Perfectly believable, sure; yet not something I want to see more than a handful of times. Haft, however, is a pugilist. And even if he isn’t yet a boxer when he gets dragged to the camps, he’s born a fighter. He’s got spirit and its nigh unquenchable. The Nazis will go to great lengths to diminish Haft, to strip him of his inner fire; they will essentially destroy him and ruin him for all time. But it will take something greater than Hitler’s mania to turn Haft into the living dead. Because he fights and fights and fights. [image]Even when he establishes himself in the US boxing circuit, Haft makes certain his boxing trunks are decorated with a Star of David. This could easily be seen wholly as a redemption and repurposement of the star that was used to damn the Jews not even a decade earlier, but there’s more to it than just that. The five-pointed pentagram, associated with Daivd’s royal son, is called the Star of Solomon; it’s the hexagram that is David’s star. And while both kings, Solomon and David, carry their measure of historical fame in the Jewish mythos, David was the warrior—so bloody-handed and vicious in battle that he was forbidden from building a temple for Yahweh by Yahweh himself. Solomon’s reign, on the other hand, was marked by peace, prosperity, and leisure. Solomon’s star could never suit Haft for Harry is every bit the tortured warrior and fighter that King David would have been.[image]So when we see in The Boxer's opening pages that Haft is broken and crazy, we are driven to find out why. It’s a perfect opening, especially as Kleist immediately juts back to fourteen-year-old Harry (then named Hertzko), full of piss and fire and life. It’s a fantastic setup and by the time Kleist catches us up again to the Harry Haft revealed in the opening pages, it all clicks. We’re sold entirely on the tragedy and victory of his life. All things have come to resolution and we are satisfied. [image]I’d never encountered a book by Reinhard Kleist before this week. I’m only a little bit upset at myself for that. Mostly I’m just happy that now I have a nice little bibliography to discover—because I’m definitely interested in exploring more of the man’s work. His art is fluid, organic, and pretty wonderful. He captures Haft so so well at all kinds of ages and in all kinds of conditions. Young teen, twenty-year-old boxer, fifty-year old man, Holocaust-starved teen, distraught, angry, deliriously happy. Under Kleist’s brush Haft always looks like Haft—even when he’s almost entirely another person. Whether past, present, or future, whichever Haft Harry chooses to be in a moment, Kleist makes certain the soul remains bubbling and fighting below the surface, unquenched. It’s a fantastic exercise and Kleist delivers both a Holocaust narrative that has something new to say and a personal history that succeeds in making its hero intriguing without lionizing him. _______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) I was given the opportunity to read Loïc Dauvillier’s graphic novel hidden, and I took one look at these two pages and backed right the heck out of there immediately. I’m sure it’s a wonderful and valuable and important work. But I couldn’t do it. Even these two lone pages crushed me.[image]2) I also don’t read sports narratives that aren’t written by Mitsuru Adachi, but I’d heard fantastic things about Kleist, so I made an exception....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Nov 23, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18405540-the-boxer

In the classical era, refurbishing old tales was essential and taught as part of the progymnasmata. The best storytellers were expected not to develop new stories but instead to work with the classics of the era. So people grew accustomed to reinventing the legends and telling the stories from different perspectives, from different points in time, featuring different characters, and to different ends. A breadth of methods were explored and necessity mothered invention in very confined circumstances.[image][She’s talking about Gwen Stacy ಠ_ಠ]Today, it’s a little bit different. We have the option to build any story we like. We can invent until our brains fall out. And some of us do. But wholesale invention isn’t always safe. Audiences might not “get” a new and exciting work. And readers are already comfortable with several fistfuls of already existing stories. Revisiting these proven tales is one of the safest ways to market a new story. Hence Disney’s entire animated catalogue. Hence the spate of cinematic adaptations that go back to the dawn of the moving picture. Hence our current subject.Spider-Man is almost a dead property. Or he should be. He’s had monthly adventures (or better) for more than fifty years now. He never strays far from status quo. His story has been told over and over and over again—enough so that any Spider-Man reader from any era can safely describe everything one really needs to know about the character to jump-start a new reader into the concept. Radio-active spider bite. Uncle Ben. Great power, greater responsibility. Sad sack normal dude. Tons of bad luck. Popular with the ladies. Sticks to walls, super strength, and webshooters. Complicated relationship with the public. Everything else is gravy. We’ve been there and done that. If not in comics, then in cartoons or films. [image]So really, what’s a publisher to do? Spider-Man is an essential Marvel product, but there’s got to be some way to breathe life into his carcass. Sure, you can give him a new, adventurous writer/artist battery, but that’s only catering to a small segment of his potential audience—the people who are already reading his books, generally. So they throw in some of the old favourites. Spider-Man crossovers with other pop characters! Spider-Man in the future (totally a legit move since Frank Miller turned Bruce Wayne into an old man with a bad heart)! Or, and this was kind of genius, you make him into a barely appearing support character in a normally supporting character’s book. And that is where the magic happens. Unfortunately, since it barely lasted twenty-eight issues, it apparently wasn’t as popular as it deserved to be.I’m guessing that Marvel was trying to market Mary Jane (and later, Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane) to a young female demographic. I’m not sure if they ever succeeded in that goal or if the book only sold well to then-thirty-year-old males such as myself. In any case, the recipe was right: Sean McKeever, fresh off Dawson-Creeky indie rom-dram The Waiting Place, would write it; Takeshi Miyazawa, one of the most vibrant young manga-inspired artists working in US comics would draw the heck out of the thing; Christina Strain would do some amazingly fun things on colours; and it would star a young Mary Jane Watson in a pretty much non-superhero book concerned with highschool drama and celebrity worship. I could imagine a teen or pre-teen girl digging that. But what did I know? I was a thirty-year-old dude on the downhill end of a waning relationship and I dug it. Maybe it was aimed at adult men after all?[image][Oh Snap, Mary Jane! Time to step up your game!]Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane absolutely sparkles. It’s the most fun I’d had on a Spider-Man book in ages. Maybe ever.[1] Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane isn’t concerned with just how depressing Peter Parker’s life is (which is, of course, the overwhelmingly resilient vibe I get from my accumulated contact with the original series), partially because it isn’t really even about Spider-Man. At least not at first.Mary Jane Watson is a popular girl. She’s good-looking, fun, buoyant, and has a fair amount of cross-over appeal in her school—making nice with kids from multiple walks of life. She’s the lynchpin fourth to a trio of popular friends: wealthy flirt, Harry Osborn; quarterback of the varsity football squad, Flash Thompson; and Liz Allen, head cheerleader and Flash’s verbally abusive girlfriend. Mary Jane’s got a good good life, but nothing’s perfect. Her friends want her to hook up with Harry because they’re basically made for each other, but she’s actually incapable of generating any real romantic interest because her heart belongs to a celebrity that she doesn’t even know: Spider-Man.[image]For much of the narrative, the hero occupies only the small dark corners of Mary Jane’s story. He’s not the main character, after all; just the MacGuffin. This is really and truly Mary Jane’s story—at least for the first several arcs, after which Peter Parker’s romantic drama begins insinuating itself into the narrative and we start getting more scenes with no Mary Jane. But that’s all pretty late-in-game for the book’s lifespan and one’s never sure if that creeps in as the book gradually distracts from its raison d’etre or if the shift was editorially mandated.[2]Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane is foremost the story of a young woman who cannot interact with reality in any kind of healthy way, hiding her existential dissonance from friends and acquaintances by a mask of effervescence. Even to her closest friend, the one who sees the cracks, she demurs, pretending that her fears, insecurities, and obsessions are perfectly within normal parameters. It’s a balancing act that constantly threatens to overwhelm her, and minor breakdowns pepper the script from start to finish.One of the early geniuses of the book is that McKeever writes Spider-Man as the problem rather than the solution.[3] If Mary Jane ever succeeds in her quest to win Spider-Man’s love and affection, she will have lost her soul (so to speak). And Peter (a.k.a. Spider-Man), who titularly loves her, does not help her. He encourages her fracture from reality by making the fantasy more realistic. Beyond just flirting with Mary Jane while in costume, Peter at one point even takes Mary jane on a Spider-date. Peter’s more concerned with his own needs than he is with Mary Jane’s—because he’s got his own issues with reality and his own problems with coping in the social circuit. [image][You guys are both blackholes of existential angst and you don’t even know it.]This is part of the joy of McKeever’s version of the highschool Spider-verse: it plays as standard teen drama, but every last character is a psychological mess for their own discrete reasons. Which makes sense when you consider his prior work, The Waiting Place, which features the exact same kind of character complexity. I mentioned earlier that this incarnation of the Spider-Man mythos is perhaps the one I enjoy the most, the one that’s the most fun. Though a series of characters each with their own social disaffections doesn’t necessarily sound very buoyant at first, it’s the combination of these characters’ unique social disabilities that make them such a charming collection of personalities.Takeshi Miyazawa, for his part, makes these dour-ish[4] kinds of interactions sparkly. His drawings of teens have always held a certain verve and energy that very few artists in the superhero field seem able to muster or imagine. He’s great with expression and posture, but more than most Marvel artists Miyazawa seems to get clothing—and gives his characters a wide range of teen-ish fashion choices. His figures always seem believable and lively. I’m actively broken-hearted that we don’t get to see more of his work. Another contributor who turns the book into something more than just a second-tier effort on one of Marvel’s little side books is Christina Strain, the colourist. Beyond just using a lot of screentones to texture the art, Strain does pretty phenomenal work translating Miyzawa’s teens into something actually resemblant of the real world. More than merely providing a variety of colours on their fashion, Strain gives the kids’ clothing patterns, graphics, and embroidery. It’s an understated effect but it goes yards toward establishing them as real people. Here’s a sample of just three of the hundreds of examples in these volumes.[image]And if there’s any question of Miyazawa’s command over the book, everything kind of falls apart when he’s not at the artistic helm. Early in the fourth arc he takes a break during a flashback chapter to be covered by Valentine de Landro, and the book falters substantially in those two chapters. Later, Miyazawa ultimately bids farewell to the book entirely (save for remaining on covers), handing the reins over to David Hahn, and again the book loses substantial steam. And it’s not that Hahn is in any way a bad artist. He’s pretty great actually and I loved his work on Private Beach. Hahn successfully draws a despondent Firestar, a frustrated Flash Thompson, a wily Felicia Hardy, whatever. He does just fine. The only problem is that he’s following the firestorm of Miyazawa’s tenure on the book and he’d have to do something downright incredible to not be second best here.[5] [image][Hey, look! An occasional superhero!]And unfortunately, David Hahn never had the chance to make the book his own. Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane folded with the close of the sixth act. I don’t know whether McKeever had hoped to end it here exactly (as there are a couple unresolved bits), but he does a fair enough job. Nobody really gets over their problems; and Mary Jane, while somewhat bottoming out, doesn’t seem to have had the ultimate kind of revelation that we can trust will keep her from the kind of disassociation that makes her celebrity fantasies at the book’s start possible. McKeever leaves the toys in place for a future writer[6], so it’s no surprise I guess that Marvel revamped the series a year after it folded, headed by Strangers in Paradise creator Terry Moore.[7][image][Miyazawa draws the four friends hanging at the coffee shop.][image][The same quartet under David Hahn’s pen.]As time goes by, it’s going to be increasingly difficult to get ahold of this series from the mid-Aughts, so if you’re interested, get on your ball! I really do pretty highly recommend it for fans of the admixture of superheroing and romantic drama. It’s lovely and lively and a testament to the fact that these old stories aren’t entirely impossible to re-envigourate—if only creators can fashion something new and fancy from the wasted old bones of canon material._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) I’ve read the original series up through Gwen Stacy’s exit, picked up again with the introduction of the Hobgoblin in the John Romita Junior days, exited again with the introduction of Carnage, picked up some of John Byrne’s run and some Tangled Web, and hopped on again for volume 2 of Amazing Spider-Man (written by Howard Mackie and then by Michael J. Straczynsky) before exiting for good and forever after the “Sins Past” arc—because why on earth would anyone stay after that? There were some good stories in there (like “Kraven’s Last Hunt” and the Aunt May Figures It Out episode), but none were particularly fun. 2) It’s easy to suspect the latter, as the book goes from being simply titled Mary Jane to shoehorning in Parker even above the heroine with Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane. The title shift always grated on me a bit, 1) for making Spider-Man the headliner of another character’s story, but also 2) for insisting that Spider-Man loves Mary Jane rather than vice versa, stripping the book of any real tension, since no matter who Peter’s dating, you are told explicitly by the title that he loves Mary Jane. Simultaneously, her love of Spider-Man is never at stake because the entire book is predicated on her obsession for the hero.3) Or at least a very visible symptom of the problem.4) Sort of not a fair description since McKeever gives the kids a good deposit of lively, humourous dialogue to fill in the crevasses of angst, woe, and social disability.5) Actually, the only Marvel/DC artist I can think of who could have been a suitable replacement for Miyazawa is Stuart Immonen in his Nextwave/Never As Bad As You Think phase. It would have been different but would have also been distinct enough to reinvent the book while retaining some of Miyazawa’s stylistic energy. Expanding beyond Marvel/DC artists, the only other artist I could see succeeding is Yoshitoki Oima (creator of A Silent Voice). She’d probably even be a more solid choice than Immonen, really.6) Which is exactly the kind of thing that pushed me to abandon Marvel/DC books about eight years ago. If all stories have to circle back to the beginning, then they really aren’t much stories at all, just narrative tricks—and seeing the same trick played over and again for years upon years just gets plain dulling.7) The revamp, unfortunately, has essentially no relation to the prior series. Characters behave in wildly different manner and are now first-day sophomores in highschool rather than the juniors or seniors they were previously. The second series may or may not be fine—I haven’t been able to give it a fair shot due to my investment in McKeever and Miyazawa’s vision for the story....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,not set,"Nov 23, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/590210.Spider_Man_Loves_Mary_Jane_Volume_1

Not because the stories that were produced to make use of the kind of red/blue-lensed glasses were particularly invigourating. They weren’t. And not because the stories were made better by their use of fancy illusion. Usually the opposite was true. Really, I just fell in love with 3D because I could do it myself. [image][Three Dee!!]But really, I had always been in love with the idea of 3D. Like most kids, gimmicks were the way to my heart. Take something boring and adult like a soap opera but throw in a handful of Veritech fighters (a la Robotech) and I was glued to every melodramatic episode. Have the Harlem Globetrotters or Batman appear on Scooby Doo and I was yours. When I first saw a commercial for a network airing of Vincent Price’s House of Wax in 3D, my world caught fire. At about seven years old, I was of course too young to harbour any real volition over my television watching schedule—and so I never was able to watch the program. Still, the concept lit up the imagination, and when I later saw Captain Eo at Disneyland I was cheered despite the fact the story, acting, and all else was dullard’s work. My contact with 3D works was pretty limited until junior high (circa 1987). Then suddenly (perhaps only seemingly so), the world of comics was being infiltrated with a lot of 3D experimentation. I picked up several issues from different series, but what I still remember was Blackthorn’s Gumby in 3D. It was cool enough, and Gumby was going through a bit of a revival (at least at my school). What’s probably more important is that it was with my Gumby issue that I really took a look at how the 3D illusion came about. The basic idea didn’t seem too tough to achieve, so I tried making a 3D drawing with just two levels of z-index (or dimensionality). It worked. It wasn’t amazing, but I definitely had two levels of dimensionality going on. So I did another. And then another. Pretty soon I was competently drawing up cartoons with three levels of dimensionality. I was also experimenting with different colour pens. I found that lighter blues more properly disappeared when viewed with the blue-coloured lens (essential for the illusion), but that darker ones seemed to make the illusion pop more for whatever reason. I also discovered what would happen if you accidentally reversed the colour order, making a couple head-spinning and impossibly dimensioned pieces (you’d have to put the glasses on backwards to see them correctly). I spent a little over a year making these drawings, wowing friends with the gimmick and getting good enough so I could employ more than nine distinct layers of dimensionality. Still, it was a lot of work (I was doing these all by hand[1]), and the only people who could appreciate my work were the dwindling number who actually had their own 3D glasses (or who borrowed mine). So, in eighth grade, I stopped.[image][One of my junior high experiments—Inspired by what else but Akira…]Over the years, my fondness for the delivery method waned. Beyond the fact that all visual gimmicks become mundane through exposure, there was the biological matter with which to contend. In 1996 and on the cusp of age twenty-three, while leaning over the counter and squinting to read the menu at a fast-food establishment, I came to realize I’d need my eyes examined. One afternoon and a diagnosis of astigmatism later, and I was now and for the rest of my life the owner and wearer of glasses. Contacts would never have suited my idiom, so glasses it was. And the one thing you should know about glasses[2]: wearing glasses on top of glasses is an awkward, non-enjoyable enterprise. Give it a shot some time. Throw on some sunglasses or reading glasses, then throw on some sunglasses or reading glasses on top of those. Now imagine doing that for the kind of duration you’d be required to sustain in order to watch a movie or read a book.  More than just a touch annoying.For that reason, I still haven’t bothered attempting to see one of these newfangled 3D movies that plague the local cinemas. It’s not that I’m sure they aren’t perfectly enjoyable and a magnificent assault on the visual cortex. I’ll bet the experience is perfectly lovely for those physically and constitutionally disposed to enjoy them. Still, a year ago when I heard RJ Ryan discussing his upcoming book, The Joyners in 3D, I was properly intrigued. Archaia always does a lovely job putting together their books, so I was sure this wasn’t going to be any low-budget affair. And it’s not. The Joyners has some top-notch quality production going on (even down to the handy rear-cover pocket for the anaglyph glasses[3]). I was interested enough in the project that I pre-ordered it without really knowing much more about it.[image][The answer was actually “Kick”]Down another alleyway of my personal history we find that in the late ‘90s, when I fancied that I might actually take a path toward becoming a film critic,[4] I was particularly enamoured with film noir. The noir mode was a spectacular combination of both the stylistic and storytelling excesses that I adored in my mid-twenties. I watched all the noir I could get my hands on. I read books on the subject. I took particular joy in reading the critical essays and examinations in Alain Silver’s Noir Reader series. By 2000, I had largely stopped seeking out new instances of the mode (having watched all the principal examples and fistfuls of the off-brand stuff) and began moving in new directions. Still, I never truly forsook noir, but merely put it on a shelf that I could visit at my leisure over the coming decades.[5]All this is to say that when I come across other media that take part in the noirish tropes and tradition, it can be a comfortable place for me. Straight up neo-noir like David Lapham’s Stray Bullets is just lovely—for sure—but other books that pick and choose their elements can be fun callbacks as well. Mignola’s Hellboy has often functioned as a kind of faery-noir. Alex Proyas almost flawlessly lifts noir elements to blend with German expressionism for his sci-fi Dark City. The reason I bring up noir at all is that The Joyners in 3D, while ostensibly a future-driven family drama, draws plenty of the common elements of noir storytelling into its playful future-fi. The crimes, the dramatic angularities, the uncomplicated morality play, the flawed protagonist, the betrayals, and of course the femme fatale. The book opens with the protagonist imprisoned and ends by drawing closed the noose of that fate that brought him there. It’s kind of formulaic and typical, but I see a reason for that—even if what I see is only built of my own construction.[image][The moment the nanny is introduced, you know what she’s there for]Ryan and Marquez do double duty pushing the reader to take the Joyners’ story as being a legitimate read of Our Glorious Future. First, they firmly establish their narrative four decades from today. This is the future, but it isn’t distant. Further, it’s recognizable. Even if Ryan hadn’t dropped hint by titling chapter one as “Meet George Joyner,” the mere fact of the protagonist’s name should be enough to invoke the man of the future from The Jetsons (for most readers). George Joyner is what we were promised through a children’s cartoon that aired exactly a century earlier than events depicted in this book. A shining though mundane future of cogs, sprockets, corporate espionage, and plastic families.Next, by pushing the reader to engage their story through anaglyph glasses, they’re invoking again a sense of Future. There was a time when we felt that three-dimensional entertainment was exactly where we were ideally headed. At least the children always believe that. Whether it be 3D matinees or the holographic games that sporadically graced arcades in the ‘80s or Disney’s newfangled polarized lens 3D or James Cameron’s Avatar or Nintendo’s 3DS or the Oculus Rift—new ways to push the visual experience of story capitalize easily on our child-sense of What Might Be. By returning to (and improving on) the 3D technology common at the dawn of Hanna-Barbera’s prognosticated world way back in 1962, Ryan and Marquez steep their story not just in a particular time but also in a mode of seeing.[image][A very Jetsonian way of life.]The Jetsons was a short-lived series forged right on the cusp of a new age. The sense of wondrous progress that governed post-war America was waning in the face of new national cynicisms. It’s common to speak of Kennedy’s assassination or Nixon’s impeachment as the end of American idealism, but the truth is that cosmic sense of national place had been rotting already and the eggs laid even before the War were beginning to hatch. Vietnam, Cold War terror, the civil rights movement, hawks and doves, women’s liberation. Rock and roll. It was all on the march, and Kennedy and Nixon were merely symptoms of the paradigm tilt. And the Jetsons, for all their goofy June-Cleaver/Donna-Reed sensibilities, were a normal family whose struggles and trials were exactly the struggles of the modern American salaryman transplanted to a future that didn’t care what it could be because it was too concerned with what it always would be.The Jetsons was an argument that no matter how much progress we made, human nature would remain unaltered—and so we would be foolish to lodge our hopes too deeply in a world of flying cars, moving sidewalks, and push-button meals. There was no promise to be found in these things because they would only highlight our inadequacies in new ways. Ryan’s message in The Joyners is exactly this, only in 3D. For all his evident enthusiasm in the mode, the decision to opt for anaglyph sturdily emphasizes that despite progress, despite the future, despite flying cars and robots and cybernetics and jetpacks—despite any and all gimmicks we might use to enhance the experience of our lives, we cannot escape our humanness. And therefore, whether in two or three or four dimensions, we cannot escape the flaws and darkness that turn the amazing into the mundane and broken.All that said, the mundane aspect of the story will be hit-and-miss with readers. Some of the clichés fits seamlessly into the neo-Jetsonsonian theme, but it will be left up to the individual whether or not the storytelling is compelling on its own or whether it relies too much upon the weight of the book’s moral.[6] The Joyners is neither a rollicking adventure nor particularly adventurous in terms of plot development. As mentioned briefly above, the story relies on a lot of the common noir tropes and so is rather predictable to those familiar with the mode. And while this serves to make that aspect of the book comfortable enough so the reader can be eased into its parable about the ultimate impotence of progress, some may lose steam along the way and miss the point.[image][C’mon, George. Get it together, man.]Marquez’ art is cartoony and slick and plays well with the anaglyph technique here honed by Marquez and Tara Rhymes. The 3D is largely crisp, and in that sense is often better than what we’ve seen from anaglyph in previous decades. The team uses several levels of opacity on their blues (which are really kind of a shade of lightly greened cyan) and reds as well as a fair amount of gradients to flesh out the appearance of depth. There are a couple moments where the red and blue lines don’t match up well enough to complete the seamlessness of the dimensional illusion, but that may have been intentional (these are typically bits of text, which made their fuzziness stand out a bit more[7]). Also, and this is a personal kind of tragedy: the fact that I wear glasses made reading the book a bit of a hassle. I eventually rigged a way to keep the red/blue lenses in place but, until then, wrangling the glasses over my glasses was a pretty rough business. I probably didn’t look that cool in Starbucks with my anaglyphs half hanging off my face. And me looking cool is important. So important.I think it’s neat that people are still experimenting with different ways of seeing, even if I’m less interested in those explorations myself (due to the aforementioned physical impairment[8]). All I have to do is remember my excitement as a kid encountering at-home-achievable-3D in comics and it absolutely justifies these projects. So kudos to Team Joyners and Archaia for taking the risk to not only pursue a 3D project, but taking the time to expand on the techniques available and enlarge somewhat the toolbox for future works._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) This was a full decade before I’d get my hands on a copy of Photoshop (version 5, fresh in 1998).

I’m sure they tried that out and chose 3D for the text after testing and testing. I really do like the weirdo effect of black elements intruding on the 3D, and I think the stark absolute in the midst of the gimmick could have played well with the neo-Jetsonian theme.8) I kind of feel a bit like Willem Dafoe’s character in Auto Focus when he’s trying to show off the new colour projection television set and everyone realizes he’s colourblind....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Nov 23, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15038251-the-joyners-in-3d

The days of Adam after he fathered Seth were 800 years; and he had other sons and daughters. Thus all the days that Adam lived were 930 years, and he died. When Seth had lived 105 years, he fathered Enosh. Seth lived after he fathered Enosh 807 years and had other sons and daughters. Thus all the days of Seth were 912 years, and he died. When Enosh had lived 90 years, he fathered Kenan. Enosh lived after he fathered Kenan 815 years and had other sons and daughters. Thus all the days of Enosh were 905 years, and he died. When Kenan had lived 70 years, he fathered Mahalalel. Dot dot dot. Et cetera and cetera. You get the idea.The author[1] of the book of Genesis does this thing right at the beginning of the first book of the Pentateuch, right after the Fall of Humanity and right after the Cain and Abel incident. It’s rather an establishing shot for the whole of the rest of the Pentateuch. It’s like Orson Welles’ fabulous crane shot introducing Touch of Evil. It basically tells you everything you need to know to make sense of what follows. It gives you foundation enough not to be irreparably lost. It’s ambiance and context and foreshadowing all in one. And it works magnificently for those with patience enough to care.Genesis 5, from which I cribbed above, reads as a litany of death. So and so was born, lived so long, had a particular son through which the dynasty would pass, lived for so many years, and then died. Next! The book repeats the formula with rare exception for ten generations. It’s a bit taxing to read but drives home the author’s point that after things went haywire in the Earthly Paradise, there is no stopping death. Things were promised to get better, but they just aren’t. No matter how long a person lives, no matter how rad they were, they all die in the end. It’s macabre (though treated a bit sterile in this early chapter—things get cooking later with details to spare) and even tedious, but it’s to a particular end.[image][Fact: what you expect to happen in the next panel does indeed happen.]Wolfsmund has the same thing going on. The first two volumes are relentless. They’re gruesome and draining and don’t really seem to go anywhere. It’s just ugly death after ugly death, and Kuji seems to introduce characters only to see them tortured and dead by chapter’s end. It’s maddening and sometimes off-putting. But then, like the book of Genesis, suddenly things start happening.[2] The loose threads of a plot begin to weave into sight and all of that earlier horror begins to make a bit more sense.I don’t know if the completed work will end up wholly justifying the first six or so chapters, but so far Wolfsmund is well on it’s way to that end. Where I was at the time on the fence and ready to give up the series if the wind just happened to blow me a little too hard in one direction or another, I’m now pretty thoroughly anticipating seeing where the next two volumes will take the story. And whether the book will wrap up then or continue on as something new or return, bafflingly, to some sort of status quo, I don’t know. By the end of volume 4, things certainly seem pitched toward climax, but who’s to say.[image][This kind of battlemap appears more and more as the story gets cookin’.]That so many seemingly main characters die so frequently is probably a gutsy move on Kuji’s part. It’s a choice that threatens to alienate readers before they have a chance to invest in the plot, when it eventually arrives.[3] Fans of gore and gruesome deaths will probably stick around for long enough, as Kuji seems to delight in finding new ways to kill off sympathetic characters. Even well after the initial formula for each chapter gives way to a more spanning and directed narrative, the creator remains well-pleased to torture, kill, and maim with abandon. A man has molten lead poured into his face. A child has his head torn off by starving wolves. A young girl is hung naked upside-down and her throat slit. A woman has her face punched in with a plate-clad fist. A man is crushed under a heavy gate. Scalding water, boiling oil, firebombs, swords, hammers, sickles. Everybody dies and dies badly. It’s pretty rough.[image][This is not the worst thing that happens to a person in the book]Along with all the violence, the superstructure of Kuji’s women may be off-putting to some readers—or at least present a curiosity. These 14th century Swiss women are often enough stripped of clothing before being murdered, and Kuji draws each of them with tremendously large breasts. As well, they look artificially enhanced (as they do not hang in ways that physics and natural biology would generally allow for). It’s a curious choice and one for which I’d be irresponsible to even begin hunting for motivations—but it can be entirely distracting I guess.   [image][Click image for anatomy lesson]Still for all that, there really is a solid storyline that develops. Wolfsmund is a kind of fan-fictional retelling of the fall a particular garrison in an isolated Swiss pass. It’s a little bit confusing as it takes place on 15 October 1315 and seems to be concerned with the Battle of Margarten, which took place a month later on 15 November. Maybe the current arc is merely prelude for the later battle with Leopold. Whichever the case, Kuji offers an exciting version of the events and gives her characters near superhuman martial prowess. William and Walter Tell are not only expert marksmen, but they can catch themselves on shear rock walls by a couple fingertips on centimeter large outcroppings. A farmgirl’s husband was murdered she and her two servants become experts in a farming-implement-focused combat style that her late husband had developed. Et cetera. There are speedlines and choreographed action out the wazoo—and it’s actually kind of magnificent in its way. [image][She is basically the Princess Bride if Buttercup had stayed on the farm.]Those looking for a staid encounter with the dry history of a bloody, lopsided battle[4] are going to be probably disappointed—such was never Kuji’s aim. Rather, she has put together a brutal, sentimental action-film spectacular. In all honesty, I probably would have preferred the more true-to-canon version of things, but not only do I respect Kuji’s choice, I also have come to pretty thoroughly enjoy it. It’s not by any stretch a perfect work, but especially for one’s first headlining project, she shows an able commitment to her vision. I look forward to seeing how she directs the narrative going forward and my fingers are crossed that she’ll at least spare one or two of the personalities in the book I’ve come to enjoy. Whatever issues I had with the above image of the girl being executed, in all fairness, Kuji absolutely draws the heck out of her face. Check this out. It’s just a gorgeous piece of illustration.[image]_______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) Tidbit for the academically inclined in the text-critical know. While no expert myself, I say author rather than authors because I’ve never actually heard a worthwhile argument in favour of JEDP theory, fascinating as it might be.

There was that one neighbourhood kid in elementary school who I could be quietly mean to while other kids took care of the actual bullying. He was kind of a jerk and he stole stuff from me and I did pee on his bike once. And there was that one kid in high school who was definitely bullied (not by me!) and who I drew an unflattering comic of. He was also pretty much a jerk, but by then I could understand why, so I felt more complicit in his misery when he saw the cartoon in which I depicted him as ugly and obnoxious. So maybe I only contributed to the systemic abuses of these two kids or maybe I was actually bullying—just not alpha bullying.[image][‘Nuff said, I guess]I wasn’t bullied myself. I was merely Not Popular. I was vaguely smart (I actually repped my school in an academic decathalon thing), I was a reader, I liked comics, I didn’t enjoy team sports (even though I was athletic enough), I never had a girlfriend, I had non-negligible acne. I was one of those quiet kids who’s just likable enough to avoid the worst kind of attention. I never got beat up and I don’t think I was ever trash-canned. I mean sure, I got punched in the arm a bit. Lots of charlie horses. I would be kicked from behind while urinating so I’d get pee all over my hands. And shorts. And underwear. So I don’t know, maybe I was bullied. Just a bit. Just a taste.Whatever the case, like many of the unpopular, I grew up to become a full-blown passive-aggressive bastard once I was a young adult. I didn’t talk bad about people behind their backs and I was never violent or physically destructive, but I did make people around me feel like crap. I was tired of not having power but too timid to get it legitimately. So I abused people with off-hand comments and cutting cynicism. I hate the me that was, but that was the me that I was at the time. And struggling to lay that aside after a decade of behaving badly wasn’t easy. So while I wasn’t either mercilessly bullied or a merciless bully, I had enough of a taste of the whole thing to be fully invested in the dilemma presented in A Silent Voice.[image][Sometimes the voice isn’t all *that* silent]Some time ago, I ran into a scanlation of Yoshitoki Oima’s one-shot version of A Silent Voice. It was well-done, touching, sentimental, brutal, and warming. It struck a chord with me through the hazy recollection of my own history with bullies and bullying. Though it was just one of those short comics that you’ll see linked on Reddit or wherever, Oima’s story of the deaf girl and the bully stayed with me—well enough that when I saw a series-long repurposement of the original on Crunchyroll Manga (it is also currently being released in paperback by Kodansha and the translation is better there), I was immediately drawn in. An expansion on the original story seemed too delicious to pass up.Oima’s original ended suddenly and happily, a moment of apology and repentance wiping away all scars. It was sweet and even powerful, but too pat. Like all short stories, it avoided the struggles that longer fiction has the opportunity to explore. With a series, the author would have the space to move beyond the pat answers and trite solutions. And so as a series, A Silent Voice crawls toward restoration with baby steps and miscommunications. And I am loving watching this story unfold. While it hasn’t been published yet, the finale is not in question. This thing is going to end happily. We can chart that from miles away, but it doesn’t matter. I don’t care that the end will be predictable. I’m loving the ride and I’m loving the characters.[image][BIF POW BAM! Hey kids, comics!]A Silent Voice begins with the story of two kids in elementary school—Shoya the reckless, popular kid and Nishimiya the new girl, who is deaf and communicates through writing in a notebook (since nobody knows sign language). Nishimiya’s inability to hear and the problems that crop up as a result are too strange for Shoya and so, leading by example, he creates an environment in which Nishimiya is bullied daily and with extreme prejudice. She is scorned, mocked, and has her hearing aids repeatedly torn from her ears and destroyed. When it eventually becomes too much, the girl’s mother complains and all blame is pushed onto Shoya’s shoulders. From that point forward, he is systematically bullied by his former friends in a manner far more vicious than that with which he instigated against Nishimiya. His resentment against her swells, and he gets into a fistfight with the girl, prompting her mother to remove her from the school. Six years pass and Shoya endures trouble all through elementary school and junior high. Through hindsight and reflection, he finds himself reevaluating those early days, and now as a highschooler, Shoya seeks to have one final, repentant conversation with Nishimiya.And the story moves on from there.[image][When Shoya is older, this is how Oima represents his disassociation with other students.]A Silent Voice is concerned with the transition from sociopathy[1]  1]Non-clinical.]] to empathy. Just as I had to evolve from my early-twenties experience of passive aggression, so does Shoya seek to learn how to melt from his seclusion and inability to relate to others. While the details of his path are different from my own, it’s comforting to see the generalities are not unique to myself. I don’t usually look for representations of myself in the literature I take in, but for whatever reason I appreciate it in this case. Perhaps because I know that Shoya’s story will end happily, it provokes hope for the conclusion to my own story.As a storyteller, Oima is perfectly suited to her task of unveiling A Silent Voice‘s trajectory. Her art is lovely and her framing and perspective dynamic. Her drawings convey a wealth of emotional information. Her elementary school kids look rather like children[2]2]Sadly, artists drawing believable children is a distinct rarity.]] and her highschool-aged versions of the same mature predictably, giving the reading a certain place to hang their hat. I love her art and that will probably be enough to interest me in any other projects she pursues.[image][Voice and communication are overshadowing themes in Oima’s book]If there is one issue with A Silent Voice, it’s in a very particular aspect of the book’s writing. On the main, Oima does a pretty great job managing words and pictures to keep things moving well. The sole piece that causes me a small aggravation is that A Silent Voice‘s characters suffer from the same inability to communicate that plagues the protagonists of so many of the Korean dramas I love so much. Yards of storytelling would be tightened up if only characters would say what they were thinking instead of remaining muzzled or outright lying about their thoughts. Still, at the same time, one of the book’s themes is how Shoya attempts to overcome the communication gulf that Nishimiya’s deafness caused in their elementary school days. So it rather makes sense that even after conquering the sign language gap, the story should continue to explore different barriers to communication. As a final note to how much I enjoy this series, I should say that the final couple paragraphs were written three weeks after the first several. I was in a motorcycle accident the day I intended to post this  and injured my arm. I have been unable to type more than a couple sentences at a time since then. I’m still having a lot of trouble but didn’t want to let the  to languish any longer than necessary. In any case, A Silent Voice was no longer fresh in mind, so I needed to glance at the first chapter to solidify some of the story details for the . Within a few pages I had the information I needed, but before I noticed, I was already nine chapters in. I find Oima’s story that absorbing.

I was perhaps the perfect age for becoming desperately fanatical over the events leading up to Wrestlemania III. It was the perfect combination of soap opera and athleticism. My brother and I would watch WWF matches every Saturday morning. I would come to school the next week and exuberate over what happened, what would happen next, who were good guys, who were bad guys, and who would win the championships. Hulk Hogan, Nikolai Volkoff, George the Animal Steele, Adrian Adonis, the Honky Tonk Man, Billy Jack Haynes, the Junkyard Dog, the Iron Sheik, Hillbilly Jim, Captain Lou Albano, the British Bulldogs, Ricky the Dragon Steamboat, Kamala the Ugandan Headhunter, the Rougeau Brothers, Jake the Snake Roberts, Macho Man Randy Savage. And Andre the Giant. These men were the lords on the earth. They were tremendous figures—though their feuds often seemed concocted even to a seventh-grade me.In March of 1987, Wrestlemania III took place in the Pontiac Silverdome to, apparently, record attendance. For whatever reason, my dad took the cue that we loved wrestling and got us tickets to watch on closed-circuit television along with a packed-out crowd at the Anaheim Convention Center.[1] It was easily the most exciting thing I had experienced up to that point. We roared, we booed, we screamed. The hall was electric with fans who were deeply invested in the stuff. I, personally, was there for the Ricky the Dragon Steamboat vs Macho Man Randy Savage grudge match. I was furious with Savage and needed to see vindication for the injustices[2] he’d earlier perpetrated against Steamboat. And honestly, it was the best wrestling I’d ever seen.[image]The headlining match in which Hulk Hogan was challenged by Andre the Giant was definitely a draw, but it was secondhand snuff by comparison. The problem was that I just didn’t like the Hulkster. He always felt a bit too big for his britches—he and his 24-inch pythons. So when Andre the Giant began feuding with him, I was like, “Good. Take his stupid belt. Devour him.” Really, I probably just wanted Ricky the Dragon Steamboat to take the belt. In any case, I was expecting a good match, just not a fantastic match. But man, we got a fantastic match. And Box Brown’s biography of the Giant spends a fair amount of time on Wrestlemania III and everything Andre did for Hogan in that contest.Here’s the real deal, if you care to see it.http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6k4...I was worried that Brown’s work would have arrived too late for me. After all, my interest in the WWF and wrestling waned sharply after Wrestlemania III. My fandom wouldn’t even survive to Wrestlemania IV. I entirely lost track of all those characters and what they were doing or even whether wrestling still existed.[3] I couldn’t be bothered. It all seemed a bit too infantile to eighth-grade me—an eighth-grade me who was still desperately longing for news of a potential X-Men cartoon that never materialized. Then a couple years later, I saw The Princess Bride for the first time. The movie was released years earlier, but still a kid, I was rather limited in which movies I had access to. And besides, what seventh grade boy really wanted to go see a movie with this for a poster:[image]But at last I saw The Princess Bride, and like everyone else in the world I came to adore Andre the Giant and his rhyming. And yet again, out of sight out of mind. I didn’t hear the news of Andre’s death in 1993 and wouldn’t discover it for another decade. The next time I encountered the man was in Shepard Fairey’s Andre- and They Live-inspired OBEY GIANT campaign. Fairey created the piece in 1994,[4] but I didn’t take notice until 2000. By this point, I still didn’t know of the Giant’s death. All this is to sell you on the fact that I honestly couldn’t be bothered to care about wrestling or wrestlers or the welfare of those persons. It was like how I have no idea what’s up with Richard Adams, author of Watership Down. I just had other things going on. And I didn’t really ever see myself reading a biography of Andre the Giant (or for that matter, a Richard Adams biography either).[image]So when I tell you that I found Brown’s telling of the Giant’s life engaging and enjoyable and illuminating, you can be pretty sure I’m not writing from within the golden glow of nostalgia. Box Brown has composed a portrait of the imposing man’s life that draws together a number of fascinating pieces, illustrating the terror and wonder of Andre’s too-short life (he was six years older than me when he died of his giganticism. If I have one complaint, it’s that I wanted more. Another hundred-and-fifty pages of vignettes of this man’s life. Even though there’s a lot here, the Giant remains an enigma, as much a mystery as you or I.[5]What Brown does well is balance a variety of portraits of the wrestler in such a way that these contrary reports of the man’s actions and demeanor seem less a conflict and more a variegation of a life lived in the depths of unreal struggle. No matter how good and pure Andre may have been (and we want him to be good and pure), no one can stand up under the degree of fear he generated in those around him combined with wealth and power and popularity and come out shiny and clean. That he does so well as he does, remaining loved and remembered by a good number among his friends, is a reminder that despite the faults, he was generally a good-hearted man.[image]Still, those who wish to recall him wholly as the good-natured Fezzig from The Princess Bride may be disappointed with the scuffing to his reputation here. Heavy drinking, womanizing, disinterested and deadbeat fatherhood, and the occasional drunken racial slur (a la Mel Gibson). These are among the nicks on his armour. But interestingly, Andre is such an unreal figure that these very human flaws serve to humanize him.And that’s probably the biggest power of Brown’s toolbox. He visually brings home just how ridiculously large Andre is in comparison to those around him. My wife is miniature set next to me. She is a foot shorter than me and I double her weight. The difference is striking when we stand closely together. I am not a small man. And yet, Andre had nearly a foot-and-a-half on me and was nearly three of me in weight. That would be daunting for anyone to confront. Brown’s work often invokes the term monster—and that’s exactly the sense that his drawings, for all their almost Ware-like simplicity, describe. Andre is monstrous. Yet for all that, Brown remembers to display how human he really is. Was. However we refer to the deceased who are also fictionalized[6] characters in a book.[image]If visually Andre is a monster, Brown is careful to keep his fragility of spirit on display as well. Even in some of the exuberances of his personality (the drinking, the fights, the belligerence), it’s easy to interpret them as reactions from within the social prison his form created for him. Hulk Hogan himself even offers this perspective within the book. We see happy moments, sad moments. Moments from Andre’s perspective, moments from the vantage of his co-workers in the ring. It’s a solid mix and gives meat to the bones of his spirit.[image]Brown plays his storytelling rather straightforward. He jumps from location to location, skipping time liberally to cover forty-six years in a pretty brisk hop. He doesn’t seem to be playing any narrative tricks prompting nuanced or complex readings of the material, which is probably fitting. Andre, for all his mystery, is still a simple and straightforward picture, and anything that would distract from that would likely be a disservice.Probably whatever you remember Andre for, that episode from his life will be represented. The pivotal pericope, however, intersects perfectly with my own experience of the Giant. While we get scenes from Andre’s rise in the wrestling world, his match with boxer Chuck Wepner, and the filming of The Princess Bride, it’s Andre’s title match against Hulk Hogan at Wrestlemania III that occupies the most space and is perhaps most lovingly recounted. And Brown does a great job recreating the details and a kind of play-by-play of the contest while simultaneously providing background and insight into what was going on within the scene. He brought to life something I had once witnessed but didn’t quite apprehend—and that was a lovely thing to come across so many years later.[image]I mentioned earlier that I wished there had been more pages in Brown’s work here. That’s not to suggest that Andre the Giant: Life and Legend is poorly conceived or that it leaves too many strings untangled. Merely, I hoped to describe that my enjoyment of the book was such that I wouldn’t have minded more of the same. I often feel this way about graphic novel biographies. It’s such an easy, fluid means to access the lives of others that these lives can often feel as though they are flitting by too quickly—as if they are underliving their value. I felt this way with Ottaviani and Wicks’ Primates as well. (Though not, curiously, with Ottaviani’s Feynman, which was thick for its short page count and perfectly essayed.) All this is to say that if Box Brown decides to biographize the life of Richard Adams, I would not turn down the opportunity to happily read that one too._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) Where they’ve held Wonder-Con the past couple years.2) Fabricated, sure, but I was only tangentially aware of that back then.3) Pro tip: it did still exist.4) It was repurposed from an earlier campaign, “Andre the Giant Has a Posse,” after Fairey received cease-and-desist notice from Andre the Giant’s trademark owners.[image]5) Though if you’re a regular reader of my s, you may actually know more about me than I now know about Andre the Giant.6) To clarify the point, this is non-fiction. But as in all biography, license is taken for the sake of story. Things are depicted in particular ways.

If I see a movie but am mystified as to what happened in it or what it meant, it’s hardly fair for me to say either that it was great or horrible. I might as well talk about how I felt about the latest Takeshi Miyazawa piece despite the fact that my cataracts[1] make actually seeing the work with any clarity impossible. If I don’t understand the thing, I am entirely incapable of judging its value, its ability to succeed at what it attempts to accomplish.The temptation of the everyday consumer-critic, filling Amazon and Goodreads with 5- and 1-star ratings and more than their share of exclamatories, is to complain that the work was not made accessible enough. If I the reader, viewer, appreciator cannot grasp its meaning, then the creator failed the task of communication. Obviously I’m sympathetic because we all like to imagine we’ve acquired the acumen to properly understand any reasonable thing. Also there does exist the possibility that a particular author, through a mismanagement of storytelling, simply didn’t do it right. Eleanor Catton recently and properly, I think, took aim at this notion:These days, the idea of being a “good reader” or a “good critic” is very much out of fashion—not because we believe that such creatures do not exist, but because we all identify as both. The machine of consumerism is designed to encourage us all to believe that our preferences are significant and self-revealing; that a taste for Coke over Pepsi, or for KFC over McDonald’s, means something about us; that our tastes comprise, in sum, a kind of aggregate expression of our unique selfhood.So while the potential exists that a work fails in its goals and so is confusing, very very often the problem is instead within us—because we imagine ourselves to be wise, intelligent, and critics and our tastes to be objectively Good. Caution, therefore, is merited. And this is especially more often the case when authors show every instinct toward being talented enough to say exactly what they intend to say.[image]I’m going to be up front on something that concerns one of my favourite comics from the last fifteen months: I don’t understand Beautiful Darkness. I loved it, but I don’t get it. Not yet at any rate. Maybe some day. When I’m older, perhaps. Or maybe later this afternoon when everything just suddenly clicks and I’m left wondering how I could have missed something so obvious. But likely, I won’t ever discover the depth of its purpose without some sizable assistance—perhaps some focused conversation with like-minded friends, hashing out details and proposing interpretations.So then how can I justify my rating of this book? If I don’t know what it meant, or even necessarily what happened, can I reasonably tell you that you should read and enjoy this book even as I did? Perhaps not.But all the same, I did enjoy Beautiful Darkness. I was entranced while reading. It held me rapt with its grim and lushly vibrant sense of itself. So instead of justifying why a person should enjoy Vehlmann and Kerascoët’s book, I simply talk about why I did. At least for now, while I fail to understand it.[image]Artistically speaking, Beautiful Darkness is a tremendous exhibition of the illustrative craft. I first encountered Kerascoët’s work in Miss Don’t Touch Me, which was lovely and wild and inspired me to pick up the present book. However grandly I felt toward Kerascoët, reading Beautiful Darkness was revelatory. The artist flits between cartooning and realism deftly. His colours paint a world very much like our own. Warm, cool, sinister, cozy. Just taking a moment to flip though Beautiful Darkness infects the soul with the sense that people are amazing, that wonderful things are afoot. It’s possible that there might be a more visually splendid comic released in 2014, but probably not super likely.The writing is funny, and its Hunger Games-style[2] storyline evolves at brisk enough a pace that readers will never have the opportunity to grow bored. The situations presented are morbid and darkly humourous. I laughed and gaped at several points—a rarity for me.[image]It’s the other aspect of the writing that I can’t be certain about. The part about What Happened. On the surface, it seems pretty straightforward. A young girl dies in the forest and a host of tiny, often grotesque people emerge from her corpse and struggle to survive in the woods. But it really isn’t that simple. There is more there, sometimes under the surface and sometimes squirming on top. I found the publisher’s descriptive text unhelpful and probably actually wrongheaded.Kerascoët’s and Fabien Vehlmann’s unsettling and gorgeous anti-fairy tale is a searing condemnation of our vast capacity for evil writ tiny. Join princess Aurora and her friends as they journey to civilization’s heart of darkness in a bleak allegory about surviving the human experience. The sweet faces and bright leaves of Kerascoët’s delicate watercolors serve to highlight the evil that dwells beneath Vehlmann’s story as pettiness, greed, and jealousy take over. Beautiful Darkness is a harrowing look behind the routine politeness and meaningless kindness of civilized society.None of this reads like someone who actually grokked the work. At least not closely. I may not understand Beautiful Darkness completely, but I do understand that the above reading is incompatible with the text as revealed. Aurora is not a princess. The idea that this is an allegory for human survival against the instinct for societal self-immolation fails to fit the available information. Other s invoke Lord of the Flies (which is fine, I guess) but leave it there with William Golding’s critique of the natural human spirit as being essentially depraved (which is not fine, and actually lessens Beautiful Darkness as a mere derivation of a common observation).I don’t wish to be too contrarian because it’s likely that these readers didn’t understand the book any better than I did.[3] Making too much of something, going for the facile interpretation—it’s an easy trap to fall into when one feels as though they have to say something wise, intelligent, or insightful about a book. I feel that pressure a lot. And I’ve fudged things before as well. So it’s not like I’m blameless. I think I just wished for better criticism because I love this book and want to understand it.[image]I love this book for what it appears to be. I love this book for the promise of what it might be. I love this book in the same way a sixth-grader might have a world-shattering crush on the girl two rows back in World Cultures. She is seen and heard but ultimately only known tangentially. But still, she is a fixation—and adored. That is Beautiful Darkness to me. It’s lovely and amazing and probably the most perfect thing ever created. Just like that girl in sixth grade you never spoke to and whose real identity remains a mystery to this day. Unattainable and foreign: the perfect crush._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) Note: I don’t actually have cataracts. Just a minor and 100% glasses-correctable astigmatism.2) Or Battle Royale if you’re so inclined. I know I am.3) My InterpretationMy guess works well sometimes and less well at others. I think that, likely, these small creatures are miniature incarnations of the many facets of Aurora The Dead Girl’s personality and that Aurora The Little Creature is just one of those facets (and perhaps the one most commonly associated with Aurora The Dead Girl). I think the feral one is probably the facet that represents Aurora’s terror in her demise. And still, barrels-full of questions remain.I don’t understand why they’ve bubbled to the surface. I don’t understand what it means that they eventually weed themselves out until, Highlander-style, there can be only one. I don’t understand how Aurora was to have died (she was surprised by her death but there were no wounds or blood on her corpse). I don’t understand the place of the Man in the story, whether he bears some connection to Aurora The Dead Girl (and hence to Aurora The Little Creature). I don’t understand why Aurora’s body is left to decompose, with the Man so close at hand (certainly he would see or smell her as he passes close enough to nearly step on Aurora The Little Creature). If he killed her, why not hide the body? If he didn’t, why not recover the body? Is Aurora really literally dead at all? Is it significant that the Man has a broken doll? What is the man working on so diligently?...more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,not set,not set,"Nov 20, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17287069-beautiful-darkness

We don’t ju[image]Nostalgia is an incredible force that recapitulates actual experiences into tidy, reframed devices for managing personal histories. We don’t just remember the good times or the bad times. We remember more-and-less the fair, the middlin’, the awkward, and the painful. Nostalgia reorders the priority and timelines and circumstances and focal points of these historical events so that moral lessons emerge. We’re a practical people, and memories that cannot be made useful for the forwarding of one story are either discarded or repurposed to buttress other stories. Our memories get built into useful evidences for any number of propositions. Sometimes these are the straightforward fabrication of value judgments such as Why I Love Parents Of Handicapped Adult Children or The Reason I Know Gay People Are Sinister. Sometimes they play into simple historical repurposements such as Why I Know My Childhood Was A Good One. Nostalgia colours things that happened in such ways, making them both very true and very not true simultaneously. We create and recreate and recreate our pasts, and because we so thoroughly believe in the worlds we craft for ourselves, those worlds, in a very real sense, become more true than the truth of actual happenstance.[1] After all, the histories that are fabricated from the threads of actual experience exert real force in directing our lives in the present—while the actual things as they actually happened mean nothing to us, having been lost to unobserved time.This One Summer is exactly the type of book we might threaten to describe as a distillation of nostalgia. It contains all the proper nostalgic elements—including among other things the recollection of the sort of coming-of-age events that drive maturation and spur consciousness expansion in the entirely non-spiritual sense of transitioning from child to near-adult. The title is even a bit of a gimme. This one summer. We’re hearing about what was. And we’re going to hear about it in a way that will prove at least somewhat consequential. There will be an end, a result, a lesson of some sort. You don’t begin a story by saying, “So, this one summer…” and then present merely a series of unrelated recollections. You’re telling a story about your past and therefore there will be a point. There has to be. You’re breathing life into your nostalgia and setting your creation free for others to love, judge, and interact with. Any story that begins with “This one summer” has to reframe history with a teleological scope—it has to indulge nostalgia.[image]The trick is that the blatant nostalgia-story isn’t really any different from the regular story. Every story we write, even future-fi, is a rebuilding of our pasts, our circumstances, and the stuff that made us. Gattaca drips as much nostalgia as Brighton Beach Memoirs, and The Matrix as much as Cinema Paradiso. It’s because the nature of storytelling is distillation. Whether you begin your yarn with “This one summer…” or “A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away…” you’re performing the same concatenating action, collapsing an entire world of histories into a single pericope. You’re making the big small. All to the end that you might celebrate a particular thing—a moment, a feeling, a person, a sense of being—whether that thing was present in the original happenstance or not. It doesn’t matter. You’re forging a new true thing out of your desire to make that thing known.[2] The important thing, then, is not to recognize a story as being nostalgic (they all are) but to look for what makes this story, the one you’re reading right now, unique._____________We didn’t vacation. Not really. I didn’t grow up in a wealthy family—though I did grow up in a wealthy community. Laguna Beach was a strange combination of Haves and Have Nots: doctors, lawyers, architects, actors on the one hand and artists on the other. Laguna Beach is an artist’s community, hosting three major concurrent art festivals that last the duration of the summer. Laguna Beach is also a Southern Californian beach community, which means wealthy people want to live there. And what wealthy people want, wealthy people get. So I grew up in the midst of friends who vacationed in Park City, Europe, Indonesia. In my family, we tent-camped for a few days at the end of every summer after the Sawdust festival closed (the Sawdust was my family’s major source of income for the year). We’d go to Buckeye Flats in Sequioa National Park. It was pretty sweet but we never stayed long enough to really feel at home. I mean, we weren’t rich or anything.[image]Still, even though we weren’t vacationers in the sense that many of my friends were, we didn’t have it very bad at all. We lived at the beach. Not on the beach, but on a bluff overlooking the beach. It was a community of mobile homes mostly owned by wealthy people as a fourth or fifth property, something they could rent out during the summers and make pretty pennies. People came to my neighbourhood to vacation. They paid through the nose to spend weeks of their summers in the place where my not-remotely-well-to-do family lived every day.[3] I was one of the locals, one of the jaded observers of the vacationing masses. I had my place in the narrative of the Tamakis’ This One Summer—just not the place of its protagonists._____________The Tamaki cousin’s book here sings in a kind of mundane-slash-spectacular way. It’s YA. Young Adult. Young in that its two principals are young enough to wonder whether they’ll grow boobs or not. Young adult in that such a question is a concern. And adult in that the book concerns troubles that are far beyond the everyday anxieties of the average preteen[4]—since most girls with barely a decade to their names aren’t super concerned with such pregnancy-related woes as an unwilling progenitor[5] or miscarriage and the depressive weight that comes along with it. I suppose in the most realistic sense, This One Summer should be termed family-friendly. Yes, it’s got sexual situations and vulgar language, but it’s intimately concerned with family (and mostly women of several ages). The Tamakis here have focused on what makes a family—those that are, those that are to be, and those that will never come about. And there’s a maturity here that I don’t think was necessarily present in their earlier work.[image][I learned today that I never really thought about some of the more confounding issues percolating in the hearts of adopted children.]Years ago, Mariko and Jillian Tamaki produced a lauded work that I wasn’t able to appreciate. Skim was beautifully illustrated but was hampered by too great a reliance on celebrating the youthful indiscretion, absence of perspective, and deep sense of self-involvement common to the North American teenager in her native environment. My  of Skim is not a great . It’s about four years old and I hadn’t yet found the confidence to write about books without slipping into the needlessly volatile. I’m not proud of my writing there, but I will crib from that  to illustrate principally where my issue with Skim lay. There is one singular obstacle facing any author who hopes to present a story featuring realistically portrayed teenagers: teens are uninteresting. Their problems are generally overblown trivialities.[6] Their insights are comically common, with the depth of a drying brook. Their social perception is little better than that of gradeschoolers—and what growth exists is generally diminished by an acute absence of wisdom. It’s good then that most authors diminish the realism of their teenage protagonists for the sake of their story, substituting instead younger versions of their adult selves.Skim's problem for me, then, was that it portrayed a protagonist whom I could actually believe was a teenager. She was a little bit obnoxious, a little bit too self-concerned, a little bit too much like every other teenager you might know. We put up with the awkward teen years because we know full well that they are in the midst of a journey. Teens are mid-range prototypes for the actual people they will one day be. We view children in that range of development with an eye to the end they will one day reach. When we read of Alexander Graham Bell or Jimi Hendrix or Queen Elizabeth or Isaac Newton or Genghis Khan or Harriet Tubman, it’s not their thirteen-year-old selves that we think of, that are important. That would be like focusing on the cocoon instead of the butterfly.[image][This panel is pricelessly cool.]And that’s the tremendous difficulty with books that are about teens and aim for some level of veracity in their depictions. Teenagers in real life have an adult form into which they are evolving (and we keep that in mind while dealing with them). Teenagers in books have no adult state. They only exist for the space of their novel’s page count. Their final form is what we see on the final page of their story. They will not have evolved. They may have had a guiding experience or some coming-of-age moment, but they won’t ever reach the mature end of that shift. We’re stuck with characters locked in an eternal state of immaturity. And so authors that use realistic teens as their primary figures to connect to readers have a huge and daunting task before them—they need to find a way to invest the reader without driving them away. Skim was a young work and the Tamakis didn’t quite succeed in negotiating their protagonist’s repellant nature. With This One Summer, we see ample evidence of narrative growth in the creative team. The book is filled with children in various stages of pubescence and yet never strikes a single false note. There’s too much interesting stuff going on to wallow in the woes of a single character, even if she’s the protagonist. There are times when Rose shows herself a true blue adolescent, but those moments work well against the other characters’ troubles, hopes, and bafflements.I haven’t seen any of the writer’s work between Skim and the present novel, but Mariko Tamaki has here proved herself an able storyteller,[7] weaving narrative threads together and proposing silence in moments where it’s appropriate. Her characters feel believable in a way unrealized in Skim—here there are plausible, evident motives for any given reaction or interaction. The dialogue works as well. Conversation, especially between Rose and Windy, maintains the kind of cracked-whip rhythm that one could hear in any vacation spot. These young women speak in ways that are engaging and enjoyable to read, but never stray into the kind of overheated false notes that make up the patter of, say, A Fault in Our Stars. [image]Jillian Tamaki continues to draw excellent comics. The almost-saving grace of Skim was Tamaki’s phenomenal artwork. She creates lush environments to play setpiece for her wonderful character designs. The same holds true here in This One Summer, only her talents have been seemingly honed and magnified in the years between works.[8] Her layouts are magnificent. Her characters are unique and always identifiable. Her sense of place is beautifully wrought in backgrounds that veer wildly between negative space and abundantly detailed snapshots of the Awago Beach environs. I love love love her art.[9]This One Summer contains masterful writing and masterful illustration certainly, but what does it convey? If, as I suspect, all stories are nostalgic, then what makes this particular story unique? If this is not to be read as some basking in the golden glow of our long-forgotten and longer-remembered youths, then what are the Tamakis circling here? Why do they wish to remind us of what happened this one summer?[image]While their answer might be (and probably would be) far different from my own, I think it essential to recognize This One Summer as an exploration of family, especially through the several women of varying ages who fill the story’s corners. At the center, of course, is Rose—a woman at the cusp, so to speak, of womanhood. She’s about thirteen and is that kind of bundled nerves, ideas, and curiosities that seem to almost universally mark the early teenage experience. She’s ignorant of a lot and wonders about sex, feeling some of the stomach-churning pull that physical attraction can hold for the uninitiated. Simultaneously, she’s protected by that kind of uncompassionate sociopathy that allows one human to hold no empathy for the concerns of others. When a local girl becomes accidentally pregnant by her local boyfriend who does his level best to abandon her via passive aggression, Rose cannot sympathize. The girl, to Rose, is simply a “slut”—and whatever that actually means, she is therefore unworthy of compassion. Rose’s mother is plagued by some acute tragedy, driven into depression and a colourless fatigue. And Rose’s reaction is to feel affronted and personally embittered. And yet there is a hope for Rose[10] because by This One Summer's insistence in portraying women at all ages, we are driven to see that Rose is on a path rather than a fixed point. This One Summer is not her story. It is, instead, one of her stories. It is the smallest part of her story. It’s simply something that happened this one summer when she was not yet an adult and not quite any longer a kid.[image][It’s true Windy. It’s all true.]I was always a local growing up, never the vacationer. But by creating this very good book, the Tamakis have given me the chance to be a tourist, experiencing two things outside my realm of personal context. I have never stayed for weeks at a cottage on a great lake[11] and I have never been a thirteen-year-old woman. I was pleased to spend time with these characters and their disfunctions and their dreams. Enough so that I wouldn’t mind reading Rose’s recollecting, “And the next summer….”_______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) At least until my true experience comes into conflict with your true experience. Then, all bets are off and these recalcitrant experiences will threaten to reforge our true histories into new, truer histories.2) I know I’m using the amorphous term thing a lot here, but bear with me. We’re talking about both generalities and abstracts, and the two aren’t exactly poster boys for accuracy.3) A couple years back, my mother expressed some regrets at how difficult it must have been for us (my brother and I) to grow up poor in the midst of such wealth. Our clothes were not stylish. Our cars were old and used. We didn’t have the awesome toys our friends did. Though I read computer magazines religiously as a kid, I didn’t get my first computer until I was twenty-three. And we didn’t travel.I was a bit surprised at her worry. Thinking about it, I could see how material envy could easily have been a thing for us, but neither my brother or I really felt the lack. I could work, save my money, and get the comics and NES games I wanted, sure. But better than that, I lived at the beach. I could boogie board and skimboard every day after school if I liked. And I did. Despite the occasional reminder that I didn’t have a computer and couldn’t afford snowboarding, I wanted for nothing.4) Or newly minted teen? I had trouble parsing the exact age of the girls. The cover makes them look ten but the inner content makes them a bit older. I suppose I’d guess Rose at about thirteen and Windy at nearbouts of twelve.5) I hesitate to say father as that feels more a vocation than mere seed contributor does.6) Note please that I say generally here. Of course there are those teenagers who deal with more deeply grave obstacles in their lives. They witnessed one parent kill another. They are homeless and caring for siblings. They have had viable threats to their lives. Those teens exist, of course. But those aren’t “teen problems”—those are life problems, things that would devastate even the best of us.7) It may not be fair for me to here presume Mariko Tamaki as the writer and Jillian Tamaki as the artist. The rear flyleaf divides them by occupation in that way, but this book is a collaboration and it’s impossible to know where one contributor’s input begins and the other’s ends—no way to gauge the push-and-pull as the two came to finalize their story. The cover and title page do nothing to give one a position.In any case, fair or not, I’m counting writing tasks as the work of Mariko Tamaki and the artistic bits as the work of Jillian Tamaki. If it helps, just consider this shorthand for the mystery of the book’s genesis.8) I’ve had the pleasure of reading her Super Mutant Academy recently, but that work is strictly lo-fi in its charms. Here, she’s going all out creating Art.9) If I must lodge one caveat that is auxiliary to the story’s content, it’s the cover. For whichever reason, Tamaki draws Rose in a way that makes her look like a nine- or ten-year-old.[image]Because Rose is probably actually around thirteen or so, I found this discordant.]10) And the reader too!11) My wife remarked that it was amusing that until it was finally made explicit I believed Awago Beach was on the ocean—whereas she, correctly, believed it to be a lakeside property. An interesting note on cultural presuppositions and how our contexts govern us. I lived for twenty-seven years on a bluff overlooking the Pacific. She grew up across the American Midwest.

It is lovely and it is baffling. Language is essential and lively and complicated and luster[image]Language is incredible and language is ridiculous. It is lovely and it is baffling. Language is essential and lively and complicated and lusterant and mystifying and intuitive and impossible. The ability of the human creature to communicate from even the earliest age is astounding. That we, without any specially intended training, acquire the ability to make ourselves known and in turn know others is jaw-dropping. That we, no matter how long we persevere, can never perfectly communicate is agonizing. Language is beguiling. We unlock the front door of its mansion so easily as if born to burglary, intimate friends with the sneaking and the thieving by which all hidden treasures must reveal themselves. But that mansion, which we presume to have the run of, soon unveils itself to have improbable rooms and inescapable mazes. We might even amuse ourselves at the irony that those who train the most diligently in the ins, the outs, and the rules of language are most often the people least capable of making use of the stuff. Language is mystery and, as mystery, language is romance.As expression and meaning whirl in the confounding dance of interpretation, every aspect of the tableau is made an essentiality. The words spoken. The dialect and tone with which they are produced. The face from which they come. The posture of the body that holds that face. The environment in which the expression is attempted. The body is a medium and the voice a vehicle. Communication seeks passage through these conveyances—only there are so many obstacles, so many threats to obscure intention and tarnish meaning.A Taste of Chlorine is an evocative treatment of language, of the wonders and woes of the human spirit’s attempt to connect to others of the like. Bastien Vivès seems focused on the elusivity of that connection and the concern that even physical proximity can be alienating if language falters. In Taste of Chlorine, art and design and story conspire to sing a kind of methodical lament, a series of mechanical refrains meant to mirror the repetitive nature of the act of swimming while simultaneously signaling an anthem to the soul who struggles with human connection. [image]And perhaps by ironic accident and perhaps by intention, the reader’s experience of the book struggles against this same wall of misapprehension. Vivès climaxes his book with a silent underwater admission, one character to another. The words are mouthed but the character can’t quite read lips. And I don’t know if Vivès gives his readers the keys to understand or not. I don’t know if the words actually can be made out. Because while I am reading an English translation, the woman whose speech is hushed in the weight of water speaks with French lips and presumably with French words. So whether Vivès intends readers to puzzle out the meaning of her lips, I (and most American readers) will be left stumped and frustrated over the inconclusive nature of a moment fraught with importance.And perhaps that was intentional? But purposed or not, it fits the theme the author glides along. It strikes at how simply we might be distracted from accessing the true meaning of words. A Taste of Chlorine incisively intimates how easy it is for two people to remain foreign to each other—to be shuffled from the path of understanding and hope by little more than a misplaced word and an absence of meaning. This is the story Vivès toys with and his art throughout drives this home.[image]For a work concerned foremost with communication, Vivès spends surprisingly little time on actual dialogue. He lets his art speak for him and for his characters. The story moves through the stealing of glances, the submergence of physiques, and what is revealed above and below the waterline. The artist’s approach to refraction is (to me) novel and largely unprecedented. He is careful and thoughtful in illustrating the physical properties of water—which is important as nearly the entire work occurs in a public pool. When portraying that which exists below the surface, Vivès abandons his inks entirely and relies on borderless colours and the suggestion of shape to delineate form and feature. The world exaggerates underwater, taking on an alien design.[image]Engagingly, Vivès avoids any hard rules in his above water inks, giving even the flat, straight substance of walls and floors and benches a kind of warbling dream state, prompting the sense that even the non-pool scenes occur under water. Readers then find themselves in as much discomfort and unease as Vivès’ nameless protagonist, never being quite at home enough to trust the reliability of the narrative they encounter. Just as we lack the sea-legs required for comfortable interaction with the text, Vivès’ swimmer can never find the words to make himself known or knowable to those with whom he swims. Language is a tricky bastard of a mistress. Vivès hits all the right notes in his exploration here. He doesn’t overwhelm with a regurgitation of theory or pedantry, but his still manages to say plenty. And if you don’t quite understand him? If his ultimate meaning sits just beyond reach? Well, that’s probably just fine. And maybe even by design.A note about the artOne of the things about Vivès’ art that I loved and wanted to highlight is the way he draws form underwater. Check this out:[image]This panel is from below the surface. Vivès completely obliterates his inks and relies wholly on his simple colours to tell the story. The swimmer is pushing off the wall in the moment before launching into her next lap. Her legs are coiled in a mess of diminished flesh tones (what Vivès uses for her skin underwater), but Vivès makes certain we know what’s going on, implying the position of her left leg by having the ankle appear in the foreground where her crotch would be. Additionally, the lights from the pool’s skylight hover above and a man on the edge is partially lit brightly, telling us that his head and shoulders are above the surface.[image]In these two panels we see how Vivès treats the underwater when the camera is above the surface. Normal inks and colours above, no inks and the less-saturated colours below. Additionally, when the viewer’s eye approaches the scene from above the surface, Vivès takes more liberty with the refraction of the body-blobs below. It’s a lovely technique._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]...more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,not set,not set,"Nov 19, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10915080-a-taste-of-chlorine

I had already finished my opener, a minor discussion of the wonder and mystery of language—of how we make ourselves known in the murk of the unknown. And then another book arrived on my doorstep, a package from Amazon UK. I hadn’t been expecting it so soon. It was publisher Jonathan Cape’s latest release from the author of the book I was at that moment ing. The book was Bastien Vivès’ Polina, and all hope of me finishing my Taste of Chlorine  that night was wholly evaporated.[image]In September 2013, I returned from the Small Press Expo galvanized. In the midst of those gathered hundreds of artists and writers who had actually created wonderful and intricate works of comics art and story, I found myself compelled by the need to create one myself. I knew I didn’t have the time or confidence to do anything of real length so I thought I might try putting out a couple mini-comics. And who knows? Maybe that’ll help me better appreciate the form for my s? That’s what I was telling myself. But really, I wanted to build something substantial. Something, perhaps, great. In the back of my head and heart, I wanted to create a full-length graphic novel about classical dancers. Ballerinas, if you will. I have four astounding friends who are professional ballet dancers, scattered around the North American continent. Seeing them work so hard and struggle and succeed and stumble and rise is inspiring. I knew there was a fascinating story there. (I even doodled up some little sample art.)[image]And then, in the middle of September, I saw on Zainab Akhtar’s site a news bulletin alerting readers to the English translation of Bastien Vivès’ Polina, a book concerned with the life of a Russian ballet dancer. Akhtar included some few page samples. I was floored. They were beautiful. I didn’t even have time to be upset that someone had beaten me to my half-formed zygote of a dream. I was too excited. I was only angry to find that the book wouldn’t be released in English until January (and in America, who knows?).[1]My excitement, as should be plain by the fact that I’m foregoing my Taste of Chlorine , was well-justified. I had expected something good. I had even expected something beautiful. I had not, however, expected a work as accomplished and perfect as Polina.[image]The first thing a reader will notice is Vivès’ illustrations. His figures are compositions of gestures, scaffolded together by the merest hint of connection. Thin lines and black blobs of ink dance across the canvas of each panel, outlining a space that I fear to paint too breathlessly. I’m very conscious of myself here and exerting considerable force on my need to wax eloquent in praise of what exactly Vivès does. His artwork is spare and organic. What appears on the page is often either ephemeral or fantastically dense. His layouts and choice of subject feel in every instance to be The Right Choice. He tells his story visually with such great aptitude that I cannot imagine this story being better served by any other illustrator.Sorry, there I go breathless again. I can’t tell the difference between objective praise and subjective adulation anymore, so please forgive me and read that into my .[image]In a book about dancers, perhaps the one great question is how well Vivès captures the flow and sublimity of the human form and the precise gracefulness required of it in the dance. I can’t say whether or not his work comes easily, but because Vivès conveys his subjects’ lithe and supple movement so naturally, his illustrations appear effortless. It helps that his style here is closer to impressionistic than realist; that allows him to focus on exhibiting his intent rather than working counter to purpose by getting lost in details. And while Vivès will occasionally fill his backgrounds with intricated set designs, he still more often provides either no background at all or only the merest fragile skeleton of a setting for his characters. This permits his dancers to float in negative space, buoyed in an elegant frame of nothingness. They are the subjects and they communicate with their bodies even apart from the context of the spaces they would actually be inhabiting. It’s a powerful technique and does much to lend weight to the presence of his actors.Vivès’ story is lively and important—in the sense that any time we follow a child through to adulthood, the movements that carry her along must be of great moment. And nearly every page of Polina works to this end. Every moment is of moment. Every moment is a work of art. [image]At about the halfway point a friend relates a maxim to Polina, a little something that carries him through: “Dance is art. There is no opponent and no partner.” Polina, as Vivès presents her, is herself art. She is in every instance an artistic effort, a creative impulse intended to convey a creative impulse. Her carriage is practiced, her posture intentional. Bojinsky, the imposing figure who instructs Polina from her childhood, reminds that “The audience must see nothing except the emotion you are conveying. If you don’t show them grace and lightness, they will only see effort and strain.” Of her own intention or merely by Vivès fateful hand, Polina’s every appearance is an exploration of her teacher’s admonition. Vivès is intent on pushing tremendous readability into every panel. We know Polina’s thoughts by her look, by her face, by the way her body hangs in the space she occupies. We know her relationship to those around her by Vivès’ use of positioning and body language. [image]In Polina‘s climax, Vivès redirects wholly our perception of things through a few panels in which he temporarily alters a character’s depiction—and in so doing, reveals the facade of so much of what we’ve already seen. It was a bravura moment. Vivès, without fanfare, turns so much of everything on its head and through a simple artistic decision gives the reader a lovely kind of insight into Polina and how her world has been composed. That single juncture of art and story elevated a very strong work to the level of greatness.[2]Concerning realism, I feel as though Polina is nearly entirely believable. I haven’t yet been able to consult my friends to see how much comports to their own experiences, but from what I do know, Vivès keeps our feet firmly planted in the world of dance as it is or may be. There was only a single moment in the book’s final act that felt perhaps a little too contrived, a little too convenient. All the same, I didn’t mind the strange twist of fate described because I found the rest of Vivès’ story so winning, his heroine so fascinating. I was happy for the opportunity to see her involved in a new circumstance, no matter how surprising, simply for the fact that it would give one more window into her soul. Or at least into the art of her existence on the page, specially prepared for the audience Vivès delivers to her.[3][image]Polina is a book about perception and appearance. The world as it is and the world as we see it and the world as we present it. Polina is about beauty and distress. Polina investigates, by charting a small dancer’s path to womanhood, the way the choices we make inform not only our circumstances but the manner in which we see those circumstances. It’s rare to find a tightly woven narrative that simultaneously gives its story the chance to breathe, but Polina does that. Nothing, not even the emptiness, feels as excess. All of it is present for its purpose, but Polina introduces us to the idea that being governed by a fate and destiny (as all stories are) doesn’t have to feel constrictive._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) And yes, I am that entitled sort of reader who demands that every book be continuously and presently available on the off chance that I will want it that week. It kills me to have to wait for wonderful things. I have no patience.2) It’s still very early in 2014, but I’m greatly looking forward to any book this year that is more magnificent or special than Polina.

RomancRomance has always played a large part in my life and been of tremendous importance to me—primarily perhaps because I engage it so vicariously. Romance and romantic ideals have always held themselves at a bit of an arm’s length from both my experiences and my way of expressing my love for others.[image]I didn’t find myself at last involved in a reciprocated romantic relationship until I was twenty-three. I had my first crush when I was six, when I realized that I (in some sense) wanted desperately to take part in the boy-girl lego. Problematically, I was a) almost incurably shy and b) surrounded by love stories. Songs, cinema, novels. The majority all pointed to the exhilarating wonder of falling in love. This constant reminder of what I was missing out on combined with my inability to form social connections with anyone I was remotely interested in. The result was a me who pined incessantly.[1] After a while, and until I grew out of my devastatingly shy faze, my only means to experience Love was through stories, by insinuating myself vicariously into their texture and tapestry.Tragic, I know. And probably a too-common tale for nerds and geeks.[2] [image]So that was the bedrock for my fascination with love stories. When I was young and untried, I adored the easy polish of guileless boy-gets-girl stories like Secret Admirer, Empire Records, and Can’t Hardly Wait. As I grew up (finally), my appreciation tacked toward more intricate and perhaps realistic relationships. By the time Before Sunset rolled around in 2004, I was fully primed for its cocktail of love, bitterness, longing, and irresolution. I had seen its predecessor, Before Sunrise, several years earlier—a classic boy-meets-girl-on-a-train-from-Budapest[3] romance that ends in ambiguity. The film closes in hope and longing; Jesse and Celine meet on a train, wander the streets of Vienna, fall in love a bit, and then go their separate ways. The film’s characters were my age in 1995 when the story took place. I too had wandered old European cities with a girl. I too had experienced the kind of loss and sustained hope that Jesse and Celine would have by the second film.[image]Before Sunset, filmed nine years after Before Sunrise, reunites Jesse and Celine by some whim of destiny and examines what the passage of time can do to a couple in love with no hope of ever seeing each other again. The Before cycle of films is probably my favourite cinematic series by a fair margin, and Before Sunset is my favourite installment. Also by a fair margin. The film hit me where I was at—in a spiritual sense rather in any sort of literal way (my own life and choices did not mirror either of the principle characters). Linklater and his actors explored the depth of suffering and longing that drives people through the distances that separate them. Jesse and Celine could not shake the haunting of their affection for each other but had no reason to believe they could ever find each other again. I felt similarly about a couple women from my own personal history—each of whom I bore abiding affection haunted by irresolution. Both of Linklater’s characters tied themselves to relationships that were stand-ins for what they really wanted. I had done similarly, thinking (often mistakenly) that something was better than nothing. And these two cinematic former lovers, when they meet again for ninety minutes on screen, are filled with exactly all the passion and fury and insecurity and woundedness and longing that you would expect. It’s all at once a lovely and heartbreaking thing. A monument to the heart-shattering power of the human affection for another person.[image][I too react this way every time a Yellow Pages book lands on my porch. Astonishment that these still exist.]Ruto Modan’s The Property, for all the many things it is, most interested me in its exploration of both of the earlier Before movies’ themes through its two female protagonists, grandmother Regina and granddaughter Mica. Modan almost certainly does not actively seek to explore the two films—she may not even be aware of them—but the nature of her characters and their stories puts the Linklater films strongly in mind. The titular property is never quite MacGuffin, but it may be close enough. Whatever the case, the property in question gets twenty-something Mica to visit Warsaw with her grandmother, where she meets a young man. A probably nice young man. The property also gets almost-ninety-year-old Regina to visit the city for the first time since fleeing (while pregnant) under the shadow of the Reich. It’s a visit haunted by memories of the lover she left behind. The property does have its place in both motivating story elements and drawing things to their open-ended conclusion, but this is a story of persons interlocking and intertwining rather than any sort of real-estate thriller.And while Modan crafts an entirely enjoyable story for the younger Mica, it’s in Regina’s life and reaction to Warsaw that The Property was most fascinating to me. Jesse and Celine probe their frustrations and disappointments in Before Sunset, considering what might have been and how time both dissolves what was and erects new burdens (as well as mythologies)—but they’re still young and only what, thirty-one? Regina interacts similarly in her own homecoming—only where Jesse and Celine have decades of potential joys and mistakes ahead of them, Regina at nearly ninety has little time left. She may be spry enough to travel, but illness lurks and too often our elderly are taken by nothing more powerful than the common flu.[4] And that pointed fragility makes a vast difference in the way one will regard their dreams and their future.[image][The circle of life, really. You die, are buried,and become the bed on which new life is conceived!]The two stories, the film and this book, are made different by the weight of years. In Before Sunset Celine says, “Memories are wonderful things, if you don’t have to deal with the past.” She hints at a kind of truth there, but she doesn’t know the full mass of her ideas. At thirty-one, she’s still just a kid. What does she know of the pain of memory, right? Regina, though? Nearing ninety, she’s lived sixty-nine whole years of everything having gone deeply wrong. She’s returning to Warsaw, but not to a happy ending. She’s too old for that kind of bald-faced romance. The city, for all its changes, is filled with memories. Plenty of good ones, plenty of lovely ones, plenty of pleasant and even exultant ones—but every one of those memories is nestled in a blanket of woes. Maybe their light can shine again, but maybe the magnified loss will swallow everything whole instead.Almost (almost) as much as The Property is Regina’s story, it’s Mica’s as well. While Regina’s is some sort of distant, smokey reflection of Before Sunset, Mica’s adventure looks a bit more like the earlier Before Sunrise. While about her business, Mica meets Tomasz, a Ukrainian man serving as a guide to Polish Jews returning to visit the important sites in Warsaw. There is that rapid-fire dance of flirtation, the give-and-take between strangers who test and adventure, never quite knowing their boundaries. The stepping-on of feelings and the making of amends. It’s all rather charming—and almost as if solidifying the Sunrise/Sunset comparison, Modan takes pains to tie Mica’s romance in 2008 to Regina’s in the '30s. The Property weaves its several stories together beautifully, with each meandering freely into another. The project might be ambitious but it’s accomplished so gracefully that one might easily forget that Modan has fabricated her tale. The Property bears none of the contrived earmarks of the common complicatedly plotted narrative and instead reads as a series of events that actually happened—in that meandering sort of molasses that moves and spins the real world.[image]I first encountered Modan’s work in Exit Wounds several years ago. I found the art style lovely and spare but the book left little effect on me. I remember little from it and cannot even remember the sex of its protagonist. The Property, on the other hand, has me arrested. Modan’s illustrations are similarly simple (making it somewhat difficult to pin down Mica’s age), but the work as a whole evokes a sense of beauty I don’t remember from the earlier book. The colouring is gorgeous and some of the scenes will likely stay with me as on-hand examples of what a good story looks like. Additionally, Modan does this cool little bit with Tomasz, who’s writing a graphic novel about the Polish Uprising. His art is beautifully sketched, with a detail intentionally absented from the rest of the story. It reminded me of that episode of Gumby when they find a television and Pokey points out the live-action program playing and exclaims, “Get this, animated people!”[5] It’s a small thing but it adds to the charm of the book and might give us a better clue as to what Mica “really” looks like.[image]We all contribute something extra to whichever books we consume. Experiences, biases, allusions. I cannot read The Property without bringing to mind Linklater’s films. The two stories inform each other. Regina’s and Mica’s stories will always reflect Jesse’s and Celine’s—and vice versa. The connection is inescapable now that it’s there. But for me at least, that’s a good thing. Even as the two creations inform each other, they also serve to elevate each other. And that a work as strong and powerfully devised as Modan’s The Property could be elevated at all is incredible to consider. I would recommend this book as one of the best of the year for pretty much anyone over seventh grade. A fantastic, serious, lively work—one that looks for the human heart and finds it in one of the last places we might expect to find it: in human characters._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) Here is my boy-girl history up until I was twenty-three, the highlights:• First grade. Wondered what it would be like to kiss Christine. She was cute.• Second grade. Laurel was also cute. Feeling conflicted.• Third grade. A new student, Erin. No longer conflicted. Erin Erin Erin.• Fourth grade. Girl sneaks up behind me, covers my eyes, “Guess who?” “I think you’re Heidi because your hands are all rough.” It was Erin. I had never felt Heidi’s hands but guessed they were hers because they didn’t feel warm and soft and I didn’t care for Heidi and imagined her hands would therefore be unpleasing. Pretty much never spoke to Erin again until our ten-year highschool reunion.• Fifth grade. Erin.• Sixth grade. Erin. I have talked to her twice? Get voted Best Eyes. Erin gets voted Best Eyes. We take picture together, arms around each other. I leave room for the Holy Spirit between us. The Holy Spirit and an Indian elephant.[image]• Seventh grade. Kristin insinuates herself into my hopes. I promise myself I will ask her out by year’s end. Every night I go to sleep promising myself, “Tomorrow.”• Eighth grade. Kristin. I have not talked to her once. I do finally ask her to sign my yearbook.• Ninth grade. Amanda from church group sits on my lap in one of those lame bandeau bikinis at summer camp. Am a smitten kitten. Kristin while at school, Amanda outside of school. Never speak again to either.• Tenth grade. Kristin. Haven’t seen Amanda in a year. Still holding out hope.• Rest of highschool. A cocktail of Tracy, Kristin, Mara, Corrine, and others. Any one of which I would happily devote the entire rest of my existence for. In theory.• Age nineteen. Pining for Tracy. Talking to Tory. Talking’s a step in a direction. Willing to settle for less than Tracy (sorry Tory). Still cannot broach boy-girl subject. Mortified and lonely.• Twenty. Amber? I don’t even remember. Her mom hated me. I think she knew I liked her. Probably because I was a full-on creeper who had no idea how to be a normal person.• Twenty-one. More of the same. Petrification.• Twenty-two. Meet Ellen. Senior in high school. So in love. Arrange to hang out with her and friends constantly. In a devastating blow, her best friend asks me to prom and I’m too socially impaired to demur. 1) I’m too old for prom, 2) her friend crushes on me big time, 3) Ellen helps her get ready and I’m just in love with her the whole time and kind of ignoring my prom date. I’m on my first date ever and just mad that I’m with this person I’m on a date with. I’m the worst person alive.• Twenty-three. I tell Ellen how I feel and nearly throw up doing so. I want to die, but it works out okay and we date, get engaged, and fall apart a few years later. Now you know why I looked to love stories for my romantic thrills. I’m so glad twenty-three was two decades ago. 2) I built model rockets as a kid, watched Robotech, read AD&D choose-your-own adventures, lived and breathed The Uncanny X-Men, and listened to Weird Al and Neil Young (and then Christian metal bands, the kind of metal allowed by my mother). You figure out how well I probably fit in with my peers at the time.3) Speaking of, I highly recommend this gorgeous series of timelapses from Budapest, probably my favourite European city: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cbbkj...4) An abiding and important theme throughout is Warsaw-as-cemetery. It’s on the book’s cover. It’s mentioned in the opening pages, and the climax takes place in the grand and sprawling cemetery.5) Gumby: Season 2, Episode 50: ""Lawn Party"" - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W03FL......more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,not set,"Nov 16, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16059656-the-property

The risk isn’t in failure, because art is always going to appeal or not appeal according more to whim of critics and the public than to the objective quality of the work (in the hypothetical world where such a quality even could exist). The risk isn’t in the artist not achieving the heights of creative majesty hoped, because that’s always at stake whether the artist experiments or not. There might be some financial risk involved, but really any artist who wagers the month’s rent on an experimental work is gambling blindly anyway. For my money, the most visceral and real and unblanching risk is that one’s audience might think it’s all a put-on. The trouble with experimentation is that it feels so contrived precisely because it is contrived. Any work that sets out to experiment is one that is by its nature very conscious of how it bends and twists and tweaks and fragments and remolds what is expected. The artist knows what works and what the audience will see coming and consciously does something else in order to surprise or reinvent. The risk is that an audience will not see the experiment as legitimate—that it will be regarded as the artist just being Artsy, as being different wholly for the sake of being different. And so, the biggest risk in experimentation is that the established artist, the artist that an audience has come to rely upon, will suffer a blow to the reputation. If the experiment fails, the artist (depending on the depths of the failure) can no longer be trusted.[1][1] For a cinematic example, refer to M. Night Shyamalan. With Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, he established himself as a director of note. And while The Village and Signs each had their detractors, both films were solid and had some great things going for them. Then he experimented with The Lady in Water, which most viewers didn’t get, didn’t like, or just didn’t cotton to. Some people just chalked it up to a good director having a misfire. “Sure, he had grown a bit self-indulgent, but he’ll bounce back.” Then came The Happening and suddenly his name was a joke and the butt of jokes. His name won’t draw crowds anymore because his experiments were regarded as the artist being too much in love with himself and imagining that he could weave gold out of straw.[image]The trick for the artist, then, is somehow to prevent the viewer from believing that there is a trick going on. When viewers believe they are being snowed, antipathy toward the work and then toward the artist begins to foster. The artist must distract the viewer then—either by wowing through the sheer audacity of the height of experimentation, inviting the viewer to take part in the experiment, or by doing such a great and good job that it doesn’t feel like experimentation at all. There is a third path—and a riskier path, I think. The artist creates a mild experiment, something outside of the established format, and rather than distracting from the experiment or wholeheartedly inviting the viewer to revel in the experiment, the artist tries to justify the new idea within the space created by the idea.[image]This is the path the Immonens take with Russian Olive to Red King, and I’m a bit on the fence with regard to how successful they are. At first blush, the whole thing feels like a bit of a put-on. Maybe not as bad as Anders Nilson’s Monologues for the Coming Plague, but still a bit too self-consciously artsy. But then, after the reader settles down and stops being disappointed that the story couldn’t have unfolded through common, typical forms, little things tend to drop into place. Details here and there. And Maybe, the reader might feel, Maybe this was a success. Not a wild and unrelenting success (I can see many readers remaining unconvinced and frustrated by the book), but just maybe it really does all pull together. As I said, I’m a bit torn on that matter. But ultimately I lean toward the conceit working. Even though I would have preferred a more conventional exploration in that final experimental section. In a moment, I’ll be speaking explicitly about the book’s details, so if you’ve not yet read the book, you may want to leave off there. [image]The only remaining thing I’ll say about the book generally is that during the half of the book when Stuart Immonen is drawing, I believe this is the best work I’ve seen from him since Moving Pictures. He’s an artist whose evolution of line I don’t believe I’ll ever tire of. And now, three petty negatives before I get to why I think Russian Olive to Red King is good and worthwhile and actually really does work and isn’t a put-on at all. The book could have used a bit more attention in the proofing stage. There are a couple typos that got through. A missing word here, a misplaced apostrophe there. For a book printed and packaged in such a lovely fashion, it’s too bad that those little things got through.[image][SH'ES]On a note of personal taste, I had difficulty focusing on the essay section in the end largely because the sans serif font used there was not conducive to reading. Visually, I found it alienating precisely as I believe it was meant to retain my interest. It’s the most human aspect of the book and would have, I think, benefited tremendously from being printed in a serifed type—much like every novel on the market. There’s a reason why literature is not published in sans serif. It’s just too difficult on readers and such is the case here. Or at least was for me.And finally, the book begins with the couple, Olive and Red, in bed with Olive waking and dressing while Red sleeps. Olive does this thing that they do in movies and television where the actress sits up in bed and covers her chest with the blankets. It makes sense in the fairytale worlds of tv and movies where an actress is altogether aware that her actions and state have an audience and she isn’t willing to give a free show for the sake of anything so trite as verisimilitude. But I do not believe in the woman who sleeps naked in bed with a husband or boyfriend but expresses a strange sense of prudish modesty when no one is looking. As well, the language used indicates this is a book for mature readers, so that doesn’t seem to be the reason Olive consciously covers up. It’s possible that this is meant to give the readers the sense that she suffers from some kind of psychological issues, but they aren’t revisited so I’m not sure that’s the reason for it. And I’m not even asking that the book have nude women in it—with the art’s minimal flair, it would be easy to simply not draw in the details or make artful use of shadow. I simply found the incomprehensibility of the act stripped me from involvement in the story while I tried to understand a reason for it. Again, probably petty of me.[image][Would this ever happen? No, it would not.]Okay, so what about why I think the book works? Let’s start with a summary of what actually happens.After a prologue in which we learn that Olive is going away for a work trip, the main story of the book takes place across seven days, each marked by the chapters Roman-ennumerated I–VII. At the end of the first day, Olive’s plane crashes. From this point onward, it’s uncertain whether she’s alive or dead. Both for Red and for the reader. I suspect that she is actually dead for the remainder of the story and that the Olive we see across those seven days is her ghost, still clinging and hanging on to this life. [image]The foremost reason to believe her already dead is the visitation to Red’s apartment in the early hours of Day II. We see Red’s slippers haphazardly resting by his nightstand, while a voice calls, “Red?” We see Olive’s shadow cast through the moonlight. Then Red’s slippers are more neatly arranged and Red wakes saying, “Olive?” Simultaneously enough, Olive wakes in the wreckage. That’s the big clue, the physical alteration of Red’s environment during the Olive visitation (or alternatively, during Red’s dream of Olive’s visitation).[image]Additional clues to Olive’s demise in the crash emerge as the story unveils. Olive wakes with no injury and no pain. She has been unconscious for nearly a full day. The plane crashed not far after sunup on Day I and she wakes near sunup on Day II. Never mind sleeping in a plane with no working heater in the snow for a full day and night. An impact that would leave someone unconscious for nearly twenty-four hours is serious enough that there would almost unquestionably be residual pain and soreness, yet Olive is particular in remarking about the absence of any injury at all.Further, the environment seems magically to have no real effect on her. Stuart Immonen mentions this in an interview. Olive doesn’t sink into the snow like she should and the taiga poses no real obstacle for her travel. And maybe that’s just the magic of storytelling, but it’s also one more evidence toward reading Olive as already dead.[image]With this reading, her actions then seem more interesting, I think. She begins Day II by gathering to herself every earthly thing she can (while quoting Chekhov’s actress Nina speaking about the value of acting). Things she will never need, like a USB cable, lots of keys, lots of pens. She drags it all along in a parachute—a means of preserving one’s life—but eventually across the days that follow, haphazardly leaves things behind. She’s letting go. Even of things that would help her stay warm, if she truly needed to stay warm. On Day IV she leaves behind a red sweater (on Day V Red returns to a store a red sweater that he’d bought for Olive). Finally, she gives up and burns her last ties to this life. Not only is she letting go but she is ready to let go. And ready to stop being lost. She crawls into the dark womb of the cave and from her fetal rest she returns to Red, standing in the street before his apartment, watching for him. She has fulfilled her promise to return, though not in any way that he can apprehend.[image]There are two ways in which I understand the title, Russian Olive to Red King, and this is one of them. Olive moving literally, spiritually to—toward—Red. Her half of the story is a story of journey, of return. She’s the dogs and cat in Homeward Bound—she’s got her own incredible journey to make and she’s plenty talkative despite the solitude. And it may have actually been hope that tied her to her spectral earthly travel. She is given a week to return—a week is the longest Red can hold out hope. In the late hours of Day VI, Red has finally given up (though he is still plaintive). He knows Day VII will arrive too soon with no word. And with the evaporation of Red’s hope, Olive burns her parachute and underscores the truth: “I’m already gone.” [image]And on the seventh day, rest.Red, for his part, is also lost. Only he’s been lost a lot longer. The reason for his distance from the human condition, for his aloof irresponsibility, is a mystery. He’s generally perceived as impenetrable and perhaps unlikable, though Olive seems to value him enough to promise a return. While Olive has to dress in black in order to affect a sense that she is mourning for her life, Red needs no exterior cues. It’s simply presumed by his demeanor.And now he has one more thing to mourn. One more tragedy on top of the mess that his life already was. But he has one more thing to tell Olive. After she abolishes herself within that cave and stands silent for the remainder of the volume, Red tells Olive this final thing. Olive, through her journey back to Red, whether real or imagined, has given Red a gift. She has loosed the dam on his imagination, letting his writing gush over the block that had him stoppered and unproductive. The title’s second meaning: Olive’s gift to Red.And so we get VIII: For Olive. I read this as Red finally producing the essay his editor had been calling about, an essay in the creative non-fictional vein dedicated to Olive. Explaining to her the things he needed her to hear. The things that might have kept her from abandoning him had she known. The mind of the bereft. The one who is left grasps and believes that had their true self been known, their former companion, comrade, lover, spouse, friend, conspirator would have remained. Either from pity or from understanding. To the abandoned, the reason will hardly matter.Red begins by explaining that in what will follow, the reader will not find a satisfactory explanation. Because though we deserve one, that’s really more than we can expect. Likely because our interlocutors too often find themselves unable to come right out with the truths that govern their lives—largely because they have yet to discover themselves, I suspect. And if a person hasn’t yet found out the truths that make up the person whom they really really are, then how can we expect them to be able to succinctly explain themselves? And so we have Red, talking entirely about who he is by talking about everything other than who he is. Despite his reluctance to understand how metaphor relates to truth, he embraces it as if a life preserver.[image]And so, in the manner of the contemporary essay writer, Red elides by cascading through a cacophony of pictures, all meant to unveil himself to she who has ears to hear. (Even if from beyond the grave.) Obituaries, train tracks (both the model kind and the elephant-killing kind), motels, bars, a series of revised confessions, a missing father, missing shoes, an over-talking friend, and an elephant that died over a century ago. They all relate and they all reveal, but never in a way that can satisfy. Certainly not for the voyeur who’s merely glanced in on seven days of Red’s out-of-context life, and probably not even for Olive, who was in some sense dying to hear this testimony.We end with Red remembering an admission that he remembered (at one point) that (at one point) he loved to draw. We’re left with Red exercising the creative self (through writing an essay) and expressing creative ambition (remembering that he loves to draw, to create). Only then we turn the page. We turn the page after Red’s creative deluge, and find the entire time he’s been working an act of destruction, shattering windows. An image of conflict. Compounded by his active care for Olive’s dog, Pasha, a pet he was previously reluctant to care for.It’s a workable conclusion in that it doesn’t take easy ways out. It doesn’t play to formulas or explanations. It feels a little hand-holdy in that Red straight up warns us not to hope for a tidy bow on things, but writers like Red often forget that the rest of us actually do know how real life works, so that feels right as well.[image]If we’re talking about preference, then yes: I would have unquestionably preferred Russian Olive to Red King to have explored its Chapter VIII through a creative use of the comics medium rather than the text-heavy photo-embellished essay the Immonens chose to enlist. I can think of several neat ways they might have accomplished something similar to what they went for. Similar, but not the same. Because the direction they did employ levels Red’s essay as a brutal betrayal of expectation. And it might be that the jarring effect of the book’s abrupt reorientation pushes the reader to re-evaluate Red because maybe we wouldn’t have been able to get that sense of him in any other way. Maybe.I expect this will be a divisive book. Pretentious or artful? Successful experimentation or self-conscious folderol? I lean toward worthwhile—not an unmitigated success, but a much more measured victory (and one that breaks my heart because I’m prone to having my heart broken). But even its worst detractors would probably have to admit, Russian Olive to Red King makes for a peach book club discussion. It may have even been built for that._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,not set,"Nov 13, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25596069-russian-olive-to-red-king

For hours he could not be separated from these dreams, though he wailed piteously in them. They had to do, I think, with the riddle of his existence. In preparation for ing Régis Loisel’s Peter Pan, I thought it necessary to show due diligence by reading J.M. Barrie’s novel, Peter and Wendy. I’m glad I did. Not only is Barrie a fantastic writer with a grand taste for words (and the worlds their interplay can invoke), but I found the opportunity to have my conception of Pan entirely overturned. I, like too many others, have had my entire familiarity with the character dictated by the sanitized Disney product.[1][image]Most of us are familiar with Disney’s penchant for trimming and reframing classic stories into confections made palatable for audiences in the lowest common denoninator (in this particular case, terrified moralists[2]). Under Disney’s pen, Hans Christian Anderson’s littlest mermaid does not lose her tongue, does not walk with excruciating pain, is not tempted to murder, and does not perish in the end. Disney’s Pinocchio does not kill the talking cricket at the beginning of the story. Victor Hugo’s finale doesn’t end in a litany of death with Disney at the helm. The stories of Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Pocahontas, Aladdin—all paved over, gently landscaped, tidied, and made wholesomely presentable by the Disney company. Some of these stories survive their crisp evolution and become their own wonderful selves in a kind of cinematic afterlife. Others, like Peter Pan, fair less well. Not only does the story lose Barrie’s ingenious narration, the chief and principal joy of the book, but Pan’s character and world are eviscerated, losing all of the frightening terrifying heart that makes Barrie’s story so wonder-strikingly perfect. I’m actually somewhat upset at Disney for turning such a work of beauty into the anemic sort of innocuous adventure we find in their Peter Pan. Their version kept me from reading the original for more than three decades.It’s fortunate that I had begun Peter and Wendy before embarking on Loisel’s journey with the character. Had I not, I would have been broadsided entirely by a crass, violent, sexist, and sexual vision of Peter Pan that stands strikingly at odds with Disney’s depiction. I would have chalked the book up as merely yet one more of the revisionist trend of reconceptualizing faerytales into dark, modernized treats for the Cynical Generation.[3] While reframing classic stories to be “more realistic” was cool for a while, it’s been done and redone and overdone so many times that it’s passed well into the realm of cliché by now. Adding to Disney’s sins, they almost had me believing that Loisel’s take on Peter was typically revisionist. But it’s not—not at all. Rather, it’s probably more properly viewed as devotional. It’d be counted fanfiction save for its production value and narrative strength.[image]Loisel’s origin story for Pan susses out so many of the terrible little deviancies that Barrie’s Peter and Wendy coyly includes. Barrie’s story took place in a world of violence and sex and anger and depravity, but Barrie consciously told his tale in a manner fitting for young listeners. It’s a deeply whimsical work, subversive in how baldly it glosses the depravities at stake in Peter’s world. Via Peter and Wendy, we find numerous dark surprises. Peter kills off Lost Boys as they grow too old for his taste. The Redskins are naked save for a decoration of scalps, some belonging to the Pirates, some belonging to Lost Boys, and their chief is so thoroughly overburdened with such decorations that he has difficulty sneaking. Tinker Bell conspires to have Wendy assassinated by a Lost Boy (with an arrow to the chest) and is successful until it is revealed that a bare chance caused the arrow to glance from her heart. Tinker Bell is portrayed as a bit of the sexpot, endowed with a generous bosom and wearing a scant leaf as a dress in order to best show off her figure. The faeries are a randy bunch and given to orgies. Peter has a fondness for meting out mortal violence. Barrie recounts that Peter will come home with stories of great adventures—only in the light of day no body can be found; at other times he will come home with no story at all—yet come daylight, we find a corpse in plain sight. Hook routinely murders his crew members for various slights and perceived slights. In Wendy, John, and Michael’s flight from London to Neverland, the journey is so long that Michael falls asleep and plunges from the air toward death in the waves below; Peter dives and rescues him spectacularly at the last moment, but Wendy suspects that Peter is indifferent to the saving of Michael’s life and wouldn’t have bothered save for the fact that he could look heroic doing it. Neverland drains its inhabitants of their memories and so Wendy and the boys begin to forget their former lives, but Peter, who’s been there longest, has no memory of his former life nor of many other things. Wendy continually must remind Peter of who she is. When Tinker Bell finally dies, Peter quickly forgets that she ever existed. [image]Had I not discovered that this was the character and realm that Loisel needed to build toward, I would not have been able to understand his work for what it is. Loisel’s Peter is not yet the Pan that Barrie would reveal to the world, but he’s on his way—and unlike Barrie, Loisel does not have any reason to hold back the grim clouds inherent in Peter’s tale. Barrie’s story is a gathering of light in a world of profane darkness; Loisel’s is the story that justifies Barrie’s requirement of light. To that end, Loisel crafts a visual narrative that capitalizes on an adult readership—and the grown-ups (parents, uncles, aunts, grandparents, and teachers) who take the time to investigate Loisel’s Peter Pan will find themselves at a place to better understand Barrie’s original, as well as the profound need for Barrie’s steadied voice from within that maelstrom.[4]While Barrie’s Peter is grounded in Edwardian England, this prequel is founded a quarter-century earlier in a Victorian London more reminiscent of the filthy streets of Dickens than the drawing-room comedies of Oscar Wilde. Loisel’s London is dirty and sinister, on the cusp of reeling under the terrible shadow of the Ripper. The city is rife with whores and pedophiles and thieves and drunks. It’s a world of foul deeds and befouled hearts. And it’s here that we first find Peter, not quite fortunate enough to be an orphan. Through six meaty chapters Loisel helps Peter divest himself of his memory, his person, his humanity—all to the end that he might become Barrie’s eternal child-monster. [image][Whimsical vengeance.]As a writer, Loisel’s panels are wordy—in the sense that there are many words—but I’ve never had the aversion to verbose comics that some do. More importantly, Loisel writes an arc for Peter that rarely feels false. We know where Peter’s going to end up but we wonder how the French creator is going to get him from Point A to Point B. And not just from London to Neverland, but from Peter the very human child in despair and poverty to Peter the heartless, innocent child of faeries and whimsy. Loisel is solid in his characterization and in explaining all the bits that Barrie left undemanded and unstated.But as good as Loisel is in his writing, his real talent lies in his illustration. He’s tremendously creative in his sense of framing within panels. Every page is bursting with dynamism and life. London is dark and desaturated, as you can imagine. It looks as filthy as it is in its Victorian heart. Neverland is bright, shockingly colourful, and designed for adventure.[5] [image][What blows me away in this panel is that these mermaids are not just allstandard fish-tailed. One has the bottom half of a shark. Another has thebottom half of a manta ray. I had never considered the remotest possibility of that. Note also: I’ve edited the nipples out of this to make the nudity morecoy and pg-13-ish, Akamatsu-style. For reasons.]Beyond page-and-panel construction and environmental concerns, most readers are going to take notice of Loisel’s character design and figurework. Peter and Hook and Tiger Lily and Tinker Bell and the Redskins and Pirates and faeires and Londoners all are strongly, iconically conceived. Their features are cartoony, but that helps their ability to convey their passions in a way the reader can apprehend even without concern for the texts they nestle up against.There will likely be some objection to Loisel’s depiction of the Black Pirate and the Redskins. Some very understandable objection. The Black Pirate features the horrible visual stereotyping we find in nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century depictions of Africans in Western media, from Little Black Sambo to the native savages in Tintin and Little Nemo. The Redskins of the Piccaninny Tribe are indistinguishable from each other and all look like caricatures of Magua from the Daniel Day Lewis Last of the Mohicans, or maybe leaner meaner versions of Looney Toons’ Injun Joe. Outside their context within the island’s mythology, the figures are, I’d wager, an indefensible outrage from any creator in the last thirty years. [image][image]However, and I say this delicately, I think their offensive nature makes sense within the scope of Neverland and the imaginative fabric from which both Barrie and Loisel cut their cloth. Neverland is, in canon, the product of imaginations. In Barrie, Neverland is fashioned of the dreams of the people who dream it. And, it should be noted, there is not just one Neverland. That which we witness in Peter and Wendy is at least the product of Peter, Wendy, John, Michael, and the Lost Boys.[6] But principally, its details are fashioned by the magic of Peter himself. The land wakes and sleeps upon his comings and goings. In Loisel, I believe we find that Hook’s imaginations and dreams fuel the make-up of Peter’s Neverland as well.Because this Neverland is constructed of the thoughts and beliefs of late-nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Caucasian Londoner children, it seems reasonable to presume that their fantasy conception of what they imagined to be the wild races would appear to resemble the grotesques we find in the literature of the time. Peter would likely have never seen a Native American, so his vision of them would have been strictly limited to the literary depictions of his age. And though he would have almost certainly encountered black men and women, people (not even just children) show an unhealthy resilience to giving up the stereotyped caricatures that fill the racial propaganda of any era. I think it reasonable to conclude Peter’s dreamworld creation of blacks and Native Americans would reflect the adventure serials of his day. Despite the distastefulness of the imagery, I think it speaks to the verity of Loisel’s adaptation.[7]Additionally, the story of Peter Pan has always proved an awkward place for women. Madonnas, mothers, and whores, across the board. In the Neverland conception of things, one can be the gentle-and-soft mother (e.g. Mrs. Darling, the storyteller), the guileless maiden to be rescued (e.g. Tiger Lily), or the seductress (the mermaids). Wendy, confounding Peter consistently throughout the story and ultimately shattering his peace and routine, occupies all three parts, playing the virginal mother who seeks to tempt Peter from Neverland, the fortress of his innocence. Loisel attempts to lay some groundwork for Peter’s method of categorizing and, I think, he does a fair job. The women of London are universally vile, his mother included.[8] He is surrounded by whores and drunks. He longs for female purity but sees adult living as filthy as the lives around him demonstrate it to be. It works for a kind of psychological background for the character, but I’m still debating with myself at how deeply Loisel dips his toe into cliché on this point.[image]Really, one of the best ideas at play in Loisel’s Peter Pan is having Peter travel back and forth between London and Neverland. The terrors of one inform the terrors of the other and the diminishing returns on the pleasures he finds in London reinforce his eventual fate as the eternal boy finding refuge past the second star on the right and straight on ‘til morning. As Peter’s ties to the real world dwindle through death, displacement, and dissipation, he leaves behind a London that is becoming grislier and grislier by the year. Women in increasing numbers lie butchered in the streets from an unknown culprit even as Peter’s fortunes in Neverland rise. His reputation soars on the island and his ability to engage in constant adventure is secured. All the elements are in place for the status quo at which Barrie will find the character twenty years later. The origin is set and Loisel’s work is done.Peter Pan is a book of fervent imaginations and the darkest of doings. It won through my skepticism with astonishing ease. The book is wonderful and horrible and I cannot imagine a more perfect prequel to Barrie’s mythology.“Do you believe?” Peter cried. Many clapped. Some didn’t. A few little beasts hissed.I was hesitant to believe. I was ready to hiss. But I didn’t. Instead, I believed. And I clapped. Loisel won me over. I’m still clapping._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) And in my case, it’s not even the full-fledged Disney product. I made my initial acquaintance with Peter Pan through the Disney storybook record, an album with an attached ten-or-so-page picture book that tracked along with an abbreviated retelling of the movie. That always felt acquaintance enough for me.[image]2) Those who find violence and sexuality and bad opinion to be in that realm of things unconscionable to present for children’s consumption.3) Shoutout to muh peeps.4) Barrie perhaps even gives those of us who are parents to small children a couple recommendary signposts for how to navigate our discussion of the Real World with the small, ingenious, and darting minds in our charge.5) As murderous and sinister as those adventures might be.6) There is evidence of other voices making decisions over Peter’s Neverland (such as when the decisions of a few faithful sleepers and dreamers determine the fate of Tinker Bell in her hour of need). But they seem limited both in number and power.7) If nothing else, it should stand as a reminder to those of us with children that the dishonest bigotries we weave into our own storytelling to the children in our charge can shape their lives in negative ways for years to come.8) And lest Loisel come under charge of misogyny here, it should be pointed out that every adult figure (save one) is reprobate. Peter is sexually harassed by a woman and then pages later nearly raped by a man. And both men and women prompt Peter to expose himself for money, proving the disgusting nature of his social environment en toto....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,not set,not set,"Nov 11, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18005794-peter-pan

Zoomorphized humans (i.e., in these cases, humans made into bipedal animals who act in entirely human ways) have an astonishingly calcified place in the history of “legitimate” comics. I don’t necessarily understand why—save for perhaps by glancing at the pet-owning citizenry out there who do their best to turn their dogs and cats into furry people. It’s obviously a pretty popular side-genre. Disney helped destroy copyright law for all time just to be the only ones ever to be allowed use of a small stable of animalized humans. I’ve never very well understood why particular stories are developed with animalized protagonists. I adore Usagi Yojimbo, but I’ve never quite apprehended why Usagi needed to be a rabbit. I’m not particularly certain that the book wouldn’t still be wonderful if Usagi looked like the average dude from seventh-century Japan. I loved Carl Barks’ Scrooge McDuck as a kid, but I never had any sense that the character was improved by being a duck.[image]I guess I can see how the bizarre-ness of animal protagonists can add to the absurdity of the humour found in something like Krazy Kat or Matt Groening’s Life Is Hell (though The Simpsons pretty solidly proved Groening’s brand could work outside the realm of animalized humans). I can also see how using the unique setting of an animal’s natural environment could give a creator an interesting world to play in (cf. Watership Down and Mouse Guard). Most talking animal comics, however, don’t take advantage of these perks and The Adventures of Leeroy and Popo is almost no exception. Almost.Leeroy is the key figure in this narrative and Popo is his pretty stalwart mate. They’re young twenty-somethings who could be in university, but aren’t. Because they’re really just kind of losers. They smoke blunts, mill about, play Wii, pine after ladies, and exclude losers more socially inept than themselves. They’re not the worst sort of people. They’re not as aggressively obnoxious as Rick, the guy they put minimal effort into avoiding, a grown kid who lives in a garage, stinks, and makes a nest of porn and strip clubs. But they’re a curbslip away from such a fate. Still, they aren’t exactly likable characters—and not likely the kind I’d care to spend a book with. But creator Louis Roskosch happens to do one thing that breaks down my resistance enough for me to hang out with his characters for awhile. He makes them animals.Everyone in Leeroy and Popo is perfectly human except for Leeroy and Popo (and Leeroy’s family, of whom we only see the younger brother Tyrone). Leeroy is a bearish human and Popo is a raptorish human. And these simple alterations to their physical appearance work a tremendous change over the tenor of the book.[1] Leeroy is suddenly softened, and rather than find him repellent my reaction turned to pity. The dissonance of seeing him as a bear allowed me the split-second of distraction needed to slip into his shoes for a moment or two.They weren’t comfortable shoes.[image]I don’t know the reason why Leeroy is the way he is, but I suspect that just as he’s one bad day from becoming Rick, the average kid who isn’t particularly ambitious is a mere trip-slip-and-fall away from becoming Leeroy. If it weren’t for good friends and healthy social connections (and an indomitable will), I might have pretty easily become something in the realm of Leeroy or Popo. Especially in the dire months after my first break-up. (I actually looked probably something not far off from a skinny Leeroy at the time—it’s amazing how much having someone affectionate believe in you can resurrect you into a kind of contented near-coolness.)Being able to spend time with Leeroy and have my revulsion wheeled back for a time allowed me to witness some of the pair’s qualities as well as their more obvious deficits. Leeroy and Popo are good to each other. They need each other. And while they’ve both a bit of the social misfit to them, they each offer the other kindnesses that help to keep them human and valuable—even if sometimes only marginally. Or at least Popo does this for Leeroy. Leeroy’s a bit too self-concerned and made anxious by the crush of love to think about others at just this moment. (Fair enough!)[image][This is one of those pivotal “nosce te ipsum” moments—that will probably pass by entirely unheeded]The Adventures of Leeroy and Popo is, in its brief span of pages, concerned with two friends sitting under the assault of a social world that is, quite frankly, beyond them. And with what will happen when one of them tries to scratch his way out from the dome under which the two have been trapped for so long. As Leeroy takes tentative steps toward living more fully that life he’s carved out for himself and engaging the human society around him, the reader is met with the anxiety that comes with watching anyone take earnest risks. We may cheer his victories and we may mourn his losses, but in the end we’ll only be able to empathize so far as we sense that the two are truly human figures. And somewhat ironically, by making the two into beasts, Roskosch allowed their humanity to shine through for me.If there’s one bit that feels off for me, it’s not the art, which is coloured in a nostalgic palette of bright earths. Instead, I stumbled a bit over the melodramatic typicality of some of the characters. Rick is not just a loser, he’s a massive loser—he’s fat, doesn’t wear clothes that remotely fit, has food stains all over, smells, wears a helmet indoors, and is grossly inappropriate at all times. Cecilia is played as that kind of untrustworthy woman who leads a loser along, all the while only doing so as part of the game between her and another guy. They’re common conventions and they’re of course boring for it, but simultaneously they’re so common that they may stand in for whole stories that readers can simply file away as the background noise that informs the lead characters’ type of existence. In any case, I didn’t appreciate that so much as I might have.[image][Cecelia is, rightly, not amused]Whether their story meets a happy or tragic end is up to reader interpretation and values, but at the least I’d be interested to see where their lives and decisions might take them in at least the immediate future. Will they build on their successes and learn from their failures? Or will they simply sublimate, dragged down by the more nefarious, more deleterious elements of their social sphere? Anyone’s guess at this point, so I hope Roskosch feels moved to continue these characters’ journeys._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) For me at least.

She’s four-and-a-half now and ready for more fantasy-adventure that’s top-of-genre caliber. I read her Bone when she was two (and crossing over into three) and since then, we’ve been pretty hungry for something similarly incredible. We’ve found books to fill in the gaps, of course. She was a sucker for the joie de vivre and wonder of Zita and her Spacegirl derring-do. She gobbled up Avatar: The Last Airbender: The Promise (mostly for sightings of Momo and Appa). She was briefly engaged with Mr. Wuffles and dimly impressed with the dour and mediocre Amulet series. But Bone is the basement-level foundation for all her comics joys. And she wants to read through all nine black-and-white volumes with me again. She keeps suggesting, prodding. And who could resist, really. But I was concerned, needing something to follow Bone up—something with a bit of flash and depth that could keep up the adventure without slack. I don’t want her ever to imagine that Bone will always be the best she’ll find (even if, for a long time, it might be). I needed something that could at least go toe to toe with the giant. So it’s rather nice that The Lost Boy came along when it did.[image]My daughter prefers strong and memorable characters, which is why I haven’t tried Mouse Guard out on her just yet (the mice, for all their distinct little personalities, just don’t stand out enough from each other). She needs Phony Bones and Big Red Dragons and Bartlebys and Rock Jaws. I think she’ll find those in The Lost Boy. While the book’s two or three human protagonists exhibit a kind of character that may be too subtle for her to discern, she’s almost certain to be captivated by the fine-cutting figure of the Baron, a top-hatted cricket who rides atop a former-pet-dog steed. There are other animal amusements to be found as well—Pettibone the squirrel, Plikt the Owl, an army of dapper, well-dressed insects. Et cetera. This is a tale of the woodland kingdoms creeping in to reassert command over the realm so long ago thefted by the avarice of men. It’s an old story, told over and again, one of the most common tropes of the fantasy genre, speaking to human guilt accrued from our sometimes violent domination of the natural realm. It would have been easy for Ruth to have produced something boring, just as ninety-nine percent of fantasy writers tackling the sub-genre have. But apparently, he’s too good for mediocrity.[image][She says that, but really, which one of them isriding command over a beast eight times their own size?]Really, and I mean it, this book is gorgeous and contains a story that is both a kind of lived-in-comfortable as well as sparkling with an intelligence and verve we don’t often see in books of this ilk.[1] To the art, we find in Ruth a masterful, confident creator whose ink-and-wash combination (whether digitally or traditionally achieved) is a visual wonder. In some ways, the work resembles the real-world segments of The Nao of Brown, only with greater detail and less left to the work of Dillon’s kind of sense for colour. While dynamic, Ruth’s illustrations are firmly grounded in a realism that lends the book a gravity that a more cartoony artist would have to compensate for by using other techniques (probably relying too heavily on the writing and dialogue). By proposing realistic crickets and owls and trees and humans, Ruth raises the stakes of his story, allowing us to more easily imagine its events occurring in some suburban neighbourhood within twenty miles of where we sit while reading his book. Also, as a side note: I am deeply deeply envious of Greg Ruth’s abilities. If I were at all the type, I would very likely cry a little tonight after reflecting on the distance between my own talents and Ruth’s.[2][image]The way Ruth unfolds his story is well-conceived. He bounces between the present and the early ‘60s by means of several tapes worth of rediscovered vintage recordings—tapes that hold a peculiar mythos in the town. Like many such fantasy stories, our entry point is a newcomer, someone unfamiliar with lore and legend—someone through whose eyes we might become gently acquainted to the weirdness in store. Through Nate, the newcomer, we encounter an earlier newcomer, Walt, child of the ‘60s.[3] We see that strange things have been afoot and boiling to a head for a long time, decades at the least. And because the rate of a newcomer’s apprehension of the world he’s entered might be a bit slow, we’re also given Tabitha, the townie who’s been on the trail for years and has a pretty stock of files on the case already. The combination of the three characters and their specialties allows Ruth to reveal tale, trials, and consequences at essentially the perfect rate.  All three of the principal child characters are written well and Ruth builds enough meat on their psychological bones that none of their decisions come out of left field or are even at all unpredictable. Even better, for any inadequacies Ruth has built into their characters, each of the three is likable enough that we can pretty easily empathize with their plights. I enjoyed watching them sound out their place in a world whose seams are unstitching at too quick a rate. [image][He found my hand]Though it’s not clear within The Lost Boy and the story comes to a satisfactory (though open-ended) conclusion, Ruth has planned this as a trilogy. Which is heart-warming, actually. That he’ll have the opportunity to expand his mythology and throw his characters into more trials and woes is fantastic news. I was looking for another Bone and while this really isn’t very much like Bone at all, it very much is a delightful fantasy adventure probably aimed at kids but best appreciated by those of us with true grit.And we are chock full of that, man._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) The word “ilk” is only ever used pejoratively and I use it here to signal to the uninformed my general distaste for the fantasy narrative. It wasn’t always the case that distrust was the starting point from which I approached any work of fantasy. When I was younger, I devoured the genre, mining it for gems and turkish delights. It, of course, turned rotten in my mouth—like day-old manna. Since then, I’ve soured on the stuff and have no problem saying: I don’t like fantasy. Reserving the right, of course, to make exceptions for the Good Stuff. Lord of the Rings. Bone. Nausicaä. In any case, I don’t have a whole lot of respect for fantasy (because it doesn’t generally respect its readers) and so when I speak highly here of Ruth’s work, you can be certain that I really do think highly of it.2) Instead, I will merely cross my fingers that my winning personality will help make up for my lack. 3) Ruth uses the trick of the tape recorder’s click to signal that we’re now beginning or concluding our reading in the era from fifty years back, but before we might notice that’s the overt narrative clue, we still get a sense of which era’s which through the use of fashion. Walt and his father have a very Wonder years vibe about them. Nate pretty clearly dresses in the contemporary fashion. Because of this carefulness, we’re never far from knowing where we are in the story’s flashes, backward or forward....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Nov 10, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17265276-the-lost-boy

She said something along the lines of Sure and Yeah and Okay. I haven’t mythologized either my proposal or her reply because nothing ever came of it. Somewhere around a year-and-a-half later, she broke it off and we went our own ways, some of us more reluctantly than others. There was no heat or fire to the self-destruction of our relationship. No fights, no rages, no untempered passions. Instead, our locations, circumstances, goals, dreams, and desires left us quietly alienating from each other. She realized it before I did. We were both, I think, made lonely by worlds that didn’t care for our needs so much as they cared for their own.Maybe that’s the thing that gets in the way of every failed or failing relationship, the inability to find oneself truly at home in the company of another. That alienation leads to a crisp and lonely distance. A distancing, an active if gradual acceleration away from the place we hoped would be our comfort. And so, things fall apart, their gears and cogs made brittle by the frost of hollowed hopes and unfulfilled expectations. Love dies and its acolytes are left benumbed. Aliens in a land of waste and broken dreams. Julie Maroh’s Love Is the Warmest Color is this kind of story, the recollection of the very human inability to sustain oneself in the face of such alien-making forces.The irony is that since being adapted into a relatively controversial film, Julie Maroh’s Blue Is the Warmest Color will unintentionally become exactly the thing its deceased protagonist, Clementine, is wholly destroyed by. Blue is about the struggle for love in the face of alienation—an alienation forged by some of the very things its cinematic form inculcates. And guided by a director’s hand and by confirmation bias, the large number of those who see the film (and perhaps of those who read the book) will mistake its purpose and play into the very influences that in the end ruin Clementine (or, for some reason, Adele in the film).[image]Blue Is the Warmest Color is an alright work that has, at its center, an interesting examination of a common story. Maroh begins with the posthumous narration of Clementine, first through a letter written to her partner-lover Emma, and subsequently through a series of diaries dating back fifteen years into Clementine’s teenage struggle for identity. And identity really is at the crux of all of the book’s ruminations—though plenty of readers won’t get it. Blue's domestic film rating of NC-17 for its long and intimate lesbian sex scenes will have people thinking Blue is about sex.[1] Readers who note how discomforted Clementine’s parents are by the presence of homosexual activity in their daughter’s life may mistake the book for a tract for tolerating sexual preferences—or maybe for an endorsement of homosexuality. Some have described the story as essentially anti-homosexuality, again by way of a bad-faith reading of Blue's direction and purpose.Maroh’s work is not concerned with homosexuality at all. Neither is it about sex. Those elements are present but wholly in service to the book’s goal, a discussion of identity and how identity alienates. In the opening pages, Emma is trying to comfort Clementine’s grieving parents who still regard the lesbian Emma with repulsion and disgust. She speaks the most important line of the entire work, the one about which the whole remainder of the text revolves: “If I had been a guy, Clem would have fallen in love with me anyway.” We can’t be certain if Emma realizes the importance of her words, but by story’s end it becomes clear that Clem has never taken her identity from her sexual preference, if indeed she even has such a thing. Apart from what her parents, her lover, or her friends would have for Clementine, it’s in the nature of where Clem actually finds identity that Blue Is the Warmest Color is essentially concerned. And with the war between her identity and those others would force upon her.[image]It’s always hard to judge an author through a translated work, hard to say anything substantial about Maroh’s gifts as a dialogist or a narratologist. So instead, we’ll talk briefly about the writing of the work as it arrives in English, through the hand of another. It works, I suppose, the words. Clementine’s diary entries are juvenile and overwrought, but that’s who she is, at least at the start.[2] Teenagers, for all their passion and fire, are among the least eloquent participants in the language of adult communication and that really comes across here. So, done accurately if not enjoyably. I had a hard time involving myself in Clem’s early crises because she was just so bad at helping me care. I remember, vaguely, what it was like when I was in highschool and how very important I thought everything going on with me was, so I know why Clem would think in the patterns she does. But the fact that I don’t respect who I was in highschool puts up a significant barrier between Clem and me.[3] In any case, the story and the question it posits about identity are more engaging than any of the verbal writing.[image]Maroh’s artstyle is a kind of Westernized manga-grotesque. It appears amateurish, the kind of things the kids pour their hearts into and post on Tumblr, but that may just be intentional. Her figurework is stiff and gangly, but she makes good use of the elasticity of her character’s faces to convey a wide range of emotional content. While Maroh’s drawing is not yet to my taste, seeming to suffer a lack of confidence, I did appreciate her use of colour throughout to gently inform her storytelling.[image]Despite my hesitancy to recommend the work on the strengths of its art and writing, Blue Is the Warmest Color does valuably investigate the question of who a person is. Rather than simply put together your typical bildungsroman about the sexual exploration of a young lesbian, Maroh gives us the interesting predicament of a non-homosexual woman (sexually involved with a woman) alienated by her social compass’ demand that she be offended by homosexuality and her lover’s demand that she support the homosexual movement. To a lesser degree, the book explores how the identities of both Emma and Clementine’s parents serve to alienate them from Clem’s love. A worthwhile book apart from its problems._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) In France, the film is rated 12 (meaning twelve-year-olds can see the film just fine), playing perfectly into both the American stereotype of the French as libertines and the everywhere stereotype of the Americans as puritanical prudes.

I was whip-smart, sardonic, and had no problems elucidating my every bursting thought with exactitude. I was, for lack of better description, charming. I wouldn’t go quite so far as to say “debonaire,” but really that’s probably just modesty speaking. I dressed well, spoke well, and forged relationships well. With either sex. Didn’t matter. I was basically the stuff. Except for the fact that none of that happened. I was instead probably just about what you were like. I was, for all my smarts, a bit of a moron. Couldn’t properly express myself. Flummoxed and self-concerned around both boys and girls, but unconquerably so around girls. And then throw on top of that the fact that I was, as J.M. Barrie describes children, innocent and heartless.[image]Again, I was probably quite a bit like you. Not because you were a particularly horrible person but simply because budding teens are not very good at being the people they have the potential to be. Junior high is a terribly awkward stage. Our bodies are wrong, being trapped in the uncanny valley betwixt the hopefully adorable child-self and the hopefully awesome adult-self. Limbs jut out here and there in clumsy efforts to rush toward that which we yet aren’t. Breasts leap from the canvas of our bodies. Unwished for erections make tents of our jeans. Strange thatches and patches of hair appear at first as if mirages. New smells collect around us. Bleeding, nighttime ejaculations, hormonal spasmatics. It’s a tough time to be a person. And all these physical oddities combine with the other demands and expectations of growing older to temporarily hobble the psychological state of the young. Stew all this together and you’ll find that people in the age range of twelve-to-fifteen are some of the most difficult, unlikeable people you know.And it’s not like its their fault. It’s understandable. It happens to all of us. I just maybe don’t want to read about such people. So the more realistically a book portrays its young teen protagonists, the more I find myself distanced from any ability to enjoy the work. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was nearly unreadable to me. Harry was so thoroughly unlikeable and whiny and stubborn and blind and conceited because Rowling did a fair job at approximating what a good kid in Harry’s position would be like. I hated nearly every minute with him. It got to the point that I wanted him to lose just so it’d knock some sense into him. I mean, congrats to Rowling on writing a believable fifteen-year-old, but I almost left the book unfinished because of her triumph. So then, I’m glad for what John Allison does in Bad Machinery, a book thoroughly concerned with the lives of budding teens.[image]I’m not even quite sure of the alchemy by which he does it either. Most authors, having recognized that realistic teens are not enjoyable and entertaining teens, ditch the idea of realism and simply write their characters as adults in kid bodies and then strip out the more, quote-unquote, adult habits (drinking, swearing, sexing, stock-trading) from their characters. This leaves their young protagonists free to operate in generally reasonable demeanor and not flip the heck out over what adults might consider trivialities.[1] It’s okay so far as it goes, but always ends up feeling a bit hollow. Allison, somehow, finds a warm place in between whereby his characters can carry on conversations like ridiculous, amusing, witty young adults while simultaneously skirting into realistic interaction with their world. Still, he sometimes draws close enough to the border that I grew uncomfortable or harboured ill feeling toward those characters.[2][image]Bad Machinery is one of those strange Modern Hybrids that we’ve seen rise up with the advent of the web and its associated comics. The series unfolds in the macro sense over a series of mysteries. These arcs resolve themselves under the taxonomy of cases. The first is “The Case of the Team Spirit,” which is followed by “The Case of the Good Boy.” There are currently six completed cases and the seventh looks to be winding down soonish. Within each case however, each page is revealed a day at a time—and in common webcomic fashion, these each resolve in something like a punchline. The story unfolds across these brief punctuations with time and place often shifting dramatically from one page to another. Still, it all keeps together well, and it may be that the promise of a joke or witticism or revelation at the end of each page actually works to spur the reader onward. After all: it’s easy to bookmark a page and let go for the night if you know you’ve got another thirty pages ‘til the next breaking point. Not so easy to let go when there’s a breaking point every page—not enough pressure to stop when it’s only a thirty-second read to get to the next rest area.Allison’s series is the tale of boy detectives. And girl detectives. Youthful detectives, at any rate. They work, sometimes together and sometimes at odds, to solve various mysteries. I didn’t consider it until just now, but I’m pretty sure that every mystery actually does have some sort of supernatural element to it. The reason I may not have noticed this is that even though there’s plot for each of these arcs and you really do want to know how things are going to piece together, the real reason you’re devouring these stories is Allison’s magnificent characters. The kids, who alternate in good measure between realism and wonderful fantasy, are deliciously wrought. Their interaction and distinct personalities mesh so well together that I worry for them as they age, knowing that they’ll eventually all move in their own directions.[3] After all, across the span of six cases, they’ve already aged two years, and now at age fourteen they’re experiencing angsts and mysteries unfathomable to the twelve-year-old’s mind.[image]Allison’s illustrations are fun and fluid and his use of expression sells his characters emotion and tone perfectly well. When Lottie says something, you can hear her words cascade exactly in the manner she intends, all due to Allison’s art. It’s easy to tell he’s been at this for years and years. His style is reminiscent of what Bryan Lee O’Malley employs in Scott Pilgrim and Lost at Sea, only rather than O’Malley’s squat figures, Allison’s are stretched lean—almost perhaps Gorey-esque. In any case, I say reminiscent purposefully. The work reminds but never feels the copycat. It’s pleasing and works for the material.Bad Machinery surprised me. A friend referenced a page on Twitter and I happened to follow the link and said, “Hey, that looks fun.” She said something along the lines of “Holy smokes, yes!” (I’m making things up at this point.) And then she said what I love to hear about anything I’m about to consume: “I envy you.” She was right to say so and I will envy anyone else their virgin experience with the series. That frantic, flustered thirst to plow through the available material as quickly as possible. The laughs, the introduction to Allison’s amusing blend of the wit and wordplay of the best comments from Imgur or Reddit or Twitter or whichever shortform social platform you may prefer. I can’t wait for you to read this. Not so that we can talk about it, you and me—simply because I’m pretty sure you’ll have a grand old time even as I did.[image]_______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) This does have the downside of making their flip-outs seem more calculated and trope-ic.

Those moments did happen and I’d want to drag certain characters away from their foolishness so they could go on to enjoy the glorious future I had in their store.

His investigation develops via an in-narrative couple of high school classes, World-Building and World-Breaking (both introductory courses). World-Building is the province of the idealists and World-Breaking belongs to the cynics. World-Building is the whole output of the creative and imaginative self, in which a builder invests their lives and experiences, everything they are. World-Breaking is merely a set of tricks, illusions by which the cynic might chip away at the value of anything another creates. “Adel’s Return” is a cool chapter in the middle of a cool series and flirts thematically with what I see going on in Cameron Stewart’s Sin Titulo. Serendipitous that I read them in the same week then, right?One of the things about worldbuilding we don’t often recognize is that it’s only tacitly the province of fantasy and sci-fi authors. Tolkien and Bradbury and Dick and Rowling and Martin are only showing us their amateur efforts in their novels. At the end of the day, a world you give a name is a world you’ve written off as one of your lesser creations. The real deals are those worlds that we continue to build and hone and craft across the landscape of our whole lives. We never think to name these because, really, what’s in a name? A cheap taxonomy? A way of excluding all the glorious and vibrant details? A commodification of our imaginative selves? Genuine worldbuilding is the cosmos we create and recreate with every waking experience—and a good number of those that ricochet through the meat of our subconciouses, informing our dreams and learning from the same. Genuine worldbuilding is not Middle Earth or Hogwarts or Westeros or Earthsea or whichever other podunk barely realized fantasy realm we’re so fond of. The real-deal worldbuilding takes place in every moment in the heads of every person across the globe. Billions and billions of worlds being constructed by the minute with a fidelity and complexity never imagined by any of the inhabitants of our favourite published fictions. It’s the unnamed, unpublished fictions that are the real majesties of the human creative spirit—only we’re so velocitized to their presence that we forget how incredible they are.[image]It’s in the connections that you and I forge between ourselves and the objects around us (whether animate or inanimate) that we develop the story of the world. The relationships that we draw up and then (magnificently) prove, whether between human or animal or vegetable or mineral or—most elusive of all—ideological, are fictions we craft to lend credibility to a universe that is plainly beyond the scope of any of our powers to comprehend. And because we are each of us so adept at worldbuilding, at composing a believable circumstance in which the stories of our lives might unravel themselves, we never blink at the suspension of disbelief that goes on when we do simple things like pay for gum in a supermarket line. Or when we attend a class on macroeconomics that we’re merely auditing. Or when we watch a Youtube parody of Peter Jackson’s film adaptation of JRR Tolkien’s published story version of a storyworld that he created long before he refined it for the page. We’re so talented that we would never dream of couching our interaction with the world in terms of suspended disbelief. It’s only when our worldbuilding conflicts with the builded worlds of those around us that we encounter dissonance.[1][image]So yeah, worldbuilding is serious, big-deal stuff. It’s also so completely normal and average that we almost safely ignore it completely and only use the term to describe its lesser cousins, fantasy worldbuilding and science-fiction worldbuilding. Cameron Stewart hints at this not-quite-subterranean sense of world creation in Sin Titulo. That he does so through thoroughly science-fictional terms does little to dilute his comic's exploration of the worlds we craft for ourselves. The book doubles as both a mind-bending, reality-melting thriller and a discussion of what it means to build worlds (in any of its senses).I probably might not have come to think of Stewart’s story in this way had I not sat and puzzled over the purpose of the book’s title, Without Title, sin titulo. What kind of works are the ones that remain untitled? Either the pretentious ones or the ones that seek most baldly to engage the viewer, reader, listener, or audience. Presuming that Stewart’s work is not pretentious (a preference and presumption I’m willing to extend simply for how beautifully composed his artwork is), that means that Stewart wants us to think more about his work than what he’s laid out most plainly in the map of his panels and in the legend found in his bubbles. He hopes his readers will depart from the trail, explore a little, forge a path through the underbrush of his story. I mean, obviously I’m guessing here. But I think the clues are there.[2][image]As the bulk of Stewart’s discussion of worldbuilding occurs in his climactic, expository finale, I’ll demur from speaking too specifically. The author does discuss the difference between worldbuilding and true worldbuilding, founding his argument on a sort of embellishment of the Platonic forms. He posits that the true artist’s concern is with creating reality rather than imitating it. In a way, we could read this as a dismissal of Tolkien-esque worldbuilding and a promotion of the kind of reality-forging that takes place in you and I in every moment. He doesn’t stop there and I’m not sure he or his characters would be entirely comfortable with this reading, but that’s the story within his story that affected me—the story of several characters trying to build realities in which they won’t be sickened by themselves and their weaknesses. A story that somewhat exists as pedagogy, a nudge to the reader toward an existence in which the stories we create for our lives eliminate our weakest selves and one in which our histories are not our fault.It’s a neat trick Stewart devises and it’s well told. I’m not sure how ultimately convincing it is, but I’m also not sure it’s intended to be that kind of a tract. Rather, Stewart leaves breadcrumbs to discussions that will be had outside his work—discussions in critical forums, bookclubs, classrooms, and in the space that exists between spouses and their conversation while driving to dinner on a Sunday evening. Sin Titulo, actually, is almost the perfect bookclub novel. Under two hundred pages, sitting squarely in the John-Warner-coined genre of the white, male fuck-up novel, and fraught and teeming with those kinds of interpretive hooks that lead to high anxiety frenzy and argument in the better bookclubs that dot the national landscape. It’s a book about social anxiety, severed relationships, love and its absence, second chances, and the means to constructing a life that will be, at last, worthwhile and whole. Stewart’s built something rather beautiful (for all its ugly bits) and even if I’m reading it entirely wrongly, I’m happy to be a part of the mythos that it develops.[image]__________I’d never read a book entirely composed by Cameron Stewart, and for all I know this may have been his first solo comics work. Whatever the case, Sin Titulo is a lovely production. The pages, while long and squat, hold bold and thick-lined panels filled with dynamic art—made moreso by the choice to use a taste of burlap for the book’s only shader, earthy and monochromatic. The paneling sits in a uniform four-by-two grid (though here I’ve only reproduced rows of three for legibility reasons, and I don’t wish to spoil any story surprises). Sin Titulo's cover gives up one of its greatest images, the recurrent lone tree, but at a certain point when the motif breaks from format, I found myself caught unguarded by its forceful presence. Again, lovely work.Different readers will appreciate Stewart’s narrative more or less than each other, and probably across a great range. Its twisting nature is of the kind that especially appeals to college-aged men who delight in those mind-blowing what-is-real-anyway stories like The Matrix, Donnie Darko, The Thirteenth Floor, and Dark City.[3] Readers less enamoured with that particular trope may find themselves struggling over whether the narrative earns its conclusion. It’s one of those stories that has a thousand dangling threads twenty pages before its final page and then neatly ties them up with a bunch of people standing around talking exposition. That works within the tradition Stewart’s engaging here, but non-fans could be frustrated by what they might (I think unfairly) categorize as a Scooby-Doo Ending.And at any rate, all this just builds on Sin Titulo's value as a great bookclub choice. Bookclubbers will have tons of fun drinking too much mulled wine and arguing about the book’s titlelessness and which character is the worldbreaker[4] and which girl they ship for poor Alex and whether he deserves anyone. Someone get Oprah on the line.[5][image]_______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) And from there come the frustrations and fights and divorces and murders and wars which comprise the bulk of both our nightly news and our entertainment.2) Plus, I have a double ear infection so all sorts of things make sense that might not otherwise coalesce.

But here, now, days later, that description feels as though it’s made itself at home. I think this is how I’ll likely describe the book in the future. And to those who ask, “But what’s The Arrival?” I will cock my head ever so slightly and with a playful astonishment dancing behind my eyes, I will ask them why they are bothering with talking to me when they still haven’t read one of the most beautiful books ever created. This is not because I refuse to speak to those who haven’t read Shaun Tan’s book. It’s more just a question of why would they would take in the lesser pleasure (my company) when they could be basking in the wonders Tan makes available to the visual sense in The Arrival.Really, I should just keep a copy ready and at hand for such instances. Then I can simply hand it over and say, “No no, I’ll wait,” while they take the fifteen minutes required to read his book. And then, when they look up and breathe out a quiet, holy “Wow,” I will look at them, smile for the second gift I am about to visit upon them in the space of a single evening, and reiterate: “Mr. Wuffles! is like The Arrival, but for kids.” And now those of you who’ve read The Arrival, just think about what that means for a children’s book.These things, children’s books, are a mystery to me. For every gorgeously illustrated Animalia, Snowy Day, or Garden of Abdul Gasazi, there’re piles and piles of eye pollution like the Olivia books. It’s a mystery to me that these eyesores gain popularity when there exist so many sublime works to ignite the imagination and fire the engines of the mind. When it arrived, I worried about which category Mr. Wuffles! would fall into. It came by mail, a gift from my mom to my son for his second birthday. I hadn’t heard of it and so remained aloof to its appearance in our home. That’s no real slight to my mother—when you understand the sheer volume of children’s books that have collected in our home over the last four years, it’s easy to understand my ambivalence. It wasn’t ‘til a couple weeks later that my wife mentioned, “You really ought to take a look at the book your mother sent. You’ll love it. It’s just great.”And it was. It is. She, as usual, was right. Wiesner’s book is beautifully composed—and, it somewhat surprised me, is actually a graphic novel masquerading as a picture book. Perfect territory for our concerns here.[image]The book is largely wordless. Or at least largely English-less. Apart from three instances in which a human addresses the ironically named (and titular) Mr. Wuffles, all dialogue is either animal or alien and is represented by appropriate—though nearly indecipherable—glyphics. While this makes the book an easy read for an illiterate three-year-old, it serves story purposes as well and gives good cause for Wiesner to push his visual narrative to the fore. Mr. Wuffles! is a phenomenal example of how well storytelling can work in the comics medium. The book is short and the plot is tight, but Wiesner includes enough details that the careful reader will see a bountifully full story beyond the simple tale of survival that Mr. Wuffles! first appears to be. My wife was even pointing out cool things that I hadn’t caught on my first read-through.[image]But really, wordlessness and great art alone don’t merit comparison to The Arrival. What earns the distinction in Mr. Wuffles!'s case is the additional joys of both some thematic similarities and the opportunity to see the world from a different angle. In Wiesner’s short work, readers become acquainted with Mr. Wuffles, a bored housecat. Despite the name and occupation, Mr. Wuffles is occupied primarily in the role of vicious, unrelenting antagonist. We are prone to think of cats as capricious and aloof, but not usually as cold-blooded killers.[1] We forget their natures because we are rarely in the position to fear them. The book’s protagonists, however, stand at a height with a nickel. To them Mr. Wuffles is Jurassic Park's velociraptors or Lost's smokemonster, cruel beings of predatory single-mindedness. Watching the prodigal intergalactic visitors interact with the rest of the life indigenous to Mr. Wuffles’ domain is a treat, and to see them draw in upon a solution to their circumstance is a treasure.[image]Really, it’s the details that spark Mr. Wuffles! into the stellarsphere of life beyond mere children’s book or mere graphic novel. This story, for all its brevity, is one of the best efforts in the form I’ve seen this year. Wiesner’s depictions of the cat are superb, rendering the feline with a ravenous fluidity and dangerous agitation. Under his pen, Mr. Wuffles becomes every bit the wild animal that George Clooney’s Mr. Fox longed to be but ultimately found himself unequipped to embrace. Wiesner’s panel-by-panel storytelling is accomplished as well. He dances between splash pages and smaller, more intimate investigations. In my memory, the whole book resembled Walt Simonson’s cataclysmic chapter of The Mighty Thor in which Thor battles the Midgard Serpent. In my recollection, Mr. Wuffles! was a bombastic collection of full-page spreads fraught with a dynamism unseen in children’s picture literature. But returning to the book in preparation for this , I found that Wiesner balances those more dramatic pages with sections of panelwork in which much of the story unfolds. These are filled with detail and will be delicious to the careful reader. Wiesner is a stunning creator and I’m overjoyed to discover that Mr. Wuffles! is not his first book because that means I’ll be able to witness more of his work—and soon._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) Certainly our culture enjoys joking about the villainous nature of cats, but while we outsize even large housecats substantially, we find it hard to remember that they would be as tigers were we only a little closer to their size. Instead, we don’t think it odd in the least that elderly women should have four or five of the creatures roaming their houses....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Nov 09, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17165875-mr-wuffles

Here the reader is recommended to the laughable insignificance of the human endeavor in the face of such grand celestial emptiness. Between these bookends, Brown recounts several dozen autobiographical moments, beautiful in their mundane simplicity. Each of these remembrances strains against both prologue and epilogue, threatening to undo our sense of how little we really are. We are shown, visually and rather powerfully, that we are little more than germs in the universal scope; but then Brown tells us trivial, page-long stories about how things were for him growing up and in his young adulthood. As if, after being shown the lie of human importance, we should care at all.[image]And the thing I most appreciated about A Matter of Life is that this tension seems to be Brown’s point and purpose. The book is overlaid with a sense of cosmic horror that has nothing to do with Lovecraft or his successors. Because of his choice of universal scope at the bookends, there is always a sense of secular numinous haunting even episodes so innocuous as Brown’s toddler son riding atop his shoulders. A Matter of Life is explicitly concerned with the mystery that subsumes the essential experientiality of the human creature in the face of the bright darkness of the extra-terrestrial expanse. Who is man that the universe should be mindful of him? Are we the Nothing that cold reason demands or the Everything that our hearts propose so forcefully through every minute of our lives? And then, what of the immortal, invisible, in light inaccessible? What about God?In many ways, Brown’s episodic memoir is an older man’s version of Craig Thompson’s seminal work. A Matter of Life is kind of like Blankets if you sucked out the vitriol, melodrama, self-importance, prodigy-level artwork, and narrative direction. In place of those gaping holes, let’s inject warmth, a bit of circumspection, a slice of compassion for his religious parents, colour, and a touch of humility.[image][My son did this to me tonight. It hurt a lot]There are a number of similarities between Brown’s and Thompson’s autobiographical avatars in these two books. Both have been alienated from the mainstream, conservative Christian faith of their parents. Both remember some dumb or mean things their parents did or said. Both have left their faith communities and maintain an awkward identity in proximity to those spaces. Both are still concerned with existential mystery and the absence of easy answers. But while Thompson’s is a more majestic and memorable work (and one that will regularly grace Best of Comics lists for foreseeable decades), Brown’s is a warmer, more pleasant experience. Save for a few moments, A Matter of Life will almost certainly prove to be a forgettable work—but that’s okay because it’s enjoyable while it lasts.Part of the trouble (and I use trouble here mostly facetiously) is that where Blankets has a grand story to tell, full of pathos and symbology, Brown’s story isn’t concerned with that. He hops from one dis- or barely-connected story to another. Taken together they weave a tapestry that gives a sense to the tenor of his formative years, but—realistically enough—there is no plot, no climax, no central conflict, and no denouement. Life doesn’t present itself in those structures and so Brown’s story feels honest and forthright.The part of A Matter of Life that struck me most notably when compared to the similarly themed Blankets was the absence of vitriol. I was going to say the markèd absence of vitriol, but then I remembered that there’s no real reason we should expect so much frustrated rage from those who move out of dogmatic ideology into something else—even if that something else is another dogmatic ideology (as often happens[1]). In a world of cool blue reason, we would simply accommodate new information and ideological shifts and go about our business living in new and better (maybe?) ways. But we’re not usually like that. Our beliefs are attached to parts and pieces of our lives, relationships, and histories. Extricating ourselves from the communities that shared our former thought-governing paradigms can be a violent experience. We feel betrayed by those who shaped our former thoughts. They feel betrayed by our dismissal of what they tended so well. Outsiders feel judged by our conclusion that they are mistaken. We feel judged for our conviction that we were wrong. A lot of pain and passion circle these decisions, threatening constantly to devour our goodwill.[image][Do you have jesus in your heart? Like, literally?]I think time may be the best buffer to those hurts. At twenty-five, Craig Thompson was essentially just a kid when he wrote Blankets. For all its wonder and beauty, it reads as a book written by someone fresh from the college years, still on the edge of adulthood. Add a little more than a decade of life and family experience and you’ll arrive at the tone of A Matter of Life. Brown and Thompson were both born in 1975 but Brown’s book was written around 2012 while Thompson’s was conceived beginning in 1999. Brown’s wounds had a full decade of healing while Thompson’s were fresh. Obviously, they are different people with different experiences and different temperaments, but I wonder what Blankets would have looked like had it been written today. It’s possible that it wouldn’t have been as good, that its strength comes from its passion and naïveté.The greatest weakness of Blankets is in its epilogue, when Thompson kind of peters out his narrative into a helpless shrug against the beauty and mystery of the world. He doesn’t know what to make of it and his new life apart from faith doesn’t yet have the vocabulary to articulate his place in the cosmos. Brown, however, isn’t a fresh apostate. He’s worn the identity of the man apart for years now and he’s (mostly[2]) comfortable in that skin. And so, when it comes to the unanswerable question about how he as an insignificant cosmic triviality fits in to a universal machine so grand and powerful and empty as his own, he with humility simply fades his anecdotes to black, allowing them to absorb back into the dark starfield of our ever-expanding universe.[image]A fade to black. A fade to lights. From mundane to mystery, from life to everything else. It’s a good conclusion to a solidly conceived work. It doesn’t satisfy as much as the neatly woven narrative of Blankets, but it isn’t meant to. Thompson’s is a story of anguish where Brown’s is a story of love. Both treat faith and familihood. Both are some measure of autobiography. Both are good uses of the comics form and would be sustained perhaps by no other medium. I partly write this not because I will remember A Matter of Life, but so that I will remember to reread A Matter of Life._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) People are preposterously pendulous!2) One of the more remarkable moments in A Matter of Life for me was when an elderly woman asks the adult Brown if he isn’t a Christian. He hasn’t been associated with his father’s faith in years and generally he depicts himself with a sour face in response to efforts to draw him back into the fold. In this instance, however, Brown looks down at this woman and, with a certain spark of kindness, agrees that he is a faithful Christian and endures her Christianese and wishes her well after helping her cross the street. He wanted her to feel comfortable despite his own discomfort.[image]It shouldn’t be striking to have read that—but since I had Blankets in mind while reading (it is a giant of the medium), I couldn’t help but think how out of place such a scene would have been in Blankets' idiom....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Nov 09, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17591893-a-matter-of-life

While I’ve backpacked a bit in the Yosemite backcountry (up around Hanging Basket at about 3000 meters) and Kings Canyon (over Lemarck Col at nearly 4000 meters), I’ve never actually taken to climbing at all. I had several friends who were into rock climbing out at Joshua Tree, but it just never appealed to me.  Around 2002, I had a roommate who was an honest-to-goodness mountain climber (see End Note 2). He and his partner were aiming to be the first black men to scale the Seven Peaks. Everest was one of those he hadn’t yet tried, but it was on the list. Still, for all that—after seeing all his gear laid out, seeing photos of him cresting the heavens, seeing the charge he got as an expedition approached—I never caught the bug. Not to climb and not to spectate.[image][Lemarck Col. Nearly 13,000 feet. Nothing too strenuous, but beautiful. I backpacked over it in Chuck Taylors. Because I’m a moron.]I probably just needed a narrative. I probably just needed The Summit of the Gods. Because this book. Oh, man. It crawls into your soul. You know that scene in Luke Pearson’s Everything We Miss where the shadow creature wends its way through the guy’s head and neck and pries his mouth open and waggles his tongue so that unbidden he says terrible things to his girlfriend? The Summit of the Gods is similar but instead of playing at cruelty with your words, this thing snakes deep within you, grips your heart’s heart, and ignites your very soul. For the space of my involvement within the pages of Baku and Taniguchi’s mountain-climbing epic, I am wholly theirs—and deeply enamoured with Everest and K2 and whatever other peaks they want to throw at me.[image]I picked up the first two volumes at the 2013 Small Press Expo. I’d hesitated for years to see what was going on in The Summit of the Gods. Despite the involvement of Jirô Taniguchi (probably one of my top ten favourite comics illustrators), the subject matter was inert to me. (As if Cross Game had taught me nothing.) I knew I’d get around to the book eventually, but I wasn’t in any hurry. Still, the pull was undeniable. The book was even name dropped (or close enough to it) in The Elegance of the Hedgehog by the younger of the book’s two narrators as being a proof of loveliness and beauty in the world. Hard to pass up a pitch that good. So when I stopped by Fanfare/Ponent Mon’s table at SPX, I rather easily allowed myself to walk away with books in hand. I cracked the first volume while sitting on the tarmac at DCA waiting for the Naval Yard shooter to stop being a moron. I finished the second volume, heart pounding, well before landing in Orange County—kicking myself for not having purchased volumes three and four as well.I could not have expected this. I was so excited, so thoroughly overwhelmed, that I almost did not want to read anything else for some time after. I didn’t want to pollute the holy sacrosanctity of the experience Baku and Taniguchi provided. Honestly, the two deserve better than me. Book whore that I am, I grimaced in apology and started in on a Nate Powell book I hadn’t yet read. As fantastic as that book was, I was still haunted by Summit. It’s that good. It’s probably even better than that good—which of course doesn’t actually make much sense but is a fitting way to talk about an experience that’s essentially a bound paper embodiment of the inimitable mystery of the human spirit. Words fail and that feels right and just. Maybe we should simply leave it at this: I was affected.[image]While principally interested in a particular climber and his alienating pursuit of an impossible ascent of Everest, Summit of the Gods has more ranging interests as well. In order to build suspense and appreciation, much of the first three volumes of the series is built around the recollections of a handful of climbers as they recount to an interviewer past climbs, records, and disasters. These remembrances are fascinating, thrilling, and haunting. Some of this is heart-racing, life-and-death stuff. Especially invested readers may find themselves slightly exhausted as episodes close and the narrative moves to the next foundational piece ofSummit's puzzle.[image]Jirô Taniguchi is the ideal artist for this work. His unparalleled ability to communicate the grandeur of an environment turns these several-inch illustrations of various peaks and ice formations into awe-striking glimpses of a world that dwarfs our own. New York City is a teaming hive of the wonder of the human creature, an ode to the potential of the species. Everest, Mont Blanc, K2, Elbrus. Though ants in the form of men do rarely light across their surfaces, these massifs and mountains and tremendous stone faces ridicule human achievement by their immensity—and Taniguchi brings that home. His sense of scale comes through seamlessly, due in part to his intricate linework and in part to his choice of panel sizes. These eruptions scraping from earth to the heavens, by Taniguchi’s pen, are as much characters as the climbers themselves. I believe the work would be lesser in any other hands.[image]Baku, for his part adapts the novel into an abrupt and jaggedly paced thriller. However that sounds, it’s a good thing. I’m not familiar with the original prose work, but I cannot believe it could be more delicious, more exciting, more nerve-trilling than these present collections. The fourth volume is due on American shores next week and I will abandon all responsibilities to read it as soon as I can, dooming myself to an excruciating wait ‘til next year when the final volume emerges to coincide with the 90th anniversary of Mallory and Irvine’s disappearance.[1]There are not many books that I will recommend as strenuously as I will Summit of the Gods. No really. You need to read this. You need to read this so badly that I will shake you like you’re not supposed to shake a baby if you don’t read this. I don’t care that that probably doesn’t make any sense because it still makes more sense than you not reading Summit of the Gods. I’m serious: read Summit of the Gods. Things will be shaken otherwise.[image]A Note #1This is hardly worth mentioning, but everytime my eye caught one, I’d be bothered. I’m not sure of the origin, but I’d guess that in the raw files given to Fanfare/Ponent Mon, there was some Japanese text overlaying the art, which had to be scrubbed from the English-language version. To do so, some cloning was done. Generally, it’s pretty fair, but in some cases it’s too obvious. The below is one of those cases:[image][image]Of course, the reason is just speculation on my part. It could be something that occurred on the Japanese side—the correction of some error or other before the pages ever arrived in Britain for English-language adaptation. Whatever the case, it doesn’t occur often, but it is present more often than I’d like. Most people will likely never notice it.A Note #2This is my old roommate atop the summit of Elbrus, the tallest peak in Russia.[image][Elliot Boston III on Elbrus]I lost touch with him about a decade ago so I don’t know how he’s fairing in his quest to summit those seven peaks.

The first was not so much a discovery, because though I had not yet read Summit of the Gods, I have been very familiar with Jiro Taniguchi’s work. He’s been one of my favourite comics creators since 2004 when I first had the pleasure of encountering The Walking Man. So really, it was merely a matter of time before I took on Taniguchi’s five-volume mountain-climbing series. My other discovery is something in the realm of Discovery Proper. If I hadn’t encountered her table at the convention last week, I can’t imagine another circumstance in which I would have been introduced to Caitlin Cass or her wonderful evolving creation, Great Moments in Western Civilization.I’ve always had a bit of a taste for the historical. While it’s true that I don’t often anymore[1]  1]When I was a younger Hahne, perhaps in my early twenties, I actively pursued reading historical nonfiction. With the introduction of more interests, more adult responsibilities, and more beautiful family members to engage my time, many of my interests were forced to wane.]] have the patience to read lengthy historical texts that aren’t also written by Eric Larson, I still take interest in works that refer to historical moments, events, and figures. I adore Umberto Eco’s historically-minded works like Foucault’s Pendulum and Baudolino. Kate Beaton’s Hark! A Vagrant is a delicious excursion into the foundations of our historical and literary tapestry. And because of the time constraints on my life currently, brief reminders of the building blocks of our cultural milleu in the form of comics are truly delectable. Which is where Caitlin Cass’ Great Moments in Western Civilization and its Postal Constituent comes in.Cass’ table at SPX was one of the first I saw, and I spent the rest of the expo telling people, Omigosh I’m so excited about Great Moments in… Something! You have to check it out. It’s over there near the end of one of the aisles! I wasn’t the best salesman. People definitely knew I was excited about something but it probably wasn’t entirely clear what it was or where this Thing could be found. Let’s rectify that here.[image][I’m not as creepy as you might imagine.This pic of Cass screening covers for the Index is straight from the top page of her blog]Great Moments in Western Civilization is foremost a by-mail program, the Postal Constituent, through which Cass delivers screen-printed artifacts of various sizes and contents. Many of these pieces are smallish mini-comics in the common-to-find pamphlet form. Others are foldable brochures. At least one held a set of art cards (on a perforated sheet) dedicated to favourite literary figures and their vices. Another was a phenomenal piece devoted to the library of Alexandria and took the form of a compacted papercraft whose story would unfold even as the sheet was unfolded in proper order. Just for fun, I drew out the steps:[image][If this doesn’t make sense, then good. Buy her book and see it for yourself.]Though the series primarily exists as a collection of individual physical objects, Cass does offer a single volume collecting what I gather are highlights from the first five years of the comic. This was my first taste of the work. Since then, and probably among other bits and pieces, Cass has been organizing a series (her first) called The Index, in which a couple of characters attempt somehow to taxonomize and tie together the entirety of recorded human history. These can be ordered from her site, where subscriptions are also available.Great Moments is one of those works (like Beaton’s more famous line) that fits shoes of both educational and humourous makes. The jokes (when there are jokes) are going to be funnier if you’re familiar with the figures skewered and their historical contributions and significance, but they also function as an easy invitation to discover some interesting personalities through the responsible extra-curricular use of Google. Or Bing if you’re so inclined. We won’t judge. The humour is a bit wry and arch and is entirely in line with my own comedic preferences.[image]Visually, each of Cass’ postal-born pieces has a rough-but-classic sort of feel to it. I know, right? So helpful a description. I’m not really super sure of the terminology to use for the style, but it looks familiar. A bit Gorey-esque. One of my favourite things beside the creative ingenuity by which Cass develops the comic is the ramshackle hand-lettering, also a bit Gorey-esque. The mutating, resizing, and bold typefaces she often hand-scrawls give the comics a comfortable sense of place, as if these were stories your talented cousin developed for you and some select relatives as gifts one Christmas, in lieu of crassly commercialized plastic extrusions.[2] Simultaneously they’re a bit creepy, giving you the sense that maybe there’s something not quite right about this whole venture called History.[image]I’m stoked to have noticed Cass’ table at SPX. It somewhat resembled the patchwork nature of the work and drew me in immediately. For all lovers of the historical, I highly recommend investigating her project. Maybe order the retrospective volume, In the Beginning. Maybe subscribe to the Postal Constituent, as I will be doing with the next of my discretionary income. The idea of having these mementos, these artifacts, these Things arriving occasionally in my postbox or at my doorstep is an excitement I haven’t felt for mail in at least a couple decades. At least._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) When I was a younger Hahne, perhaps in my early twenties, I actively pursued reading historical nonfiction.

The unraveling of prejudices. The low-level epiphany on which my emerging hope for humanity is fastened. And it’s all just a sham, really. Approaching an unread book and believing it to be anything other than an undiscovered experience is an unhappy arrogance common to too many of us. I loathe the presumption that assigns the value of a book before even cracking its cover. And I loathe still more the fact that I am far from immune to such biases.Frequently I will neglect a book on my shelf or in my stacks because some element of its self conjures negativity in my appraisal. Maybe the cover, for all clichéd admonitions, spurs judgment. Maybe the publisher’s summary falls flat. Maybe the creator’s prior work has not ignited my appreciation. Maybe, as in the case of Helter Skelter, flipping through the book’s pages has revealed an art style I’m not in love with.These reasons are of course inadequate—hollow rationalizations designed by a faulty mind to the end that my life should be less exciting, less challenging, and less enjoyable. Because that is the historically documented trouble with the human mind: we believe it to be looking out for us and concerned with our well-being, when some approximation of the opposite is true. Really, just look at the boyfriends, girlfriends, wives, and husbands your friends have elected to spend their time with. In many case, just terrible choices that no rational mind would entertain. And then look at the way your friends self-saboutage within these relationships, as if pain and hurt and misery were Olympic events and each one of us were somehow representing our nation before the world. Hence the proliferation of psychology degrees, family and marriage counseling, psychiatric medicine, and the easy availability of massive quantities of booze. All because we somehow know that our minds are out to get us and we hope to at least make it a challenge as we go down in flames. To that end, I read books I don’t expect I’ll like. Books like Helter Skelter. Because I’m used to my brain lying to me and this is just my little way of giving it the finger and saying,  “You’re not the boss of me!”[image]And when I close the back cover of a book like Helter Skelter, having read its last page, and sit exulting in an example of why it is that books exist, I may smugly revel in having stuck it to my brain one more time. Because, wow. This was worth my time. Wholly contrary to my expectations, this was worth my time.The book is smarter than I’d originally guessed and incisively chronicles a made woman in the world of cheap celebrity. Liliko is a model, a top model, and her life is built of the kinds of experiences and fabrications you’d expect—and a whole hill of those you wouldn’t. She’s undergone science-fiction levels of plastic surgery to become a Frankenstein’s monster of beauty. It’s said that the only bits of her that remain in this new version of her are: 1) her hair, 2) her eyes, and 3) some unspecified portion of her genitals. And of course, she has a complex. It’d be hard not to.[image]Helter Skelter tells a tale reminiscent of Sunset Boulevard (and even straight-up references the Billy Wilder film) and prescient of Moyocco Anno’s Sakuran. Actually, it probably plays avatar for the million other stories about women whose usefulness is predicated on their sexual beauty and the desperation with which they fear the abolition of such a temporary celebrity. Not only do such heroes of the popular culture have to contend with the constant fickleness of a populace whose tastes bend and twist on a dime, but terror of the inconstancy of the masses is bolstered by the model’s knowledge that age weathers all and that she only ever had a dwindling, minuscule shelf-life. In Liliko’s case, her terror is accelerated by a brute fact of the procedures she used to mold her body into a physical perfection—while drugs and treatments may temporarily slow the degradation, her flesh will begin eroding at a terrifying rate. And more than just aging dramatically, women who’ve undergone similar treatments show seeping lesions, deep bruises, and corrosion of the material beneath the flesh. These women become monsters, and monstrosity is Liliko’s certain future—so she’ll see if she can’t get a jump start on it.It’s a lunatic ride.[image]Okazaki’s art, which originally turned me off when I flipped through the book, is rough and exaggerated. In some ways, it conjures perhaps a prototypical Natsume Ono and is some kind of kin to the grotesque. I’m not familiar enough with the style to give it a name, but it does lack the polish I generally hope for in my comics. That said, it works beautifully. Even before the conclusion of the first chapter, I was wholly onboard and saw Okazaki’s illustrations as essential to the maddening story being told. The art allowed me to disassociate Liliko’s story from titillation. The model spends much of the story undressed literally so that we might discover her undressed figuratively. Eroticism would have been a distraction, for we aren’t meant to take in Liliko’s story with her as object of our lust or arousal; rather, we are to find her life and person and actions and predilections harrowing. The grotesqueries of Okazaki’s art allows that to unfold and eliminates the potential of clouding that message with the guilt of objectification.[image]A helter skelter is an amusement slide that spirals downward around a central tower. Riders would climb a stairwell within the tower to height, after which they would begin their quick descent. An apt, if obvious, metaphor for Liliko’s life, career, and probably sanity. If the title wasn’t enough, in the concluding pages, the Beatles song of the same name plays, perhaps as warning to all who would follow Liliko’s path. Helter Skelter is a hard book, one that confronts the various cowardices that consumers in our cultures nurture and enjoy. It’s about the life and death of souls and how these two things co-mingle within us as we play heroes and villains by the things we buy, the people we laud, the shows we watch, and the clothes we wear. Helter Skelter is an older work, but smart enough that it will likely feel contemporary even forty years from now._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Nov 06, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16169876-helter-skelter

For many of us, the best way to understand people who are different from us or other than us is not through dry academic description—much better to feel the life of another person as if you were intimately concerned with their fortunes. Representative John Lewis, Andrew Aydin, and Nate Powell have succeeded tremendously in bringing a particular milieu of the middle of the twentieth century to a point of contact with the soul of the reader.I did not grow up caring about the black civil rights movement. It was a distant thing. Like the Holocaust or Vietnam. Like trust-busting, flagpole-sitting, and chimney sweeps. I grew up on the beach in South Orange County across the ‘80s. I was so deep into white privilege that I wasn’t aware that racism was still a thing. Maybe in pockets in the South where all the backwards people lived. Again, a million miles away.I had grown into a social ideology in which Colour Blindness was the ultimate expression of love one for another. It was what we were to evolve toward in our path to moral social perfection. I didn’t really think of people in terms of their ethnicities or ancestries. Unless they had an accent. But then, there wasn’t a lot of opportunity to practice interaction. White was the ninety-plus percent majority of my highschool. A handful of Latinos, some Asians, and like four black kids. There was, I think, also a French girl. She was more alien than any non-whites in our midst. I treated the black kids I knew identically to how I treated the white kids I knew. They were just friends or acquaintances or enemies like any other kid. So far as I knew, racism was a virulence that was choked out fifty years earlier.[image]Kids are terrible at simple math when it comes to measuring time. They also aren’t great at putting themselves in other shoes.I never once asked myself or my friends: Hey, what’s it like to be the only dark face in a sea of blotchy pinks? I knew what it was like to be an outsider. Coming from a lower middle class family that struggled to meet ends, I knew what it was like to be an alien in what was and still is a ridiculously wealthy community. Having pretty bad acne, I knew what it was like to be uncomfortable in my own skin. Being a deeply shy introvert, I knew what it was like to have a lot of trouble socializing. Pursuing an avid comics readership, I knew what it was like to be ostracized for awkward tastes. I knew deep enough within my soul that it informed my every public action—I knew what it was like to be different. And yet I never once considered the lives and circumstances and histories of these non-whites in our midst. I was naive and careless enough to think that just treating people as I (an individual with my own life and circumstance and history) would wish to be treated was enough.[image]And that’s why I never really bothered to care about the civil rights marches, the laws, the continued biases, the presence of deep-seated racial biases in our film and television entertainments. And even if I was old enough to understand what institutionalized racism meant, I wouldn’t have been able to see it or care. It wasn’t until years later, at the tutelage of a fifteen-minute clip from the beginning of Mississippi Burning that any of that began to creep in. If I had read a book like March in my comics-steeped junior high and highschool days, I would have gotten a headstart on a journey I’m still stumbling down—a journey to love each person in the best way possible according to the contexts that are unique to their individual lives.I was looking forward to March wholly on the involvement of Nate Powell. I was aware that Congressman Lewis was involved and that at least in some respect this was his story. I hadn’t read any Lewis and was unfamiliar with his career (my disappointment with American politics is so total that I don’t even know[1]  1]Perhaps shamefully, perhaps not.]] who my state’s representatives are) and I was unfamiliar with the co-writer, Andrew Aydin. But Nate Powell I will follow to world’s end.[image]And Powell, as usual, is on fire here. His art—both the staging and the linework itself—is perfect. A co-worker who doesn’t read comics walked by as I had the volume open and without knowing what I was looking at remarked: “That’s beautiful.” He was right. The book is printed in black and white, with grey washes for shading, and the work is great. The desaturation evokes old television or photography and moves the reader into the past. The washes give the illustrations an easy flow and blend, helping the reader wade into an atmosphere and time to which many would otherwise struggle to adjust. Powell draws us into John Lewis’ story—into his life—without effort.[2]2]Or so it seems. Powell is so on top of his game that we don’t see any nail-biting or hesitation in his work. It’s just there. As if Powell waved his hand absently in the direction of a blank page and Representative Lewis’ life simply emerged by fiat.The reality, of course, is likely way more frustration, careful balancing of ideas, and long long hours of wrist-cramping labour. But it doesn’t look like that.]] And it’s a pretty tremendously interesting life.Congressman Lewis participated in the 1963 civil rights march on Washington DC. He was the youngest speaker at an event that is mostly widely remembered for Dr. King’s “I Have a Dream.” March is the story of the March On Washington, told as memoir from John Lewis himself. And Book One doesn’t ever arrive at even the beginning of the march, instead spending its time exploring the childhood and young adulthood of Representative Lewis. In approaching the story obliquely and wholly as prologue, March: Book One gives readers a sense of place—a foothold into what may otherwise be a largely alien landscape. We see young John and his family making a living in rural Alabama. We see the strict rules that governed the ways they could interact with the world around them. We see young John’s thirst for justice and righteousness. We see John take up the role of preacher, and we see his burgeoning interest in liberation theology and the social gospel. And we see the early sparks that lit the conflagration of the civil rights movement—that would burn away so much of the accumulated ethical detritus that dirtied America from sea to shining sea. It was to be a holy, sanctifying fire—a movement that could be a seraphamic coal to America’s tongue, if only the nation would stand up and say, “Here I am!”[image]March: Book One ends well short of the reader discovering how America would react. In its pages, we see some early-stage sit-ins and some of the struggles that the black (and some white) protestors would have to endure. The book concludes on a rhetorical high note, a small but potent political victory, but still feels as though it precedes the current day by about a million years. I will be grateful to the completed work for how well it will help today’s generation bridge the gulf between the civil rights struggles of yesterday and the very different (but still virulent) racial turmoil facing the nation today.In fact, if I have one thing to hold against March: Book One, it’s that it is Book One—this is a story that thirsts for completion. The continued reccountment of these stories is, in its way, as important as the events themselves. Without being brought to life again and again, the power of this history will wane—will fade into bare academic fact, lifeless datapoints known only by rote, and therefore powerless and hollow. March is good and important and I’m proud of the medium for being its vessel. Would that all worthwhile history was recorded with the care and accessibility of John Lewis’ March._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) Perhaps shamefully, perhaps not.2) Or so it seems.

I want to say it was 1999, but I may be off a year or so. It was during a period of time when I was reckless with money and would buy dvds by the fistful when lonely. Amidst all the Criterion editions of movies I sometimes didn’t even like, I also spent a bit of time browsing through Suncoast’s and Tower Records’ anime sections. I wasn’t yet an anime fan, but I was intrigued. And so, Perfect Blue caught my eye and with its cover blurb referencing amalgamation of Walt Disney and Alfred Hitchcock, I was sold. I wasn’t overly enamoured with either director, but I nursed at the time deep pretensions of film-crit aspirations, so I thought this was something I ought to take an interest in. Due diligence and all that. I was in my twenties and pretty lame.As it turned out, it would take me later viewings to come to appreciate Perfect Blue. I initially approached it merely as psychological thriller, entertaining so far as it went, but ultimately hollow. Again, I was young. Apparently though, the film crawled deep enough into my mind that when his next film, Millennium Actress, reached the U.S., I was there to snap up a copy right away. And then the same with Tokyo Godfathers and Paranoia Agent. As well, I counted myself lucky enough to catch Paprika a couple times in theaters. A small part of me was ruined when word arrived of his passing. He was young, not yet forty-seven. That’s me in six years. One of the most talented and prodigious and interesting animated filmmakers, removed from the game before ever arriving to the zenith of his potential. I doubt there will be many deaths of creators that will stay with me so strongly.Kon had something going on in his films that was delicious. His art was top-notch of course, but I found the greatest pleasure in letting his stories wash over me. He had a kind of thematic interest that resonated with my own, even if he wasn’t anything like my mirror. Throughout his decade-long burst of animated works, we see Satoshi Kon intimately concerned with the nature of reality and the question of identity. And in Tropic of the Sea, first published in 1990, we find prototypical presence of both concerns.[image]Reality notably bends and twists and absconds with itself in Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress, Paprika, Paranoia Agent, and the “Magnetic Rose” segment of Memories. It becomes intentionally impossible for both characters and audience to sensibly walk the borderlands between dream and memory and the life as lived. It would not be hard to see Kon advocating for an existence that sits beyond or alongside the empirical—that perhaps to see the world wholly in terms that can be seen, measured, and tested is less an embrace of reality than the normative paradigm would dictate. Perhaps Kon’s works are meant to clammer somewhat for revolution. Not for something so base as political change but for something more sweeping: a means of understanding our world in terms of swirling mystery and worlds between and imagined experiences that inform reality behind our backs. To we of the rational expectation, we of the scientific rigour, we who demand evidence for belief, it all sounds a bit loosey-goosey—but Kon, for whatever he wanted to convey, was aware of how wacky his worlds would seem. He largely lets them unfold without comment but will occasionally drop clues that he has met our skepticism and that our skepticism doesn’t matter. Because in his worlds, skepticism is the bastion of the foolish.And yet in my world, I am built of skepticism and cynicism. Raised in a world of dogmatic beliefs (American nationalism, non-denominational Protestantism, capitalism, a Left Behind-style eschatology, and a decided cultural segregation between sacred and secular), I found myself in my brief history since adulthood at several points of contention between what I perceived as rational and what was possibly—at best—wishful thinking. I am, for as much as I believe in some things, deeply cynical and critical of most everything (even things I still believe). I’ve been wrong too many times for dogmatism. And for good or ill, I’ve been wrong too many times not to approach every last thing in life without a measure of skepticism. My identity—my personal understanding of who I am and what I’m for—is in constant flux.[image]And again, as a reminder, Satoshi Kon’s works are all, every one, concerned with the question of identity. Perfect Blue says so outright on its marketing, grabbing hold of Mima’s question, asked and answered in the film, “Excuse me. Who are you?” Kon presents a woman whose career decisions may or may not be at odds with who she really is—or perhaps she will become who her career decisions demand. Millennium Actress explores the Vonnegutian maxim that we should be careful who we pretend to be because we are who we pretend to be, only without the ominous overtones. Tokyo Godfathers wonders at the reality of three of the homeless, questioning whether they are vagabonds or kings, and challenges both character and viewer to better grapple with the meaning of each. Paranoia Agent concerns a community whose identity is an ethical-social torpor forged of a post-war sluffing off of responsibility. In each of these Kon attempts to let his characters divine the truth of their own existences. He pushes people to self-evaluate in a world where dream and mystery collide and perhaps allows the self-inspecting person to finally stop from seeing through a glass darkly. It seems that Kon felt that dream-blurred reality was essential to the acquisition of true self-sight.And these themes are nascently present in Tropic of the Sea. In this older work Kon only lightly treats the infringement on reality by the mysterious, but it’s still present and essential to the foremost question of the protagonist’s identity. Yosuke is the hesitatingly apostate son of a family of mermaid priests. Yosuke’s grandfather is a true believer, though he has passed his priestly duties on to his son. Yosuke’s father has never believed but, as may happen, an additional trauma turned his faithlessness into a light kind of antagonism. Yosuke struggles to make sense of strange dreams or visions or memories that may validate his grandfather’s faithfulness. He feels himself agnostic, but the intrusion of the unexpected may prove his unbelief inadequate.[image]Tropic of the Sea is more forthright in its use of the uncanny, making the supernatural impossible to deny—by tale’s end, none of the characters remain skeptical. That’s a little bit too bad and Kon will happily play cards closer to vest in the future, but the story’s still engaging and stands well as a solid mermaid story. In fact, though originally published in 1990 (amusing counterpoint to Disney’s neutered, feckless Little Mermaid), Tropic of the Sea's US publication in 2013 marks a bit of serendipity. Kon’s mermaid, though substantially different in realization, rides similar cultural waves as last year’s beautifully wicked Sailor Twain. Mermaids in Tropic have priests that honour them daily because they are dangerous. They don’t sing about life above the waves. They don’t play and frolic. They are demigods and their involvement in the world can be a joy or terror. Sailor Twain's South was a beauty capable of great horror, but Tropic's mermaid is a horror capable of great beauty. It’s rather nice to see these powerful, non-pacified visions of the mythic see light once more.[image]Kon’s art here is interesting, a cross somewhat between his later animation style and the over-detailed charm of Katsuhiro Otomo’s Akira. I’m not sure how deeply indebted Kon is to Otomo for his technique in these early efforts, but I wouldn’t be surprised if the influence was heavy. Tropic's character art (shadowing, line dynamic, etc.) could have been drawn by Otomo himself but for one distinction: Kon’s figures aren’t so stumpy as Otomo’s. In Akira, Domu, and Mother Sarah, everyone looks a little squashed. It’s a part of Otomo’s signature and that’s fine. But when we see the proportions of Kon’s characters (in terms of limb and torso length), it becomes apparent how much more natural Otomo’s characters could have appeared. I’d be interested to see how Kon would have drawn a manga circa 2005 to see if his style truly changed or if the simplicity of his anime works was merely due the limitations and requirements of the medium.Tropic of the Sea, while especially delectable for fans of Satoshi Kon, is still entirely worthwhile as a standalone fable of science vs supernature, of technology vs the unknown. It’s fascinating to see Kon’s favourite themes in evidence even in this early work and I’m grateful that Vertical took the initiative to bring this to English publication at last. Kon is one of our era’s creative treasures and any chance to see his hand at play is a fantastic opportunity. I was glad not to miss it._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,not set,"Nov 05, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17412813-tropic-of-the-sea

I and you and everyone you know are by nature unable to project ourselves into experiences we have not had. The shorthand of this is that everything that feels foreign to me feels comfortable to someone else. And what feels cozy and warm to me feels wrongheaded to someone else. And we have a hard time seeing this kind of thing—because we begin in ourselves. Forget for a moment that most of us in the U.S. are products of a culture that is superbly focused on individualism and the rightness of personal experience. Even without that formidable personal origin, our biological nature prompts this initial self-concern as well. The typical human experience is to perceive the world from behind the eyes and within the head. Proprioception gives us the sense that our thoughts and calculations and beliefs and rational self all exist within the geography of our skulls. Rather than five feet outside ourselves or in that tree over there or in this hand here or even, more romantically, in the space between you and me—rather than any of the thousands of possible places for the self to reside, the general experience is that the έγώ sits firmly and (usually) immovably a couple inches behind the eyes. From this starting place, the entirety of our unadulterated life experience is wholly our own. My life and all that it contains is my own alone. It is not yours and you can only guess at what it would be like to be me. And vice versa. The things others see and feel are alien to us. The only way for us to be someone else or feel as someone else is through the imagination—and even then, we’re still only ever us pretending at what it’s like to be someone else.[image][She doesn’t even realize that raccoons don’t have tear ducts]This is why it’s so hard to love other people, so hard to engage a true and honest compassion for those who are unlike us. With those who are a bit like us, we can short-circuit our lack of empathy by pretending the other person is us (or near enough). We can think that if they were us, they would want this or maybe that. For most of us, that’s what compassion or charity looks like. It’s doing to others as we would have them do unto us. A fine rule so far as it goes, but when the things that others want are not the things that we ourselves would want, guessing how to do good to them or for them becomes excruciatingly difficult enough that most of us don’t even bother. Hence wars and sexism and religious intolerance and human trafficking and nationalism and homophobia and racism and school rivalries. We who would hope to love fail to love because we simply don’t understand what love would require.This is where literature comes in as one of the most powerful tools the world has yet devised. In literature, the reader doesn’t just escape their own troubles for the space of a book. In literature, the reader doesn’t merely learn new things about the location or period in which the novel occurs. In literature, the reader doesn’t just sift through new ideas and philosophies in carefully packaged trifles designed to thrill even while delivering pedagogy. In literature, the reader doesn’t simply take in some beautiful prose and carefully worded text. Any or all of those things may occur, but in every novel, readers are silently invited into something more wonderful than any of that. [image]In literature, the reader is smuggled behind the eyes and into the head of a person wholly different from themselves—and often, into the heads of several persons.[1] In literature, through a subtle mystery, we become other people while remaining ourselves. Our desires, interests, circumstances, personality, history, abilities, and beliefs are all altered. We are transformed temporarily. And as long as we can hold on to the memory of that experience, we can better relate to at least one kind of person who is not us. The more books we read and the more often, the better we will be able to relate to that which is alien to us. And the better we can relate, the better we can empathize. And the better we empathize, the better we may love—because empathy is the gateway to love and without it, your love will be hollow and ineffectual.Gene Luen Yang’s Boxers & Saints is, by its nature and structure, a work deeply concerned with empathy. It bleeds the stuff.[image]When I was in school, we covered the Boxers and their rebellion at least every other year. I still remember the little paintings and illustrations that were used in our textbooks to pique our interest in the movement and its Western response. It may strain credulity, but if I told you I never once grew tired of hearing about the Boxers so often, would you for one minute believe me? You probably should. I never wearied of learning of either the Boxers’ efforts to overcome foreign influence nor of the bizarre names they chose for their movements. This is mostly because we never talked about them save to say, Yes there was a Boxer Rebellion around the turn of the century. Yes America sent a handful of soldiers to China. Yes there were probably other important details there, and Yes we won’t talk about them ever again unless it’s to mention the rebellion in passing and then dismiss it as unimportant. [image][It’s good to have a slogan]In introducing the historical events of the Boxer Rebellion, Paul A. Cohen describes a group exercise he takes his students through when approaching late imperial Chinese history. He requests they write down in a couple sentences their associations with the Boxers and the Taipings. He reports:[2]The results of the quiz are remarkably consistent. Year in and year out, while a substantial majority of the students have at least a glimmer of information concerning the Boxers and are able to identify them as “anti-foreign” or a “rebellion” or a “revolution,” well over 90 percent have never heard of the Taipings.While I myself had not heard of the Taipings (or more correctly, had not caught them in my memory when hearing of them), I’m surprised that Cohen reports that most students could tie the Boxers to an anti-foreign element. “Rebellion” is easy to account for since they were only ever referenced in my history class as the Boxer Rebellion. I didn’t know what or whom they were rebelling against. I didn’t even know who was doing the rebelling. Boxers? People who opposed boxing? What was clear was that there was a Boxer Rebellion. Everything else, at least in my two decades of education, was immersed in an impenetrable mist.Yang’s book does this thing that I’ve found graphic novels particularly useful for. It educates seamlessly, easily. I love graphic novels that explore historical moments because they breathe life into those events in a way I haven’t discovered in any other medium. I was excited to finally be introduced to the Boxer Rebellion in a manner that hamstrung the abruptly curtailed style of history that my typically nationalistic education[3] reveled in. And right away, it expanded my understanding of the flow of world history in exciting directions. [image]Boxers & Saints is really two books[4], Boxers and Saints. Each represents a different facet of the generalized experience of the rebellion and the events (and kinds of events) that brought it about. Boxers relates the events through a young man who joins the Boxer movement in a leadership capacity after seeing a fantastic vision and follows him and his brothers as they seek to purge China of the influence of the “hairy ones,” the foreign imperialistic forces (notably found in the form of the Christian missionary movement, both Roman and Protestant sects).(I wasn’t even aware of either the involvement of Christianity in China at the time nor in the prevalence of mystic vision amongst the Chinese people in that era. I’m always slightly more curious about works that involve the way the human condition is interpreted in light of the Mysterious, so discovering this pre-ignited my interest in Yang’s project.)Saints takes on the perspective of a Chinese girl (and then young woman) who joins the church and experiences visions of the Maid of Orleans (or Joan, if you’re on familiar terms). Life becomes more tumultuous as she seeks to understand her calling—what she is meant for—and the countryside becomes increasingly hostile toward “foreign devils” and “secondary devils” (those Chinese who’ve converted to the foreign gods).[image][Death to the stutterers]The books each tell their own story (and are stand-alone to some degree) but intersect in crucial points and cannot be fully understood apart from each other. A person may read one or the other and feel satisfied in the story presented, but together they illuminate each other. This, interestingly, is a reflection on the reality of human existence itself. Living life wholly from my own view, I may gather a seemingly complete story of a life—of what it was to be me. But it’s only when one considers also the lives with which mine intersected—how theirs reflected on mine and how mine affected theirs—that anything approaching a true vantage of who I was can emerge. In taking the stories of Little Bao (Boxers) and Vibiana (Saints) on their own, we see a fraction of their realities. Yet taken together, the two figures come into fuller relief, a touch closer to their real selves. Early on in Boxers, Little Bao sees Vibiana (then known as Four-Girl) and describes the moment as “meeting his future.” Despite how little their paths will cross in the books, at the point from which he narrates, Bao knows just how important their interactions have been. But since the powerful fruition of their relationship isn’t revealed until the final pages of Saints, it takes the reader exploring both books to make sense of what exactly happens with Boxers' lead. Further, Saints climaxes with a particular religious vision (Vibiana sees visions throughout the entirety of the book), the details of which seem mere artistic embellishment unless one has already gone through the final pages of Boxers. [image][Since her previous name was Death-Girleven a name like Vibiana is a step in the right direction]The manner by which Yang weaves these two narratives together is wonderful. They at first feel simple and rather straightforward, solid but nothing spectacular. That is their deception and a mark of Yang’s gifts. The more I return to their pages, the more the complexity of Yang’s story unfolds. And not just in their cross-pollination, either. The books chart a careful course through the details of the history, drawing in events and figures in such a way that readers will feel comfortable that, though historical fiction and though likely a compression of timelines and events, this is for all its fictions a true story of the Boxer Rebellion.And even as the books differ with respect to protagonists and perspectives, they vary in size and composition. Boxers is nearly twice as long as its companion, Saints. Lark Pien’s precise and judicious colouring tells different stories in each book. Little Bao’s rise to powerful figure within the movement and eventual fall as the rebellion is crushed[5] is a colourful affair—not the least because of the inclusion of the gods of the opera, who possess the Boxers, enabling them to fight with skills beyond mortal ken. There is still plenty of sepia dust in Bao’s story, but the skies are blue, the waters are blue, and fires rage red and gold. Vibiana’s story is sepia throughout. Mud skies, mud water, mud fire, and mud blood. The only exceptions are Vibiana’s mystic vision (which interrupts with striking clarity), Vibiana’s and Father Bey’s narration, and flames in the epilogue to Saints.[6] The reason for this is well-considered and really only unveils itself after the fact. There are other tricks to narration that play themselves out according to each book’s purpose, but it would be unfair to spoil them here.[image][It’s okay mei-wenWe all go a little crazy in the midst of bloodbaths and massacres]Yang’s art is brilliant for his task. His figures are simple and clean. His wide cast features a variety of looks and body types, and all are wrangled neatly into the stable his style maintains. He produces characters whose presence is cartoony but dignified. These are not figures meant to be laughed at,[7] but instead objects of interest and compassion. Yang is proposing a real world represented in spare lines and bold actions. And it works just as you’d expect if you previously read his American Born Chinese, in which he used a similar style. These books are beautiful and fully merit the careful production value of their publishing.[image][This is like one of those Dude-Where’s-my-car momentswhere you wake up out of a crazy trip to find you don’t quite know what you’ve done]A couple days ago, my wife and I were discussing Boxers & Saints in relation to the non-fictional history book I was ready on the subject (to supplement this ). As well as commenting on how interesting Boxers & Saints is, she (a teacher) remarked on just how powerful a tool for teaching things like this could be. Graphic novels are uniquely digestible. They are able to present a full story in a vessel that can be consumed in a couple of hours, and then poured over in order to absorb further details.[8] Something like Boxers & Saints would not take the place of a history textbook, but would make a wonderful complement to that text. I spent forty years not knowing a thing about the rebellion, but after reading Yang’s books here, I found myself on Wikipedia discovering more—and then even checking out a whole book on the matter from the library. I imagine I would have behaved similarly in junior high, had this kind of thing been available.[9]In Boxers & Saints, I find something beautiful that’s rather elusive in the bulk of religious works by religious folk. Boxers & Saints, while from the pen of a religious person (Yang is part of a Chinese Catholic community) and religious in nature (the books definitely work out of his faith structure), does not really feel like a religious work. Certainly we may acknowledge the parts in which Christian doctrine filters in and actually directs the books’ conclusion. And there are evidences of Yang’s personal eschatology at play, his sense of what becomes of the believer’s self after death. But the book plays so honestly with the faults and beliefs of its characters, Christian and pagan, that it just feels like an exercise in human observation—a riveting story of the condition of the species. Yang treats the Boxers with the same humanity with which he treats the saints. Part of this stems from his recognition of his own kind as fallible, a humility he describes in an interview with Wired from last January: “The more I read about the Boxer Rebellion, the more conflicted I felt. Who were the protagonists here? Who was more deserving of our sympathy? The Boxers or their Chinese Christian victims? In many ways, the Boxer Rebellion embodies a conflict that some Asian and Asian American Christians struggle with, a conflict between our Eastern cultural heritage and our Western faith”[image][My advice: when Jesus is telling you a story, you don’t rush him]To this end, Yang has intentionally created a work designed to interact with our sense of self by pushing us to understand the human story from multiple vantage points. We are ourselves. Simultaneously, we become Vibiana, who struggles to find balance between her heritage in a nation that despises her and a new heritage that proposes she sacrifice everything for the good of a new and heavenly nation. Simultaneously, we become Little Bao, who sees Christians and their foreignness as a very real threat to the goodness and sanctity of Chinese life. Simultaneously, we become Father Bey, a hardened priest whose frustration with the besetting sins of all who surround him drive him to feel betrayal at every turn. Simultaneously, we become Mei-wen, a woman who straddles the line between warrior-maiden and goddess of mercy and compassion. We are made victims and victors and victims again. Yang offers us a wealth of opportunities to see through eyes unclouded by hate. In a vision, the crucified Christ admonishes Vibiana to be mindful of others as he is of her. By proposing so many windows into so many souls, Yang fulfills his own Lord’s will somewhat, giving the reader the chance to inhabit the souls of others and learn to be mindful of them—a practice run for carrying the conviction into real life._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) Usually, at the least, the reader takes in the life, perspectives, and interests of the protagonist and the author.

There’s always been some obstacle between me and my enjoyment of what so many others seem to dig on. That said, there are a couple bits here and there that I’ve enjoyed. A line, a stanza, an idea. I liked a poem an English professor friend of mine wrote because it mentioned Bubo, the mechanical owl from Clash of the Titans. I liked bits of “To His Coy Mistress” because it was absurd and, so, funny. And I liked bits of Shelley’s “Ozymandias.” You know, “two vast and trunkless legs of stone” and all that. I heard the poem in seventh grade and the whole idea resonated with me—the fragility of kingdoms, the temporary nature of everything we are and do.I grew up on the beach. We moved to the coast when I was three. I stayed near the sand until I was thirty-two. In those nearly three decades, I built a lot of castles, sometimes in the traditional sense, packing sand into shapes and then carving out everything that wasn’t “castle” from the mass. More often though, I crafted what my dad (our master craftsman to whom we were apprenticed) had termed dib-dab castles.[1] And of course, the greatest tragedy of each of our creations was their limited duration. Not one single fortress survived the night and the rising tides. No matter the strength, value, or beauty of the castle. Time and tides swept flat every kingdom. By comparison, Ozymandias’ kingdom was particularly tenacious, leaving those two stone trunks.Books about the mortality of the race are not rare. In fact, most stories can in some sense be read as an exploration of our perishable nature, of our inevitable expiration. The fact that we will all die pretty much sooner than we’d prefer motivates (even if only subconsciously) so much of our narrative displays—and of course our real-world actions as well. One of the saving graces of the human experience is that without the intervention of some terrible accident (injury or disease or murder), we all get at least six decades to gradually make sense of the whole tragic mess. Those years and years of intermittent contemplation may bring us to peace or push us toward existential horror, and that’s what centuries of literature helps us explore. Sandcastle is no different, and by collapsing those decades and years and months and days and hours of potential meditation into the span of a day or less, authors Frederik Peeters and Pierre Oscar Lévy force the issue rather neatly.Sandcastle, like most Twilight Zone episodes, is heavily plot driven. The reader’s first pass is going to almost inevitably be wholly invested in the question of Holy Crap What Is Happening?! The book is written and drawn with judicious tension. Lévy and Peeters grab hold of one’s attention deftly and don’t show any concern with offering relief until the book’s final curtain draws closed. It’s an exhilarating ride and well worth the ticket paid. [image]Partway through, however, readers will begin to sense that the plot, the story, the mystery, and whatever climax awaits is probably beside the point. Sandcastle is thoroughly invested in the human dilemma—that bit of story that takes place in between plot points. Lévy and Peeters offer a neat entry into their discussion of the human end, lubricating the conversation by its relevancy and immediacy. The characters are rather typical, but that allows us to investigate the typicality of their conundrum. Throughout Sandcastle's paces, it’s never quite clear whether the nature of the book’s MacGuffin is founded in science fiction or magic—though various clues point toward some sort of fantasy sci-fi. Visitors to a secluded lagoon in (probably) Spain find themselves trapped there by mysterious means. More alarmingly, they rather quickly find themselves aging with alacrity—at something like a rate of one year in fifteen minutes. The elderly begin to expire, the children hit puberty early, and the younger adults try to figure out what to do. The authors use the generic character tropes as a means to more immediately bridge the gap between the reader and the question that hangs over each of our lives: What do we do with the fact of our limited time in this sphere?[image][He was going to say: without riding a pony]Even as Sandcastle is itself a grand parable for those with ears to hear, Lévy and Peeters have seen fit to include a couple smaller interior parables for easy lessons and digestion. One is in the nature of the sandcastle itself, titular and obvious, finding itself expressed through several iterations over the course of the tale. Another is a swansong fable about a king who so feared death that he entombed himself to keep the spectre at bay. The careful (or lucky!) reader may discover more breadcrumbs and trails that the authors have laid out, all to the end of better engaging their subject.[image][Biology *is* cool!]The dialogue is simple and maybe sometimes a little awkward. This may be an artifact of translation or it may issue from vacationing foreigners all trying to speak in a common tongue. In the growing children’s case, it may show that while their minds mature and they acquire some of the intelligence natural to their age,[2] there’s still a bit of social awkwardness attached to the absence of experience. The personalities, too, seem immune to aging. The petulant teenage girl still lives to frustrate her parents even at the age of thirty. The five-year-old girl still loves her parents with wide-eyed affection, even well into her newfound adulthood. And the three-year-old boy is as detached from the immediacy of his situation as an adult as he was as a child. And all of the children will sit bound and tight for a good story, even in the midst of imminent death.[image][Everybody loves a story!]Peeters, whose art is full and lively, describes the book as a parable. And it is. Sandcastle is one more opportunity to prompt our thoughts toward consideration of our mortality and if there can be any meaning in it. These parables surround us, whether in Shelley in junior high or in the kingdoms we build as children in the sand, but we are—as a species or as a culture—so prone to forgetfulness and distraction that reminders, even obvious ones, can be welcome. Even for those who believe they know about life and death and afterlife and afterdeath, the privilege to reconsider the limits we’re born with is a gift that should not be squandered or abdicated. We are already, as a people, so very arrogant. Why not take the opportunity to take on the humiliation of mystery?[image]_______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) I’ve since learned from Wikipedia that these are probably more commonly called drip castles, though a good number call them dribbled castles. These are constructed by taking a fistful of very wet sand (a slurry) and letting it drip in a controlled manner from the hand. The castles are wonderful and organic and amazing when well-produced. Here’s a basic tutorial:[image]And yes, dad, I know that if I held the sand so high above it would demolish the castle below. I drew the large space between to illustrate the 3 steps: 1) the hand holding the slurry, 2) the wet sand dripping down, and 3) the drops of sand solidifying into a castle.

I’m sure most people living today haven’t had the pleasure—as panoramas were largely popular in the 19th century and were already well on their way out by 1900. I have of course seen panoramic photography and the inheritor of the ill-fated Cinéorama, Disneyland’s Circle-Vision 360°. Still, not the same thing and I regret that I will likely never have the opportunity to engage such staging and artistry in person. Reading about panoramas, while exciting the imagination to some small degree, really can’t do justice to what must have been a tremendous thrill for 19th century viewers.Panoramas were sometimes built of painted panels alone (often staged at differing depths to confer a sense of dimensionality), but many featured three-dimensional elements as well—sculpted pieces in the foreground designed to trick the mind into seeing depth where none existed. Observers were brought into an arena of specialized lighting and visual manipulation, which could then govern the rational mind into a particular aesthetic experience. The panoramic scene would elicit a mediation between beauty (a concept derived from sexuality) and the sublime (a kind of awe in the face of the horror of the unknown). This balance between the two was known as the picturesque.[1][image]Panoramas were means by which people could be theatrically transported into a world outside their own—a world of the picturesque, of beauty and awe conjoined. The panorama’s chief conceit is that the viewer does not just take in a particularly lush painting but is installed within the painting itself. Canvas borders would be obscured by props such that the beginning and end of the panorama could not immediately be discerned. Having been enveloped within the panorama, the observer is made participant in the scene into which he or she has been placed—whether in landscape, cityscape, or the ferocious battles which dominated the later history of the artform.[image]It is in multiple levels of panoramic engagement that Suehiro Maruo’s adaptation of Edogawa Rampo’s The Strange Tale of Panorama Island is concerned. The story’s central figure Hitomi, a man of stolen identity, uses the wealth he acquires surreptitiously to fund the construction of some version of an earthly paradise.[2] His goal is to submerge the book’s characters in the titular island’s vision. Through painstaking planning, skilled construction, a talented ensemble of actors, and wanton expenditures of seemingly endless wealth, Hitomi creates a lavish illusion—a living panorama into which guests (and himself especially) can experience an unreal world in a visceral way. Hitomi is centrally concerned that his fantasy island feel like a real experience—though one that is immediately picturesque, drawing together eroticism and natural awe almost seamlessly. Hitomi’s strange and taled Panorama Island is an ode to hedonistic excess, a devotion to pleasure divorced from any context save for the immediate experience of that pleasure.[image]Interestingly, many of the critiques contemporary to the era of panoramic painting popularity are underscored and heightened through Hitomi’s island. On top of the criticism that the easy illusionment of panorama experiences rendered them merely base propaganda, opposition at the time cited the operation of the locality paradox upon viewers. The locality paradox refers to observers’ inability to discern their true place, whether they were in the locale presented in the panorama or in the viewing rotunda. Because Hitomi’s goal is his guests’ complete participation, he would not remotely see the locality paradox as problematic, but rather something desirable. Further criticism objected to the physicalization of the sublime. The Romantics feared that in rendering what ought to be awestriking from material compositions, the Wonderful would be reforged as Ordinary. While Hitomi would be likely to object to this, following his story through to its conclusion does offer evidence to support the Romantics.[3]Additionally, more than Hitomi’s goals even, The Strange Tale of Panorama Island does itself seemingly somewhat hope to draw even the reader into the panorama of the story.[4] Most literature attempts this to some degree, but Maruo revels so much in the visual spectacle afforded by the story’s demands that one can’t help but feel the forcefulness by which the artist presents both eroticism/beauty and horror/awe. Once Hitomi visits the near-complete island in the company of the woman with whom he pretends at marriage, the book shifts into a full-fledged attempt at propagandizing the wonders of the island. The artistic rendering of the island’s decorations and landscapes is truly magnificent and sells prodigiously its paradisical lures. Maruo is an astonishingly talented illustrator when tackling the physical presence of the island, and some pages and panels may momentarily theft the artistically inclined reader of breath.[5][image][image][image][image][image][image]In the end, as Citizen Kane-style utopian stories have taught us to expect, Hitomi’s strange island becomes more Panopticon than Panorama. The reader sits centrally, observing all with unobstructed vision. Coinciding with the Romantic criticism, we find awe and beauty have been made cheap and so lose a bit of their magic. This is especially the case for Hitomi, who has lived longest and most abundantly the life within the panorama—he more than anyone is aware of the fabricated nature of the entire endeavor. By the strange tale’s explosive conclusion, Hitomi seems rather spent, wearied, and bored by the whole thing. Perhaps this was Rampo and Maruo’s intent, to propose a horror story in which the most unnerving thing is how easy it is to lose the verdancy of formerly wonderful things that arrive too easily. Perhaps they intend this as a statement on the value of struggle and rarity. Perhaps, in their way, they are Romantics themselves. Perhaps not, of course, but as within the panorama, what is seen is governed by one’s context—so who’s to say?_______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) Straight from Wikipedia: Thomas Gray wrote in 1765 of the Scottish Highlands, “The mountains are ecstatic. None but God know how to join so much beauty with so much horror.” [sic]2) Kind of like how I imagine Charles Foster Kane might have aimed in his own stately pleasure dome had there not been a Hays Code to hamper him.3) In an entirely facile way, this makes sense. Here’s a f’rinstance:I grew up on the beach in Southern California. Almost literally. From age three through thirty-one, I lived within a short walk from the sand in Laguna Beach. Summers (and even falls and springs and a bit of winters) were spent on the sand and in the Pacific herself. Bare, tanned skin was everywhere. Bathing suits weren’t particularly conservative and so seeing women with all but breasts and the nethers exposed was entirely normal. Common. Mundane. Even when I reached my teen years and was entrenched in a hormonally driven quest to surreptitiously take in the beauty of every girl I’d see, I never once considered bare shoulders, belly, or thighs to be any more magical than noses, knuckles, or elbows. When I discovered those from other American and international cultures considered otherwise, I was baffled. (An early, confusing lesson in multiculturalism—one that I wouldn’t understand for a decade or more later.)The point here is that what might have been considered mystical or awe-inspiring was robbed of that potential by its brute commonality. In other words, for a person raised in track housing, the idea of indoor plumbing isn’t even something that merits thought. It’s boring and a given and holds none of the magic that it would for someone from 1850.4) Interestingly even the book’s framework moves from horror (even if not necessarily sublimity) toward beauty, marrying the two concepts in a bifurcated sort of picturesque.5) The artist is perhaps less equipped for the depiction of human persons—as faces (and especially the eyes) are often grotesque distortions beyond probability. I will admit that this may be an intentional stylistic bit and perhaps Maruo is making some artistic statement by giving everyone weird, lazy eyes.

In a way, that’s kind of like saying that it’s sad that most people will only ever know Herman Melville for Moby Dick. That is: it’s not really sad at all and that there is a good reason why the great torrential works are the ones that imprint on the shared cultural experience. There is a reason why when someone mentions Melville, Murakami, or Tolkien, better than nine-tenths of the time, that person isn’t going to bring up (respectively) “Bartleby the Scrivener,” Sputnik Sweetheart, or Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. And there is a reason that when people talk Otomo, it’s a safe bet they aren’t bringing up Domu.And it has nothing to do with the quality of the work. Really, pound for pound, I find Domu a more exciting read packed with more thrills and better character moments than Akira. It’s more tightly plotted and possibly even more insane, though I wouldn’t argue the latter with any ferocity. There’s just, perhaps, a feeling that we owe the larger work our fidelity simply for the tremendous effort involved. 2666 is the superior work because it’s a bazillion pages long. Moby Dick is the superior work because it’s a bazillion pages long. Akira is the superior work because it’s longer than Moby Dick and 2666 put together in some glorious back-alley slash-fiction disaster by Melville and Bolaño’s ferociously ugly in vitro lovechild.[image]Because I’ve a touch of the contrarian in me, I have to guard against preferring the lesser known work for virtue of its obscurity. I prefer Domu to Akira, but do I do so justly? It’s hard to say. I mean, how could I ever know? In the end, the question might not even be worth asking, Which Is Better? Instead, the more worthwhile route may be simply to suggest that whatever the merits of the longer work—however completely awesome Akira might be[1]—Domu is wholly on its own merits worth the time it takes to track down the book and settle into its wacky brand of urban horror.The lion’s portion of what makes Domu so incredible is Otomo’s artistic vision for the book. Not entirely of course, and the script is tightly plotted and wonderful, but Domu would not have been half so successful a realization of Otomo’s story had it not been for his prodigious talent with a pen or brush. Here. Look at this panel.[image]And now this.[image]And now this.[image][Check out the detail on this apartment complex. Before computers.]Do you feel bad yet for being nowhere near so accomplished in whatever skill it is that you have professed to become an expert in? Otomo may not be as awesome a father to my children as I am, but I am not near so awesome a father to my children as he is an illustrator. Probably the most painful thing about it is how little of Otomo’s work there actually is. Like, imagine if Hayao Miyazaki’s last film was Porco Rosso. We’d be thankful for what we had, of course, but in our heart of hearts we’d always be mournful for what was never made.[2]And really, it’s not even all down to the intricacy of his work either. His sense of design is impeccable. You know how there are a few directors/cinematographers who just bear astonishing aptitude for their work, who shoot angles and vistas that eclipse the actors themselves. That’s Otomo. Think back on the work of Sergio Leone. The Good, the Bad & the Ugly.[3] Sure, the film stars cinematic superstars Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach, but without Leone’s peculiar framing, long posed shots, and extreme close-ups (remember the final duel and the combatants’ eyes), the film would have been inert. That is what Otomo offers his characters. The chance to be enveloped in something preordained in such a way as to show off every facet in its most dynamic and awestriking light. Again, an example.[image][2-Page spread—hence the weird scanner stuff at the crease.]And another.[image][2-Page spread—hence the weird scnner stuff at the crease.Also, Otomo here vertically flips the orientation so that the gound is at the top of the page and the sky at bottom. We see the rooftops with lamps on top. The two figures twist in the air high above the complex.][image][Close-up on Etsuko and Old Cho.]And one more.[image][This is Otomo’s version of Leone’s gunfights.]And interestingly, Otomo’s ability to convey action so dynamically capitalizes dramatically on his story’s sense of irony. Beyond the horror aspect of the book, Otomo presents a story deeply concerned with futility—which plays on his character’s extreme impotence. Of all Domu's characters, so many of whom try so hard to effect their own destinies, only two (and then, really only one) ever have any ability to affect the outcome of the book’s machinations. The crazy woman, the mentally arrested giant, the hoodlum, the kid, the young detective, the chief detective, the spiritist. They’re each incompetent to alter their own destinies and the destinies around them. Domu focuses heavily on police work and the reader spends a lot of time following an investigation that will ultimately be resolved in the most delicious deus ex machina—and by an unlikely deus. [image][The lighting choices here are phenomenal.]Domu is an almost perfect work. It may actually be perfect. I don’t really have the apparatus to judge perfection, so I tend to talk in aimless vagaries like this. Whether perfect or not, the sheer talent invested into its every page is formidable and affecting. It’s easy to see, for instance, how Domu might have influenced Rian Johnson in his execution of Looper's Rainmaker character—one could easily guess that Etsuko stepped right out of Otomo’s Tokyo’s high-rise developments and into Johnson’s Midwestern cornfields. When I first encountered Domu fifteen years ago, I was certain the book would stick with me throughout my life. I’ve been right so far. It is after all a masterwork, so we shouldn’t be surprised._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) And Akira *is* awesome, of course.

Sometimes the lifetime of achievements by a single imaginative voice is so overbearing that it will forever eclipse that creator’s exterior works, making it impossible to view those works for what they are. But maybe that’s okay and maybe that’s how it ought to be. After all, a painter’s landscape cannot simply be a landscape on its own; it will always be a part of the painter, an extension of that artist’s life. The fourth book of an author exists always in contradistinction to the three it followed and those that might follow it. It’s completely impossible to read anything J.K. Rowling writes without conjuring the spectre of Harry Potter—and maybe that’s right and good. A sentence is only sensible in context of the sentences among which it makes a home. Punch Drunk Love is lent a particular poignancy for the audience awareness of Adam Sandler’s prior oeuvre—and maybe that should be template for our interaction with all works. These cultural artifacts we enjoy do not and cannot stand alone and of their own. Every piece of music, literature, film, and art is the product of a single moment within a series of moments in the life of a creative source which exists in a creative epoch built of an endless complexity of circumstances, histories, motives, and movements. Each of these are important to the generation of the piece—and of course some bear more direct influence on the final result—so maybe it’s not necessarily unfortunate for a piece to be weighed under by the reputation of its builder.So when I approach Tale of Sand, JIM HENSON’s Tale of Sand, perhaps we should embrace both the good and the harm that come to the work because of the association. Honestly, at this stage of the , I’m not sure whether I appreciate the work more due the association or less. That’s part of what will be going on here. Me trying to decide. Regardless, let’s get base evaluation out of the way at the outset: Tale of Sand is worth most comics readers’ time[1]—whether penned by Henson or not.Tale of Sand is a bizarre experience nearly any way you cut it. Depending on the kind of reader you are, the first thing you’ll notice will be one of two things. Those who pay attention to covers and attribution will off the bat recognize that Jim Henson’s name is featured largely—to the point of being included in the book’s full title, Jim Henson’s Tale of Sand. Those who aren’t quite so concerned with covers or authorship will first open the book and be struck awed by Ramón K. Pérez’ mind-blowing illustrations. I had seen scans of the book’s art before seeing its title or authorship, so I had the curious position of being sold on it wholly apart from Henson’s name. In fact, for me, Henson’s attachment to Tale of Sand had a rather diminishing effect on my expectations. I know Henson entirely from his puppetry. The Muppets, Sesame Street, The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth. I like each of these moderately well but not so well that I’d ever seek out a work based on Henson’s involvement. And each of these held some tie to my childhood (even though The Muppets were originally tied to adult entertainment through Saturday Night Live). Suddenly I was concerned that a book with such great art would be rendered infantile by Henson’s writing. Pretty groundless, but expectations usually are.[image][Fancy meeting you here!]Honestly though, Henson’s and cohort Jerry Juhl’s writing is easily the chink in the armor of what is a pretty mouthwatering book. Tale of Sand‘s frontmatter clues us in to the situation. Henson and Juhl worked on a script for a surrealist film for several years in the ‘70s, pitching it around to little success. With the progress of other projects, Tale of Sand was boxed and shelved, where it lay hidden away for decades. Recently discovered, Henson’s company made an alliance with Archaia[2] to produce the film as a graphic novel. In comes Pérez with some of the most gorgeous, crisp, raucous comics art there is and you’ve got a pretty strange book.Henson’s and Juhl’s idea sends a protagonist on a twisting romp through something like a dream. “Like a dream” in that I can’t guarantee that anyone has dreams that resemble the odd, rambling visual-narratory pace that overlays what is essentially a kind of tight formalism. Maybe people do dream like that. I bet Eco does. I, on the other hand, do not. So to me, the script felt like one of those events where an author tries to describe a dream but relies either too much on narrative thrust or on clichés that we’ve learnt to associate with dreams and dreaming. Then again, maybe the writing team never intended Tale of Sand to be interpreted as being a dream or even being dreamlike—though the title invokes certain ties to a sleepytime wonderland. Hard to say.In either case though, the amount of story present is slight. Because of its surrealistic atmosphere, Tale of Sand probably ought to encourage readers to test out a variety of interpretations. Is this about Henson? Is it about the 20th century’s American male quest for purpose in a society that will not offer anything but the role of Sisiphus? Is this meant to be a statement about the reader/viewer? Is he saying something about the art of interpretation itself? Maybe. Maybe not. There’re not really enough solid tendrils onto which a reader might grasp to wrangle the authors’ intent for the work. I wasn’t particularly enamoured with that or the fact that none of the characters are really ever characters. They’re not even really probably literary devices. They exist only as colour for the palette of the protagonist’s journeyless journey. And, thankfully, as something for Pérez to draw. Because, man, this cat can draw.[image]See? I totally told you so. Pérez takes remarkable command of Henson’s and Juhl’s probably copiously described fantasy.[3] The artist mixes painted scenes with starkly conceived pen-and-ink illustrations. Sometimes there will be bursts of colour in nearly insane combinations while other instances will craft a subtle blend of monochromatic tones. Sometimes Pérez will play with double-page spreads while at others he will fidget with a page filled with smaller aspect-to-aspect paneling. And when he does use panels, his grid is all over the place. When he does use a grid. A lot of times he doesn’t.[image]Really, the art in this book is so big that it’s impossible for me to do it justice. Taking a two-pager and squeezing it down to fit in 519 pixels just seems fruitless. This is work that deserves to breathe. Tale of Sand would make a fantastic coffee table book—something for guests to browse through while their host retires for a few minutes to process the last hour’s dinner-followed-by-too-much-cheesecake. And because there’s so precious little in the way of actual narrative force, a visitor can pick it up, flip to any page, and begin reading with little damage to the experience. That kind of reading might actually play into the work’s governing theme of Sisyphusian circularity.[image][How ‘bout a little blatant sexual imagery!]Though I thought little of Henson’s and Juhl’s writing, it may have been the lack of absolute boundaries, a product of having no real story, that enables Pérez to cut loose so vibrantly. The artist blows off the rails early on and seems to feel little need to rein it in. When all you have is page after page of loony descriptions and the ground-level scene design of This Takes Place In A Dreamworld, the sky is apparently the limit. So hooray, I guess, for a weak story in favour of realizing such a stunning artistic achievement.My dad’s hitting town tomorrow for a visit and I can’t wait to show him Pérez’ art. A Note There was one thing that left me a bit uncomfortable while reading. Henson’s script relies on a number of ethnic stereotypes. Angry arabs wielding scimitars. African tribsmen kowtowing to a white man in a pith helmet. An indian guide. I felt kind of like I was reading the less fondly considered volumes of Tintin. The thing is, I think there’s probably some reason for their inclusion.In the foremost, the book is fraught with not just these stereotypes but with cliches from all over the history of the cinema. There has to be something to that. The book even invokes rather overtly Clouzot’s Wages of Fear. Also, if we take the era of authorship and the era from which the principal character seems drawn, there are internally logical explanations. From the early mid-‘70s, Henson and Juhl were penning a tale of a man who looks like a product of the late-‘50s. Such a man would have likely had his view of other cultures shaped by the slim window that an education purchased at the drive-in would have bestowed. Stereotype after stereotype. Now if Tale of Sand is meant to be his dream, then of course it would be populated by the stupid and backward imagery he had embraced in the theater.This somewhat lets the tale’s authors off the hook because if this is all the hero’s dream, then the authors cannot be culpable at all. At least in the context of this book. Another Note Now this does open up the question of interpretation a bit. I’m concerned that in my  above I gave no indication of there being a satisfying interpretation to the work. The possibility that Henson and Juhl were merely attempting to craft something that would be visually bizarre and mind-bending isn’t that palatable, and it’s perfectly plausible that they were really saying something with all the callouts to cinema tropes, the American frontier landscape, and the blatant sexual allusions (cf the above image).The sad fact is that at least on a first reading, I approached Tale of Sand rather lazily. Maybe there’s much more going on beyond the mere surface. And maybe that deserves more time than I put in. I’d like to think that it does. And I’m sure that as I return to the work over the following years that I’ll be in a better place to plumb its depths._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) Though possibly not money, depending on how much one values story over art.2) I’m unclear whether the relationship grew out of Archaia’s handling of various other Henson IP or if that privilege is result of their relationship that began with Tale of Sand.3) Throughout, Pérez (either of his own volition or via editor recommendation) includes pieces of Henson’s and Juhl’s script. It’s a nice addition and ties the work more concretely to its origin....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,not set,"Nov 04, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11480909-jim-henson-s-tale-of-sand

I talk explicitly about how Oshimi ends the series and offer my interpretation. If you want a  that leaves the mysteries and plotpoints alone, check out my  of the series’ first five volumes.]In one of Shuzo Oshimi’s final chapters in Flowers of Evil, former Baudelaire fanatic Kasuga is assigned to read once more from the poet’s Les Fleur du mal. The poem is “The Head of Hair” (also known in English as “Her Hair”), a devotion to luxuriating voyeuristically in a particular woman’s thick, dark hair. By calling to mind “sweltering Africa” and “languorous Asia,” the verses evoke a sense of finding the exotic in the mundane, of being rapturously transported by conveyance of the immediate and physical presence of another.It’s been a twisted and twisting road for Oshimi’s series as well as for his characters. When I ed the first five volumes a few years ago (a  I recommend as an essential complement to this one), the series seemed to be headed toward an immediate crescendo—and in a way, it was. The tension and perversion builds throughout volume 6 and climaxes in the first chapter of volume 7. It’s cataclysmic to the lives of the series’ characters, and its effects mark everyone for the remainder of the story.With the second chapter of volume 7, however, everything changes. The narrative’s tone is markedly altered. None of the overt tensions or perversions remain. Kasuga’s world has gone colourless and mundane. He’s a subdued wallflower in his new highschool, hesitantly going along with wherever his social circle’s current pulls him. By volume 6 he’s destroyed his copy of Baudelaire, signifying either a culmination or a new direction (we’re pressed to wait and see to discern which is the case); but by volume 7, Kasuga has given up entirely on reading. He’s nearly a blank slate. He seems rudderless, and less patient readers will suspect the same of the series.[image]As the third major arc of the story set in, readers discussing the series were concerned that Oshimi had lost steam and direction. It’s not uncommon that a story’s popularity will extend its publication beyond the point that its narrative can reasonably sustain.[1] But while Oshimi moves Flowers of Evil in drastically different directions, the new vector actually presents a kind of salvation for a narrative that had gone so far off the rails that it likely couldn’t have recovered without some compelling rearrangement of the furniture. So it is that with his new direction, Oshimi is given the rug with which to really pull the room together.___My wife rather loathed Flowers of Evil, at least at first. She read the first five volumes in order to help me get a handle on the book for my previous . She was repulsed. The repellent nature of the kids’ depravities gave a feeling of nauseated horror. I talked somewhat about how unsettling the books could be in my . It wasn’t the easiest sell to get her to read the rest of the series, but I wanted someone to bounce ideas off. In the end, she felt the books redeemed themselves and ended up glad she had finished entire series. I felt the same. This was an exciting series to encounter. There’s a lot here, much food for much thought.[image]___One of the essential elements of discussion throughout Flowers of Evil, from beginning to end, is the nature and necessity of perversion. Characters’ interaction with the perverse, whether to embrace it or to demur, is at the heart of their futures—whether they with be able to transverse the mountains walling their pubescent selves off from the broad wide and exotic world that seems to only exist in their dreams and visions. Without the drive to perversion, these kids will be trapped in their stultifying provincial lives. But taking on the mantle of pervert creates a window into a whole new world of opportunities. This is a lodestone given from the series’ beginning, but the nature of what exactly is perversion is a question that Oshimi elides until his finale.In the first two arcs (culminating in the first chapter of volume 7), Kasuga and Nakamura’s quest for the perverse manifests as mere dilettantism. They steal intimate articles of clothing, they display those articles, they wreck a school room, they run away, they cause a touch of social mayhem, they talk back to authority figures, and they attempt self-immolation. Essentially, they act out in the ineffectual manner that the voiceless often do (I mean, minus the panty-thefts),[2] and the wider culture has no mechanism by which to hear (let alone comprehend) their anguish. Throughout these arcs, Kasuga struggles to understand perversion. He recognizes its necessity, but cannot get his hands around what all it entails. He sees perversion as the means to saving and protecting Nakamura (in his terms, allowing her to get to the other side), but his inability to ascertain what perversion actually means in their context consigns Nakamura to destruction (fortunately abortive).[image]With the rise of the third act, Kasuga isn’t any closer to discovering the nature of perversion, but the need to understand has moved from immediate to remote. He has no contact with Nakamura and is alone in a new context at first very different from his prior secluded rural community. He’s largely content only to exist until he’s occasionally reminded of Nakamura. After one such reminder shocks him into remembering his earlier raison d’etre, Kasuga plaintively broaches the subject with some thuggish types: Here I am, still alive. Breathing my pathetic breaths when there’s no reason. How ought I to go on living? How do I live as shamelessly as you guys do?It’s unlikely that Kasuga actually suspects these toughs of holding any of the keys to his reawakening dilemma, but he’s still got a taste for self-destruction and the moment does catalyze his renewed need to understand perversion. To underscore the rebirth of his quest and emphasize the new direction it will chart, he moments later encounters a kind of surrogate for Nakamura in the form of Tokiwa—and in a fit of contrivance, Oshimi has her looking at Baudelaire’s Fleur du mal. Tokiwa is several times referenced as bearing a resemblance to Nakamura, though for the most part the comparison seems only glancingly justified by a miniscule physical likeness. Regardless, Kasuga’s growing friendship with Tokiwa gives him a constant reminder of the desire to understand his suspicion that perversion is necessary to a true life. This continued interest in the flowers of evil (the series emblem for the Perverse) gives the series a connection with the prior two acts—even while the governing narrative is remarkably more subdued.[image]Kasuga is growing up and Oshimi’s Flowers of Evil is obvious bildungsroman, being dedicated “to all the boys and girls suffering the torment of puberty, and to all the boys and girls who have ever suffered the torments of puberty.” In my previous  of the series, I remarked at length on the kind of wild expression against the ragged inequities of the world as the young teen encounters it. In this third arc, Kasuga (no longer in junior high) has largely put aside that overt kind of rebellion against his society and begins exploring the garden of earthly delights available to the regular citizen in contemporary Japanese society—all in his own broken and awkward manner, of course. In eventually coming to pursue a relationship with Tokiwa, he struggles to maintain the sense of a peaceful life while simultaneously still investigating his unanswered questions. Even his relationship with Tokiwa is in some degree an attempt to discover the end to which he is destined. Kasuga encourages Tokiwa to write and finish her novel because he recognizes it as being his own story and needs some sense of where it will all end for himself. He needs to know that there’s some hope that his quest will be completed.When Saeki reappears, Kasuga’s precarious plans begin to sputter. He had tried to play the straight and had looked for satisfaction in subsuming his perverse side, but Saeki (made bitter by their junior high disasters) unravels that with a simple, surgical question: Will you make her unhappy too? (Said with a smile that says she knows Kasuga in some ways better than he does himself.) This instigates a confrontation with the spectre of Baudelaire’s flower in which Kasuga’s fears are addressed and he comes to recognize that before he can settle his account and complete his growth, he needs to understand why Nakamura denied him participation in what was to be their final act of perversion. In a kind of vision-moment he crushes Baudelaire’s flower, a signification that his quest for perversion will remain on hold until he understands Nakamura. Kasuga underscores his new mindset by pursuing a safe, comfortable, non-perverse relationship, but he’s torn by a conflict. He hopes to find his answers through Tokiwa, but simultaneously he knows he needs resolution with Nakamura. He spends some salad days, playing the pleasant young man next to Tokiwa’s industrious, eager-to-please burgeoning young novelist, but we find the crushed flower has left a remnant stain in his palm and soon its tendriling petals begin to assert themselves. Kasuga’s realization that he cannot fully escape his path without first dealing with it prompts him to return to his old town, where he encounters both death (of a relative) and a means to resolving his quest (the location of the long-absent Nakamura). [image]This revelation prompts a total confession to Tokiwa (who could previously only guess at Kasuga’s past) and through some tumult prompts the couple to confront Nakamura. In a sense, Oshimi lets Kasuga have his cake and eat it too. Tokiwa, initially pissed and bereft, becomes the active instigator in Kasuga’s resolution with Nakamura. Almost from beginning to end, their reunion is Tokiwa’s show, emphasizing just how essential she will be to Kasuga’s solution going forward. In a final, ecstatic culmination to Kasuga’s confrontation with Nakamura,[3] Nakamura reiterates—this time verbally—her reason for pushing Kasuga off the stage at the end of the second story arc. “Don’t ever come back. You normal-man.” Nakamura releases Kasuga from his quest to solve her by suggesting that he was never going to be able to have the brand of perversity she’d require. It’s not the end of his quest, but it’s a step. It gives him time to consider and removes the immediacy of what he perceived as a threat to Nakamura. Even though she’s clearly not All Well, she’s not in any present danger.So we in the penultimate chapter catch up with Kasuga in college. He’s reading Baudelaire again, but as an assignment. He’s not suffering from any of the obsessiveness of youth. His relationship with Tokiwa remains sturdy. She continues writing and studying and he, still a bit rudderless, ponders the spectral blank canvas of a composition book. In a post-coital reverie, Kasuga dreams mundane, pleasant, happy, normal futures for all the principal characters who’ve expressed their deep brokeness throughout the series. Kasuga and Tokiwa are together with children. Saeki is happily married. Kinoshita, who was bereft at being left behind and unable to escape the mountains, is visited by former best friend Saeki. And Nakamura is well-adjusted and is happily reacquainted with the father who saved her from self-immolation back in junior high. The curiosity that marks this dream as something Of Import is that it is presaged by Kasuga, standing naked and stripped bare before the reborn Flower of Evil, with one of its tendril-petals brushing his chest right where Nakamura tore at him years earlier. This marks, I believe, the following scenes as the ultimate perversion. If one considers how junior high Kasuga and Nakamura would react to Kasuga’s dream, we recognize that Kasuga has reached his ultimate understanding of perversion. If the “acting out” of the junior high years is a dilettante’s version of perversion, then the adult’s version is the acquiescence of social normalization—though not with doe-eyed acceptance but as a visceral considered response to the bald inequity of the world. Kasuga dreams the life of the true pervert and wakes to make that a reality so far as his power will allow.[image]The first act of the rest of his life after receiving this moment of enlightenment is to open up his composition book and write. And what he writes is a single tendril-petal. This moment is anthemic for him. This is what defines him moving forward. He, like Baudelaire, will find the exotic in the mundane. He will be rapturously transported by his proximity to living the normal, pleasant life with Tokiwa. And perhaps most perverse, he will make this happen for Nakamura as well—if not in reality then at least in the province of fiction. The final chapter of Oshimi’s story requires a bit of effort to interpret, but works best when understood as the first chapter of Kasuga’s new novel, the continuation of what he writes after drawing that evil petal at the close of the dream chapter. In his dream, Kasuga feverishly writes the futures of all his friends, page after page, a tremendous sprawling manuscript. When he wakes, Kasuga takes up this task for real. And in Flowers of Evil's final chapter, we see Kasuga write Nakamura’s history, placing himself in the story as saviour. Everyone involved is perverse save for Nakamura and eventually, we see, Kasuga. Nakamura is threatened to be swallowed by the perversion but Kasuaga offers her salvation. Nakamura doesn’t know it at the time, but this is the very salvation Kasuga dreams for her in the prior chapter. His perversion is complete. Perversion and normalcy blend and mix and become indistinguishable but for the motive on which they are founded. __The last couple years of following Oshimi’s wild trail have been envigourating. Flowers of Evil takes a couple fascinating turns and keeps readers on their toes wondering what will happen next. And while early on I was uncertain of just how much I would enjoy the book, in the end it was just a really cool exploration of growing up. Oshimi’s page design is always solid and his art generally avoids the hiccoughs of the earlier chapters (save for the continuing recurrance of characters with the odd oversized antihelix). If it weren’t for the unwieldy length at eleven volumes, I’d suggest that Flowers of Evil would make the perfect book club book, as it’s ripe for discussion._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) An immediate example is Death Note, a series positively swollen with tension through its first five volumes. The creators had originally intended to wrap with that climax, but the wild popularity of the series caused publishers to push them to extend the story for twice the length intended. And while the second half undulates beneath the seas of Goodness and Acceptability, those are so far and distinct from the pure greatness of what came before that most readers feel cheated by the introduction of the new characters, Near and Mello.2) This is not meant as a judgment against the voiceless but more as a comment on the inherently mute nature of voicelessness.3) After a four-page spread that may be my favourite bit of the entire series....more",Notes are private!,1,18,1,not set,not set,"Nov 02, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/21532285-the-flowers-of-evil-vol-11

Hiking, skimboarding, boogieboarding, skateboarding, running, jumping, destroying things that weren’t my body. It was an awesome time to be alive. I was reckless and wild and harboured little care for decisions that entailed in some form or other the principal question of How much is this going to hurt? Twenty years later, nearly every activity I choose to engage revolves distinctly around how much discomfort or outright pain the activity might incur. Because unfortunately, all those wonderful things I could do eventually seemed focused on a single goal: destroying things that were my body.In my early-to-mid twenties, miscalculation and overestimation brought me injury after injury. Head injuries, neck injuries, back injuries. Ankles, shoulders, fingers, hands, knees, groin. Injuries so far as eyes could see and injuries in dark places hidden by layers of flesh and sinew. I was used to healing quickly and so used to returning to activity quickly, sometimes even instantly. As I grew older, the pace of my healing slowed but my habits didn’t care and so I bounced back from my wounds too quickly and, being off-balance, slow, and in a body that wasn’t one-hundred-percent operational, I compounded my injuries. The fallout of course is that now, so many years later, I live in near constant pain. From ankles that sprain and swell while Facebooking to a back that cannot survive a sneeze to shoulders that cannot throw a tennis ball overhand. Sitting on the ground for a half hour will ruin me for a week. Rolling over in bed means waking again for the tenth time in half as many hours. Fascinating, I know.[1]The point of all this is to say that when I was younger, I wanted to be Broxo or Zora. Now though, I am content merely to take in their vagabond adventures. Even though half my concern for them is tied to how badly I would hurt the next morning had I the need to sleep in the conditions that make up their daily ritual.The titular Broxo (of Zack Giallongo’s Broxo) is not the main character of his own book. That distinction goes to Zora, a warrior cut more from the mold of Miyazaki princesses than from Disney’s pampered-chef variety. She’s no fan of slumming in the wastelands, but she’s doing her bit to support her family’s vision of uniting the five clans under a single purpose—and because that end requires means so unappetizing as crawling the wastes, that’s what she will do. She’s pretty badass like that. Plus, she has awesome little decorative wings on the side of her headband and she’s easily the first character I’ve ever seen pull that one off. (Sorry Captain America. Sorry Hermes. Sorry Hawkman.) She’s also smart, tenacious, and maybe not so competent with a sword as the loner she meets, a boy king named Broxo.[image][Really, it’s hard to argue, even if he has worse skinned kneesthan my son. Who wobbles when he walks.]Broxo opens with Zora cresting a plateau in search of the Peryton clan so that she might deliver the news of unification, that all the people of the Penthos might once more be as one. She finds instead a pretty shabby place, a land mostly of gloom and murk—deserted save for a small few inhabitants, each with their own things going on. One of these is Broxo, and the remainder of the book dwells on their interactions and adventures. These, despite their clash of cultures and the gathering darkness, are a joy to follow.I’ll tell you this now: the fact that there isn’t presently a sequel to Broxo rushing from the printers to the publisher on its way to a speedy distribution breaks my heart. Because I want more of these two. I want more adventures that will make me hurt all over vicariously (even if the characters themselves seem immune to my own current frailties). Giallongo has charmed me.[image][]A large part of Broxo's depth is founded on its principal two characters. Both Zora and Broxo are mixes of strengths and weaknesses, a combination whose powers come to outweigh its inadequacies. Zora is brave but foolhardy and reckless. She’s good with a bow and okay with a sword. She’s driven by her ambitions but is a bit ethnocentric, leaning on the belief that her civilization (the one doing the uniting) is the superior and that what’s left of Broxo’s betrays barbarian savagery. To usurp Avatar, she’s got a lot to learn before she’s ready to unite anybody.Broxo is himself a strong fighter, wily, and at home with the dangers of the plateau, but he’s ignorant of many things. He’s weighed down by a history he only partly knows and a past he’s largely forgotten. He’s far from socialized and despite his guileless overtures, he trips a number of social blunders that make working together with Zora a difficulty. He has a larger responsibility than he’s aware and swaggers a bit more than he deserves.[image][That ma-ha-jick moment!]The beautiful thing about Broxo is watching these two strong figures bend and snap and bend again in order to preserve their lives, understand each other, and ultimately evolve closer to that personal state that was previously sequestered in the realm of Mere Potential. As in any realistic growth situation, there’s friction and forgiveness. It’s a good and well-thought-out relationship and not one I expected to find in what is essentially a Conan-esque tale of adventure, fantasy, and zombie apocalypsis.[image][]Though threats come from several quarters and are due several motives, the most overt trouble comes from the Creepers. Also called the Ancestors, these undead roam across the plateau bringing doom where they tread. Their existence is new to Zora, so their plight on the plateau occupies a kind of facile mystery element in the story. They are the bow that Giallongo ties to neatly draw together so many of his narrative threads. That they’re well-conceived saves us from feeling that we’re reading one more overcooked zombie book in what has been something of a decade-long glut of the material. That they’re not just shambling once-deads is important and for me was first underscored when Broxo has to fend off a child Creeper. It’s a good story moment.Giallongo’s art is lively and his figures well-composed. His staging, whether we consider his characters, their actions, or his landscapes, is immaculately designed. We’ll often read praise of certain novels or films in which the artist so invests the creative impulse into depicting the location that the location itself becomes a character. Paul Auster’s New York City in City of Glass and its sequels. Sergio Leone’s Old West in Once Upon a Time in the West. Et cetera. Giallongo does this very thing with his depiction of the Peryton’s plateau. Its very anatomy tells you who it is and alludes to the story it enfolds. I’m not sure it’s fair, but I couldn’t shake the sense that Giallongo is a man influenced by Miyazaki (as should we all be). Beyond the presence of his environments and some of his staging, many of Giallongo’s character designs may have fallen right out of, say, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. See? Check out this old lady:[image][Sooooo Miyazaki!]I’m glad I read Broxo, even if I squirmed to see the conditions in which these characters relaxed. (It’s one thing to tread a stony path and another to lounge on it.) There was a time when I may have been able to keep pace with their antics, but that is a distant history. It hurts to be reminded of my decline over the years, but the relish with which Giallongo approaches his characters and their plight brings out the sunshine again. I wasn’t entirely truthful in my earlier stated desire for a sequel to Broxo. The truth is I want four. At least._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) A particularly bitter irony is that I still subconsciously think of myself as an athlete. Playing with my kids, I still daily overextend myself without thinking.

It’s [image]This weekend Richard Linklater’s Before Midnight lands in metropolitan theaters across America [ originally published in May 2013]. It’s a film that I am hotly anticipating and one I’m hotly anticipating landing in less metropolitan regions of the country. Before Midnight is the third in what may be my all-time favourite film series and follows Before Sunrise and its sequel, Before Sunset. And while I currently feel my blood vibrate in anticipation for a new sequel to Before Sunrise, this wasn’t always the case.A decade ago when I heard there was going to be a sequel to Before Sunrise, taking place nine years after Sunrise's final moments, I was skeptical. The audacity that Jesse and Celine would happen to meet again for the first time in nearly a decade screamed: “Gimmick.” I will admit to some excitement and anticipation, as I was a tremendous fan of the first film and was cautiously optimistic. Still, I had a hard time seeing how a sequel set nine years later could in any way seamlessly flow from Jesse and Celine’s Long Conversation in Vienna (not official title). I was terrified that one of my favourite films would be diminished by someone’s need to force a sequel. But the funny thing about gimmicks is that they sometimes pay off.In Before Sunset, the gimmick does pay off and Linklater delivers a maddeningly compelling film that actually enhances the value of the earlier film.[1] Happily for Teddy Kristiansen’s and Steven T. Seagle’s gimmick-steeped collaboration on The Red Diary/The Re[a]d Diary, their own gimmick pays off well and each half bestows a kind of blessing on the other half.Explaining this book’s gimmick is almost certainly going to be obnoxious, but without the explanation it will be almost impossible to convey the wonder of the work. I’ll try to keep this brief. The project began as a single book, Le Carnet Rouge, written and drawn by Seagle’s occasional collaborator, Teddy Kristiansen.[2] Seagle loved Kristiansen’s art on the book and wanted to bring it over to America under Image’s Man of Action imprint—only Seagle would have to be directly involved in the book’s writing for the work to be published through Man of Action. And as the book was already written by Kristiansen, that wouldn’t fly. Seagle might have gotten away with publishing via a translation credit, but he speaks neither French nor Danish (Le Carnet Rouge had already been translated into Danish. So he came up with the bizarro gimmick that would give us two books in one (the volume is presented flipbook-style, with each story reading from its respective front cover to the book’s center).Here's a Vine showing the book's layout: https://vine.co/v/bVO2JOPjOWYThrough a process Seagle terms transliteration (but is really nothing like what everyone else means by transliteration), Seagle took the Danish version of the text and adapted its sounds into something like English, then cleaned that up and massaged it into a coherent story. (In the end notes I’ll provide the example that Seagle uses to illustrate the process.) The surface-level trick is that his story is wildly different from Kristiansen’s. Using the same art. The real trick though is that both his version and Kristiansen’s are very good stories, regardless of either their process of generation or how very little they resemble each other.[image][Here’s an example. Seagle’s “transliteration” is on top and Kristiansen’s original is below.]Both tread some of the same thematic ground, exploring characters whose identities are in flux, who submit to war as means to escape the self, and both feature a man named William Ackroyd who seeks to untangle a history divulged through a collection of diaries. But in Kristiansen’s book, Ackroyd is a biographer researching a poet who stumbles upon a more interesting story. In Seagle’s, Ackroyd is a former artist whose works are celebrated though the War took his ability to produce. In Seagle’s, Ackroyd experienced the fullest measure of WWI’s trench warfare. In Kristiansen’s, Ackroyd may not have yet been born at the time of WWI. Both stories concern a British painter in 1910 Paris (Seagle specifies Montparnasse), but their stories and experiences are very different. Both end up fleeing Paris, but in Kristiansen’s in fear for his life and in Seagle’s in fear for his soul.[image]Both stories are excellent, but at less than seventy pages perhaps rather slight. Put together and in contradistinction, Kristiansen’s and Seagle’s sororal twin stories present a powerful exploration of both the human condition and the narrative craft. Taking the opportunity to tell the two fully different stories under an identical restrictive framework gives the reader a unique porthole through which to observe the vagaries of the human spirit. Where Seagle’s story might initially appear as mere technical exercise (perhaps a challenge to himself if nothing else), the final result is intriguing and entirely worthwhile. In comparing the two stories while reading—almost an inevitability due to the format of the project—the ingenuity of both creators is magnified through a sort of meta-story that extends beyond the words and plotlines and art.[image]As with another big release from 2012, Building Stories, the order of revelation may be important as well. Depending on which version of the story a reader takes in first, impression of the other will shift and be somewhat governed by the experience of the first. The first time I read the two stories, I tackled Seagle’s “transliteration” first and followed that with Kristiansen’s original. Two days ago, I reread the work and reversed the order. My experience of the two short stories was quite different. Part of this would owe to the removal of suspense over just what is going on, but I think the larger part is how the reading of one book informs the phenomenon of the second. And vice versa.[image]Kristiansen’s art is brilliant as usual and is the strongest part of what makes Seagle’s gimmick here plausible. He conveys the variant Ackroyd’s stories through his usual downbeat palette and lightly impressionistic strokes. The art is vague enough to be read through multiple lenses (essential for Seagle’s scripting conceit), but concrete enough that we can grasp his figures as material solids, people whose lives matter with the kind of tangibility that breeds empathy. And while Kristiansen relies often on desaturated and muted earthtones and blues (lending a weighted mood to much of the work), he includes bursts of occasional red that feed fire into the reading. As well, some brighter outdoor scenes lend a trickle of the verdant to both stories, reminding us that even the reccountment of past woes can be lent verve in the manner of the telling.[image]Unlike Before Sunset, I find myself unable to forget entirely my initial thought that The Red Diary/The Re[a]d Diary combination is forged of a gimmick. It’s too thoroughly the book’s foundation and identity. But it doesn’t matter. The project embraces its gimmick completely and shows definitively that such tricks cannot determine the success or failure of a work; instead and unsurprisingly, it comes down to the usual mystery of craft, vision, and competency. Read this book/books/whatever it is.“Transliteration”Seagle provides an example of his process in the book’s backmatter (which is really actually middlematter since this is a flipbook). These are the opening lines of the book:Kunsten kan, på sin egan brutale måde, få alle til at føle en rus, som en frygtelig sygdom, men måske den smukkeste af alle sygdomme.Through “transliteration” this becomes:Constant can father’s sin even brutality made for all til it falls in ruin some in foretelling wisdom men made the mistake of all wisdoms.Then he cleans it up a bit:Forever will man’s sins of brutality make for mankind until it fall in ruin wisdom itself foretells that man makes his mistakes in the name of wisdom.And finally another pass renders it:Forever will man’s sins of brutality make pain for all men—until they fall to ruin—who claim that their mistakes were made in the name of a greater wisdom.Pretty weird, huh? Regardless, Seagle does something magical between the Danish and his final script. I don’t know just how much massaging was done to the text but I imagine that in places, the conscious reinvention had to be pretty substantial in order to maintain the fluidity of the narrative (especially with regard to names of characters)._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) And if critics are to be believed, Before Midnight does the same for both of its own precursors.2) The two worked together on the lauded It’s a Bird… and the soon-to-be lauded Genius.

The fact is a lot of us can probably relate in at least some manner to Ted Halker, his sense of alienation, and his frustrating struggle to live up to his potential—especially while others may seem to live up to theirs almost effortlessly. I may not be a genius (or maybe I am!), but I’ve lived Ted’s trials with exactitude. If you don’t count the particulars of his plotline.[image][Truth.]The question of potential and potentialities looms over Seagle and Kristiansen’s latest collaboration, Genius. The book’s eponymous genius, Ted, is haunted by what he could be if only he would be what he could be. He’s likewise stalked by the undeterrable weaving of fate and the question of how his actions in the present might deterministically prompt the ultimate form of that tapestry. It’s a trim book and an easy read, but it tussles with concepts that lend their own formidable weight to the whole enterprise. The questions of ethics, will, determinism, responsibility, and sacrifice form the bedrock of (if not all then many) introductory philosophy courses—because, after all, these are the questions that plague our human existence. Their answers (and even more: the demurring to answer) have ranging effects in the personal, familial, and community spheres. Seagle and Kristiansen avoid specifics for the most part but do suggest an angle of descent for approaching broadly the ethics of circumstance. It’s likely that the creative team’s purpose was more to provoke the question in their readers than it was to propose a solution—and so far as this is their goal, I believe most will find their book a success. They leave plenty of room for discussion, neither making Ted a paragon nor a villain for his final solution. I imagine that every book club to discuss Genius will ask in some form or another the question, “What would you have done in Ted’s place?” A kind of Sophie’s choice gimme of a question that is nonetheless appropriate for all its cliched guise of introspection.[1]Writing a story about a character who is a genius is probably the most difficult kind of story there is to write. Creating a believable character who is substantially different from the author is never easy and falls apart in any number of aspects that are just plainly beyond the writer’s grasp. We see this all the time when a man is writing a female protagonist, when a white woman is writing a black woman, when a straight woman is writing a gay man, when an atheist is writing a believer, or vicey-versa. Writing someone who is not you is incredibly difficult to accomplish in a manner that could be mistaken for verisimilitude. But in each of these cases, a little bit of empathy can go a long way toward selling the illusion. The old trick of using one’s imagination to walk a mile or kilometer or league in another’s soles really can help bridge the gulf between author and character. The problem with writing a genius is that no amount of empathy or imagination can make your character smarter than that character’s author. Because of this, it’s rare to encounter a figure within the literary tradition who actually feels like the genius he or she is meant to be.[image][Still, whatever the case, floating Einstein will always be a genius.]To ease the tension and help prompt the myth of intellectual brilliance, writers have a number of tricks at their disposal—gimmicks that can help sell the heroic smarts of their protagonists. A small list of a number of these:• The character will tell you that they are a genius. Or at least passingly mention their IQ or how Mensa is beneath them.• The character will give you simple-but-quirky explanations for everyday things as proof of their above average intellect. • They will have a genius-person job.• They will scribble equations on things. It doesn’t matter whether the equations are legit or related to their field of study or accurate. All that matters is that the equations are scribbled—because without either familiarity with the equation being scribbled or what the variables represent, the reader will just have to take on faith that the complexity is relevant and accurate.• Jargon, doesn’t even have to be real. Quantum gyrations. Planck strings. Acoustic radiation. Perpentudinal ethnoplexies. (See also 97% of all sci-fi stories.)• Name dropping of peers. Einstein. Schroedinger. Dirac. Quine. Russell.There are other gimmicks, but these are common. And better, they’re generally acceptable ways to aid in the reader’s suspension of disbelief. And I’m not complaining, really. How much worse would it be for an ostensibly popular work to essay a completely believable and legitimately genius protagonist? Only the slimmest percentage of the readership would understand any of it.[2] [image][Smart guy being oblivious to female biology, however: that is a sure marker of genius.]So when we discover that Seagle and Kristiansen rely on the standard bag of tricks, it’s at first understandable if still a bit disappointing. (I really want to read about a genius and actually rationally believe he is a genius, but still enjoy reading about him. Chimeric, I know.) But after a few pages, we realize that it doesn’t matter so much. We’re not going to be asked to believe that Ted will solve impossible equations like Matt Damon in Good Will Hunting. We’re not going to see Ted put into a situation where his genius will be put on display. We’re not going to be asked to believe it when Ted contradicts scientific theory and changes the world for the next century. That’s the stuff of biographies and isn’t what the creative team has on its plate for Genius. Instead, and amusingly (probably), Seagle and Kristiansen propose a very mundane problem—one sadly enough encountered by non-genius people every day. Ted’s intellect allows him an improbable out, if he will take it, but otherwise this is really the tale of every one of us in some respect. Potential and potentialities. Ted’s story is about the weighing of consequences and “being man enough”[3] to take responsibility for the results of our judgments. It’s about who we are and who we might become. It might be the story of a genius but it doesn’t need to be. And while Seagle and Kristiansen involve Albert Einstein’s ghost rather often and rather effectively, he’s really only the crutch Ted needs to become what he might become. Scientist as catalyst.[image][This panel was harrowing to me. Been there, done that.]So here’s a funny thing about Seagle/Kristiansen books. I always want to read them until I pick them up. I read that a new collaboration is to be published and I get excited, remembering how much I enjoyed their last creation. Then I get the book, thumb through it, and decide that maybe I’ll wait a while and read it when I’m in the mood. There’s no real justification for it save for Kristiansen’s palette. The artist uses downbeat colours that are dingied and desaturated. If a range of colours could be given a name, Kristiansen’s would be named Eeyore. There is none of that cheery blossom of wonder that fills Miyazaki’s works, none of that alternating between soft and bold that marks Glyn Dillon’s latest. Even Frank Miller’s Dark Knight, which often has a similar monotone of blues and greys, employs its hues to bursting dramatic effect. So in a sense, I’m always predisposed to not enjoy these Seagle/Kristiansen ventures. Which is great because I always end up deeply appreciating their work and thinking that Kristiansen is probably the perfect artist to bring Seagle’s stories to visual life. Despite my initial reluctance, I always discover myself pretty amazed at what Kristiansen can do, and while reading I never find myself feeling the visual tone unwieldy or too depressing. So you’d think I would learn. I probably won’t (I’m not that kind of genius), but I really ought to.Genius, for all its slim page count (126 pages!), is a lovely and thoughtful work. I’m hoping that by year’s end, the book will be Number 15 in my best-of-the-year list—because that would mark 2013 a truly phenomenal year for comics. As it is, I don’t doubt that Genius will land in my Top 5 (even as Kristiansen and Seagle’s The Red Diary did for 2012). I’m enthusiastic for the book. Because it’s Good. And even probably Very Good.The One Thing I HatedThis is almost a triviality, but a triviality that was so pervasive that it constantly threatened my reading of the book. Genius uses a handful of typefaces rather than hand-lettering. No big deal, that. Almost everything these days uses custom fonting and you’ll hear no complaint from me. If I were to put out a book, I’d probably do the same. The problem with Genius is not that it uses typefaces but with one of the typefaces used.Particularly with respect to lowercase Ts and Rs. Here’s the first panel I noticed the problem:[image]The Rs and Ts are so similar that I thought Ted’s father-in-law was calling Albert Einstein Bett and referring to his real name as Albett. The guy’s suffering a bit of dementia, so it’s not impossible. But he’s not calling Einstein “Bett.” It’s only the font that makes it look like that. Here’s an up-close comparison of the two letters: [image]They’re different, but not remarkably so. My wife stumbled on the lack of distinction earlier than me in this panel where Ted makes a deal with his son. She was baffled at why Ted would offer his son a used cat.[image][The idea of Ted offering his son a used catis actually way funnier than his actual offer.]Again, it’s not a big deal, but I’m disappointed that the issue exists at all._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) Cliched because what moderator on earth would avoid such an obvious line of group inquiry. Guise because what impossibly slim percentage of book club members discussing Genius are actually going to themselves be geniuses and therefore be able to calculate the complications of Ted’s position?2) One of the greatest praises of Ottaviani’s Feynman is that he renders Richard Feynman’s legitimate genius in a readable, easy-going way (thanks in part to Feynman’s own work in rendering himself approachable). This becomes the more evident when Ottaviani unleashes an unexpurgated Feynman on the reader in the form of for-reals science in a concluding lecture, wherein Feynman endeavors to explain QED to an audience (and the reader). It’s mostly impenetrable to the average reader, but because it’s a short moment, it drives home Feynman’s intellect and imagination in a way that gimmicks could never do.3) I do not invoke Manliness because I carry any special affection for the concept but only because Ted’s father-in-law values manliness and balls and real men et cetera....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Nov 02, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16075920-genius

I predated by a few years the rather briskly paced evolution of alt sexualities from something horrifying to kids to something that kids could dabble in without too much fear of ostracizing. I grew up in a town whose homosexuals-per-capita population was second in the state behind San Francisco. We were all pretty well aware of how common open homosexual lifestyles were in the town. We knew about the Little Shrimp. We knew about Sneaky Pete's. We knew about the Different Drummer bookshop. And yet, for all that, ""homo"" and ""fag"" were still slurs, and when a rumour spread in junior high that this one guy was playing pocket pinball in class, the whole school took it upon themselves to brand him as gay and therefore worthy of a derision that remained probably all the way through high school for the poor guy. We were all little bastards and didn't really have the cultural wherewithal to learn any differently. There certainly wasn't an internet out there to help us empathize with different people's stories about being different. Even when some of us turned out to be different in the ways we previously derided.I'm not sure that having a book like Wandering Son would have helped when I was a kid, but it wouldn't have hurt, I don't think. At worst I would have written it off as gross—but even so, I would have seen another perspective. One I wouldn't see for nearly a decade more.[image][That's the trouble with girls.]Story time. In a gathering of high school kids for some event or other, there was a game in which people would have to perform some stunt of the leader's choosing. One of them was to speak in a gay lisp. Five-sixths of the guys involved wouldn't participate—not because it was insensitive and othering—but because it was too gross. A friend of mine took a trip to Africa and this tribe's chief took his hand, wanting to show him the village. My friend shook off that man's hand. Fifteen years later he is still proud of that decision. In high school, at a school in the center of the second gayest town in California, there was a boy who tried out for the cheerleading squad. He was immediately deemed gay. I don't even know if he ever wore a cheer skirt or if he wanted to. Of course that wouldn't have had anything to do with his sexual preferences—we wouldn't have known that—but at least within the scope of our warped cultural pericope, that would have been slim justification for our prejudice. As it was, the mere hint of peculiarity in terms of sex or gender presumptions was enough to send us all into a whirlwind of confusion and antipathy.Again, I'm not sure that having read Wandering Son would have helped, but it very well may have. Anything that humanizes the targets of othering is worthwhile because empathizing with those who are Not You and Not Like You is essential to loving them as you do yourself. And above everything else that it does so well, Wandering Son humanizes its characters—regardless of how much they deviate from the cultural norms their societies dictate.[1] When I first approached Wandering Son I was concerned that, like so many works that have lessons to impart, it would come off as didactic and proselytizing. Instead, we have this warm-hearted, gentle story about a collection of kids growing up. Wandering Son doesn't lay out any argument for the humanity of its characters who diverge from social expectation. It doesn't need to.[image][Pro-tip from a non-pro: don't answer the door in a dress if you don't want to be seen in a dress.]Takako's book allows you to grow comfortable with these kids as you would members of your own family. You see them happy; you see them hurt. You see their dreams; you see their fears. You see them reaching for lives that make sense to them, struggling even as we all do to find comfort and value in the things that attract our affections—all while trying desperately not to have our spirits crushed along the way.One thing I appreciated about Wandering Son is how neatly it eviscerates the presumption that transgressing gender distinction also necessarily informs sexual preferences. Growing up, it was the law of my land that transvestitism also meant homosexuality. A man who wore his wife's clothes in secret also obviously harboured a closeted homosexuality. A woman who dressed in man's attire[2] was giving off strong lesbian cues. Our understanding of the immutability of gender and its ties to sexuality offered us no room for understanding things in any other way. Wandering Son, by beginning its narrative journey in elementary school, removes sexual preference from the initial spectrum of topics—at least for the principal characters, if not for their peripheral antagonists (who engage in all the weak-minded slurs I would have ejaculated when I was their age). Series lead, Shu, a fifth-grade boy who gradually finds himself dressing more and more in girls' clothing does so wholly apart from any sexual interest. He simply enjoys looking like the archetypical young girl. So too with his opposite number, a girl named Takatsuki, who likes to dress as a male (which is easier for her to get away with, since male clothing is increasingly bi-sexual). In the first volume she begins her period, underscoring her sex despite her objection to normative gender cues, but has so far not had any opportunity to express her sexuality.[3] [4][image]While pretty clearly a book intending to explore the social issues involved in the gender/sex confluence of spectral anomalies—and one that so far as I can tell does a pretty stellar job at that investigation—Wandering Son is foremost an interesting story. I don't think it could possibly succeed at drawing out its social questions if it failed to present well-described human characters in largely believable[5] narrative circumstances. These characters move and speak in realistic, human ways. They aren't cartooned caricatures of pedagogical lances meant to joust with our presuppositions. They may actually do some of that jousting, but it's only because they are realized characters that they have any power to blossom empathy in our hearts.[image][It can be tough being a freshly minted man...]The art is rather lovely, the lines fine and bold. Takako employs a simple illustration style that provokes the reader to focus on characters, their expressions, and the way they carry themselves. The illustration of the book in every way serves the purpose of the story and its unadorned vitality both keeps the reader from distraction and invests characters with an immediacy that helps sell the illusion of their reality. Fantagraphics' production on the book gives the art plenty of room in which to luxuriate. The pages are large and the paper thick. For hardbacks, these volumes are surprisingly light. They are beautifully produced and will look handsome on a shelf. The only drawback is that considering their not-insubstantial size and the fact that there are currently fifteen volumes available in Japan, these will easily take up a whole shelf in many bookcases (and of course, for fans with plenty of space to grow, this might not be a bad thing).In a year of some fantastic books, Wandering Son continues to shine and is easily recommendable. It can be a handy introduction to a different kind of experience for those who come from generations with more ossified social beliefs (such as my own generation); and it can function as a great segue for parents to begin discussing social/sexual issues with their children. Complex moral structures treated with humanity and care is one of my favourite hallmarks of good literature—and in case you hadn't guessed, I'd happily deposit Wandering Son in the category of Good Comics Literature.[image]_____________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_____________Footnotes1) Which should be easy, right? Because these characters are human. Really, we shouldn't even need a book to make the effort, but even my own very narrow personal history demonstrates with force that we do need books to make the effort.2) Granted, ""men's attire"" is a rapidly diminishing category of fashion. 3) Honestly, when I was their age, I wanted so very badly to ""hump"" my crush into oblivion, but that was mostly just me going with social expectation. Though I bore affection for a girl, it wasn't really sexual, I don't think. For one, I was prepubescent. For another, I really only had the vaguest understanding of what ""humping"" included. I understood the reproductive aspect and I understood that I should want to do this thing, but I had no real libido and so no visceral understanding of how sexual desire actually worked. I had, instead, a stand-in for that desire that was constructed from expectation more than anything. 4) Homosexuality does become topical later in the series.5) Not being Japanese, I don't really have any sense of how much verisimilitude with which Takako represents the Japanese reaction toward transvestitism and transgenderism and transsexualism. Translator Matt Thorn offers a brief essay on the subject in the backmatter of volume 2, but it's unsatisfyingly brief.

Being white and male, I had the privilege of being [image]Growing up, I never had any concern with finding myself in the heroes of adventure stories. Being white and male, I had the privilege of being more than adequately represented in the protagonists of these adventures. Or at least roughly represented. Really roughly. Roughly enough so that no hero of any of the books or movies I loved remotely resembled me save that, perhaps, they had penises and skin that was lighter than it was dark. They might not have actually had penises—I never had the opportunity to check, nor would I have even considered the attempt. In truth, regardless my privilege, the heroes of my favourite adventures were always indelibly alien to me. The depth of their foreignness was complete. I did not have their strength, their skills, their abilities, their wit. Moreover, I could not conceive that I might ever share any of that je ne sais quoi that made them suitable heroes. And here, on the cusp of Age Forty, I can look back and applaud the considerable judgment I possessed as a seven year old—because I have acquired none of those heroic traits (save perhaps a smidgeon of wit). I have always then wondered at those who are sad about not seeing themselves in their heroes. Chalk it up to privilege if you care to, or perhaps to the fact that I just never seemed to share in the growing-up experiences that so many of my friends had, but I have always imagined that I would feel as much disconnect between myself and my heroes as if I had been black or Asian or female. Because heroes were never even human to me. They were this Alien Other. When Spider-Man was Peter Parker, he wasn't like me. He was this non-human creature with amazing skills that was pretending to be me. He was the privileged one and he was wearing some equivalent of black-face to try to blend in, some human-face camouflage. It didn't work. Not for me.Which is not to say that I didn't enjoy heroes or their adventures. I did. I ate that stuff up. I loved Spider-Man. I loved Rick Hunter. I loved Wolverine and Groo and Rogue and pre-ninja Psylocke and Nightcrawler and Tintin and Power Pack. And Kitty Pryde. While still foreign, Kitty Pryde was the adventure hero whom I could most relate to. I would of course never be able to be her or possess near a third of even her non-superhuman abilities. But if I were forced to relate to one of these fictional figures, it would have been her. And that's kind of the point: I didn't love these characters because I could relate to them. I loved them because they were unbelievable and fantastic. The stories they got wrapped up in were ludicrous and impossible and kind of delicious. And while I've mostly graduated from adventure tales[1], I'm still able to take great joy in the occasional episode—despite not feeling that I am remotely represented in the protagonist. Bone is fantastic and amazing, even though Fone Bone isn't even human. Raiders of the Lost Ark is thrilling, even though Doctor Jones is an immortal possessed of uncanny luck. The Sea Hawk is exciting and daring, even though there's nothing in my make-up that could possess me to commandeer a tallship or run a guy through with a rapier.And I found Delilah Dirk as delightful a hero and her adventures as blisteringly exciting as any other—despite the fact that she is a woman and I, clearly, am not. And a woman that has skills and fortune greater than those of any man or woman in all of the combined histories of the real world. She has a winning personality and a basketful of impossible abilities. I don't know whether my daughter will take after me and feel no need to see herself in her protagonists,[2] but if she does hope to find herself in her heroes, she won't find that in Delilah. All the same, I expect she'll take as much joy in this episode as I do. Delilah Dirk may be unconvincing in terms of realism or relatability, but it's a grand little adventure.[image]While Delilah may be the book's hero, its narrator is someone who flies a little closer to the earth, the mostly accessible Turkish lieutenant, Selim. It is through the eloquent Selim that we encounter the whirlwind, Delilah Dirk. He is as incredulous as we might be when encountering a woman who is trained in forty-seven sword-fighting techniques, who sits as a high-ranking member of three royal courts, and who—in the preindustrial Mediterranean[3]—claims the power of flight. Selim is just a normal guy, mostly. He's a janissary lieutenant with astonishingly good taste in tea and a certain loquaciousness, but with no other skills to recommend him. Delilah helps him out of a bind and they begin their travels together, moving from hot water to scalding. [image]Only, when one is on Delilah Dirk's side, things can't get too hot—just more interesting. The only time when Miss Dirk isn't entirely in command of her situation, Selim is able to provoke her to action simply because in the present crisis he has far less to lose and so is less shocked by their predicament. Delilah Dirk is a woman-run show. Honestly, it'd be a delightful romp either way, but it's refreshing to see an overly competent woman in the Doctor Jones role for a change.And beyond the easy romp of adventure, Cliff does allow for a moment's meditation on the risks and benefits associated with both adventure and a more staid provincial sort of life. The characters are, at a point, afforded the opportunity to retire free of the kinds of consequences that would plague William Munny in Clint Eastwood's masterpiece, Unforgiven. Each character gets to choose between quietly settling down to enjoy the fruits of labours and leaping once more into the unknown, with all the associated joys and terrors. In a more critical world, we might read Cliff as contemplating the tension between liberty and security—marking Delilah Dirk, for all its old-world Mediterranean elegance, as a thoroughly Third-Millennial American work. Delilah and Selim each make their own decisions for their own reasons, but the reader may enjoy the opportunity to exercise the question along with the two companions. For myself, I was reminded how adventurous I once was and wanted to be, but how with age crept in so great a desire for comfort and reliability that any remnant thirst for adventure is nearly quenched. A bittersweet acknowledgement, but I'm grateful to Cliff's book for bringing it to mind and giving me another opportunity to evaluate my own history and decisions.[image]Tony Cliff's art and writing are perfectly enjoyable. It was Delilah Dirk's gorgeous cover that first attracted me to the volume. I saw its beauty and dynamism and knew this was a book I'd need to pay attention to. Cliff's illustrations are fluid and graceful and his cartooning expressive. There is no ambiguity in his visual storytelling. Delilah is conveyed as a woman somewhere between elegant poise and a child's crafty mischief. Selim is drawn lean and astounded, wiry and witful despite being out of his element. Their dialogue is peppered with smarts and humour and keeps an enjoyable cadence. Even though Delilah Dirk is lighter fare, it's expertly conceived. I can't wait for more and hope the wait won't be too long.I'm cheered that more and more great stories are featuring female protagonists. I'm grateful for Zita the Spacegirl, Spera, Broxo, Twin Spica, Friends with Boys, the works of Hope Larson and Raina Teglemeier, and the Hilda stories. And now, I'm grateful for Delilah Dirk. Not so much because these will be characters whom certain young women will be able to relate to (if that happens, I consider it a bonus), but because the proliferation of good, solid female heroes is a hint that things are getting better. That maybe the world my daughter grows up into won't bear women quite so much animosity as it did when my mother was growing up. That maybe it could be entirely good and safe and joyous to be a woman in the coming age.[image]One cannot escape one's privileges and so I cannot ever know what it feels like to be a woman. And yet, with great privileges come great responsibilities—so even if I cannot know that experience, I owe it to my daughter, my wife, my mother, my friends, and my whole society to listen to what I can't understand. To learn of what is hidden. To care deeply for the well-being of those who are other from me. And to invest in what is made mysterious by nature of my privilege. And if part of that involves taking joy in good books about great women, then consider me the luckiest of men.More Delilah Dirk, please.____________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]____________Footnotes1) Real big of me, I know, right?I shouldn't by now, but I still do feel like I need to clarify when I say things like that. Probably because of the tongue-in-cheek way that I say them. I don't honestly think adventure stories are lesser stories, even though my personal history has trained me to believe that. For me, it's a matter of taste—yet my tastes are historically tied to different periods of my life. It's like metal. I listened to heavy metal, speed metal, and thrash metal from 8th grade to maybe a little before my high school graduation. So for me, justified or not, metal will always feel like something you listen to when you're a kid. Something you grow out of.Because my taste in film and literature shifted away from adventure stories after highschool, I unconsciously associate those kinds of stories with my immaturity, and so adventure will always feel like something you grow out of. It will feel like that even if my rational mind denies the connection.2) I'm not too concerned this won't be the case, as the character with whom she currently most identifies is Bartleby the rat creature.3) The Ottoman janissary corps existed between AD 1383 and 1826, so Delilah Dirk occurs sometime within that window, probably earlier than later....more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,not set,not set,"Aug 19, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17261174-delilah-dirk-and-the-turkish-lieutenant

He may be my Favourite Author—if not, he's definitely part of a select handful of Favourite Authors. I haven't read all of his works but I have read eleven of them, some of them multiple times. When I was reading Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (for the second time) alongside my wife (her first time), we were so taken with the book that we named our as-yet-unborn daughter St. Wind-Up Bird (while she awaited a proper name) as mark of our affection for the novel and, conversely, for our daughter. When 1Q84 was released a couple years ago, I purchased it at release and promptly devoured it. When I began Utsubora, I suspected that Nakamura probably had done the same. By the end, I instead presumed simply that Nakamura read 1Q84, allowed it to filter into her cultural consciousness, and then wrote a completely different kind of story that lifts liberally—and perhaps accidentally—from the very large novel. There are overlaps.It's not cheaty or plagiaristic or anything, but its several similarities did prompt me to initially hope that I'd be able to write a  about a book about a plagiarist that was itself derived a bit too closely from another work. I'd say it's almost a shame that I couldn't end up writing that , but Utsubora is so diabolically interesting that I'm deeply glad for it. Even if I can't use this space as much of a meditation on the nature of plagiary.Utsubora, unlike 1Q84, grew on me. With Murakami's novel, I was hooked from the start. I was seeing the fascinating properties of the novel in every page, every pericope. With Utsubora, I began at tepid. I thought, This is the run-of-the-mill thriller. Suspicious suicide. Femme fatale. The obvious, typical everything. A quarter of the way in, some of the book's intrigue began to surface and kept me invested until the conclusion. At that point I was still only at the point of thinking that the book was Fun. And of course, Fun is nice. There's nothing wrong with Fun. I just wanted more bang for my buck—after all, the editor's blurb on the back called it Nakamura's masterpiece. And initially, it didn't feel like a masterpiece. So I was going to write a  that said that.[image]Fortunately, I like to get my ducks in a row before I begin a , so I started thinking about the story and I realized that I didn't actually know what had happened. Which is on-the-face-of-it ridiculous, right? I mean, I read the book all the way through—and pretty carefully. So I made my wife read it and we talked about it. There were so many holes in our grasp of What Actually Happened that I decided to reread the book, this time taking notes. At this point, I was guardedly impressed. In truth I was probably Schrödinger's impressed. I was simultaneously impressed and the opposite of impressed and would only become wholly one or the other upon finishing my notes. As I picked my way through that second read, carefully noting things that might have anything to do with putting together the pieces of Nakamura's puzzle, I realized a handful of things: 1) the author was meticulous in putting these things together in a way that actually reveals everything, 2) the book is about much more than just the thriller that it's camouflaged as, and 3) the book is not actually a thriller in any sense—even though it toys with the structure of the thriller.[image][These are some of the notes I took.]I won't say much about it because sussing out the book's plot is half the fun, but Nakamura juggles back and forth between events at will—so much so that neophyte readers might be wholly left in the dark. There is a complexity to her non-linearity that you might not notice 'til you're knee-deep in its morass. Nakamura will bounce between two or three or four events happening roughly simultaneously and then throw in a couple pockets from two weeks or two months or two years ago. It's a ton of fun if you're up to it. Mind-bogglingly challenging if you're not.What surprised me about the book is that its story is really pretty mundane. Outside of all the narrative tricks, nothing is quite as diabolical as it seems. In fact, it may even be that Nakamura was so interested in creating a meditation on the existential part of any novel's author that she masked it in genre tropes so people would ingest something probably outside their usual range of reading. Utsubora feels sexy and dangerous, but it's really just a discussion of the nature of authorship.[image]Nakamura's novel follows the diminished career of Shun Mizorogi, a once potent author whose works have inspired a particularly loyal and invested collection of readers. Mizorogi has long lost his inspiration and, in an act of ill-conceived desperation, plagiarizes a young amateur's work, developing it as his own project, thereby winning renewed acclaim for what will be seen as his magnum opus. Utsubora begins with what may be the suicide of a young amateur, a woman with whom Mizorogi engaged romantically after plagiarizing her. The identity of the dead woman is in some contention, as all her particular features were obliterated when she dove headfirst from a high-rise. Then a twin appears.[image]It sounds kind of ridiculous. And it's actually more ridiculous than it sounds. But it's also very very good. Nakamura has created something tense and relentlessly worthwhile. It's Mature rating will make it a hard sell in a lot of markets (and it definitely earns the publisher's 18+ recommendation[1]), but it's a valuable book that merits the time readers will put into it. And that's the great thing. When I first presumed Utsubora to be some sort of lip-service homage to Murakami, I was only seeing plot points and thriller tropes. I thought Nakamura's book would merely be an amusing ride. Summer reading, something to lounge with poolside. But just as Murakami masks deeper examinations of culture and identity in his novels, so too does Nakamura. All the salacious bits about blended identities and sexual liaison actually work on a High Literary level as lightly veiled thematic reference to the central discussion of the Author and his place in, among, and above the work. The last couple years have each been great for comics, with a number of surprising and valuable works releasing in 2010, 2011, and 2012. Utsubora is one more release assuring that 2013 will be another stand-up year for the comics medium.____________A Dissonant NoteThere is one thing I haven't figured out that nags at me. Through all the notes I took (even to the extent of compiling a timeline of events to keep everything straight), there was one thing that I couldn't make sense of. It's potentially something that could outright break my interpretation. It's troublesome and I don't yet understand it. I've come up with an argument for it, a way to wedge it into my reading of the book, but I fear I damage the truth of things by how I massage the thing into my reading. So yeah, if you have any great thoughts about this one element, I'd love to hear them.The thing that is tripping me up so badly is this: the cheesecakes.____________A Timeline of EventsI don't yet have a study guide prepared for Utsubora. I'd like to have one—at the least to help readers understand the plot well enough that they can begin to get at the meat which lurks within. Until then, I'll deposit my timeline of notable events here. Obviously, these are spoilers so if you haven't read the work, I'd recommend not going any further, even if you're the kind who doesn't mind spoilers. With that, click the below thumbnail to see a rich expression of the book's plot development:  [image]____________Footnotes1) I never ever ever feel like a creeper reading books like this in roughly public spaces like Starbucks. Not even slightly. Yep, here's a page where two detectives are discussing the identity of a missing person with a landlord. Then they're talking about an author's bibliography. Young cop, old cop. Typical stuff. Turn the page. Oh hey, a close up of a finger in a vagina. A tongue glancing off a nipple with a string of sloppy sloppy makeout saliva. Turn the page rather more quickly. Phone conversation with an editor about when a particular chapter will be ready for submission.Yeah. I don't feel like a weirdo at all.

Besides not being particularly interested in battle comics, I think oversaturation in my youth led to mecha-fatigue. Two series of Voltron and a religious devotion to all three Robotech seasons left me a bit spent. Throw in some Battletech gaming as well as all the giant-robot stuff that littered the culturescape of my youth (Transformers, Tranzor-Z, Johnny Sokko) and it might not be difficult to see why I might weary of the stuff. Around 2003, after about a ten-year abstinence, someone convinced me I should give Neon Genesis Evangelion a shot—that didn't go so well and I basically gave up on mechas for good.Obviously, this was unfair and premature—like saying I don't like country music just because I haven't heard any country music I've ever appreciated.It's easy to propose—on purely rational terms—that prejudices are always unfair. It makes sense. The argument is valid and cogent. Of course, that doesn't stop every last one of us from building lives on irrational presuppositions and convenient generalizations. I haven't questioned my belief that mecha stories are substandard fare because, well, primarily that would give me one more direction in which to apportion my already far-too-small disposable income. Also: though I read comics all the time and spend at least six hours per week writing about them, at least I don't read the ones with big robots on the covers because that's infantile.(1) So when I sat down and read Knights of Sidonia and had my worldview shattered? That was a feeling both delicious and terrifying. After all: I am now someone who reads and enjoys mecha manga.(2)[image]For a reluctant reader such as myself,(3) Knights of Sidonia has a number of things working in its favour. (It wasn't an instant sell. I hesitated to pick up the first volume. It wasn't my thing. I read the first chapter. And then the second. It had some intriguing sci-fi ideas,(4) but mere ideas aren't enough to buy my interest any more. So a few more chapters. This is kind of weird but kind of neat. And I like these characters. And some of the mystery of what's going on. So I pick up and read the second volume and Wow! Suddenly I'm sold on these characters and invested and Oh yes and Oh no and What Is Going to Happen Next WHERE IS VOLUME 3??)[image]To its credit, Knights of Sidonia is both conceptually smart and plenty imaginative. Series lead Tanikaze is one of the few humans onboard the Sidonia who cannot photosynthesize and requires regular meals of actual food. As would be scientifically likely, the fact that he has a diet at all means that he'd smell differently from other members of the ship's ecosystem. All over the ship are hand-holds and bars on which crew and residents can attach carabiners for when the ship turns and gravity changes. In the first chapter, we find that cloning is commonplace, and by the second we're introduced to Shinatose who's neither male nor female but can reproduce with either sex.(5)The series as well features a kind of lo-fi elegance to its art. Illustrationwise, Nihei maintains good control of his visual space. While there is sometimes a lot of activity in panels (especially when in battle with the Gauna(6)), it's generally not difficult to determine what is going on. (Though to be fair and honest, my critical sense tends to disengage during battles. I find myself rushing through to get back to the good stuff, the interpersonal junk.) At any rate, all remaining interpretive difficulties were smoothed away on a subsequent reading. And it says something worthwhile to note that there was a subsequent reading—and that there will likely be more to come as I return to re-acquaint myself with the story-so-far as future volumes are released. [image]Initially there was one thing that kept me at distance from the book. Nihei posits story moments in a kind of staccato kind of articulation. The cuts from one piece to the next are crisp and rely only on thematic shifts in the art (rather than employing narrative bubbles). The effect was a bit jarring on my first read and I felt that I was missing things. A second (and then third) reading proved that more likely I was reading carelessly—as I no longer felt that estrangement from the plot and had no such issue with the second volume. It may also be that I have grown accustomed to Nihei's style of visual storytelling.If you're looking for some interesting sci-fi, it may be that you won't go wrong to check out this series. Remember that when I recommend this, I'm a reader who's just as invested in mechas as I am in bicycles or tricked-out lawnmowers or tandem strollers or any number of other things I don't care about at all. This is a mecha book that doesn't really feel like it's about mechas.(7) Knights of Sidonia feels like a series of character studies in what would be a drastically different social environment from our own, only punctuated by colossal acts of violence. And so far, it's pretty keen. I'll grant that I'm only two volumes in and it's entirely possible that the book could go catastrophically wrong (like 90% of television series as the seasons wear on), but for now Knights of Sidonia excites me in a way that I hadn't expected. I want to know what happens to Tanikaze and Shinatose and Hoshijiro. And I'm especially interested to see which character gets the privilege of breaking Kunato's neck. That bastard.[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]___________Footnotes1) I mean, not really, but that's the feeling I always had for mechas and giant robots, kind of a reverse nostalgia.2) Or at least one particular example of the genre.3) Or even moreso, like my wife who is still less willing to pick up sci-fi than I am. I tricked her into reading Knights by saying how little I cared for the genre and then expressing how excited I was to read future volumes. I mean, I guess that's not so much a trick as it is just a flat statement of How Things Are. In any case, she reluctantly picked up the first volume and happily picked up the second. So there's that.4) ...Interesting ideas that may very well be old hat for rigourous fans of the genres (those who may be well-accustomed to the common tropes), but at least for a reader who only occasionally encounters sci-fi, Knights of Sidonia had quite a few interesting future-concepts at play.5) I haven't yet sussed out what pronoun they use to refer to Shinatose. Since she seems paired to Tanikaze as a possible romantic association, I imagine she'd take the female pronoun because he codes heterosexual and masculine.6) So far, the alien Gauna are the series heavies—though I wouldn't be surprised for there to be some sort of reevaluation or reversal in later chapters.7) To be fair, I suppose it's possible that 98% of all mecha manga aren't really about their giant-robot-looking vehicles. That would be really kinda cool, I guess—though I'm not then sure what the point would be....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,not set,"Jul 09, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11100681-knights-of-sidonia-1

Certainly there's something deeply self-satisfying about venting all the bile accumulated through trudging amongst particularly gruesome examples of creative detritus. It's fun and it gives both critic and reader a chance to laugh (if the reader agrees with the critic). But I'm growing less and less comfortable with the exercise as part of Good Ok Bad. After all, despite the site's title (which I maybe sorta regret a little now), my primary goal and interest is to evangelize people to the value and good to be found in the comics medium. If I were to have a mission statement, it would lean heavily on the concept of helping people find comics, graphic novels, and manga that they will enjoy and find value in. Reviews of Bad books don't have anything to do with that mission. This is the large part, probably,1 why such a slim percent of my s are One-Star Books.Foiled and its sequel are not Bad books, but the problem is similar. They aren't books I would probably promote to many people. They are Okay—books with some good to recommend them but a number of issues that diluted my enjoyment of their contents. That's fine because not every book is going to be stellar and not every book is going to be one that appeals to my sense of what Good is. All the same, being lukewarm toward a book makes it hard to speak about with any kind of passion. I'm not recommending something, so my purpose is diminished. I'm not warning the reader away from something dreadful either. There's not even really anything to poke fun at. It's just a book series with a decent idea that doesn't measure up to my sense of what makes good storytelling.And it started out so well too.Foiled's first volume opens with some beautiful art direction. Mike Cavallaro's art can be exquisite at times. The title page features the book's principal, Aliera, in fencing gear. It could be a throwaway panel, but instead Cavallaro uses it to push a wonderful silent narrative of the girl. The perspective is low-angled and the reader encounters the protagonist for the first time as someone strong, well-guarded, and probably pretty talented. [image]The following pages, including the artfully prepared indicia, take the reader through Aliera's self-disarming ritual and we see the girl move from her place of power into an identity of comparative weakness. It's a good visual allegory for how Aliera's life works itself out and is accomplished silently, through art alone. While I know it would have been impossible to eloquently develop the story of Foiled had the book continued wordlessly, less words may have saved the book from the bulk of its missteps.I had not heard of Jane Yolen or her work prior to reading Foiled. I read a couple of her titles off the rear cover to my wife (apparently Yolen has like 300 books under her belt) and she said, ""Whoa. Owl Moon' famous. She's famous. It won a Caldecott."" Those may not have been her exact words, but they rode along those lines. With that in mind, I'm not sure what happened. Maybe Yolen is just uncomfortable with the comics medium. Maybe she thought comics are the future and she should get on that ride but really doesn't respect the medium for what it can do. Maybe she's still super talented but is just writing in a slump. I can't possibly know the Why behind the reason these two books are so poorly written, but they are.I'm aware that YA books are often written with teenage figures who speak not as teenagers but instead as teenagers imagine themselves to talk. So when Aliera narrates in a voice that feels wholly untrue to her demographic (the teen fencer demographic!), I try to shrug off the fact that it doesn't ring true to me. And I largely succeed!Yolen seems to fall into one of the more common traps of first-person narration from some point in the future. Aliera, the narrator, knows how all this pans out. She makes reference to things we'll understand later after all is revealed. But simultaneously, she narrates interjections and warnings to herself (""Protect your heart!""2) as if the things the reader is watching unfold are also being seen by Aliera for the first time as well. It's fumbling and distracting, but shouldn't hurt the reading too badly.Foiled's writing shows its biggest struggle in that its dialogue and narrative are rather clipped and abrupt—to the point that it's often unclear why exactly things are being said. There's a disconnect between motive and verbal action. It happens throughout the first volume but perhaps the most glaring example is Aliera's treatment of Avery in volume 2. The first book concludes with Aliera frustratingly telling Avery to go be in the light, so he takes off and we suspect they'll have more interactions later. The second book begins with a little time lapse and with no major events having taken place in the interim. Yet from the outset of volume 2, Aliera loathes Avery, refers to him as a betrayer, and basically wants nothing to do with him. He's done nothing new to merit this shift—and if Aliera felt this way previously, it would have been helpful to see that attitude develop in the prior book.[image]There are a host of minor details that could have been better treated to remove narrative dissonance. Aliera, it is non-overtly revealed, has cone monocromacy (or something identical). That's total colour-blindness in which the subject possesses rods but only a single king of cone, rather than the three types that humans are normally born with. Those with cone monochromacay can detect a range of about a hundred colours instead of the million that the average human can. It's an exceedingly rare condition. I had to look it up to see if it really existed. Even a single offhand remark from Aliera saying that she had a rare condition associated with her vision would have kept me in the story instead of breaking my involvement. Likewise, I had trouble decided exactly when in the school year this story begins. Aliera makes it sound like Avery is the new kid, even though all the girls really really want him and it sort of feels like he's at least been around for a while. But then she walks into a class and the teacher asks for her name so he can assign her a lab partner. This makes it sound like the first day of school or maybe the new semester. Some mention of which would have been a comfortable way to bring the reader in to what's up with a Biology teacher who doesn't know who his students are but immediately launches the class into frog dissection. Maybe there's not an explanation for that, though. I don't know.And a more petty grievance: Aliera is baffled that Avery, a sixteen-year-old, hasn't read Moby Dick. I'm nearly forty and if you tell me you've read Moby Dick, I will register a small amount of happy surprise. I can count on three fingers the number of people I know for sure have read Moby Dick (and one of them is Fone Bone). That anyone should be shocked that another person (let alone a teenager) shouldn't have read Melville's book bears incredulity. It may have been at this point that any possibility that Aliera could have been a stand-in for a teen was severed. I could no longer believe.Now if you're still with me, you're likely wondering why on earth I wouldn't be rating Foiled as a One-Star book. Your hypothetical curiosity is fair and merited. I wasn't exactly kind in the preceding because, Yes, Foiled's writing is bad. It's awkward and distracting and fails to maintain logical flow amongst its parts. It feels clichéd and overwrought at times. And though I'm tempted to write it off as being written to a younger, lesser crowd,3 I think that a YA audience deserves good writing even as much as I believe I do.[image]So yeah, while the writing's pretty gruesome, Foiled is not all writing. As mentioned at the start, Mike Cavallaro does a good job with his illustrations. His art is cartoony and lively and I enjoyed the way he brought me into Aliera's world of fencing. I know way more about fencing now than I did a month ago—due merely to his illustrations of Aliera's competition gear.Generally, though, even good art is not enough to save a bad book. The Manara Library (vol. 1) is not saved by the fact that Milo Manara is a tremendous illustrator. Batwoman: Elegy is not saved by the fact that JH Williams is a tremendous illustrator. So it's likewise not Callavara that ultimately saves Foiled for me. Instead, it's merely that at the end of the day, I want to know what happens to Aliera, Avery, and Caroline after the conclusion to volume 2. Call it Stockholm Syndrome if you like, but I really want to know. Even if only enough to check the plot synopsis on Wikipedia after the series wraps.[Review courtesty of Good Ok Bad.]___________Footnotes1) The other part is that I have a tendency to leave books I'm not enjoying completely unread. And since I won't  an unread book, that means I have a pretty small pool of Bad books to choose from.2) Seriously, the protect your heart business is trying. It's overlaboured to the point where one wonders if Yolen might not be working with Mattel to market a licensed Foiled: The Drinking Game in which the book's YA fans are encouraged to take shots whenever Aliera narrates ""Protect your Heart"" or inexplicably hates Avery or whatever. I'm sure it would be a hit.3) One that might for instance imagine that either Twilight or Hunger Games, for all the fun that can be had in those books, are examples of quality writing....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,not set,"Jul 09, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7159898-foiled

Forget all the body we""These kings of the sky, clumsy, ashamed.""            —BaudelaireThe young teenage years are pretty much rough on everyone. Forget all the body weirdness—the growing boobs, getting hairy nuts, the changing voice, the blood, the acne. Forget all that awful, awkward business about having a body that's transitioning from its sensible kid form into what will eventually come to be the slightly more stable form of the adult person. And forget the fact that with your new limbs and protrusions, your balance is completely off and even the way you used to walk has to be relearned and reapplied because you're in a different chassis than you were, and because you haven't quite caught up, you're clumsy as a yak in an America shop. Forget all that because as traumatic as that can be and almost certainly is, it's amateur hour when stood against the wall in a police line-up with the psychological and ideological shifts that govern that same period of our lives.Or at least that govern the lives of people who are like me. And like the principal characters of Shūzō Oshimi's Flowers of Evil. I don't believe we're special either. I suspect these shifts time their approach as arm-in-arm escorts of puberty, honoured guests to the marriage of the self-consciousness and self-awareness that mark our first steps toward adulthood.[image][Self-awareness vs self-consciousness! Now fight!]At some point along the winding path between immaturity and maturity, the human child (with few exceptions) becomes first cognizant of themselves as unique person and then of themselves as they may be viewed by others. Often, the time that passes between ""Hey wait! I am totally unique and a person in my own right and I can do and believe as I want!"" and ""Omigosh, probably everyone will hate me!"" is pretty slim. For me, it was a near instantaneous revelation. I mean, I knew before that point that some people didn't like me, but it was always distanced from who I was inside. Up until that shift in self-awareness, that some people picked on me just seemed like bad luck—like some people got the raw end and that was just kind of a matter left to the Norns. Or something. Obviously, as I wasn't yet entirely self-aware, I wasn't thinking in these kinds of terms. But regardless, I didn't recognize a huge connection between how I was treated and who I was.""Those damaged products of a good-for-nothing age.""            —BaudelaireSimultaneously, many of us struggle with the recognition that the world is messed up and suddenly we have minds that will someday (maybe even tomorrow) be able to grasp some of the reasons why. We see, at least in part, the errors and hypocrisies of the older generations. We see parents who aren't doing anything to make things better, who aren't rocking the boat for change. (Because they're likely too busy paying for our food and our clothes and our schooling and our housing and our entertainment, but we're not yet aware enough to see how that sucks the soul out of even the best of us.) We see these atrocities against the idealist human spirit and we reject at least a portion of what came before us. This is why so many junior high fantasies turn toward what we on the outside perceive as darkness.(1) There's this sensed need for the razing of the inequities and absurdities of the present age so that we might, even if only accidentally, emerge with something closer to utopian.[image]Part of this often impotent dissatisfaction with the way the world is manifests in teens finding (or believing they find) value in things that others do not. This can take the form of pursuing what are perceived to be fringe trends or marked interest in something old and off the cultural radar. Readers tend to take the latter path and so tend to express down more interesting lines—if no more rigourous or effective. There's something deliciously elitist about quote-unquote discovering some forgotten book or author, some writer of ideas that nobody you know is familiar with. When I was younger I read a biography of Rommel, a 700-page book of moralistic principles by Richard Baxter, and a Japanese novel by a first-time female author about a kid who killed his dad with a katana and hid the body. I felt awesome. I mean, what non-military-historian reads Rommel's biography? I had Arrived.I mean, of course I was a moron. But that's part of growing up, right—the journey of learning that being elite just means that you have an unrealistic understanding of your own personal value and tastes. And just as I grew up and out of much of my small-mindedness and ridiculous sense of self-worth, so too will Flowers of Evil's protagonist, Takao Kasuga. At least, if Nakamura lets him live that long. In a way, though, Kasuga's relationship with Nakamura has put him on a bit of a fast track for moving toward maturity. He won't get there the normal way, but barring the cataclysmic, he'll likely get there sooner than the average bear.""Ennui, the fruit of dismal apathy,Becomes as large as immortality.""            —BaudelaireFlowers of Evil is a mix between romcom and bildungsroman (as most bildungsroman are). Kasuga finds himself struggling to adulthood on the social outskirts of acceptable junior-high society. He's still well-within the fold, careful not to step too far out of line, but his adoration of literature (especially foreign literature) sets him apart from his classmates. Behind him sits Sawa Nakamura, a girl with little regard to the manner of the world around her. She stares down teachers, calls them shit-bugs in front of the class, and delights in the possibility of what she sees as true perversion—not that amateur-hour sexual deviancy stuff, but the real deal: a twisting rejection of all that her society deems acceptable and normative. Kasuga falls under the misanthropic tutelage of Nakamura when she witnesses him nearly accidentally steal the gym clothes of Nanako Saeki, on whom he's had a monster crush for over a year. Kasuga begins capitulating to Nakamura's ludicrous demands under threat that his indiscretion will be revealed to Saeki. Buoyed by the strength he finds in the writings of Baudelaire, Kasuga follows the rabbit hole as far as he can, and soon enough Saeki herself is inevitably involved—forming a kind of insane love triangle. The whole thing is just bazonkers.[image]Oshimi's unwary protagonist finds satisfaction in an elitism marked especially by his love for Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal. Kasuga looks out over his rural town and pities it for its lack of sophistication. Of all the places he looks, he can find no one whom he believes would have read Baudelaire.(2) He even has to travel to a distant neighbourhood to access a worthwhile bookstore that will carry the highbrow imports he revels in.When I first approached Flowers of Evil, I suspected that Kasuga's infatuation with Baudelaire was incidental to the French author himself and to the specifics of the referenced work, Les Fleurs du mal. Oftentimes, the name-dropping of authors or exterior works fulfills the singular function of giving a character an air of pretension. And certainly Kasuga is pretentious. He adores Les Fleurs du mal primarily for how it makes him feel at odds with (and so, better than) the society in which he finds himself. But for that goal, any author obscure to a fourteen-year-old in the Japanese countryside could have worked. Kierkegaard, Pascal, Cicero, Hume, Joyce. It needn't have even been an author. Kieślowski or Eisenstein or Malick for film. Sienkiewisc or Gauguin or Man Ray for art. If all that was needed was a name to drop, any of these would have sufficed.(3) Oshimi does, however, seem to be aiming at more than mere pretension and his use of Baudelaire seems more nuanced.I now speak as an expert on Les Fleurs du mal who had read neither it nor anything of Baudelaire until yesterday afternoon. Since then, I read the SparkNotes analysis as well as about five of the hundred-or-so poems included in the controversial collection. So I know what I'm talking about, clearly.Nevertheless, reading that analysis and several poems did a lot for governing my understanding of the foundation from which Kasuga is operating at the book's start. It goes a long way toward both explaining why he often reacts the way that he does to Nakamura's and Saeki's actions and enforcing Nakamura's ideological plane as a natural place of safety for Kasuga.(4)[image]One of the primary themes Baudelaire plays with is the ground between what he terms Ideal and Spleen. The Ideal is basically what it sounds like, the inviolable purity of nobility and love and passion. The ideal is beautiful and honourable and, in Baudelaire's sense, fantasy. The Spleen is perhaps more easily represented by a sense of malaise. The Spleen is anger and filth and human muck. Weakness, greed, cowardice, lust, all the negative traits of the human spirit that rule us while ever preventing the Ideal from becoming reality. Baudelaire seems (so far as my expert limited reading implies) to be concerned with the tension between the two.And as a bit of a dilettante, Kasuga seems less concerned with or even aware of that tension. He begins the book entranced by the darkness he sees swirling within it. Just reading Baudelaire's words at his desk at school feels to him subversive. Kasuga is drawn to the Ideal certainly, as evidenced by the positioning of Saeki (his crush) as his muse—wholly pure, incorruptible, sexy but without either sexual volition or sexual desire. The stark unrealism he indulges with relation to the girl seems ludicrous apart from the filter of Les Fleurs du mal's influence (and maybe even with that influence). Simultaneously, Kasuga wallows in his sense of the world's ""evil."" He doesn't so much recognize the troubles that plague humanity as he finds the concepts of evil (including rebellion and darkness and perversion) attractive—so long as they aren't in any way tied to Saeki, his muse.[image]""Adorable sorceress, do you love the damned?""            —BaudelaireNakamura seems a kind of bridge across the tension that Baudelaire expresses. She rejects Baudelaire and the contents of Les Fleurs du mal out of hand. She finds in Kasuga a good kind of clay to sculpt with, but wants to free him from his reliance upon one more of what she would deem a shit-bug—those people trapped by smallness of mind in a world that could be so much more if perversion could reign.(5) Over the course of the series, Kasuga more and more finds Nakamura to be a marriage between Ideal and Spleen. Something glorious and beyond what he or Baudelaire may have conceived. Of course, he's just a naive fourteen-year-old, so what does he know?Of the three characters, Saeki seems the most out of her depth. She's lived in quiet desperation for a long time but doesn't understand Nakamura's ideology or Kasuga's growing infatuation for it. In a way, she's the most level-headed of the group, but that leaves her the most vulnerable.(6) She also is the one with the most to lose if her play into these floral ""evils"" fails her. She's the good-looking girl at the top of the class, highly popular and destined to have a good future for all the connections her family can afford her. Kasuga on the other hand was never destined for greatness and Nakamura has, in a social sense, nothing to lose.I don't know where Oshimi is going to take his story, but unless these characters succeed in remaking the world in a new image, they're bound to come out the other end damaged and perhaps beyond recognition. The series is still ongoing in Japan and I don't know how many volumes are intended. The arcs seem to move in threes (if the cover groupings are any indication) so the series may end with volume 9 or 12. In any case, that's plenty of time for the tone to shift dramatically in any direction. Maybe volume 7 will shoot us twenty years into a post-apocalyptic future in which Nakamura is an establishment nun for the Christian overchurch that governs all nations, Saeki is a part robot dominatrix, and Kasuga only exists as an embedded consciousness implanted in all sentient beings as part of a terrorist protocol initiated by Nakamura before her conversion. Or maybe things will continue hard-driving down a road paved on the bones of angels and we'll get to see the doom of three kids who relish the rejection of the normal so deeply that they alienate all around them. Really, anything kinda goes and I'm looking forward to seeing what happens and reading probably too much into it. I'm enthusiastic about this series even if it occasionally gives me the oogly-booglies (as in volume 5's crescendo).There are a couple more things to discuss before I close. They just didn't fit so neatly in the stream of thoughts I had above, so I'll append them here.Oshimi's art is kind of a chimera. In some ways it's brilliant. In others it's awkward and amateurish. I never don't like it, but it's got some rough edges. I'll talk about some of them before moving onto how awesome the art is. Easiest way is to show the big splash opener for volume 1.[image]Oshimi sometimes struggles with perspective and so renders his characters, like Nakamura here, with impossibly short limbs or too-large heads. If you're a fast reader, you can easily blow by these without concern, but those of us who like to luxuriate in an artist's choices might be stopped cold here and there while trying to understand what's going on and whether the figures are really disfigured. And here's a close-up on Kasuga's ears from the same page:[image]I don't know if Oshimi's own ears feature extreme protrusion of the antihelix, but he does this a lot with his characters as if it were normal. Every time a new character appeared with such aggressive antihelixes, I was stopped cold. It's not so much that I don't believe a bunch of unrelated people could have ears like that—but more just that I become deeply curious as to the motive behind the artistic choice.Okay, so that's it for my complaints about Oshimi's illustrations. His choices otherwise all work spectacularly. Oshimi does a solid job conveying a breadth of emotions from boredom to suspicion to fear to anger to madness to anguish to cold criminal intent. Part of the reason I continued after the not-super-impressive first volume was Oshimi's ability to convey characters with depth and breadth. Half the story is told in words, but the better half perhaps is told in looks and body language. Oshimi, for the most part, nails this. Nakamura gives looks that exult in her moral superiority. We see Kasuga's soul die a little bit and resurrect as a new species of spirit. Saeki, when she is coy but clued in, looks exactly that.Incidentally, with the importance of facial expression to the work, Oshimi makes an important design decision with regard to Nakamura. Nearly constantly wearing glasses could have easily saboutaged her entire character's visual strength, as glasses very neatly hide or obscure the eyes. And because the eyes play such an important role in Oshimi's manner of conveying expression, a Nakamura with diminished access to that method of facial storytelling would have been disastrous. Instead, Oshimi hides portions of the glasses that might interfere with Nakamura's expression. Often this will be the top rims of her frames, but sometimes he'll abolish other bits of the glasses' structure—as in this example in which Nakamura looks through one of the glasses' arms so that she can look from profile and the reader still knows exactly what she's expressing.[image]""The lady's maids, to whom every prince is handsome,No longer can find gowns shameless enoughTo wring a smile from this young skeleton. ""            —BaudelaireOshimi also uses art to heighten the sexual tension of the book and thereby includes and indicts, pressing the reader to share Kasuga's perspective. It's not fan service, meant to titillate the low-class kind of minor perverts that Nakamura dismisses with so much disgust. This is an entirely different kind of thing and, while it may be common, I hadn't personally seen the technique used before. Oshimi uses aspect-to-aspect panel transitions to paint the scene of interpersonal space in a setting. Very, very often, the reader will encounter a couple talking head panels followed by a panel featuring only Nakamura's bust or maybe the hem of Saeki's skirt. These are not generally remotely lurid—Nakamura's bust, for instance, usually features no cleavage and is almost formless in terms of detail—and seems present in order to convey Kasuga's awareness of sexual characteristics more than anything. Here's a two-page example in which Kasuga is having a conversation with Saeki on her sickbed while she is dressed in pajamas.[image][image]The presence of the panel featuring Saeki's crotch doesn't seem in place to spur the fantasies of Flowers of Evil's readership but instead to prompt us to empathize with the turmoil Kasuga is experiencing and give us a clue as to its ————....[Review exceeds Goodreads' character limit.

Far Arden is a dear joy to me and sits happily and staunchly among my favourite comics works. The work is funny and sad and adventurous and poignant and true. I did not know what to expect when I first encountered the book, and found myself continually surprised by how very much fun I had pouring over its pages. I've read it several times over the past few years, first a couple times with a library copy, then online, and finally with my own edition. I should probably pick up a second copy for the day my first inevitably fails. Fact: I love Far Arden. So it shouldn't be any surprise to learn that I've been anticipating Crater XV like crazy. Even if it has a space station on its cover and is named Crater XV. [1]I know a lot of people (or at least a handful) who were put off by Far Arden's tonal shift. They thought it moved from light into darkness too quickly. I personally saw the stormclouds gathering gradually, and while I couldn't have predicted exactly to which depth the book would finally plumb, nothing felt out of place with Cannon's ultimate destination for Army Shanks and his cohorts. [2] Still, no matter how one ended up feeling about Far Arden's blend of comedy and tragedy, no one who read the prior book will be caught off-guard by any place that Cannon chooses to take Army in this sequel.Actually, that's one of the pieces of the Crater XV puzzle that had me so invested. Knowing how happily Cannon could willingly abuse his characters entrenched the expectation that he might do anything to Army or any member of his supporting cast. Would the fifteen-year-old perish with her dreams of space unfulfilled? What of Pravda, Army's childhood love? Would Barty turn into a sympathetic character only to rush headlong into his own mortality? And what of Army himself? The adventurer begins the story a broken man, wholly devastated by the events of the prior adventure. What would Kevin Cannon do to him this time? After all, a story with no conflict, with no danger to its hero, can hardly be much of a story. How far would that damned Cannon go?[image][How far indeed!]Crater XV, for all my fears that it'd mire itself in space exploration, turned out to be exactly as rambunctious and adventurous and gripping and thoughtful as I'd hoped it would be. Cannon is so skilled at telling an adventure tale that I cannot immediately draw to mind a single author who does it better. I nearly read the entire 496 pages in a single rapturous sitting. [3] Crater XV twists and wriggles and finds ever new ports into which its story might squirm and then dock. There were so many Oh What Is Going To Happen points throughout that I gave up predicting and simply held on to what Cannon fed me. This didn't mean I gave up trying to predict where our ship was going; it just meant that those predictions were generally pretty futile.Cannon, as it turns out, is wily.Crater XV returns with the same madcap humour as governed the prior work. Characters behave as lunatics, motivations are sometimes absurd, and Army is still completely invulnerable and superhuman—save for when he isn't. As well, Kevin Cannon brings back his use of expository onomatopoeia. It's even more often present in Crater XV than in Far Arden. Here's an example:[image][Onomatopoetic!]Still, as exciting as Crater XV is as an adventure story and as warming as it is as a source of humour, my favourite part of Cannon's sequel is its human aspect. Ultimately, this is what sold me so strongly on Far Arden as well. Readers more interested in a comedic adventure won't be required to think so hard at all and will simply be able to bask in the unadulterated mallemaroking. But for those of sterner stuff, those who crave the adventure of the human spirit and all the woes that adventure requires, Crater XV will provide ample fodder for meditation.While Far Arden principally concerned itself with the dangers inherent in ambition and the pursuit of dreams (as well as what it means to belong and to desire belonging), Crater XV treats (among other things) what drives the human animal to live, even after hope is twisted and dreams burnt to bare husks. Army Shanks begins at a raw place, but his is not the only story of finding life from lifelessness. There is a certain thematic resonance between many of the book's characters, from Army to Sztab to Arluk to Barty to Molniya to Drake and Richter. Even fifteen-year-old Wendy's reckless optimism reads as a personal artifice she's designed to push herself from an empty life toward something of value.[image]Another governing paradigm for these characters is their struggle to see beyond their own troubles and accurately assess the world as it is. Too many of them force their vision of the world to conform only to what they hope to see. Barty, for the least spoilery example, carries a desperate need to feel like his position as an Arctic League bureaucrat can still enable him to be the hero Canada wants. In his quest to justify a ""heroic"" attack on an oil tanker, he will not allow himself to see anything that contributes to a scenario in which the tanker's goal is less than bombing Canadian soil. And Barty's is the least of these delusions. Army, as the central figure of Crater XV, of course carries the strongest personal mirages, and these motivate him in a complexity of ways. Army is haunted by both the events recorded in Far Arden and a newly unveiled history that returns him to his orphaned childhood—and it's in this web of personal illusions that perhaps the book's truest plotline—a story wholly divorced from the exterior adventure that governs the Crater XV's narrative superstructure—finds its home.I didn't know how Cannon could follow up Far Arden with another Army Shanks story. Things seemed to wrap up fairly conclusively in the story as revealed in that first volume. I hadn't imagined such a robust sequel—or one that paid such service to the beloved original. And yet, Crater XV delivers. It's a huge book and it's extraordinarily fun. Similar to Far Arden, I'm not sure where exactly a sequel to Crater XV would come from. But Cannon is enormously imaginative and if he decides to make Far Arden a trilogy, then I will hunger for that third book as voraciously as I did for this second volume. And I expect that hunger will be likewise justified and then satisfied. Because, as wily as he is, Kevin Cannon delivers.[image][Kevin Cannon delivers, but I wouldn't necessarily say that he sexy delivers]__________NoteIt may sound like I'm gushing. That is because I clearly am. I love these books more than I love the vast majority of comics that I love. So yeah, I am gushing and I will continue to do so. Until you buy these two books and love them at least half so much as I do.__________Foototes1) Other fact: space and rockets don't exactly do much for me. I was a huge fan of space exploration as a kid. I subscribed to Odyssey magazine. I knew what a syzygy was. I was enthralled by Voyager and Pioneer. Skylab filled my eyes with wonder and, maybe, delight. I was roundly known as a ""space cadet"" for my astronomical loves.I'm not sure when that affection died or even what killed it. In second grade, I lived in the pages of Our Universe. By sixth, the only reason I knew anything about the Challenger before it erupted into a terrible historical footnote was that our school (and perhaps every school in the US) made sure we knew well and good that Christa McAuliffe was a schoolteacher and she was going to space and that, for some reason, made her a hero. (It hurts me to know that I was a cynical little bastard even then.)Maybe it was the nerdiness of my interest, the fact that friends so looked down on my looking up. Maybe it was the slow realization that space offered nothing but a colder, more isolated version of the same reality I dwelt in every day. I can't pin down the impetus or the moment, but somewhere between ages seven and thirteen, my love of outer space died. And it being space, even I did not hear it scream.[image]2) I talk briefly about why I thought the shift worked in the spoiler for Far Arden. If you'd like to read that explanation, here's a SPOILER. (view spoiler)[In Far Arden's conclusion, I appreciated that Cannon was saying starkly what he had been saying obliquely throughout the prior 368 pages. From the outset, we discover that Far Arden destroys lives. At first by the possibility of its existence, then by the certainty of its existence, and finally by the experience of its existence. The end is foreshadowed by much more than Fortuna's quotation of Lawrence Oates and the book's gathering darkness shows a steady increase as it goes: deaths are first played for laughs with characters we don't know (Flue), then move into heroism (Anger), then to tragedy (Amber), and finally to meaninglessness (with the rest). (hide spoiler)]3) It was only the fact that I wished to remain gainfully employed that kept me from taking a two-hour lunch break in order to devour the entire book at a once.__________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"May 02, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17194535-crater-xv

I mean, not a real fan. Real fans of the author would almost certainly consider me a dilettante—a lipstick Lovecraftian, if you will. Fact: I have never finished anything Lovecraft wrote. I gave At the Mountains of Madness a shot several years ago when I downloaded it for free for my old-gen Kindle. It was too slow, too dry, too far-removed to keep my interest.What then are my points of contact with the author's worlds? Through Mignola's Hellboy universe, first of all. I know he hasn't adapted the Cthulhu mythos but I had read that his cosmic monstrosites have been described as Lovecraftian. And since I loved his monsters and elder gods and tentacle-beasts, I decided that I liked whoever was the influential genesis for these creations. My other point of entry is the boardgame, Arkham Horror, which is set in Lovecraft's fictional stomping ground and employs his creatures and mythos. Because of that game (which, sidenote, is really pretty fun), I can give a knowing nod of recognition when someone namedrops Cthulhu or Shoggoths or even Shub-Nigguroth the Black Goat of the Woods.Unimpressive, I know. But here we all are.[image]With my previously abortive attempt to read ""At the Mountains of Madness,"" I was pretty excited when I discovered that INJ Culbard had adapted the story into the comics medium. I loved Culbard's work adapting the Holmes mythos with Ian Edginton and thumbed appreciatively through his work in Princess of Mars last time I was in an actual, physical bookstore (sadly, only window shopping). At the least, I knew I could finish the story this time. And I did. Culbard's attractive illustrations took me through a story that, while involving fascinating concepts, was actually pretty dull. The book has its up-sides for sure, but I'll hem and haw about where it went wrong for me before I get to the good stuff.Because I found the original so distancing and tedious that I couldn't finish it, I don't have any viable apparatus to judge whether to blame Culbard or Lovecraft for what I feel went wrong here. I lean toward Lovecraft because 1) he's dead and won't have his feelings hurt, and 2) the opening to the original At the Mountains of Madness wasn't that encouraging on its own. The biggest issue may be that Culbard leans pretty heavily on dialogical and narrative-bubble exposition across the entire tale's expanse. As the story is related in flashback by a surviving member of an arctic expedition, this seems sensible and keeps the reader in mind that we're encountering the recent past in which something terrible occurred. Unfortunately the text is rather wooden and so, while fitting the standard style of desiccated academic writing (as all academic writing I've encountered is1), is rather a chore to get through. It would have been nicer to see Culbard rely a bit more heavily on his artistic chops rather than on resurrecting so many of Lovecraft's words.2 It would have been far more difficult, I imagine, to rely so much on art to tell this story but I believe both that Culbard is prodigious enough to do the work well and that the book would have been much more interesting for the effort.[image]Part of the issue, perhaps, is something I alluded to in my  of Junji Ito's horror classic Uzumaki. I begin that  wondering at the comics medium's ability to interact with the horror genre so well as other mediums:I’m skeptical of comics’ power to truly horrify using supernatural elements. Because the reader controls entirely the pace of a story’s execution, one of the primary tools of the horror genre is kept from authors in the comics medium. Additionally, revulsion is increasingly difficult to elicit from static imagery—a gross drawing is merely that and draws forth none of that sense of fear or terror that aficionados of the genre tend to relish. Certainly a compelling story about the affects of war on a civilian population can horrify, but only because it is humanity who is the monster and not some lumbering creature of the imagination. There seems little room for the supernatural to scare us from the immobile, two-dimensional page.This is Lovecraft. This is cosmic horror. We all know that because that's what we (even we who've never read the work) know about Lovecraft. Space monstrosities that push mortal men toward insanity. And yes, horrifying things happen. Supernatural things. Things beyond the ken of these men to describe. We are allowed to peek beneath the veil of a whole, horrifying world. Something that should be disturbing and frightening and maddening. Only it isn't.[image]I'd say the problem is that we are jaded by years and decades of being fed unnatural images through film and literature (because, of course, we have!), but this isn't the whole answer. After all, film and prose fiction still have the ability to conjure fear of the uncanny. So then it seems a weakness unique to the comics medium—and a weakness that diminishes the ability to empathize with the protagonists of At the Mountains of Madness, who are clearly terrified by the horror they've stumbled into. Rather than feel anything relevant to their revulsion or terror, I simply had to acquiesce to a detached acknowledgement that these people are feeling these things and that the events and beings they are witnessing are actually horrifying. I don't blame this on either Culbard or Lovecraft but the medium.3Okay, so those are my two complaints. Give them what weight you will. But instead now let's move on to the happier, gilded shores of Culbard's art. [image]The artist here presents page after page of lovely illustrations. His cartooning is top-notch and his skill at rendering his characters leaves nothing to be desired. The reason I was excited to see what he'd do for Mountains was that in the short time I've been following his work (two years? three?), it has yet to disappoint me. While his figures are straightforward and simply conceived, he spends some level of invention toward panel and page design. In the present work, it is not uncommon for him to expand one panel to fill the background and gutters of the entire two-page spread. It's a killer technique that lends an expansiveness to his pages.4 The nature of Mountains' narrative gives Culbard numerous opportunities to experiment with lighting and he does a good job, dramatically illuminating subjects and casting demented shadows. The whole work is a visual treat.In the end, Culbard saves me the trouble, allowing me to experience what I imagine is a faithful recreation of Lovecraft's novella. The story itself does little more for me than serve to sate my interest in the mythos sparked by experiences with tangential works. It was fun to encounter (in some sense of the word) Elder Things, Shoggoths, Mi-Gos, and Cthulhu. It was cool to hear mention of the history of R'lyeh and to learn a touch more of the civilization that once thrived on the Plateau of Leng. I only wished I could have been more enthralled by the experience. Man, that would have been something!__________1) It doesn't have to be of course, and I'll admit to only having read a smallish pile of academic papers.2) If indeed that is what he's done here.3) A lot of this is conjecture. I may be wrong and it may be that horror isn't impossible in the medium. It may be either that I haven't encountered the right book or story yet or it may simply be that I am dead inside and therefore incapable of feeling fear or horror or revulsion at any of these plainly terrifying things.4) I don't remember him doing this in prior works I've encountered but now I want to go back and see what I missed.__________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,not set,"May 02, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7960820-at-the-mountains-of-madness

She named the polar bear trio in the first episode after her, her mother, and her infant brother—I, the papa bear, was at the office. One of our favourites though was an episode of The Life of Mammals that we found on Netflix called ""Social Climbers."" It's all about monkeys and it's amazing to watch. I know all kinds of animals are smart and use tools and surprise us constantly with their ingenuity—there's just something wonderful about these creatures in particular. My daughter and I always had a grand time snuggling up and watching the habits of these intelligent animals unfold under the warming tones of Attenborough's soothing narration.When I heard First Second would be publishing a non-fictional account of three of the foremost pioneers in primate studies, I was intrigued. When I discovered that it was written by Jim Ottaviani, I had to have it. His Feynman is one of my favourite non-fiction comics. Ottaviani's sense of what out of everything to convey is masterful. I couldn't wait to burn through Primates. Attenborough primed me for the book and Ottaviani's involvement sold me on its viability, but I was wholly unprepared for Maris Wicks.[image][Wicks wants you to think this is imaginary Jane Goodallbut I choose to believe it is real-life Wicks herselfswooping in to make all things beautiful]Wicks is beautiful.1 Wicks is gorgeous. Wicks is vibrant and verdant and lush and bright and comfortable and lively. This is cartoon art of the first caliber. I fell in love within pages. Her sense of these animals is perfect. Before reading Primates, I probably could have imagined any number of artists exploring Ottaviani's script with him. Now, that is impossible. Wicks owns Primates as much as Ottaviani (if not more!2).[image]Adding to the tremendous strength of Wicks' work on the book is her choices in colouring. It probably helps that she both illustrates and colours the work herself and that she evidently has some pretty mean skill with a palette. I've used words like verdant and lush and lively to describe her art. It's because of the colours. This is one of the greenest books I own. And not just some sad mix of drab greens that might dot the hillsides in your standard, grim contemporary fantasy adventure. Nah, Wicks' greens punch you in the face with how happy they are. This is a book that makes sitting for hours and days and weeks in the jungle to catch a glimpse of some monkeys doing something (anything!!)—well, it makes that jungle seem like the best place in the world to be. [image][It's like they can see into each other's souls!]And lest we imagine that Wicks has made a lie of the arduous routines that Primates' three protagonists underwent, I like to read this as Wicks transcending the mundane world of insect bites and cold mornings and wet clothes and cramping muscles and instead delivering us into the transformative mindset of the women who would happily endure these things for months and years in service to their dreams. In that sense, I think Wicks has captured something marvelous, something beyond words. Because while these women are built of tremendous determination, it's the joy they take in these animals that is what fuels that stubborn willpower.Primates tells the overlapping stories of three women who (through hard work that others were unwilling or unable to take on) discovered new things about chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. Two of them, Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey, were familiar to me. I had seen several documentary pieces on Goodall in high school circa 1990 and I was at least aware of the 1986 Sigourney Weaver film about Fossey, Gorillas in the Mist (even if it was a bit outside my interests at the time). Biruté Galdikas was entirely unknown to me—though the delightful fact from the cover that she wore a blade on her hip helped me anticipate her section. Each of these women are deeply associated with primate studies and each were tied together through the early direction of Louis Leakey.4[image]As a primer on these three women's work, Primates is perhaps a wild success. The reader is given a fair assessment of both the content of their work and a glimpse into its importance. The act of reading is almost wholly without challenge and is even invigourating; through the different narrative voices Ottaviani uses for each of the women (and briefly for Leaky as well) I found myself happily drawn into their own recollections of their work. For the neophyte in whom this book sparks interest, an initial list of resources for further studies is provided (being boring and lame and sometimes satisfied with too little, I simply opted for Wikipedia to round off some of the corners to my own body of knowledge in respect to these women).[image]Someone more familiar with these women and their scientific contributions will doubtlessly find Primates a less lively read than I did—as would anyone approaching a text aimed at an audience with a lower proficiency in a subject. A book of 133 pages dedicated to biographizing three lives is going to understandably overlook much of the content of those lives. This is not a criticism, but may be important for fans of Goodall or Fossey or Galdikas to keep in mind. Ottaviani does make understated references to certain things that those more familiar with his subjects will pick up on. An example:[image]And another:[image]One time Ottaviani and Wicks were a bit too coy, I think, and the mystery still eats at me. My wife too as it turns out. She read Primates a day or so after I finished, sparked by my exuberance for Wicks' art. After she turned the last page, I began to probe her (as I am wont) regarding her assessment of the work. I interrupted her just as she was getting started with the question: ""Was there anything you didn't get?"" A pause of consideration and then we spoke in unison: ""What did she sit on?!"" We still don't know. I tried Google and read a couple biographical articles on Galdikas, hoping against hope the event would be described—to no avail. Maybe some day. For now, when I think of Primates, two thoughts pop into mind before any others: 1) Soooooo pretty; and 2) What did she sit on?!If you read all that and somehow are confused as to what I think, here's the short version: I very much enjoyed Primates. It's a lot of fun even if it may leave the reader hoping for more information. I would have happily read the same book had it been 270 pages long. I might even had done so had it been 380. Maybe not, but probably. Primates' three (or, briefly, four) narrators are not as buoyant or rambunctious as Feynman was for Feynman, but they are different people and Primates' use of their voices is comfortable and warm (perhaps in Fossey's case, warmer than the woman herself). Ottaviani does a good job balancing between the three women and prevents the work from being about any single one of them to the diminishment of the others. I expect the work will age well and will be especially useful in giving younger readers a foothold into the study of primate ethnology.5 I think most readers will really really like6 Primates and most of those will even learn a thing or eight.________Footnotes1) This shouldn't need clarification, but I'm here talking about Wicks' art. Like how we might say that Monet is blotchy or Van Gogh is swirly or Pollack is drippy or Warhol is boring. I mean, we probably wouldn't but hopefully that gives you the idea of what twist of language we're working with here. Wicks, the human person, might be beautiful and gorgeous and vibrant and verdant (verdant?) and all these things, but I can't know that because I've never met or even seen her. So we'll stick to describing her luscious art.2) Sorry, man! If you want all the glory, you should choose to work with a lesser light next time.33) Don't worry! I'm kidding. I know you're not a glory hog.4) I'm not certain how much direction he actually gave, but the book makes it seem minimal. More logistics and networking within the home theater than anything.5) That the focus of the work is on three women (and not just arbitrarily on three women but justly) may be of help provoking interest in the sciences in young girls—a demographic to whom the sciences sadly seem rather opaque and uninteresting.6) This was my wife's actual evaluation: she ""really really liked"" the book.________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"May 01, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16002028-primates

And not just because they're mine or I have some familial duty to the ones who are related to me. I care about women because somewhere over the last twenty years, I began to empathize with them. Not all at once probably, but gradually. It came along with being able to empathize with all sorts of people who were not me. When I was twenty, I didn't get people. At all. I found everyone obnoxious and dull. I liked girls, sure, but only because I wanted to eventually carve myself into their lustrous flesh.1 I wasn't the greatest of people when it came to other people. I spent my childhood and teen years painfully shy, unable to make many friendships and so: unable to really get the knack of understanding how and why others might feel the things they might feel. I attribute this lack of empathy to something beyond the mere fact of my awkward introversions. I could have still learned to understand people had only I kept reading. But I didn't.I had been a voracious devourer of books up until junior high when suddenly my book-nerdiness became a social liability. I stopped reading lit entirely and instead picked up comics, which were dumb enough not to seem Smart. Dorky but not nerdy.2 A relevant fallout of this decision was that I was no longer reading the books that would have taught me to relate to characters of complex motivations and differing cultural foundations. Instead, I wallowed in seven years of cardboard characters with unrealistic motivations and monolithic concerns. It wasn't comics that made me unsympathetic, but they sure didn't help.(Comics in that era, of course, were nowhere near so varied or valuable as they are today. Three cheers for progress toward the visio-narrative utopia, eh?)In any case, when I hit age twenty I realized my social survival no longer depended on pretending not to like books—so I jumped right back in. I gradually began, with the help of fictional figures voicing the concerns of real authors, to soften. It was a slow road. I began to better understand people who were not me—or at least to apprehend that it was okay that they were not me. Fellow Americans of different cultural backgrounds, then people of ethnicities that were not straight-up Caucasian, then those outside the heterosexual spectrum, then those of foreign soil, then believers in different gods and ideologies. And then women. The order might be off but then again it might not. Regardless, over the nearly two decades that passed after my twentieth birthday, I grew a lot as a human and am thankful for the books that lit my path.And now all that is to say: when I approach a book like Sakuran, the experience is emotional for me. Moyocco Anno's book is about women in distressing circumstances, and throughout I felt the weight of the whole history that has arrayed itself against the female existence. I think of my wife, my daughter, my mother, my friends, women I know from the internet, and women I don't know at all and will never know. Societies over the long centuries and societies in this very moment have not made living the kindest of experiences for women—societies governed and purposed by my people, by men. I hate us for these inequities and a book like Sakuran fills me with tidal waves of regret and sadness, even if that is not its purpose.[image][That right there kind of justmakes you want to throw up on everybody forever]Moyocco Anno's Sakuran concerns Kiyoha, an 18th-century courtesan who is destined (by Anno's pen) to become the most celebrated of all the houses in Yoshiwara.3 Anno begins by introducing Kiyoha as she nears the height of her fame and then peels back for the rest of the book to chart the woman's course across what turns out to be a hard and bitter sea. Kiyoha is a ""strong"" female character in the sense that she survives to better herself through her experiences; but simultaneously, she is not immune to her circumstances and her life of prostitution under contract to her house takes evident toll on her. She realizes the world she's trapped by is terrible and makes the best of it, but she never shies away from acknowledging the reality that her role as courtesan is dominated by paternal influences.[image][Kiyoha, being paternally influenced]This is my first experience of Anno's artwork and it took me rather off-guard. Sakuran's art is bizarre and kind of wonderful. Her figurework is hyper-limber and her poses extend into a vibrant sort of grotesque.4 Characters motivate through a series of light physical impossibilities that work to provoke a sense of awkwardness that mirror Sakuran's narrative force. For those who critique manga for the Japanese creators' penchant for focusing too much on the eyes as a conveyance for emotion,5 the eyes in Anno's work will be awestriking. Belle's eyes in Beauty & the Beast are much larger than the average manga character's, and Kiyoha's eyes in Sakuran are much larger than Belle's. We've heard the cliché of a person's eyes being pools and The Lovely Bones introduced the treacle nickname ""Ocean Eyes."" Kiyoha's eyes would make Ocean Eyes look like two raindrops by the comparison. These two globes are as soulful as all the blues that spawned in the first decades of the 20th century combined. I mean, look at this:[image]I have it on pretty good authority that ""sakuran"" refers to confusion or derangement or mental agitation. The book's subtitle Blossoms Wild, as well as an apt description of the madness of Kiyoha's blooming sexuality under such a terrifying commodification of the female self, seems pretty probably a play on the homophony between sakuran and sakura, the Japanese term for cherry blossoms (and one of the more well-known Japanese words in America, thanks to the influx of manga and anime imports). Kiyoha's maturing and sexual bloom within the walls of the pleasure house is agitating for the character as well as for the reader. It seems trite to compare our distress to hers, but it's Anno's implication of the reader into the intimacies of Kiyoha's decade of depetaling6 that provokes the reader to empathize with Kiyoha's state—even if to a lesser degree.[image]While the broad strokes of Kiyoha's tale will be readily accessible (and possibly familiar7) to American readers, there's a lot that will likewise confuse (or at the least remain unobserved). Anno relies on a lot of cues that are probably easily discerned by Japanese readers and those more intimately familiar with Japanese feudal history and culture. I have perhaps a better than usual grasp of Japanese history for an American of non-Asian roots but am by no means fluent in the nation's culture and history—and I was oftentimes stumped by the meaning of things occurring on Anno's stage. Some of my difficulty certainly lay in the staccato nature of Anno's panel choices (what she'd show and what she wouldn't) and some of it lay in my difficulty in discerning identities of characters, but the bulk of any interpretive wrangling may have been due to my ignorance of era and history.8Despite the occasional struggles that slowed my reading, I found Sakuran an affecting work, harrowing and draining.9 I'm not sure if Anno plans any further exploration of Kiyoha (though the book wraps rather tidily), but Sakuran merits further exploration from readers if the ground is there to be tread. Footnotes1) Metaphorically speaking, of course.2) The distinction was important to me back then.3) Yoshiwara was the famous pleasure district in Edo (present-day Tokyo). Its houses of prostitution form the background for numerous literary works concerned with the era.4) Tip of hat to Tom Spurgeon's  that made this description click for me.5) An unhelpful and boring critique, even when phrased more obliquely as: I don't like manga because their eyes are so big. The complaint nearly always falls flat as a strange sort of hypocrisy because American cartoon styles (such as, say, Disney's used in Beauty & the Beast) use oversized eyes extensively as well, and generally not to so attentive effect as many examples of manga.6) I recognize the preciousness of describing a woman's initiation into coupled sexual experiences as ""deflowering,"" but Anno almost pushes the description by her title. As well, the coercive nature of Kiyoha's sexual engagements are rapacious and demanding and strip her of any of the tenderness we treasure in the potential warmth of the sexual act.7) I often kept in mind Catherine McCormack's courtesan's life in 1998's Dangerous Beauty. The similarities are as vivid as the contrasts. While Dangerous Beauty pits the hypocrisies of the church against its protagonist, Kiyoha only struggles against her society's view of the woman (or at least the pleasure house woman) as disposable.8) My wife here disagrees with my assessment of rating the book Good despite the difficulty I had with sometimes knowing what was going on. She felt that the issues of narrative interpretation were (perhaps even intentionally on the artist's part) principally the fault of Anno's design choices rather than brought on by our cultural discrepancies. Michelle appreciated the work that she thought was being attempted but evaluates the work as actually accomplished as only being Okay.9) Emotional involvement is always very subjective, of course, so I will always suspect my own history and circumstance governing me rather than the work—but I would be irresponsible not to mention it.________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,not set,not set,"May 01, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13153403-sakuran

But my father, he was a career artist in the real sense—in the sense that he produced physical objects of art. Ceramics and Chinese brush painting. The point is: we're both all about the aesthetic value of human creations, no matter the medium. He likes my work and I like his and whenever one of us runs into something sublime, we Facebook each other and say: ""Hey. Look at this. It is worth your time.""So minutes after cracking open and flipping through my edition of Sergio Toppi's Sharazde: Tales from the Arabian Nights, I had placed an order for a second copy—this one to ship to Europe where my father lives. I didn't want him to see scans of Toppi's work online. I didn't want to message him photographs of these drawings (though I couldn't resist an Instagram in his honour). No, he needed to behold this gorgeous collection of art in person and I would not wait for him and my mother to fly out to visit in the summer. I needed to share this now. Or as close to now as shipping to Europe could approximate.[image]And I wasn't disappointed. His reaction very much mirrored my own. He was just as blown away and gob-smacked as I was. Being a genuine surfer hippie from the genuine surfer hippie days, the word ""stoked"" might have held some play as well. There was joy, there was adulation, and there was awe. In short, Toppi's work received from my father (and from myself) exactly the reaction his work deserves.Because, oh man.1[image]The only other comics er I actively read remarked on the fittingness of having Walter Simonson introduce the book. Simonson's best work is clearly influenced by Toppi—much of his Mighty Thor seems a marriage between Toppi's visual topography and Kirby's brute dynamism. But while Simonson is all about the excitement of the actions in which his characters revel, Toppi is quiet and reserved. His work (at least here represented) is reflective and considerate. His drawings are mysteries and evoke the sacred even more deeply than Craig Thompson's attempts in Blankets.I've been describing Sharaz-De in terms of its art and even think of it primarily as an art book—something to display for guests—rather than as a comic book or graphic novel. It has a story and it has writing, but those things really seem mostly in place to provoke Toppi to draw something interesting and amazing and earth-shatteringly beautiful. Honestly, I may never read the book's story ever again. And that's fine and I don't mind. I certainly don't feel slighted. This is an amazing book and worth every penny I spent on it.[image]Part of my ambivalence toward the book's narrative aspect may be that it's an adaptation of a kind of literature I generally avoid: the fable. Toppi is adapting some of the stories of Scheherazade, the ken of which have long filtered into our societal consciousness. Even if one is unfamiliar with the tales of the Arabian nights, the structure and morals are ubiquitous. Characters who are dishonest, ungrateful, and oath-breakers meet untimely and often terrible ends. If you make a promise to a strange being who gives you wonderful fortune with a single stipulation, whatever you do, don't blow it where that stipulation is concerned. These fables are common across cultures—so if you've read European or Asian fables, you know the drill as well. Just desserts figure prominently.Toppi doesn't do any astounding narrative acrobatics with these fables. They are told in rather straightforward tone. They are there and they are faithful and not much more. But as I said, who cares when they were the genesis for such wild visual imaginations. I've included some scans with this  (as is my wont), but please don't imagine these do anything near to approximating what you'll see in Sharaz-De. It'd be like a guy carrying a faxed photo of his girlfriend in his wallet. These scans are merely sad facsimiles of the crisp printing that inhabits the paperscape of Archaia's lush, large book.[image]I've read that Archaia is using Sharaz-De as a test case to prove whether or not there's an American market for more of Toppi's work. I hope, almost desperately, they'll sell well enough to merit future editions. I can guarantee that if I still have a discretionary income, then I will own each and every one of these.Because, oh man.A Note on the PoliticalAs with any transmission of an ancient Arab work by a European's pen, there will be questions with regard to the looming spectres of Orientalism and appropriation. The concerns are valid so far as they go, and Toppi does lean somewhat on Orientalist trappings, but not nearly so much as we might expect from a work that came out of the 1970s. More, the mystery and foreign grandeur of his work in Sharaz-De seems to mirror his own penchant for making every story mysterious and foreign. Even a cursory survey of his work shows that Sharaz-De is not unique in its wild landscapes, wandering attires, and exotic figures—these are common traits across his oeuvre. While not perfect in its portrayal of these people and their culture—more because of wild reinvention than misrepresentation—I felt that Toppi acquits himself pretty well on Sharaz-De.This reinvention does bring up the question of appropriation and the right of appropriation. And here's where I say that I'm torn on the whole appropriation issue. And here's where I begin a big ol' excursis. Good thing the 's over and this is just an end note, huh?[image]While I'm never happy for people to feel they've been wronged and I like to sympathize and do what I can to show them my compassion, I believe reappropriation is not only intimate to the human experience but actually Good. Reappropriation is one of the ways that members of humanity and human communities naturally interact. I visit your house and I see something I really like in the way you decorate the walls in your living room and I go home and incorporate some of those ideas into my own visual landscape. This is how cultural expression naturally works, regardless of power balance. I'll incorporate your good ideas into my creative expression whether you're my boss or I'm yours.I don't have any problem with this on the face of it. Sharing culture is good and builds community. I think, though, that with the rise of concepts of intellectual property, people and cultures have more and more grasped onto the idea that they own ""their"" practices and visual markers. Because I don't actually believe in intellectual property,2 it's a hard sell for me. I also think it's hubris and naivete to believe that what you or your culture has produced is all yours—as if it wasn't created through the appropriation of other cultures' intellectual/visual products.Rather, I see three responsible ways for Good People to deal with reappropriation. 1) Be compassionately invested in world community. The big problem (as I see it) with exocultural appropriation is when it's done by nationalists, people wholly invested in their own community with no interest in the community of others. This is even worse when the appropriating community is oppressing the appropriated culture. The problem then isn't primarily the appropriation but oppression. Evidence: I've yet to find an Asian who was angry at Avatar the Last Airbender's use of distinctly Asian cultural cues, 3 even though the show was forged by a couple of white American males. Why? Because the show and the creators were as respectful as anything. 2) Recognize cheesiness when you see it—and then avoid. Hot Topic is (or was... do they still exist?) the modern American youth's highly commercialized reappropriation of punk cultural cues. They've branded and marketed particular aesthetics that punk culture once used (and may still use, I don't know) to distinguish itself. Hot Topic is so very not punk. And it's obvious to anyone who'd care to notice. 3) When you encounter an individual who is upset by your appropriation of some of their cultural cues, dialogue with them. Discover what you can do to mollify their concerns. Explain that you realize that what you've appropriated doesn't mean the same thing to you as it does to them and explain (not excuse) why you've done the thing you've done. Listen to their complaints and reasons why they're uncomfortable. Learn from each other. Foster community.That's my off-the-top-of-my-head response. And goes some way toward describing why I don't think we should be bothered by Sergio Toppi's version of the Scheherazade. Footnotes1) I'm trying hard here not to open the book for reference because I'll lose way too much time falling again into Toppi's illustrations. It's really an amazing world he's created.2) It's complicated and I'm still working out for myself what that even means.3) Which doesn't mean there aren't any, but I think the general thought is that ATLA gets appropriation right._____________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,not set,not set,"May 01, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7716394-sharaz-de

One of the greatest struggles for a literary work concerned with faith in the unseen[image]Introduction OneReligion in literature is hard to do well. One of the greatest struggles for a literary work concerned with faith in the unseen is negotiating that breach between Why Should I Care and Hey You're Preaching At Me. The borderlands that lie between the two are filled with deep and often satisfying conversations—or at least ones that help readers to recognize the breadth of perspectives that naturally hover across the human landscape. And then consider even those works that don't press us to think seriously about what it means to be human in the face of all else that exists—if they resonate with us without dogmatizing, we tend to appreciate them a bit more. And this is a phenomenon unique to the realm of fiction.When picking up a brick of text called Beliefs of the Coptic Church, one would likely be disappointed if the book hemmed and hawed and only vaguely laid out what the Coptic Church might believe. We not only excuse blatant and direct reference to a particular theological dogma when reading a reference work discussing that dogma's merits—we expect it. Fiction, on the other hand, long ago ceased its comfortable position as a vessel to convey a distinct and particular moral. Such overtly displayed lessons as found in ""The Fox and the Grapes"" are largely seen as reliquary, a nod to a long-passed and primitive kind of reader. Nowadays we, for good or for ill, are embarrassed by fictions that wear their heart too immodestly exposed.[image][p.s. I am Iron Cat]At least we are when we're not members in good standing of the particular choir that is being preached to in a work. Christians who read Doug TenNapel's CreatureTech seem a lot less fidgety around the book's very very Christian climax. Atheists and those who've fled fundamentalist Christianity seem much more willing to overlook Craig Thompson's rather weighted evaluation of churchgoers in Blankets. The problem with each of these works is that we feel a little too handily that we are being preached at. It's an uncomfortable thing: first because whenever the author's agenda overwhelms the story, we lose sense of their world being a real kind of place; and second because fiction is so well suited to discussion that most contemporary readers will find its repurposing for monologue a bit jarring.1Happily Jason Brubaker's reMIND doesn't, I think, fall into this trap. It has things to say about belief, questions to ask, but it does so with enough humility that one can easily forget that it was even about a question of faith. And really, maybe it's not about that. Maybe religion is just part of the world he's unveiled for the space of this story and maybe the book is about living, and so naturally treats our beliefs in unseen possibilities. [image]In any case, while Brubaker employs direct reference to a divine entity (the Invisible) and even some less overt clues as to whom the Invisible might best represent, he keeps it oblique, allowing readers to make their own decisions about his characters' cosmogony. In CreatureTech, Doug TenNapel wallops readers over the head by having his non-believing protagonist actually flatout encounter the divine and witness crucifixion. It's a crude hammer the size of Mjolnir that TenNapel uses to pound penny nails into an Ikea version of faith and belief. (Fortunately, TenNapel almost redeems his book through sheer madcap humour—what he lacks in subtlety, he nearly makes up for in bravado.) [image][This is when TenNapel's hero in Creaturetech actually experiences Jesus the Christ on an alien world in alien guise.]Brubaker's path is more thoughtful and more considerate and more enjoyable and hits less like the eighteen-wheeler of belligerent proselytizing than TenNapel's. reMIND's characters have no direct encounter with the divine. No vision. No dream. No voice in the midst of fire or storm. Their Invisible remains invisible and if they continue to believe, they do so out of faith, out of a hope in things not seen. And because of this, I found that I could enjoy Brubaker's story for what it was rather than have to stop and think about what I thought about how much I agreed or disagreed with his characters' personal ideologies.Introduction TworeMIND is one of those books that I thought was going to be one thing and was excited about the thing I thought it was going to be and then it turned out to be something else entirely and I was a little disappointed and then forty pages later I didn't care and was excited again. The book opens with gorgeous art depicting a mechanically inclined woman named Sonja climbing a tower to do some work on a propeller turbine. [image]I wanted a story about her and her life and her trials. I wanted her personal dramas to unfold across a landscape of workshops and machinery and oil and gaskets and tools. I wanted Lawrence Marvit's Sparks without the fantasy. But pages later, when I discovered that this wouldn't be at all the direction Brubaker would be taking, I was disappointed. Completely unfair of me, I know, but it was as if I had witnessed the murder of my new best friend. My new best imaginary friend, as it turned out. Fortunately, Jason Brubaker is a talented storyteller and has things to say even if they aren't the things I imagined for him to say. [image]Pretty quickly, things take a turn for more wild and rambunctious paths. Talking animals, undersea civilizations, body-swapping, political coups. I blew through both (handsomely packaged!) volumes of reMIND rather quickly. Maybe over a couple hours? Maybe less? Even though his book is not the quiet character study I'd injudiciously hoped for, it's very good at being exactly what it is: a sometimes adventure, sometimes fantasy, sometimes theological rumination.The ArtThe first thing most readers will notice—before the talking cat, before the talking lizard, before the talking rat, before the talking sea anemone—is Brubaker's art. It's gorgeous, actually gorgeous. I read that he works (worked?) for Dreamworks animation. After reading reMIND, it's obviously to their credit that they thought to hire him. reMIND's visual troposphere is a beautiful mix of alien and familiar. Though deeply unlike, it reminds me of Moebius in that. His characters have the kind of fluidity that those with animation backgrounds tend to boast over their other comics-illustrating compatriots. As well, the book does a good job designwise, laying out some wonderful panels and scenes. [image]His character designs are usually pretty tight, even if often more cartoony than I generally prefer—the design for the lizard princess Cyrene is particularly good, being both grotesque and beautiful simultaneously.[image]I appreciated Brubaker's use of Photoshop (or some similar image-editing/creating software) for colouring. He uses, I believe, a number of watercolour washes (and oils) masked and recoloured to lend texture to his art.2 His colour choices are vibrant and fit the proposed mood well. [image]Another technique he employed that I thought worked particularly well focused on the use of white, overlit backgrounds to silhouette his foreground action. The effect creates a kind of bloom around figures, increasing their dynamism and pushing the reader to sense action even in the static.[image]Brubaker uses digital blurs to create dimensionality rather than strictly relying on colour cues as most (colour) comics would.[image]Anything Else?reMIND is above all else: fun. It's primarily an adventure story, the tale of righting a kingdom's wrongs. It has other stuff (like the religion aspect), but those things may seem more like local colour meant to add solidity to Brubaker's world rather than to stand as the book's purpose. reMIND is an enjoyable romp that may or may not prompt further reflection on its themes. If it does, fantastic. The self-examined life and all that. If it doesn't, it's still a pretty bitchen little story.[image]And maybe its sequel will be about Sonja's life on the outskirts of a society that can never truly understand or appreciate her. And how that affects her love life!3BonusBecause I'm completely awesome, Jason Brubaker drew a picture of Victuals the cat in my books.[image]Actually, I lied. It had nothing to do with how awesome I may or may not be. It's just 'cuz he's a nice guy.Footnotes1) It's possible that Blankets almost sidesteps this by almost being non-fictional. The book is ostensibly a recapitulation of Thompson's childhood growing up in fundamentalist America but is in reality a fictionalization of that experience (at least more so a fictionalization than any straightforward memoir would be). Strangely enough, Tezuka's Buddha very neatly dodges the awkwardness of the dogma question despite similarly being a fictionalization of religious history and presenting its story as True Fact. The loophole might rest both in that Tezuka's life of the Buddha is filled with blatant fantasy elements and in that the book doesn't really ever take itself very much seriously at all—if a movie of the life of Christ received similar treatment, it would be picketed more than Scorsese's Last Temptation.2) I guess this to be the case because I use the same technique in my own illustration work and think it looks pretty nice. Colour me biased.3) Maybe Jason Brubaker is better off not consulting me with what to do next.________[Review courtsey of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"May 01, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11920745-remind

For the most part I've either abandon[image][These take up a lot of space]There are very few books I read any more that I'm partially embarrassed by. For the most part I've either abandoned the stuff that shames me or grown confident enough in my enjoyment that I can feel no guilt for reading something others might not understand. And yet, there remains that small number of works that I demur to recommend—or even admit I read.1 Negima: Magister Negi Magi is one of those. It's highly embarrassing to me, but I can't stop. Because for all the ways it's really bad, there are as many ways in which it's really good.[image][Magic, yo!]I came to Negima through another guilty pleasure. In 2001 or 2002, I decided I needed to check out all these books that were importing from Japan in the freshly minted manga wave. I had read Akira way back when Marvel was releasing it through Epic and scattered issues of Viz's Area 88 and First Comics' Lone Wolf and Cub, but that was all more than a decade earlier. Coming to manga at that time just after the turn of the millennium was, for me, daunting. There were a lot of titles available and a lot more coming out every month. And despite the internet, it was still pretty difficult to find legitimate critical sources from which to find recommendations. After combing through forums and blogs (2002 was pretty much the zenith of the blogging phenomenon2), I saw the title Love Hina crop up often enough that I began to recognize it when walking through Walden Books or Suncoast Video (remember those!). I figured what the heck and picked up Love Hina volume 1 as my first foray into modern manga imports.The book was bizarre, rather offensive, and kind of intriguing. I was immediately confronted with blatant pandering to a decidedly lascivious male gaze, sexism, and probably even misogyny. My memory of the series is a bit spotty, but I do recall not being comfortable with the book. Still, in the interest of not prejudging cultural expression foreign to my own, I wanted to give Love Hina a fair shake. I picked up the second book, confident that reading two volumes would fulfill Due Diligence and then I could abandon the series. Only, I grew attached to the characters. For all their fulfillment of sexist tropes and promotion of female objectification, these were characters whose plot I became invested in. So I begrudgingly finished off the series. The conflict within me was real, but I've always been fairly good at sifting wheat from chaff. Being a thinking person whose ideological foundations are constantly evolving with the acquisition of new information, it's rare to encounter a work from any author that doesn't contradict some aspect of my paradigm-shifting belief system. I became, then, accustomed early on to reading books and encountering art that said things oppositional to what I believed. Sometimes those things would be deeply confrontational with the way I perceived the world. So I learned not to be entirely put off by such encounters but to instead compartmentalize for evaluation after reading. It's been a helpful system for me and allows a level of critical involvement impossible were I to simply react in the midst of a text. So that's how I read Love Hina. And that's how I read Ken Akamatsu's following work, Negima.[image][*hugs*]Not long after I finished with Love Hina, I discovered that Akamatsu would be releasing a new series, featuring a ten-year-old British wizard teaching a class in Japan. I figured I'd give it a shot and hoped that the author had gotten the fan service out of his system.3 He, as it turned out, had not. And in several substantial ways, Negima is a much more objectionable work than Love Hina is. But it also paints a much more compelling portrait of the women it horribly objectifies.Negi Springfield is ten years old (almost) and has just graduated from his school of wizardcraft and witchery and the sorting hat has decided that he will be employed at an all-girls junior high in Japan. The girls junior high at Mahora Academy is part of a much larger academic complex, with attached elementary and high schools and university. Its headmaster and several teachers are wizards, so Negi's not completely on his own. Because Negi's only ten and not quite capable of caring for himself (because he's ten), the headmaster installs the boy in the room of Asuna and Konoe (the headmaster's granddaughter). Hijinks, of course, ensue.[image][Hijinks!]Not only are there plenty of opportunities for naive and innocent Negi to accidentally stumble into his students topless, bottomless, and any other assortment of awkward pseudo-sexual situations,4 but the author forces the point regularly. In the beginning, while the series flounders for a few volumes, Negi is given a flaw by which if he is criticized too sharply, he'll sneeze. And if he sneezes, he'll disintegrate the clothing of anyone around him. (Note: he teaches at a girls' school.) Beyond this, several of his students develop feelings for him even though—as Asuna continuously reminds everyone—he's only ten and this makes the whoops-I'm-naked scenes still more awkward. [image][Scenes like this are not uncommon, like, at all.]Like Love Hina, the nudity in Negima is coy and silly. The girls are unashamedly drawn fully nude but are nippleless. Either strands of hair or amazing tricks of light work to obscure their nipples so that we never need worry about seeing too much (as if nude fifteen year-olds weren't already too much). Groins are always hidden by legs or other props. The whole thing reminds me of that Mormon bubble-porn meme that was circling the drain a few years back. In the end, I'm not at all sure what to make of this stuff. The girls are drawn like twenty-three-year-olds but their ages put them well below the age of consent, thrusting them into the spotlight of awkward fantasies for I'm sure any number of the title's readership. (Maybe it's all some subtle commentary on the arbitrary nature of social rules like ages of consent vs evolutionary instinct.5 Or maybe it doesn't matter since the target demographic is fifteen years old anyway? Actually, I don't know who the target age for the book really is.) At any rate, Negi's students are regularly objectified in blatantly sexual manner and not (usually) in service to the plot. It's stale and old and often misogynistic. And I'm sure it does nothing to foster an environment of care and comfort for girls in Japan—or from the guys who read the book over here.So why bother, right?[image][That this is an actual outfit worn by a fifteen-year-old girl is pretty much indefensible.]The strange fact of the matter is that for all that (and actually in opposition to all that), these books—like Love Hina before them—are curiously enjoyable. The real joy of Negima lies beyond its building of anticipation and pacing out of scheduled reveals. Those are all good and fine and keep things moving in the narrative department, but the greatest abundance of Negima's strengths is in its character building. The book begins with Negi Springfield and his class of thirty-one girls, and while some of them only get passing personalities, it's pretty impressive how many of them (an easy majority) Akamatsu explores in better-than-average detail. Through revealing these girls' characters, Akamatsu engages the reader's empathy for their circumstances, bringing greater tension and involvement in their struggles and trials. More than that, by turning these girls into full-orbed characters, Akamatsu actually begins subverting his sexual objectification of them.There's a delicious6 clash between contradictory purposes that actually mirrors how many inhabitants of our paternalistic world are happy to behave. The book posits that these young women are foremost people with strengths and dreams and goals that exist wholly apart from their genetic sexual disposition. They are individuated apart from their relationship to the series' male lead (this is solidified in the series epilogue in volume 38). And yet, for all that—for all their character strength both tied to and independent from their femaleness—Akamatsu always returns to their position as object for sexual fetishment. This is really how most men (and a fair number of women) treat the real-life women who inhabit their lives, mixing sensible well-regard with a careless desire to sexualize without consequence. That Negima does this so blatantly deserves, I think, at least bookclub-level consideration; and while Akamatsu may not have intended any net good from his creative decisions along these lines, I think the opportunity here for the reader to critically examine their own understanding and treatment of the female person is worthwhile and should not be overlooked in the face of disgust for the surface of objectification.[image][What's being a girl have to do with...?]The most curious thing about Negima is that Akamatsu first establishes his female characters as sexual objects and then reestablishes them as non-object persons. And while he ping-pongs between their object and non-object states (sometimes within space of a single panel), the title's final statement is in support of these women not as objects but as wonderful, full-fledged characters. This is not to justify the book's rather gross and awkward use of sexuality, but to merely recognize its complexity.And now because we all7 approach texts containing disagreeable content with a sense of nuance and find ourselves able to appreciate quality and value even while disapproving of aesthetic or moral deficits, let's talk about what makes Negima something I rate well despite my deep conflicts over the book's material.I've already mentioned Akamatsu's character work, but here are some specifics. Negi, the book's hero, is only ever okay. He's a bit of a Mary Sue but never really gets in the way of the book's true characters, the students. Negi begins the book as a fledgling magician, fresh from the academy and ready to prove himself. He's rather singleminded and so as much as he takes his role as teacher (and eventually protector) to these thirty-one girls seriously, he always struggles with his need to prioritize his true goal of locating his missing father. He's self-sufficient, self-reliant, and self-absorbed. If his character has an arc, it's wrapped up in his struggles 1) to put his students first and 2) to learn to rely on the powerful, wise, and intelligent friends who are happy to help him out. [image][But at least this happens at one point, right?]But as I've implied, Negi may not even really be the main character in his own book. It's fun to watch him grow up a bit, even if he never really has to strain to do so. The real protagonist is his class of thirty-one girls. While the book seems to think it's the story of how Negi becomes the Best Wizard Ever, actually sitting down and reading the thing it becomes clear that this is really the tale of a bunch of girls who gradually discover the world is full of magic and how they'll interact with that knowledge. And while, as a class, there's never really any grave conflict over these girls' acceptance of the magical world (and a character arc with no conflict is generally dimly viewed under most rules of narrative critique), the charm of the individuals who make up Negi's class is so winning that it's hard not to consider their story worthwhile.The girls are varied in temperament, skills, backgrounds, interests. Asuna has mysterious abilities and amnesia. Evangeline is centuries old and has millions of dollars in bounties on her head (and a crush on Negi's father). Nodoka is bookish in the extreme and her primary skill seems to be her courage in overcoming her shyness. Another girl is Negi's descendant from the future. Another is trying to be a good gymnast. Another wants to draw manga. Another died in 1941. Another is a scientist. Another is a chef. Another is a robot. Another is an orphan adopted by the church. Another has trained for years to protect the life of another student, who is the headmaster's grand-daughter. Only a handful of these girls have full arcs, but out of the thirty-one, each gets narrative spotlight for at least a short time and most are given distinct personalities and stories. That by series' end I can identify and tell you about almost all of them is, to me, pretty amazing.[image]Despite the title's rocky start, most of the stories end up being a lot of fun. After two volumes, I had given up on the book. Negima, in those volumes, just seemed an endless stream of disconnected school-daze stories and excuses to showcase nude teens. I took a long break from the series and then somehow got the third volume (maybe from the library). That volume was a distinct step in a better direction. The entire volume presents a single narrative arc (prior volumes never had stories longer than two chapters) and introduces the first hints that there might be some driving story behind the series. Volumes four through six offer a still longer arc and build more characterization and history into the series. As well, the fan service gets scaled back a bit, allowing the story to breathe on its own merits. By this point, I was invested enough in the story and characters that seeing where they'd go convinced me to stick with the series.Akamatsu seemed to have trouble deciding what kind of series Negima would be. The first couple books seem to aim for Harry Potter crossed with harem comedy. After volume two, however, the harem aspect is relegated to occasional filler episodes scattered across the thirty-six remaining volumes. With volume three, the series seems to transform into supernatural adventure. Then, around volume eleven or so, the book becomes a tournament book for about three volumes. Then it becomes an otherworldly adventure, then tournament book, and then a kind of world-shattering epic adventure. Scattered throughout are chapters that seem to want to transform the book into a romance comedy. If the reader pays too close attention, a kind of literary whiplash may result, prompting frustration in those who want the book to be a single thing. Personally, I found the constant evolution of the series endearing—as it's hard to stay mad at the mistakes when the status quo is shattered with such alacrity and ease.[image][Annnnnd: fight.]There remain a couple more things to talk about. Foremost perhaps, if one can minimize concern for the book's sexuality, most readers will want to know about the title's premature conclusion. For reasons I'm not yet aware of, Akamatsu elected to end the series before the principal story actually wrapped. The conclusion is moderately satisfying. With chapter 353 (of 355), all the story points are tied up save for Negi's quest for his father. This was the reason behind Negi's entire mission and so it's kind of the most important piece of the story. Chapters 354 and 355 zip the reader ten or more years into the future to a reunion of Negi's classmates where we are given a brief summary of how Negi's quest concluded. The series ends with an epilogue giving biographical synopses of each of Negi's students. It's a little bit underwhelming—but less so if one considers the series to be the story of Negi than that of his students. It's problematic, but could be worse.[image]The other thing is the sexuality. I've talked about it a bit already, but it may be worthwhile to discuss the age problem just a bit.These girls are 14 and 15 years old according to their plot points and so, by fetishizing them, Akamatsu promotes a sort of statutory objectification. But then again, not really? These girls don't carry the awkward sexuality, physical proportionality, or carriage of a young teenager, but are instead mature women that the plot simply decides must be junior high students.8 Still, no matter how old these girls appear, Negima encourages the readers' acceptance of them as junior-high-aged (even while confusingly depicting them as being much older).I'm conflicted on this point somewhat. I think it's good to recognize that women, even young women, are sexual beings as much as anyone else—that they might have all the desires, curiosities, and kinks that you may have and plenty you don't. Negima recognizes that and pursues it (doggedly). The problem of course is that it does so with a camera lodged distinctly and completely within the cleft of the male gaze. Akamatsu presents strong female characters that are sexual and don't (often) apologize for their sexual natures—but he does so with the goal of titillizing his male audience (at least I presume his motive and audience here). It's one thing to present a mature and thoughtful depiction of a woman and her natural appetites. It's another to do so in order that a man can turn that woman into a sexual object. Too much, I'm afraid, Akamatsu's work is fueled by this latter prompt. And whether that's his intent or his editors', the result is pretty gross and kind of reprehensible.[image][The girl here remarking on Negi's small penis is hundreds of years old but trapped in a ten-year-old's body.]As I've suggested, it's rare that a single ideological element (or even a collection of such elements) is enough to cause me to judge a book's quality in one way or another.

Offered by Junot Diaz, one of the Third Millennium's first crop of kick-ass authors, we aren't given any context for whether this is just a general appraisal or if this was the summary of Diaz' remarkably elegant 2500-word discussion of Red Handed itself. I was a little suspicious (having been born in the early '70s and therefore in the tail-end cutoff for Generation X, suspicion is my natural state). Chalk it up to years of being lied to by marketing and media or maybe just to envy for the fact that Junot Diaz 1) hasn't declared me The Man and 2) likely is so unaware of who I am that point 1) is as likely as winning the lottery without playing. I thought ""Matt Kindt is the man"" was pretty weak so far as endorsements go. But then I asked my wife what she thought after she finished reading this book a few days ago. She basically reiterated Junot Diaz, albeit using completely different words:""He's... he's some kind of genius, isn't he?""And as it turns out, they're both right, Diaz and my wife. Kindt's mind twists and turns in a way that is perfectly in tune with the kind of narrative goodies he regularly delivers in his books. I first encountered Kindt's work with Super Spy, which stands shoulder-to-shoulder in a tie for my favourite piece of espionage fiction with John le Carré's The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. Ever since, I have never been disappointed with the magic he so carelessly weaves through his stories.[image][Matt Kindt includes the inside of his head in this book.]While very different from Super Spy structurally,1 Red Handed does something similar in terms of taking several disparate threads and weaving them together into a satisfying whole. The stories of strange criminals start and stop, each concluding with the perpetrator being cuffed by the city's super detective, Gould. These are interleaved with artless sections of dialogue. It takes a while to apprehend the pattern—but when one does, it's hard not to stop and think ""Heh"" or ""Little scamp"" or ""Whoa"" in that kind of way that offers a silent congratulations to Kindt for letting us take part in this twisting genius.Beyond the conceit of the Twist—that moment in the storytelling when the author turns the tables on the reader and turns the story they were reading into another story entirely—Kindt's structure for Red Handed allows him to effortlessly break off from his story and engage in a little bit of philosophical discussion about the nature of crime and law. Often in ambitious literary work, these excursions are narrative cheats that authors use to force-feed some added value into what would otherwise be a pretty mundane set of plot paces. While I was nervous for a time that Kindt had stepped into that common trap, Red Handed vindicates itself and Kindt uses these discussions to inform the story and enrich the reader's participation in its conclusion. In fact, Kindt's finale would be hollow without the ranging conversation that governs it.[image][You know what else isn't a crime? Skateboarding.]I haven't yet read Mind MGMT (though I'm looking forward to it2), but of Kindt's other works I cannot decide between Super Spy and Red Handed as my favourite. Both are complex, valuable, and worth your time. It's possible that Red Handed may be the more ambitious. I don't know. I'll probably just have to reread both to make sure. And that's not an event I'll dread by any means. Matt Kindt is one of my favourite creators and I can't imagine a time when I stop anticipating what he'll produce next. Because: as it turns out this man really is some kind of genius, isn't he?A Note about PerfectionWhile I think Red Handed is a good book, a great book, and maybe even a fantastic book, it is not a perfect book. What is really, I know, right? Still, while Kindt continues to hone his craft, I'd like to talk briefly about his path so far (as presently culminating for the moment in Red Handed).Kindt, the some-kind-of-genius that he is, strikes me as foremost an Idea Man. Everything he's shown us so far paints him as prodigiously imaginative. He has big ideas for his overarching story, for the forms those stories take, and for some of the intricacies of how his pages and panels will lay out.3 I don't look for any improvement on his part in this area. He has, so far as I'm concerned, arrived. If not perfect for what he's doing, his ideas are close enough that we mere mortals cannot distinguish well enough to complain.The area where I'd most like to see continued improvement is in the way he uses his art. Before even beginning down this road, I'd like to clarify that I think his art is good and enjoyable. With that, let me flesh this out just a tiny bit.Kindt's art is indubitably unique to the current expression of the medium. He uses a kind of lumpy brushwork that allows him to stretch perspective and exaggerate anatomy such that he can engage in the kind of forced focus that his idea-play sometimes requires. With a crisper, more defined and realistic style, these visual ideas would break down and the reader would be distracted by the sort of uncanny-valley experience that naturally occurs by bending perspective. I love this about his art and the way he employs it. His style allows him to do things impossible for whole swaths of other creators.The style does have a weakness, however, in that its looseness means interpreting panels can be difficult. There are times at which, because of the subject Kindt chooses to pursue, more detail is required in order to understand panel progression at a liquid speed with which readers are comfortable. Here's an example:[image]My presumption is that across these five panels we're meant to read a single chronological sequence. You have the man seducing the woman who then falls asleep and then into a deeper sleep and then he sits on the edge of the bed and then dresses. I think that's how we're to read it, but I'm not certain. There are issues with that reading. The chief problem is that in the two panels in which the woman sleeps and then sleeps more deeply (indicated by the stream of Zs incensing up from her head), the woman sleeps alone. The man is not present in the bed with her. Suddenly, he sits in underwear on bed's edge and presumably (under my interpretation) is putting on his glasses. In the next he is dressed, but the woman's position is changed and her elbow is elevated—not usually a position associated with deep sleep.There are other possible interpretations for what's going on across those panels, but as a reader I'm not convinced that I should pursue trying to make those readings fit the revealed story because I can't be sure these inconsistencies aren't just part of the nature of Kindt's loose style. They do strike me as odd and prompt me to look for a non-sequential reading, but I'd prefer more visual cues to justify exploring that path.So while I enjoy Kindt's art and style and use of those two expressions to breath life into his stories, I guess I'd like to see more care in how he uses these things to tell his stories. I'd like to see him better govern what makes it into his panels, taking into account the strengths and weaknesses of his chosen style. He's not bad by any stretch. I'd just like to see improvement for the sake of clarity.A Note about the Cover  [image]Click for larger]It's easy to gloss over the design of dust jackets. Generally, they're simply meant to catch an eye and sell a book. Red Handed's cover may be intended for that purpose too, but what I like about it is the story it tells when one compares its front to its back. Specifically, on the frontside we see a woman slip a somethin-somethin' into a man's hot beverage while he reads the paper. On the rear we see the man about to sip from that same beverage and we are tipped by the death's head lifting from the drink's steamy vapour that the man's time will soon draw to a close. His companion is gone by this point and several minutes have passed, since on the front we see the chair-thief arguing with the cook (screwdriver in hand) and on the back we see her carrying her kidnapped barstool.As well, the book's title and subtitle are presented as being part of the window of the diner in which the couple sits. On the front cover, the subtitle reads The Fine Art of Strange Crimes. On the rear and in reverse since our perspective has shifted to inside the diner, the subtitle changes to How to Commit the Perfect Crime.None of this is a big deal. Just a bit of trivial fun._____________________Foot Notes1) In Super Spy, Kindt's framework presented the stories of twenty or so characters chopped up and dischronologized. It's only as you travel through the book that you begin to recognize that the stories of these spies aren't parts of a larger collection of short stories but bits and pieces of one larger tale.2) I've mentioned it elsewhere, but I no longer purchase comics in their individual chaptered form. Budgetary concerns combined with my lack of patience with serialization means that I only encounter comics stories through collections—and Mind MGMT's first collection is still a month off.3) One instance on this last point. In 3 Story, Kindt draws a soldier being shot through the eye and uses the comics form to chart the path of the bullet through the topography of the man's head and neck. It was unnecessary but somehow adds to the reader's experience of his death.[image](click for larger)_____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,not set,"Mar 25, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16002012-red-handed

Not entirely, sure, but I did stem my weekly habit of visiting my local supplier every Wednesday In the 1990s I stepped away from comics for a while. Not entirely, sure, but I did stem my weekly habit of visiting my local supplier every Wednesday to pick through the new releases. I got kind of burnt out on the whole scene during that era. To fill the narrative hole left by my newfound and half-hearted abstinence, I turned to film.[image][Hey there.]The '90s were when it became more common for films to appear on VHS mere months after cinematic release—and at a reasonable price too!1 Then came DVD and my fair-sized film collection grew obscene as I reveled in the joys of directors' cuts, feature-length commentary, and all the bells-and-whistles that studios used to entice collectors back then. (Note: the early days of DVD were fertile for film lovers for all the bonus features packed into discs.) I began to consider myself a true cineaste. Of all the modes and genres, the kind of film I found myself returning to most frequently was film noir. It was something in the alchemy of sight and sound unique to noir that won me over—that striking admixture of the stark lights and darks, the snappy hard-boiled cryptolect, the femme fatale, the hard-bitten antihero, and the existential journey that governs the mode. I devoured every piece of noir cinema I could find: the real stuff in the range of 1941 through 1958, the proto-noir police procedurals, the neo-noir homages (e.g. Chinatown or Phoenix), and even the sci-fi noirs (e.g. Bladerunner and Dark City). I read books on the subject, both popular (like Eddie Muller's Dark City) and academic (such as the wonderful Alain-Silver-and-James-Ursini-edited series of essays, Film Noir Reader). All that is to say, I bear at least some small affection for noir, and when I returned to comics after my decade-long sabbatical I would have been pleased as a bourbon-spiked punch to encounter something in the mode in the comics medium.[image][Not from you, apparently.]Unfortunately, even in the world of black-and-white crime comics, the essence of noir seems incredibly difficult to achieve. There are certainly many good crime comics, but not a lot that even come near to successfully capturing the unique chemistry of noir. Perhaps the closest I've seen is MISS: Better Living Through Crime—which, while eschewing any number of the normative elements of the mode, still manages to exude the necessary vibe. Dave Lapham's Murder Me Dead (and to lesser degree Stray Bullets) also falls pretty safely under the noir label—it even has a so-very-noir title. Beyond that, really, I've only so much encountered books that were influenced by noir rather than noir proper. And that's okay. Jeff Smith's RASL is sometimes billed as sci-fi noir but is really only sci-fi that's influenced by noir. And that's okay. It's okay because, for the most part, the book is really good. And at the end of the day, even if the thing you want more than anything is Billy Madison 2, you're still gonna be pretty happy if you get Last of the Mohicans instead. Apple? Orange? Who cares so long as it's tasty and refreshing.[image][If rob had a gun here, one of these men would have bullets in them.]After Smith tidied up the Bone universe in 2004, he made a brief pit-stop over at DC Comics where he produced a short Captain Marvel story for the company. It was good and it was fine but what everyone wanted was more of Jeff Smith and what his own fertile imagination could concoct. Then Smith began producing RASL and everyone promptly forgot about him. At least so far as anything beyond Bone went. Or at least so far as I was aware. Granted, I'm only vaguely cognizant of anything going on in the comics world, but I do regularly read Greg Burgas over at Comics Should Be Good and occasionally read some of his cohorts at the same site. And I stopped visiting my local comics store a couple years before the first chapter was released. So who knows. Maybe RASL was all the rage and I just never heard about it. At any rate, I was surprised to find out last November that the series had concluded and was collected in four handsome volumes. I immediately amended my Christmas list and sent RASL right to the top. I needed to see whether the lack of news was justified. After all, Bone turned Smith into one of my (and my wife's) favourite creators. It turned out that I needn't have worried and that even though RASL was merely influenced by noir and not the real deal, it was still pretty great.[image][You got your science in my fiction! You got your fiction in my science!Two great tastes that taste great together!]One of the most immediately discernible positives about Smith's book is the art. If you were a fan of Bone's illustrations, you'll be right at home in RASL. My young daughter saw me reading the book, looked inside, and asked if it was a new volume of Bone. She's three-and-a-half and she could pick out Smith's style at a glance. He's built the book around the same strong use of positive and negative spaces, the same fine-lined figurework and exaggerated postures. And just like Bone was dominated by beautiful pages, so is RASL—even if the New Mexican desert isn't half so lush as Thorn's Valley.Like his prior opus, this new work allows Smith to explore the divide between the visible and the spiritual, between the empiric and the elusive. The scientist-on-the-lam hero, Rob, is caught between mysteries his methodologies have a chance at explaining and the myths that roam his world unheeding the requirements of physics or the natural laws. He encounters the god he trusts, Nikola Tesla, through diaries, journals, and academic papers. He blunders into a god he'll never understand through simple acts of providence. Whether he encounters the divine or not is something that Rob is not equipped to discern. And in the end it doesn't really matter. After all, this is a thriller, dammit, and Rob's trajectory and the conventions of his narrative will not allow us to dwell overlong on philosophy or metaphysics.We can't forget that Smith is modeling Rob's journey on the comfortable formulae so native to the noirish mode. Rob's a dirty angel, but he's our angel. He's morally tarnished (and was so even before he went off the grid to flee a government bent on information and revenge), stealing art and shacking up with a prostitute. He's a man of deep appetites and his use of Tesla-inspired world-skipping technologies only serves to enlarge his antiheroism and needs.[image][Hither and come.]And as much as he's caught between science and spirit, Rob finds himself wedged between any number of other duets. Some abstract, others less so. Tormented by the ghost of a scientist and the ghost of a woman. Crushed between his rational mind and his hungering passions. Full-bodied romance and the stale whiskey of base desire. Selfishness and sacrifice. He's the hooker with a heart of gold, only he's selling his soul instead of his body. He could be a character out of Chandler if only he had a chance with the snappy patter. He's hard-boiled alright, but not much of a talker. He's closer to John McClane than he is to Philip Marlowe.Still, thankfully, it isn't Smith's occasional nods to noir that won me over so soundly. It was Tesla. It didn't have to be him, exactly. It could have been Marconi or Edison or Lodge or Einstein or Feynman or Curie or anyone, really. But I love it when fictional stories (especially science fictional stories) take members of the historical record and insert them into the novel in a big way. It has to be believable, of course, but I find that when done well these inclusions add an automatic sense of reality to what might otherwise be a wholly fantastic story. And Smith does it well here. [image][My tenth grade self is thankful, as there was only so much Twain he could stand.]Nikola Tesla has, in the past few years, enjoyed a popular renaissance. He's become the scientific hero that primitive man a century ago was too short-sighted to see. For at least the last three-or-so years, content aggregators like Reddit have humped the leg of his ghost and legend so hard that his spirit's got to haunt with a limp now. And RASL comes, coincidentally, at the perfect time for all this adulation. Really, if sites like Reddit need to make a patron saint of a comic book, the book should be RASL, hands down. The man, while seventy-five years dead at the time of Rob's story, is the hero of the book while Rob skulks around as mere protagonist. We follow Rob but our eyes, like his, are always on Tesla. And that's a pretty mighty accomplishment on Smith's part.The book, for all its wonders, is not without flaw. As he did with Bone, Smith seems to have an aversion to wrapping things up in a way that satisfies. RASL definitely leaves less to the hands of the authors of fan fiction, but there are a couple large questions that remain unanswered. I'm okay with living with the mystery, but at the same time I would have probably been more okay with the solution. But then, perhaps like Rob, I too have less patience for the invisible when there's so much concrete laid out before me._____________________Foot Notes1) For a long while, video releases weren't intended to go straight to the consumer and were marketed to video rental houses. Purchasing a new cassette (for, say, that colossal bastion of taste and refinement, D.B. Sweeney's and Moira Kelley's rocket to A-list stardom, The Cutting Edge), would cost more than a brand-new game Xbox 360. It wasn't until the early '90s that it became common to see VHS movies released at price points near $20. Which I know because when I wanted to buy Last of the Mohicans, it was like $80 and so brought about my first act of piracy, renting the film and then duping it with a second VCR.

After all, is there much that can be said that hasn't already been said? Bone's so long been part of the canon of comics literature (such as one exists) that ing it at this point is like ing Watchmen or The Dark Knight Returns or Maus. Or for the non-comics-literate, a bit like if someone penned a  today for Huckleberry Finn. I mean, what's the point, really?Still, I tell myself, there are those who haven't read the book yet. There are those who have read comics for years who haven't read Bone and ought to be ashamed of themselves. These are aficionados of the medium who need to be cajoled into reading something that will make them better participants in the medium. And there are those still new to the medium who might not be familiar with the canon and might not be aware of Good Places To Start. This  is probably mostly for them. And for people who might google the question, What's the first graphic novel I should read? (You hear that Google?)Additionally spurring my interest in ing the book, I have a daughter. She's three and likes me to read to her in the evenings. I had read her The Little Prince and Just So Stories when she was two, but I thought she might get a kick out of comics before bed. She had previously seen book one of Gene Yang's Avatar: The Promise, which she loved because she was already familiar with the show. A father can only read so many times about Sokka and Toph getting the oogly-booglies from watching Aang and Katara getting frisky before that father just snaps—so I needed something fresh. Something new. Something I could stand to read repetitiously. So I pulled down Bone. She was almost instantly excited. And after she became interested and comfortable with the characters, she was wholly invested. Now Smith's characters thoroughly infest her imaginative play. She insists that she is Bartleby and her one-year-old brother is Ted the bug. I have become Jackal Bone, some fell hybrid between Phoncible P. Bone and, well, your common jackal. Though sometimes I am Kingdok and sometimes I am Roque Ja and sometimes I'm the Big Red Dragon. In any case, she and other kids love this book and rereading it several times to her over the last months has given me new appreciation for Smith's creation.Also, there's the whole colour thing to consider. More later. Promise! First, a bit of history.[image][There's always time for locusts.]Bone was one of that first crop of creator-owned books that constituted a burgeoning movement away from the malaise of the corporation-directed folderol of the '80s. Smith spent thirteen years (from 1991 to 2004) publishing chapters of what would eventually be a 1300-page epic fantasy story. I hopped on in somewhere around the year 2000, when Smith was nearly 65% through. Waiting each month for the release of a new chapter was tortuous. I needed to see the conclusion and I needed to see it now. And then, as Smith approached his finale, several months would pass between chapters. It was grueling. Readers first approaching the book today are blessed with the option of purchasing the entire series in a handy, single-volume paperback version.1But rather than just talk about the book, let's start with looking at some of Smith's art. Because while, yes, his characters and dialogue and verbal storytelling are wonderful, one of the foremost joys of the book is how he conveys his narrative through artistic choices.[image][image]This is a simple chase sequence, but it's composed masterfully. Fone Bone jumps from a snowbank onto a lower bank and makes a little progress while fleeing furiously from the rat creature who dives into the snow at his heels. (Excitement!) In the next panel, we see another rat creature face-first in the snow at Bone's heels a second time. (Hot pursuit!) Fone Bone comes to an impassable river and waterfall but looks down to find an escape. We and he think he's found a respite but are surprised to find rat creatures to be more driven by instinct than by reason. While the page ends with some humour, the real punchline is on the next page as the branch fails to support their weight and the three tumble into the falls below. The second panel on this page is majestic as we see silouetted the three small figures against a mere portion of the formidable falls. If we hadn't taken in the awesome danger Fone Bone is in by panel two, Smith drives it home by completely obscuring the three characters in the tumult of the falls' base. The volatile energy in that scene is terrific. Panel four brings us relief again as Fone Bone breaks the surface with a gasp. We know how lucky he was to make it but are almost instantly dismayed in the next panel to see the heads of the rat creatures breaking the surface as well, and the pursuit is begun anew. Unfortunately, wet Fone Bone slips on the icy rocks and the tension crescendoes on the final panel of that second page.Here's another one:[image]While the prior example was fraught with action, this shows Smith using entirely different techniques to build tension. Across these three panels, there is essentially no movement save for Thorn's eyes and from Fone Bone as he struggles then reacts to what he's seen. Otherwise, Fone Bone, Granma Ben, and Thorn retain the same position across the panels. The source of drama comes from a bright lightning flash in the second panel. We (and Fone Bone) see the scene unveiled for what it is, for what was wholly obscured by the dark and stormy nighttime. Fone Bone moves from being annoyed at Granma Ben to startled by the lightning to terror at what he's just seen. It's a beautiful scene and the book is full of this stuff. Over the years since I first finished the story in 2004 I had remembered the characters and their plot points, but I had forgotten this. I had forgotten what a master craftsman Jeff Smith is when he chooses how to visually tell his story. Bone employs a lot of dialogue and Smith is not shy about using words. Still, he shows over and again that he knows when to shut up and let his art speak for him and his characters. Even if Bone was entirely wordless and plotless, it would be worth your time for the art alone.So then, what about words? Another thing I had forgotten was just how funny these characters can be even while in the midst of terrible, LOTR-level, world-collapsing events. People are dying left and right and there's a tremendous war on and Smiley Bone is still a silly bastion of joy and laughter. And to Smith's credit, that never feels trite or abusive. That the book is riddled with funny moments even in the midst of dark doings and ill tidings may be exactly what saves it from being as grim and dour and thematically grey as some of its fantasy-genre cousins. The reader never feels that lives aren't at stake but simultaneously never feels overwhelmed by that threat.[image][It's true. There is.]As well, Smith populates his story with expressive, unique, and noteworthy characters. That my daughter would adopt so many for her waking dreams is impressive and is evidence of the good job Smith does. All of the protagonists are well-rounded and individuated (save perhaps for Smiley Bone, who remains a bastion of zany aloofness throughout). Even the supporting characters are given personalities and motivations. We spend the most time with Fone Bone and his opposite lead, Thorn, and by story's close we see them grow through the challenges they've had to overcome. They are full-fledged fictional beings. Smith's villains are worthy as well. Though he doesn't so much follow after the footsteps of Miyazaki, making his antagonists sympathetic figures, he does at least make them interesting.Bone's story is as full-orbed and ranging as its characters. What begins as light adventure soon turns to dark mystery. And then back to adventure. And then to epic journey and battle against cataclysmic evil. And all woven throughout with a sense of myth and spirit. There are forces at work in Fone Bone's world that are beyond the seeing eye and tap into energies outside the realm of the sciences. And I don't mean wizards and dragons. Even though those are there too. These things work to make Bone's world and mythos feel substantial, solid. And it helps that his story is exciting. Which you already knew because why else would I describe the wait for new chapters as tortuous?At the end of the day, if you haven't read Bone yet, you really ought to. If you like comics at all, you owe it to yourself. If you like adventure or fantasy, you owe it to yourself. If you want to read your kids something a little dangerous and a little exciting and a little funny and quite possibly the best thing your kids will have yet experienced, you owe it to yourself and to them. And if you've already read Bone but it's been a couple years, you owe it to yourself.[image][Thorn's such a flirt.]The Colour EditionSeveral years ago, Smith worked with Scholastic to bring the book to a wider youth audience. Part of the marketing was to colour the book. (As originally published, Bone was a strictly black-and-white endeavor.) I'm not sure whether having the book in colour was one of Smith's abiding desires or if Scholastic believed they could better sell it to kids if it were in colour—but whatever the case, when you go onto Amazon or wherever to order your copy, you'll have a variety of formats to choose from. One of those is the colour edition. [image][*sigh*]I won't say that Bone in colour is an abomination, but only because I can't really justify that critique because I haven't read the entire thing in colour. Because what I did read was awful. Or maybe not awful. Maybe it was just uninspired. But when you lay uninspired on top of majesty, you've done something terrible. This colouring job is that. You may not think it's possible to suck the life out of a black-and-white comic by adding colour but you can. You really and truly can.So please, for your sake and for your children's sake: buy and read Bone in black and white. It's beautiful and stunning and you won't feel embarrassed for the book while reading it.The One Thing I Didn't Like Really at AllSo this is weird and in a way pretty major, but I hated the ending. Now is the time for those who haven't read the book to stop reading. You already know I adore the book and think you should absolutely read this thing. It's canon and it deserves to be so. Everything hereafter is SPOILER.Okay, so I was completely and entirely sold on Smith's world until the last chapter. The climax and even most of the denouement were stellar and right along with what Smith was doing with his story and characters. It all fit. Then, in the last pages, we see his principal characters make a decision that kind of goes wholly against who Smith developed them to be. I'm not sure why he chose that ending for his book. In the story in my head, fifteen years earlier when Smith first thought of the story, he came up with an ending. Over the intervening years, his narrative grew and new ideas insinuated themselves. His characters grew in ways he hadn't originally charted out. They became something more than what he had proposed to himself in the beginning. And over the years he added plot points and dialogues and maybe even new arcs. So when he comes to his conclusion, it obviously needs to be different in at least nuance from what he had originally planned. And yet, for reasons foreign to my imagination, Smith decided to stick with his original ending, even though it clearly did not fit with the characters he'd created and the circumstance they find themselves in. That's how it happened in my imaginary version of what went down to make this ending the ending that got published. I recall being disappointed when I first read that last chapter seven years ago. But whatever my reaction was, in my memory, I was merely annoyed. Reading it again now with my daughter, I was actually angry. I wasn't angry that these characters made the choices they did. I was angry that they did so inexplicably—that there was no justification for their final decision. It didn't fit with Fone Bone's character arc. It didn't fit with Phoney Bone's character motivations. It felt entirely foreign to everything Smith had done prior to that moment. And that just makes me sad for the project, that perfection could be so easily evaporated in a book's final pages.And now I'm sad.[image][Anger.]_____________________Foot Notes1) My impatience for the final unveiling of a story is the primary reason I no longer buy single issues of any series and will even push off acquiring the collected volumes until a series wraps.

After all, is there much that can be said that hasn't already been said? Bone's [image][Bad morning.]I wasn't sure I'd ever  Jeff Smith's Bone. After all, is there much that can be said that hasn't already been said? Bone's so long been part of the canon of comics literature (such as one exists) that ing it at this point is like ing Watchmen or The Dark Knight Returns or Maus. Or for the non-comics-literate, a bit like if someone penned a  today for Huckleberry Finn. I mean, what's the point, really?Still, I tell myself, there are those who haven't read the book yet. There are those who have read comics for years who haven't read Bone and ought to be ashamed of themselves. These are aficionados of the medium who need to be cajoled into reading something that will make them better participants in the medium. And there are those still new to the medium who might not be familiar with the canon and might not be aware of Good Places To Start. This  is probably mostly for them. And for people who might google the question, What's the first graphic novel I should read? (You hear that Google?)Additionally spurring my interest in ing the book, I have a daughter. She's three and likes me to read to her in the evenings. I had read her The Little Prince and Just So Stories when she was two, but I thought she might get a kick out of comics before bed. She had previously seen book one of Gene Yang's Avatar: The Promise, which she loved because she was already familiar with the show. A father can only read so many times about Sokka and Toph getting the oogly-booglies from watching Aang and Katara getting frisky before that father just snaps—so I needed something fresh. Something new. Something I could stand to read repetitiously. So I pulled down Bone. She was almost instantly excited. And after she became interested and comfortable with the characters, she was wholly invested. Now Smith's characters thoroughly infest her imaginative play. She insists that she is Bartleby and her one-year-old brother is Ted the bug. I have become Jackal Bone, some fell hybrid between Phoncible P. Bone and, well, your common jackal. Though sometimes I am Kingdok and sometimes I am Roque Ja and sometimes I'm the Big Red Dragon. In any case, she and other kids love this book and rereading it several times to her over the last months has given me new appreciation for Smith's creation.Also, there's the whole colour thing to consider. More later. Promise! First, a bit of history.[image][There's always time for locusts.]Bone was one of that first crop of creator-owned books that constituted a burgeoning movement away from the malaise of the corporation-directed folderol of the '80s. Smith spent thirteen years (from 1991 to 2004) publishing chapters of what would eventually be a 1300-page epic fantasy story. I hopped on in somewhere around the year 2000, when Smith was nearly 65% through. Waiting each month for the release of a new chapter was tortuous. I needed to see the conclusion and I needed to see it now. And then, as Smith approached his finale, several months would pass between chapters. It was grueling. Readers first approaching the book today are blessed with the option of purchasing the entire series in a handy, single-volume paperback version.1But rather than just talk about the book, let's start with looking at some of Smith's art. Because while, yes, his characters and dialogue and verbal storytelling are wonderful, one of the foremost joys of the book is how he conveys his narrative through artistic choices.[image][image]This is a simple chase sequence, but it's composed masterfully. Fone Bone jumps from a snowbank onto a lower bank and makes a little progress while fleeing furiously from the rat creature who dives into the snow at his heels. (Excitement!) In the next panel, we see another rat creature face-first in the snow at Bone's heels a second time. (Hot pursuit!) Fone Bone comes to an impassable river and waterfall but looks down to find an escape. We and he think he's found a respite but are surprised to find rat creatures to be more driven by instinct than by reason. While the page ends with some humour, the real punchline is on the next page as the branch fails to support their weight and the three tumble into the falls below. The second panel on this page is majestic as we see silouetted the three small figures against a mere portion of the formidable falls. If we hadn't taken in the awesome danger Fone Bone is in by panel two, Smith drives it home by completely obscuring the three characters in the tumult of the falls' base. The volatile energy in that scene is terrific. Panel four brings us relief again as Fone Bone breaks the surface with a gasp. We know how lucky he was to make it but are almost instantly dismayed in the next panel to see the heads of the rat creatures breaking the surface as well, and the pursuit is begun anew. Unfortunately, wet Fone Bone slips on the icy rocks and the tension crescendoes on the final panel of that second page.Here's another one:[image]While the prior example was fraught with action, this shows Smith using entirely different techniques to build tension. Across these three panels, there is essentially no movement save for Thorn's eyes and from Fone Bone as he struggles then reacts to what he's seen. Otherwise, Fone Bone, Granma Ben, and Thorn retain the same position across the panels. The source of drama comes from a bright lightning flash in the second panel. We (and Fone Bone) see the scene unveiled for what it is, for what was wholly obscured by the dark and stormy nighttime. Fone Bone moves from being annoyed at Granma Ben to startled by the lightning to terror at what he's just seen. It's a beautiful scene and the book is full of this stuff. Over the years since I first finished the story in 2004 I had remembered the characters and their plot points, but I had forgotten this. I had forgotten what a master craftsman Jeff Smith is when he chooses how to visually tell his story. Bone employs a lot of dialogue and Smith is not shy about using words. Still, he shows over and again that he knows when to shut up and let his art speak for him and his characters. Even if Bone was entirely wordless and plotless, it would be worth your time for the art alone.So then, what about words? Another thing I had forgotten was just how funny these characters can be even while in the midst of terrible, LOTR-level, world-collapsing events. People are dying left and right and there's a tremendous war on and Smiley Bone is still a silly bastion of joy and laughter. And to Smith's credit, that never feels trite or abusive. That the book is riddled with funny moments even in the midst of dark doings and ill tidings may be exactly what saves it from being as grim and dour and thematically grey as some of its fantasy-genre cousins. The reader never feels that lives aren't at stake but simultaneously never feels overwhelmed by that threat.[image][It's true. There is.]As well, Smith populates his story with expressive, unique, and noteworthy characters. That my daughter would adopt so many for her waking dreams is impressive and is evidence of the good job Smith does. All of the protagonists are well-rounded and individuated (save perhaps for Smiley Bone, who remains a bastion of zany aloofness throughout). Even the supporting characters are given personalities and motivations. We spend the most time with Fone Bone and his opposite lead, Thorn, and by story's close we see them grow through the challenges they've had to overcome. They are full-fledged fictional beings. Smith's villains are worthy as well. Though he doesn't so much follow after the footsteps of Miyazaki, making his antagonists sympathetic figures, he does at least make them interesting.Bone's story is as full-orbed and ranging as its characters. What begins as light adventure soon turns to dark mystery. And then back to adventure. And then to epic journey and battle against cataclysmic evil. And all woven throughout with a sense of myth and spirit. There are forces at work in Fone Bone's world that are beyond the seeing eye and tap into energies outside the realm of the sciences. And I don't mean wizards and dragons. Even though those are there too. These things work to make Bone's world and mythos feel substantial, solid. And it helps that his story is exciting. Which you already knew because why else would I describe the wait for new chapters as tortuous?At the end of the day, if you haven't read Bone yet, you really ought to. If you like comics at all, you owe it to yourself. If you like adventure or fantasy, you owe it to yourself. If you want to read your kids something a little dangerous and a little exciting and a little funny and quite possibly the best thing your kids will have yet experienced, you owe it to yourself and to them. And if you've already read Bone but it's been a couple years, you owe it to yourself.[image][Thorn's such a flirt.]The Colour EditionSeveral years ago, Smith worked with Scholastic to bring the book to a wider youth audience. Part of the marketing was to colour the book. (As originally published, Bone was a strictly black-and-white endeavor.) I'm not sure whether having the book in colour was one of Smith's abiding desires or if Scholastic believed they could better sell it to kids if it were in colour—but whatever the case, when you go onto Amazon or wherever to order your copy, you'll have a variety of formats to choose from. One of those is the colour edition. [image][*sigh*]I won't say that Bone in colour is an abomination, but only because I can't really justify that critique because I haven't read the entire thing in colour. Because what I did read was awful. Or maybe not awful. Maybe it was just uninspired. But when you lay uninspired on top of majesty, you've done something terrible. This colouring job is that. You may not think it's possible to suck the life out of a black-and-white comic by adding colour but you can. You really and truly can.So please, for your sake and for your children's sake: buy and read Bone in black and white. It's beautiful and stunning and you won't feel embarrassed for the book while reading it.The One Thing I Didn't Like Really at AllSo this is weird and in a way pretty major, but I hated the ending. Now is the time for those who haven't read the book to stop reading. You already know I adore the book and think you should absolutely read this thing. It's canon and it deserves to be so. Everything hereafter is SPOILER.Okay, so I was completely and entirely sold on Smith's world until the last chapter. The climax and even most of the denouement were stellar and right along with what Smith was doing with his story and characters. It all fit. Then, in the last pages, we see his principal characters make a decision that kind of goes wholly against who Smith developed them to be. I'm not sure why he chose that ending for his book. In the story in my head, fifteen years earlier when Smith first thought of the story, he came up with an ending. Over the intervening years, his narrative grew and new ideas insinuated themselves. His characters grew in ways he hadn't originally charted out. They became something more than what he had proposed to himself in the beginning. And over the years he added plot points and dialogues and maybe even new arcs. So when he comes to his conclusion, it obviously needs to be different in at least nuance from what he had originally planned. And yet, for reasons foreign to my imagination, Smith decided to stick with his original ending, even though it clearly did not fit with the characters he'd created and the circumstance they find themselves in. That's how it happened in my imaginary version of what went down to make this ending the ending that got published. I recall being disappointed when I first read that last chapter seven years ago. But whatever my reaction was, in my memory, I was merely annoyed. Reading it again now with my daughter, I was actually angry. I wasn't angry that these characters made the choices they did. I was angry that they did so inexplicably—that there was no justification for their final decision. It didn't fit with Fone Bone's character arc. It didn't fit with Phoney Bone's character motivations. It felt entirely foreign to everything Smith had done prior to that moment. And that just makes me sad for the project, that perfection could be so easily evaporated in a book's final pages.And now I'm sad.[image][Anger.]_____________________Foot Notes1) My impatience for the final unveiling of a story is the primary reason I no longer buy single issues of any series and will even push off acquiring the collected volumes until a series wraps.

I'm not sure where that was exactly but I'd guess it was pretty quickly after I stepped out of junior high. I had grown up with science fiction and it had held a comfortable storehouse of wild imaginations when I was young. Some of my first comics were some weird-ish Gold Key books and reprints of the early Marvel sci-fi bits (such as ""The Terror of Tim Boo Ba""). They were helpful in expanding my conception of what could be, but eventually all that sort of began to stale as the tropes became recognizable and the shocks mundane. Near the end of junior high, I discovered marginally less fantasy-based sci-fi in a short-story anthology edited by Isaac Asimov, among others. It encouraged me to see that there was something beyond Star Wars and Tales to Astonish and Ender's Game, but in a way, it was too late. Space and the future and time travel had stopped calling out to me. I still held onto superheroes for a while but that was more born of an already-extant investment in the characters.1 By the time I discovered science fiction that could really excite me (say, Gattaca or Moon or last year's Moon Moth), it was less that I was interested in the sci-fi and more just that I appreciated good, thoughtful stories and accomplished storytelling. I don't seek out science fiction stories, but if I hear grand things I can be persuaded to spend some time in their worlds. Which is why I picked up Brandon Graham's reimagining of Prophet. [image][Which is good because I don't honestly think he knows where he's going.]<excursus>I'm not even sure how important it is to mention that Prophet is a reboot, is a reimagination, or is in any way related to the earlier book. Nobody2 cares about Rob Liefeld's short-lived series, Prophet. I was there on the ground floor and after one (or maybe two) issues, I didn't care either. I suppose the only reason why anyone talks about the two in conjunction is to make Graham's version look real good. But I'll tell you this for free. Graham doesn't need the crutch.</excursus>For someone who doesn't look for or even particularly care for science fiction stories, Prophet excites me in ways that surprise me. When I sat down to blow through volume 1, I did so reluctantly. It was a due diligence kind of thing. So many people were talking it up I felt it would be responsible of me to take a look. A few pages in, I sighed and set my jaw to trudge through yet one more sci-fi cliche that people seem to devour for the reason that they simply are not me and have their own tastes and desires. Having read and enjoyed Graham's King City, I was disappointed. Yet, gradually, the world in which I believed that Prophet was typical and maybe a little boring—that world was shattered by the sheer imaginative force of Graham's brash creative will. This thing was not just worth my time. It was good and it was exciting. I was undone and remade. Politely.[image][This is the Brandon Graham I know.]While Prophet's art is fun and kind of wonderful and the book's narration is a terse punctuation on its interesting plot development, Graham's greatest asset is imagination. In terms of sheer creative dynamism, Prophet is revelatory to me. In a sense, it sends me back to the freshness of my childhood. When Tim Boo Ba's fate was mind-bendingly fresh. When I opened UFO Flying Saucers #8 to have my paradigm shift. Graham's Prophet unveils a world that I couldn't imagine on my own. Maybe I could have conjured one or two or three of the wild things that make up his John Prophet's universe, but this is hundreds of things. Hundreds of things that make me feel young again.[image][Chubs.]And maybe it won't act as a fountain of youth to anyone who isn't me and doesn't have the exact same kind of childhood political geography exerting such governance over his or her reactions to really great science fiction craziness. Maybe it will merely stop at making that person happy for having read something worth their time. And maybe that's good enough, right? But for me, I crave more and will be (to my own surprise) following Graham's Prophet to its end.NoteI've noticed that I haven't actually described either the book's plot or characters. I'm not going to. I don't think anything should come between a reader and encountering Graham's world for the first time. Giving readers a heads-up would only diminish the experience—and I won't have that on my conscience.[image][John is a hard, hard man.]_____________________Foot Notes1) And as those characters evolved into unrecognizability and new characters continued to flood the books I followed, I simply couldn't find the connection anymore in their never-ending-yet-never-moving stories. I'm tempted to say I failed the books by my maturing interests, but in reality it was probably the books that failed me by not being able to grow along with me. I don't hold it against those superhero books—they followed a path that seemed best to them. But I can't pretend interest anymore. The nostalgia in me says I should feel a kind of sadness for that loss. Or perhaps a cousin to sadness. But more I just don't feel anything. The same way I don't feel sadness for the loss of my first, second, or third girlfriends. There was emotion involved at one point probably, but now it just doesn't really come to mind save for an occasional ""Huh!"" when I realize how long it's been since I cared.2) Probably._____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,not set,"Mar 25, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15770131-prophet-volume-1

And everything that attempts to mark out the boundaries and admonish a sort of Best Practice approach to the world of humanity is just some arrogant SOB's shot in the dark based off what worked for her or him. Nobody really knows. And when you add to that the volatile mix of emotions and hormones, it becomes flatly miraculous that any of us can lay claim to even a modicum of success when it comes to Being Around People. Which is, of course, funny when one considers just how naturally social we are, as a people.While I personally have at last settled into a comfortable kind of success on the interpersonal front, it took a while. Decades. And in those decades when I was trying to figure it out—trying to make friends and find love—I screwed things up often, badly, and often badly. I hurt people and was hurt by other people. My emotions overcame my reason—which only would have mattered if I knew what I was doing.[image][I did this to someone once. I am shamed.]For this reason, me being part of the broken human race and being smart and being stupid and being filled with love and distrust and kindness and anger—for this reason, watching Makoto Shinkai's 5 Centimeters per Second was a resonating experience. It felt true and honest. For all its awkwardness, for its sliver of a resolution, for its refusal to offer satisfaction—for all of that, I appreciated Shinkai for telling a story I could believe in. His film charts a love's gradual evolution into void through three segments. It's good and powerful and most viewers I hear from don't actually like the movie. My wife thought it was a good film that she never really wants to see again. Kind of like me and Grave of the Fireflies.When I saw that Vertical had released an adaptation of the film, I was initially skeptical. Beyond the fact that adaptations from other mediums into comics rarely fair that well, any adaptation of Shinkai's film would have to navigate his reliance upon scene-to-scene and aspect-to-aspect cut. Part of the power of Shinkai's film comes from its staccato barrage of imagery, something impossible to adequately simulate in comics. And then, lastly, I wasn't sure I was in the mood to watch people engage in romantic suffering. [image][I fell you, Kanae. I really do.]I needn't have been concerned. Yukiko Seike's adaptation acquits itself on all points. More than acquits itself, actually. Because as good as Shinkai's 5 Centimeters is (and it is good), Seike's 5 Centimeters is better.In truth, while sharing a foundation, the two are very different literary artifacts. Kind of like comparing James Fenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohicans with Michael Mann's. Seike takes Shinkai's rather terse script and expands on it... expansively. Her sense for a story that either was only hinted at in the source or even didn't exist at all is robust. Characters get backstories. Relationships develop. Takaki's girlfriend has enough dialogue to make the dissolution of their relationship mean something—and we actually bear witness to that dissolution. And where Shinkai's original ends in three chapters, Seike's creates an entire additional fourth chapter, moving Shinkai's world well beyond it's original purpose.[image]With all of her additions, Seike's adaptation strikes an entirely different vibe and its tonal difference is dramatic. While my wife might not ever want to see the film again, I'm certain she wouldn't put it out of the realm of possibility that she might return to the book. While Seike doesn't obliterate Shinkai's original conclusion, she does offer something more satisfying (at least to Western readers who delight in loose ends being tied and clipped). I am one of those who appreciated what I imagined Shinkai to be saying with his mostly downbeat1  1   conclusion. I thought his ending was natural to the story he was telling. (Caveat: I was also fine with the conclusion of John Sayles 1999 film Limbo, whose ending was booed in my audience.) That said, Seike's version is the more mature work and its length and heavy use of dialogue allow it to explore the implications of Shinkai's world a bit more insightfully.Probably because of Shinkai's interests combined with his film's barely-over-an-hour runtime, the original's focus was acute. It was solely concerned with Takaki and how his inability to hold onto love dominated and destroyed his life (at least for a time). Seike's version treats that but also explores the ramifications of Takaki's brokenness. We are all every one of us participants in our societies and even our most internal struggles leave marks on the outside world. Our joys, fears, activities, ideologies—everything—affect those around us, even those we fail to notice. Seike's 5 Centimeters explores that in a way that Shinkai's was either unable or unwilling to do. And Seike's epilogue takes Takaki's story beyond where we previously saw it end and does so in a way that's both true to Shinkai's 5 Centimeters and true to the new vision, which Seike has developed.[image]Roundly satisfying, I liked this. It was good. I felt like I was reading something worth my time—which is a remarkable thing for an adaptation. Mature loves stories in comics aren't the most common find, so any solid literary romance is worth pursuing and supporting._____________________Note1) There's a bare trickle of hope in the final frames of the film, though not enough to overwhelm the far greater sense of loss._____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Mar 25, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13153400-5-centimeters-per-second

Publishers Weekly, Washington Post, New York Times. Booklist, NPR, School Library Journal. They all loved it. In the realm of young adult graphic lit, it's been a good year for Drama. Which made me feel strange about my staunch ambivalence for the work.I don't usually feel a little bit bad for not appreciating a book so well as nearly everyone else, but it does happen. Underwater Welder was another one. I think it has to do with both a) having deep wells of respect for the creator and b) having appreciated their previous work. Also, it helps that I imagine I like both Lemire (Underwater Welder's creator) and Telgemeier. I don't know either one but by their creations they strike me as Worthwhile People. This pile of well-regard leaves me troubled when I finish a book that peer pressure suggests I adore, but it just doesn't come together for me. I feel a bit embarrassed and a bit awkward. And a bit like one of Raina Telgemeier's characters in this book.Too on the nose? Yeah, probably. In any case, let's not labour overly hard on how bad I feel. Instead, let's just get down to it.[image][Over the laws of light / Over the moon by midnight / Let's do it all this time]Part of why I'm torn on Drama is that Telgemeier has developed a tremendously likable and predictable style. When you open one of her books, you know it's her. The clean, organic lines and strong colour choices that sell her stories are completely fluid. They're actually enjoyable and give life to the experience of reading her works. A lot of good books boast great art and strong stylistic direction, but few can tout the happy exuberance of Telgemeier's work. I love her drawing and her character designs. She's a champ as a cartoonist, conveying story dynamically through expressions, posture, and action. Her static drawings are animated and I wish I could draw half so well.Another of Drama's excellencies is Telgemeier's choice of protagonist. Callie is a good person. A girl on the brink of the terrors of high school who probably might not even encounter those social nightmares as anything of the kind. She's smart, disciplined, and energetic. And she's got a social collective that can soften the blows of even the most uncomfortable teenage mistakes. As Telgemeier writes her, Callie is an independent thoughtful heroine who is strengthened by her participation in society and in her embrace of community. Plus, at some point before the story's start, Callie boldly dyes her hair shocking pink and Telgemeier awesomely feels comfortable in never offering any explanation for the action.1[image][So I'm lying here / Just staring at the ceiling tilesAnd I'm thinking about what to think about]That said, there were things that kept me from tracking with the book quite so well as I might have. One may seem legitimate but minor and the other one may seem petty and bizarre.In the first, despite the fact that I enjoyed all of Drama's characters, I never was able to believe they were seventh and eighth graders. These kids function both interpersonally and in their school activities as if they were juniors and seniors in high school. While not without their hormonal dramas, these kids are responsible, kind, smart, and mature. They are pretty much exactly what I don't remember from junior high. They are pretty much exactly what I didn't see while working with junior high kids a few years back. They are pretty much exactly what my wife doesn't see in the junior high kids she teaches on a daily basis. They don't behave at all like the kids they are.It's possible though that my experiences merely constituted a bad sample. It's possible that Telgemeier and her friends were pretty much exactly as self-possessed as Callie and her friends are. It's possible, but my own experiences inform my reading and so I was pulled out of the book every time we're reminded that Callie is a seventh grader. (I suppose though that one possibility is that this book is written to the junior-high-aged reader and not to nearly forty-year-olds like me and that the book is meant to serve as a kind of pedagogical story. I suppose Telgemeier might be showing junior highers their ideal potential, what they might be if only they could emulate these characters instead of the selfish, shallow ones that other media toss their way. Or she might just be appealing to their vanity. I don't know.)2[image][This is the scene in which Callie tells Greg that she doesn't know how (because they totally used protection that one time!) but he's a father now... Only that never happened. But it looks like it did, right?]But as I suggested, that complaint (while possibly legitimate) is pretty trivial and the reader should be able to overlook it with a slight bit of reality suspension. The real problem, for me (and possibly only for me), was that Drama holds too true to its name: there was just too much drama. And by that, I mean melodrama. Everyone is just so earnest and surprised and invested and passionate and, well, it just kind of made me uncomfortable. Telgemeier telegraphs the key to the central dilemma at the end of the book's first quarter and spends the rest of the book building toward the colossal misunderstanding against which the ship of Drama's plot must break. We know what the characters don't and so we watch them twist and struggle. I didn't enjoy that feeling, being close enough to omniscient that I could warn these characters of their folly and deflate the strength of later tragedy and embarrassment—if only I wasn't so completely transcendent that interaction was impossible.I know some readers probably thrive on that brand of tension. I'm sure daytime television's biggest demographic would be right at home with Drama. But because that kind of story makes me uncomfortable and I get no joy from all the over-drama, Drama is not a book I enjoyed. I recognize the value of the craft that went into it and I love some of Telgemeier's other work. But in the end, Drama's obvious strengths can't overcome its apparent role, for me, as an obstacle to fun._____________________Notes1) That Telgemeier also had the attention to her own details to leave Callie's eyebrows their natural light brunette was not lost on me and was deeply appreciated.2) And this is the point at which I start getting notes from junior highers telling me I'm obviously too old to remember what it's like to be them and plenty of junior highers are good, mature, responsible people. This happened with my Octavian Nothing , in which I suggested that I knew few teens who could actually appreciate the complexity of the work._____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Mar 25, 2013",not set,"Mar 25, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13436373-drama

I don't mention these to drop names but to give you a place to hang your hat, a way of knowing what I'm talking about. Maybe you've read all of these. Maybe only one or two. But in either case, you should understand that I'm talking about those literary works of heft (and not necessarily of physical heft) that demand careful reading and even more careful interpretation.[image][This doesn't have to do with literature. I just found her expression cute and endearing.]There was just something in the challenge presented by those books that called out to me in a way that enriched my life. And since beginning Good Ok Bad, I've had to shelve my interest in literary fiction almost entirely.1 I spend all my spare time (after work and family and side work) reading comics for  and then ing a handful of those. I read a lot every week and preparing a  takes up at least an evening. And so I've missed my first love: meaty books. Sadly, comics haven't ever risen to the task of filling that void. At least not generally.Even the best comics are works of genre fiction, fantasies or sci-fi or sci-fi fantasies. Maybe an adventure or a graphic crime novella. There's nothing particularly wrong with that. I adore Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind and think it's one of the best comics I've ever read. But it's no 2666. Not that it has to be, either. There's plenty of room for fiction that is fun and fiction that is hard. It's just, comics has been largely missing the hard stuff for a long time now.[image]The last few years though have been particularly encouraging to me. There have been more serious works produced in English-language comics2 in the last half-decade than in possibly the entire rest of English-language comics' history.3I mean, look. We've gotten Moon and Ba's Daytripper. Chris Ware's Building Stories (and before that, Jimmy Corrigan). What else? Habibi, Asterios Polyp, Big Questions, Sailor Twain, Mother Come Home, The Arrival, and the work of Nate Powell (Swallow Me Whole and Any Empire). Each of these are huge steps toward comics producing something of literary magnificence. We can see them straining for and even sometimes touching a goal that I hold (even if no one else does) for the medium: that comics would at least in some of its product transcend4 its medium and give the world Literature. With a capital L.With these works, I could see comics on the cusp. I could see creators growing at an almost unnatural pace toward something amazing. When Duncan the Wonder Dog came out I wondered if we hadn't arrived. The work was complex, filled with allusions, and spoke to something deep within the human experience. I was stunned to hold something in my hands that was exactly what I had been missing from the medium. But a single work is not an arrival. There had to be more. There had to be more creators doing things that were not just good and not just great, but incredible. Two years after Adam Hines' Duncan, Chris Ware's Building Stories was collected and proved my faith in the medium. It really is an astounding work, something that proves the essentiality of comics for certain stories and gives readers a work of complexity and importance. But Chris Ware is a known entity (and not exactly representative of comics as a whole). This is exactly what everyone expected of him. I felt I needed more. Hines was unknown (and sadly remains so, despite crafting such a sublime work) and Ware's star will not cease to shine brightly among the outside-comics literati. What would be the third work and how long would it take to arrive?As it turned out (at least according to a quick look at Amazon), The Nao of Brown hit American shores the day before Building Stories. It's sad to think that such a beautiful, careful work could be so entirely subsumed in the wave of press for another work (even one that is great and careful itself), but fortunately some people were aware of The Nao of Brown. If it weren't for reading other people who gave the book a shot and thought highly of it, I wouldn't have known it existed in order to give it one myself. And now, like I did with Duncan the Wonder Dog, I'm going to be telling everyone I know that if they want to read a worthy graphic novel, Glyn Dillon's book is what they want to be reading.5[image][Introducing: Nao Brown, killer. Sort of.]The Nao of Brown is a wonderful collection of visual and literary themes, marked by a compassionate visual sense and a deeply dialogical atmosphere. It's one of those books in which word and image conspire together in a harmony unusual for comics.6Dillon is not only an impressive illustrator and designer. His art always on every page aids his story, lending voice and colour to his characters' dialogue—and to Nao's narration. In a work in which the majority is filled with mundane conversation, Dillon invests his characters with expression, carriage, and posture such that their story would be incomplete if only left with their words. These are real people and they are rendered realistically save for the fact that Dillon captures them in the best possible moment—all in order of course that the reality their story should be validated by their presence.The art is gorgeous, pencil and watercolour (though these days it can be hard to tell just how much is post-processed in Photoshop—as if it mattered in the end). Dillon couches his work in a rich tapestry of visual metaphor. Rich enough at least that there's plenty of fodder for those willing to put the work in to interpret him. Visual motifs abound. From the recurring use of the circle to foreign and foreign-esque cartoon characters, everything evokes. The pages bleed with purpose. Even Dillon's use of colour seems to bear on his meaning. Nao wears red. All the time. Every time. Until the times she doesn't. The Nao of Brown is such a delight to the eyes that I find myself wishing every book looked like this—despite loving much the more simple work of Chris Ware and Jason. Dillon's art breathes, it has life. And life is exactly what his story demands.[image][Check out this awesome page in which the bartender and Nao are juxtaposed, perhaps insinuating against Nao's apparent relationship to Steve.]The Nao of The Nao of Brown is half-Asian, half-Caucasian and suffers from a violent interior life. She has a few friends but seems distant and distancing. She is afraid of herself and Dillon's exploration of her thought life gives merit to her fears. Generally, it would be about at this point in the book's description that I would slowly begin shutting down, losing interest. I realize that comics are a uniquely powerful medium for communicating the experience of the fracture of the inner self. Epileptic did it well. Swallow Me Whole did it well. It's a Bird... did it well. Even Fun Home and Are You My Mother? did it well in their own ways. The problem is that books about broken people tend to be mopey affairs. Really, Epileptic should carry a government label on its spine warning against combining with the consumption of alcohol—for such a terrible meeting would surely end in toasters and bathtubs and things too terrible to contemplate.Happily, The Nao of Brown forges its own path. It's not The Pleasure of My Company, but it's probably not far off.7 For all of her fear and violence and actual, visceral anguish, Nao is a charming and beautiful young woman. I would want her as a friend. You probably might too. And from the outside, it's easy to see why few people realize that she's troubled any more than the next person on this sad, strange globe. In fact, she comes off at a glance better than a great number of us regular citizens. All of this means that Nao's story, while dark and terrible and innately concerned with the depravity of the human spirit, is sold with a buoyant gait and trudges along with the delightful pluck of a three-year-old in slightly too large rain boots, kicking leaves and stomping puddles. The book is a delicate admixture of sobriety and humour, and it's imbibing this concoction that carries the reader through, granting the pleasure and honour of coming to the place at which interpretation may begin.[image]As with all books pregnant with complexity, The Nao of Brown requires dutiful attention and a steady hand—even when trying to piece together the overt story elements. (And that's before we even dream of answering the question of Dillon's purpose and goal.) After reading, desperate for someone to converse with on the book (since my wife wouldn't finish reading it for another three days), I glanced around at s and found critics incorrectly reading all sorts of things into the book. One suggests that Nao was the author of the Pictor stories. Another suggests that Nao is oblivious of Steve's affection for her while Nao herself pretty much plainly states otherwise. And then, I haven't found a single critic who correctly identifies who Dillon most likely pairs with Nao by story's close.8 And if these details escape us, then legitimate understanding of the work's intent is almost necessarily elusive. And this is not to criticize those inattentive critics but simply to remark upon The Nao of Brown's glorious complexity.9 Many readers, even, are split on the book's conclusion, debating whether Dillon's finale was a cop-out or not. I would suggest that whatever one's gut reaction to the climax and denouement, it should probably not be trusted. Dillon's weaving of his story is subtle and multifarious, not the kind of thing to be judged quickly. [image][Role reversal.]I am so very deeply grateful for this book. I am grateful to Self Made Hero for going to the trouble to make this artifact available a world away in nearly-sunny California. I am grateful to Glyn Dillon for putting so evident an effort into making his story come to life with such colour and in such a beautiful production. I am grateful for The Nao of Brown for assuring me that literary fiction holds a life beyond the confines of prose and can even sometimes make visitation to the shores of the comics medium. And I am thankful to Nao Brown for springing into pregnant life from the pages of her book—because I think the questions that fuel Nao's dreams and fears are the questions that haunt and help whole populations of this earth. And we need a cipher, someone to ask the question that we might scrabble for the answers.____________________Footnotes:1) I did squeeze in 1Q84 when it came out, but it was such a juggling match that I haven't attempted anything of the sort since.2) And let's be clear here that I'm talking about American, Canadian, and British comics (and maybe Australian?). My lack of familiarity with non-English-language productions makes it impossible for me to judge there. Though I have been encouraged to know that there's definitely some, I guess, off-the-beaten path serious literature like Jiro Taniguchi's The Walking Man.3) And let's remember here that I'm talking about fiction. Serious-minded, even outright dour autobiography has been a staple in English-language comics since at least, what, the Seventies?4) And I don't mean transcend in the sense that they should stop being comics. More just in the sense that comics' evolution was retarded for so long that it still struggles against infantalizing its potential. Comics is, in a sense, a ghetto—and wild critical success in comics is often really just an example of big fish/small pond. I want to see comics able to present great cultural artifacts that can stand up with the Beethoven's Fifth Piano Concertos, the Citizen Kanes, the Crime and Punishments. That's what I mean by transcendence.5) My recommendation of Duncan actually went over largely as a lead balloon. Very few of those who gave it a shot actually appreciated it. Some were confused by its complexity, some were too staunchly opposed to message, some thought it was fine but couldn't empathize with my adulation. Here's hoping things go better with The Nao of Brown.6) Generally a great comics work is far stronger in one of the two elements (visual and textual) and diminished in the other. Works like Gaiman's Sandman display verve and grace in their writing while the art suffers and is many times at odds with the written words. On the other hand we have something like Building Stories, whose design sense is beatific while its dialogue (while not bad) stutters by the comparison.7) At least in terms of tone. It's nowhere in the neighbourhood of plot or purpose.8) The author drops a tremendous tip in the first panel of page 202 if the rest of the story doesn't help spell it out.9) I have struggled and wrestled with what Dillon has accomplished, and though I now think I get a lot of it, there are still questions and I cannot be certain that in the final evaluation I have gotten it right. This is a book that demands discussion. Maybe even heated discussion._____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]...more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,not set,not set,"Feb 12, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13594590-the-nao-of-brown

Really everything went pretty swimmingly save for the fact that I was born with a very narrow palette. My range of acceptable tastes and textures is lean and withered. I am, others have judged, a picky eater. [image][This was not me.]I'm fine with a small battery of stand-bys (meats, potatoes, dairy, most fruits), but vegetables and items with more exotic textures remain holy and set apart for sacrifice to other eaters. I mean, I absolutely adore steamed artichoke, but broccoli, cabbage, cucumbers, tomatoes (not a vegetable, I know), and non-Idaho-potato roots twist my expression into something sinister. Mussels, oysters, and sushi are a rocky row to hoe—fourteen years ago when I interviewed for my current job, I was taken to sushi, gave it a chance, and nearly drenched my prospective employer in regurgitation. I mostly stick to safe things these days, out of habit and out of fear.With all that in mind, think about how incredible Lucy Knisley's book must be to make me want to a) prepare things like a plateful of mushrooms, a gaggle of sushi rolls, or a good pesto, and then b) try actually eating the product of those recipes. Relish, Knisley's personal-history-via-gustatory-memory, is simply wonderful. I haven't been this exuberant about a reading experience in a while. There are better, thicker, more challenging works available and as far as importance goes, the 173-page paperback doesn't hold a candle to, say, Building Stories or Duncan the Wonder Dog. But that hardly matters as I'm pretty well-convinced that I had more fun reading Relish. It's that much fun.[image][Curvy!]Knisley's memoir is composed of twelve short chapters that roughly trace the chronology of her life, and each pericope develops around the various foods she associates with those stories. She intersperses narrative delights with recipes for favourite foods and a helpful fact sheet explaining the complicated world of cheeses. None of my description of this, however, conveys the pleasure and excitement Knisley's pages draw forth.Her work is bright, colourful, humourous, and (best of all) exuberant. The joy Knisley evidently takes in the act of tasting is translated almost perfectly (fn1) through both her narrative choices and the manner of her execution. Her characters are lively and their expressions telling. She narrates her story with a confident voice and as much as she talks about food, good food, and even gourmet food, Knisley never approaches that smug condescension that has become the signature delight of the foodie crowd. Here, wait. I'll share with you the piece that utterly won me over early on in the book.  [image][Click to read without squinting.]That right there is golden. I will confess that perhaps nothing else in the book grabbed me quite so well as the image of young Lucy dreaming of all the geese that would be foie-grased into her belly over the succeeding years—but the rest isn't far off. And at the end of the day, Relish does probably exactly what it sets out to do:1) Make Lucy Knisley seem like an awesome person with an infectious love for food.2) Infect the reader with that love for food.3) ...There are probably other things the book sets out to accomplish as well: like talk about stuff that happened, share information about food, underscore the fact that Knisley's mother is a bitchen cook, make divorce seem sad. Stuff like that. It's all there and it's all at some level of important. But end of the day? Relish is about a young woman's love of food and how you will be drawn into that love's blackhole gravity until you become one with a love for food too.Remember: I almost vomited on the founder of the company I was trying to work for all because the taste and texture of high-quality toro put my throat into convulsions. And now I think I want to try sushi again.[image][As it turns out, many of the things we eat are sinister. And not all of them are meats.]Footnotes1) I only say almost to leave her room for improvement—even though I can't imagine in which direction she could improve.________________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]...more",Notes are private!,0,32,1,not set,not set,"Jan 29, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15786110-relish

How do you talk about a book deeply concerned with something you don't understand and therefore can't really respect? Like, pretend you're an atheist (or maybe don't pretend if you're already there). You're reading this book in which the protagonist just doesn't feel the call of the Holy Spirit so much as she'd like. So she talks to all these different people who give her all sorts of spiritual advice on what the Holy Spirit's like, how the Holy Spirit feels, how best to invoke the Holy Spirit, what it means to be filled with the Holy Spirit, how it's okay that she doesn't speak in tongues because the Holy Spirit doesn't manifest in that way. And all that jazz.Now you're a patient, careful reader, and you know there's more to the story than just this character's difficulty with what she considers an essential part to her life and lifestyle. But still, she's yammering on about the Holy Spirit and you (for the life of you) just cannot relate. You're an atheist, after all, and she's profoundly bothered by not experiencing what you consider to be a faery tale. It would be like if you read a book where everybody seemed overly concerned by how Richie Rich would react when posed with various ethical dilemmas.That's kind of how I felt while reading through Are You My Mother? I tried, of course, to distance my skepticism with the book's central tenet from the reading experience, but when is it possible to do this entirely? See, the sad fact of the matter is: I put no stock in psychoanalysis and Are you My Mother? is virtually governed by the stuff.[image][It really does show a little.]Where Bechdel's prior biographical work Fun Home was ruled by a series of literary allusions, Are You My Mother? is built from a fabric of Bechdel's experiences with therapists, dreams, and allusion to works of the analyst's discipline. Ostensibly a recollection of her mother as Fun Home was her coming to grips with her father, Bechdel's latest is more the story of her own manias (fn1) and her attempts over the years to resolve these and get to the bottom of their existences. The book only ever tangentially involves Bechdel's mother insofar as her mother plays a role in some of the author's struggles.Bechdel begins each chapter with a dream and then follows with some manner of psychoanalytical interpretation that then informs the rest of the chapter. Are You My Mother? is thoroughly peppered with quotations from a variety of psychological texts. And many of Bechdel's anecdotes are reccountments of her therapeutic sessions from the past couple decades or so. In trying to learn the story of Bechdel's relationship with her mother, it's virtually impossible to escape the thumbprint of Freud's successors.[image][But that... that's crazy!]And for that reason, I found it hard to stay interested. This is most likely my own fault but I don't exactly know how to tell. The craft Bechdel employs to draw, colour, and otherwise visually tell her story are of a match with Fun Home. Her verbal chops excel to the caliber of the prior work as well. So it's mostly only the content that got in my way.Because I just don't put much stock in any of the kinds of therapy in which Bechdel puts so much stock. When the interpretation of dreams insinuates itself into Bechdel's narrative, the readings always seem (to me, at any rate) outlandish and contrived. And the eagerness with which Bechdel's in-story avatar seeks affirmation of her interpretations seems to sit heavy with confirmation bias. [image][What kind of environment creates this kind of internal tension in a kid when she's confronted by the question, ""Do you love me?"" Really, my heart kind of breaks for Bechdel here, whether she intends it or not.]It's really a matter of suspending disbelief. I could read a story in which a boy is forced to live under the stairs and is stolen away on his eleventh birthday to live at a sorcerer's school and be totally taken in because the story makes stepping away from believability easy and natural. For me though, Are You My Mother? is meant to play straight and Bechdel sells the story as something turgidly real—and because of my own biases, I was continually removed from the narrative experience.And as I said, I can't tell whose fault that is. Probably mine because I'm sure that if I happened to put any much stock in psychoanalysis, I'd probably be right there with Bechdel. It's really too bad for those of us who can't get on board, because I was pretty interested in hearing about Bechdel's mother, her history, and how her identity develops alongside or in opposition to Bechdel's father's. [image][Oh! Oh yeah! Silly me to forget!]As much as it's in any way my place to judge this very personal and familial work (fn2), I'm torn by the responsibility. Do I major on the fact that the work is quite competently accomplished and a mark of superior craftsmanship or instead lean on the fact that I didn't enjoy the book or get nearly so much out of it as I did her earlier memoir? I'll leave it to you to judge my choice even as I judge Are You My Mother? Fairly or unfairly, that's up to you.Footnotes1) Mania in a non-technical sense. If there is one. And I'm sure there is.2) And I'd say that it wasn't my place save for the fact that this very personal and familial work is being packaged and sold as a product for consumer consumption.

I read stories of warriors from prior eras and about the glory and honour found in a battlefield death for a good cause. I licked my chops in adulant glee while devouring films like Red Dawn and Edge of Darkness. The thought of dying and killing for the good of the homeland was a relishment. I was, in fact, a moron.Sure, I had been sold a bill of goods, the lie that war is glorious and that dying for nation is an honour. But I was a kid with above average intelligence. I should have known better. I should have seen myself being led by the nose, reacting irrationally to the chummed waters of nationalist propaganda. But I didn't. I believed in military power. I believed in America. I believed in the honour of combat. I believed that it was entirely within our national rights to bomb those who would make American living inconvenient.[image]I actually said at some point that we should just nuke the Middle East and solve all our problems. I believed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki—and I loathed those revisionists who would suggest the Enola Gay to be anything other than necessary. I was xenophobic and intolerant and blind to the fact that people are people. I hate that there was a time when I was ever this person. And I hate that I lived in a society that would encourage me to have been this person that I hate having been.Which brings us to DMZ.At some point in the near future, due an increasing number of unpopular presidential decisions, a movement arises in Middle America demanding the right to secede. Various militia groups join up and soon, within the very borders of the American society, a new American nation begins to take shape. Soon, America plays host to a second civil war—one between the establishment United States (and its Foxish media mouth, Liberty News) and the hillybilly-chic Free States. The Free States make rapid progress toward the East Coast and soon are on the edge of Manhattan, where they come to a sort of stalemate with US forces. Manhattan, whose population has been cut by two thirds, is the new battleground—a demilitarized zone where combat occurs despite (and often to spite) a variety of truces and ceasefires in effect. Manhattan is the DMZ. An easy place to die.[image]Where DMZ is so successful is in its ability to bring readers a sense of what it might be like to inhabit such a terrible place and circumstance. Wood certainly concerns himself with the military operations that terrorize the city and the political monsters (a.k.a. ideologies) that command those operations and the media machines that justify such monstrosities—but that's not what he's all about. Instead, the first and foremost object of Wood's attention is the citizenry, the people who never have voice enough in these blasphemies of humanistic endeavor.Part of the power of DMZ for Western readers (or at the least for Americans) is that the victims are people we know. They are ours and they are innocents. They are doctors, nurses, teachers, mothers, first-responders, artists, architects, and small business owners. They were minding their own business. And, most importantly, they are Americans.One of the great obstacles between the average American and empathy is our inability to imagine ourselves in the shoes of anyone who doesn't share our privilege and power and history and social evolution. Maybe it's our geographical isolation. Maybe its that we miraculously came out of WWII as the super power (fn1) and hadn't the understanding of world affairs not to abuse that. Maybe it's that Manifest Destiny has been grilled into our psyches since grade school—even though most of us don't actually believe in any such thing as divinely orchestrated fate. Maybe it's that we're still too white, Protestant, and privileged as a whole people. Whatever the reason, when we hear of the plight of those in other DMZs, we struggle to care. Or maybe we don't even struggle. Maybe our apathy is so great that we can't ever even get to the point of realizing there's something to care about. It's a good thing then that Matty Roth exists in the DMZ.[image]Matty, the series' protagonist, is a wish-to-be photojournalist who gets an assignment to shadow a popular newsman on a forray into the DMZ. Their helicopter gets shot down and Matty is the only survivor. Suddenly, by no design of his own, he is an embedded journalist in the middle of a warzone—and the new voice of the people of New York, whether they want him to be or not. While he tries to understand both the Manhattan that was and the Manhattan that is, we see that he hopes to be a part of the Manhattan that will come to be. Matty's struggle for survival is the story of the people's own daily challenge. There are the combatants of the greater war that always threatens to spill out onto the streets. There are the Blackwater-esque contractors in place to rebuild the damaged city who cause more trouble than they solve. There are the tribal kingdoms that arise from neighbourhood to neighbourhood, each fiercely protective of their claimed territories. There are the individuals who begin to crack under the strain of anarchy and the constant threat of death or torture. And none of these are in place for the good of the citizen.It's horrible, really.After I graduated from high school, I read a little more. I travelled a bit. I became friends with people whose families did not hail from Orange County or California or even anywhere in the US-held territories. I encountered the internet when the World Wide Web became a thing. And gradually, piece by precious piece, the paradigm of power and violence I previously cherished fell apart. It crumbled under its own weight and inability to express anything that coordinated with the world as I came to know it. I became repulsed by my prior naivete and arrogance. I grew, I think, and matured. Because my mind was cleared of certain barriers, my heart was given a chance to understand, to empathize. It was a too-long process of maybe a decade.But if DMZ had been around back then, I might have saved myself several years.[image]NoteI haven't really spoken to the actual quality of the craft that goes into the telling of Wood's tale. By and large, the production is pretty top-notch. The writing and plotting are strong. Wood presents largely believable situations that reflect the kinds of stories we already may be aware of from the Iraq disaster of the last decade. The art too is almost always suitable and well-fitting with the cacophony of the DMZ. I'm not any kind of native New Yorker (fn2) so I can't speak to the accuracy of its depictions of streets and neighbourhoods, but it looks enough like the New York in my imagination to sell the story.If I have one complaint about the series, it's that when Matty takes on a change in character around the halfway point of the series (during the Parco campaign), I didn't feel the writing justified the abruptness of the shift. I never felt comfortable that the Matty of the first half of the series would so immediately become this new Matty. I'm not complaining too much though, because the shift whether earned or not does take the story in an engaging and worthwhile direction. So there's that.Footnotes1) This is probably largely due to our geographic isolation from the actual two battlefronts of the war.2) I'd been there once, at 2am, and my experience was decidedly negative.________________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Jan 29, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/158683.DMZ_Vol_1

That storylines and characters and art choices are market-driven rather than a natural growth from organic narrative processes? That Big Corporate books (i.e. those from Marvel and DC) are mired in stunts that hope hopelessly to keep the interest of current readers while simultaneously attracting new blood? That comics sales dwindle from stagnation, a direct market, and an inability to do anything that feels real with characters whose legacy and recognizability are more important that the stories they inhabit? Everyone knows superhero comics are like this, right?But they don't. I doubt anyone in my office knows this—after all, they don't read comics. I doubt my brother knows this—after all, he doesn't read comics. I know my wife didn't know until a few years back when she married me—after all, she didn't read comics. Even now that she does, she spends very little time in the corner with the superheroes—so it's pretty possible that she still doesn't know this. (fn1) My guess is that the people who read superhero books (but aren't also in junior high) are pretty well aware of the shenanigans involved in their pastime but suffer those slings and arrows to get one more taste of their four-colour crack. And the people who don't care about superhero comics generally won't know about the shenanigans because they don't care about superhero comics.And this is, I think, the biggest problem with Nicolas Mahler's Angelman.[image]In Angelman, Mahler skewers the superhero industry, satirizing their ridiculous marketing ploys and the way they abuse their characters in order to just-maybe wring some profit from their heroic husks. The book follows the life and history of a new hero, Angelman, as he tries to adapt to superheroing and find acceptance among colleagues. Along the way he is constantly hampered by his writers and editors at Korporate Komics, as they seek to use him to fill ridiculous niches hoping to bring in new readers. While Angelman is given a nemesis, it quickly becomes clear that his true antagonist is the editorial team at Korporate. The problem then is that while Mahler ably satirizes big superhero publishers—using wit and amusement as his chief weaponry—it's never clear who will appreciate his book. Readers of superhero books are already probably well aware of his punchlines; after all, they're immersed in the stuff. They'll probably find Mahler's book amusing, (fn2) but probably not nineteen buck worth of amusing. And people who don't read superhero books probably won't catch the jokes or, worse, won't care in any case. [image]It's too bad, really, because Mahler is a talented creator. I very much enjoyed his slim earlier effort Lone Racer and he shows at least as much talent here—and possibly even more polish. The narrative concept that governs Angelman is really pretty genius (fn3) and the book's use of colour delightful. As per what I've seen from Mahler before, his characters are amusing abstractions, mostly noses and torsos—and sometimes even without visible arms. The book's backmatter is likewise amusing and relevant and includes a price guide for Angelman issues, covers from the character's short-lived series, and an afterward guide to the supporting cast's stories.[image]Angelman is well-published and sharply produced. Its critique just wasn't anything I hadn't read on comics blogs over and again for the last seven years. Honestly, it's probably worth reading but probably not worth owning. Which seems sadly apropos in a way. I'd much rather recommend Lone Racer. Perhaps I'll  that soon.Footnotes1) Although, since she proofs these for me, she knows by this point right here at least.2) And it really is amusing. Mahler's a smart writer and his jokes betray that intelligence. In a way, Angelman does taste a little like the seasoned games player thoroughly schooling his jock cousin at risk every Thanksgiving, a kind of intellectual bullying. We all know that superhero books occupy the low end of the comics gene pool, and when Mahler pokes fun at the genetic deficiency it starts to lack a little grace. Maybe. It's possible I'm being too compassionate. After all, superhero books, ammirite?3) Each page brings to life a discrete incident from Angelman's story (either from his narrative or his meta-narrative) and anchors the telling in footnotes that recall issue numbers and story titles related to that page's event. Like so:[image]________________________[Review courtest of Good Ok Bad.]...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Jan 29, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12651087-angelman

Did men really just go up to women and offer them a few bucks to flash their boobs?"" I assured her that it was and that it's the same today and it's not a big thing and everybody does it. I was not very convincing. Probably because I was as surprised as her. I knew the early twentieth century in Europe1 was a rambunctious time—what with the swift ideological, artistic, and moral paradigm hops that were occurring quickly enough to pile up on each other's shoulders. But I wouldn't have suspected the streets of Paris would basically be a live-action Girls Gone Wild.Deep down I guess I still unknowingly held onto the mythology that our forebears were a quaint and unimaginative bunch.2 For that reason (probably among others), biography proves its usefulness once more. We are again reminded that the world is bigger than we thought and expression of the human spirit is wide and diverse. Kiki de Montparnasse is good at arguing this reminder because Kiki de Montparnasse, in all likelihood, is not very much like us at all.[image][See. I told you this happened in real life. Proof!Note: I censored the last panel for all the delicate children out therereading a  of a book about a nude model.]In Catel and Bocquet's biography of Alice Prin, better known as Kiki,3 the reader is rushed through fifty-two tumultuous, extravagant years of a woman's life. Kiki is one of those figures whose existence is simultaneously extraordinary and clichéd. Extraordinary because she lives in that larger-than-life manner that can't possibly seem to sustain itself. Clichéd because it doesn't. Like so many of those who burn brightly enough to catch the eye of the everyman, Kiki flares out, smouldering and spent.[image][Nobody respects the arts anymore.]Kiki's life incorporates what amounts to a who's who of the early-century French arts movements. Picasso, Cocteau, Man Ray, and piles of painters, writers, dadaists, and more. Kiki, for all her faults and failures, was famous for a time in her small but powerful corner of the world. She modeled for many of the best of her generation and inspired others through her own creative endeavors—through singing, painting, writing, and sex. Kiki's output among these lights was voracious, swallowing up as much as it produced. She tortured the hearts of men even as she led them to new artistic discoveries. She was, to use an American turn of phrase that would post-date her by a couple decades, something else.[image][The comic depiction of the shooting of the art that graces the book's cover with Man Ray's actual photo for comparison.]The publisher's description that graces the book's cover is bizarre. After describing Kiki in terse encyclopedic summary (model in Montparnasse in the '20s, partner to Man Ray, painted by Kisling, Foujita, et al), it embellishes grandly: ""she is the first emancipated woman of the 20th century"" and ironically goes on to cite her sexual, emotional, and whole-persona liberties. The irony, of course, is that Catel and Brocquet demonstrate so much the opposite of this over the course of their treatment of her life that one wonders if the publishers were being merely playful or if they truly misunderstood the work before them. The trailhead of Kiki's life is the abject poverty into which she's born. Nearly an orphan and raised by a grandmother, she comes to live with her mother in her young teens. Necessity and expediency lead her to sell her body for display, as a model to sculptors and painters at times and as a cheap thrill for randy men at others. As told in Kiki there is nothing noble in her modeling at first, no transcendent love of the arts. She only wants to get paid and initially embarks on a life of nude modeling at the command of her basest needs: for hunger, for shelter—and eventually, to support growing coke and alcohol habits. [image][Dude. If you don't respect the coke, the coke won't respect you.]At no time does Catel and Brocquet's Kiki ever approach anything resembling emancipation—save perhaps in her death in the final pages of the book. She is bound by her poverty, enslaved to her addictions, held captive by her reputation, fettered in her fear of losing that reputation, imprisoned by her desires, and subjugated by her emotional needs. Kiki de Montparnasse, if read as written, presents almost a cautionary tale, a non-fictional catalogue of how not to live if you wish to lead a happy life. Kiki's abundant lack of abiding joy may be the surest evidence that she did not, in fact, live the kind of emancipation this book's publishers seem to daydream into the work.In its most realistic sense, Kiki plays as tragedy. The reader keeps hoping things will finally work out for the woman, but while there are certainly some high points, everything winds down through a series of soft crescendos. By tale's end (and it's no secret that Alice Prin dies in 1953), I liked Kiki enough that I mourned her along with the small few who gathered at her funeral. Catel and Bocquet do an admirable job breathing life into a dead-and-gone celebrity, fleshing out her flesh and selling her as a model of the more exuberant kind of twentieth-century woman—a woman as much bound by her circumstances and personality as any of us. A slave, a whore, a human. A spark, a light, a life.[image]Footnotes1)And in America too, as it so happens.2) Clearly though, they were more imaginative than me. I would have never thought of walking up to a stranger and offering a pittance for a brief show of public nudity. Strange world.3) At least better-known in some circles—perhaps in France or in the art world or by biographers of Man Ray. I had never actually heard of the woman. Which actually fits the story told fairly well.________________________[Review courtest of Good Ok Bad.]...more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,not set,not set,"Jan 29, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10401677-kiki-de-montparnasse

I've found that the idea of a science fiction world isn't enough to spark my interest. A world populated by robots? A dystopian future of genetic manipulation? Star-spanning empires and the rebels that seek their liberation from those empires? I always have a sense of been there and done that. The ideas just don't excite me like they once may have—I presume that decades ago, when I self-identified as a sci-fi fan, these things genuinely did excite me. When I hear of a new Battlestar Galactica, I can't be bothered to care any more than I would for the news that there was a new Civil War show coming out this Fall. Even though I loved the original BSG as a kid. And the same goes for adventures. The idea of watching a hero overcome great odds to save the princess, the town, the nation, or the world is a tired device. Used and reused.Still, even a cursory glance at my Top 100 Comics list will reveal numerous books from both genres entrenched even as far up as my Top 10, so clearly my lack of adoration for the genres isn't the end of the story. Not being a fan doesn't mean I actively dislike the genres; it just means they have to offer something special in addition. Really, it just means they have to sell the kinds of things I love in other stories. I'm currently reading Jeff Smith's Bone to our three-year-old daughter (her favourite characters are Kingdok and the rat creatures, whom I've given Muscovite accents). What's been pronounced in this reading (moreso I think than in prior excursions into Smith's Valley) is both the depth of atmosphere and the breadth of characterization. Smith invests the book with fantastic character moments that speak not merely to the state of his heroes and villains but to the nature of the human person itself. This focus elevates the work beyond a mere exercise of plot and device to a height most fantasy adventures never even bother seeking to reach. It's why Bone is one of my favourites despite its grounding in the fantasy and adventure genres.This is also why I appreciated Zita the Spacegirl so much as I did. The book, while solidly aimed at adventure-loving youngsters,1 is filled with the kinds of character moments that will make it sing to even the parents of those youthful, single-minded readers.Zita the Spacegirl (and its follow-up, Legends of Zita the Spacegirl) ostensibly relates the adventures of a reluctant hero, Zita, a girl sucked from our end of the galaxy to another end of another galaxy. It's Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey—only instead of two dogs and a cat, it's just a lone lost girl who becomes something bigger than she is. While that description may be enough to sell the story to any number of my friends, I'm curmudgeonly enough to require more bang for my buck. It's not enough for me to know that Ben Hatke has written books that my daughter will want to hear read over and over, but it does say something special to know that these are books I'd actually enjoy reading to her over and over.[image]Hatke pours a lot of love and care into his creation. Not only is he conscious of the need for his characters to boast winning personalities, but his creative spirit is well evident in the vast array of amusing alien creatures that rain all over Zita's parade to greatness. I found myself dwelling on panels longer than I might usually be given to do—especially treasures like this:[image][Seriously. Aren't these things the most adorable little squirts.]Where Zita shines is where books like the later Crogan Adventures shine: in its complexity of human relations.2 It feels sometimes as if Hatke takes lessons from Miyazaki and Ghibli's school of characterization, as even Zita's antagonizers are portrayed in sympathetic terms. They are not bad guys for the sake of being bad. They are, to quote twentieth-century American philosopher Curly Howard, victims of coicumstance. Sometimes they labour under false beliefs, sometimes they operate by the dictates and limitations of their insular cultures.3 All this works toward making Hatke's books a more readable, believable world.At present, there are two Zita books in print. While the former is quite enjoyable and introduces most of the principal characters (as well as what may be the Series Dilemma), the latest release Legends of Zita the Spacegirl is the better of the two. The character having been introduced already, Hatke's allowed to explore Zita and her new family of friends a little more closely. And while Zita experienced some growth in the first volume, it was mostly due circumstance. One of those people-having-greatness-thrust-upon-them sorts of things. In Legends, Zita is able to grow by observing the better, more courageous, more compassionate acts of others. It's a more natural accomplishment and so ends up meaning more.[image]A couple months ago in my  of Josh Tierney's Spera, I mentioned that I was on the lookout for books that I'd soon be able to pour out upon my young daughter. I said:I’ll be looking for books that don't portray femaleness as an indictment, a weakness, or a reason to be victimized. And honestly, apart from a handful of books, I can't immediately think of much that fits the bill.Whatever indictment that is on much of the comics industry as it currently stands, I'm happy to say that among that handful of books (which includes Hildafolk and Bone and Nausicaä and Spera), Ben Hatke's Zita series will find a place in my heart and on my shelf. I'm excited to see where he takes these characters. Whether they adventure to get there or not.[image]Notes1) I'm not certain but almost-certain that the Zita series is primarily aimed at young readers. There's nothing I've seen on the jacket or indicia that would indicate Young Readers (or even Young Adult readers) but the book boasts that all-ages kind of sensibility that's common to the taxonomy.2) I was tempted to just leave it at ""personal relations"" as most of the interactions are with aliens, but Hatke's aliens are really probably more just humans in weird shapes.3) With this in mind, it wouldn't be difficult to read into the Zita books some sort of veiled critique of the American people. Though I doubt that's within the realm of Hatke's intentions here.________________________[Review courtest of Good Ok Bad.]...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,not set,"Jan 29, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8879121-zita-the-spacegirl

Ban it!]A couple weeks ago it was Banned Books Week, a national celebration of those works that have been challenged by adults who believe in sequestering away literature that does not adequately line up with their particular ideological yardstick. It's rare that these challenges are meant as outright bans. Rather than seek to remove a work completely from the range of literature available to a society, these challengers wish to keep the targeted books from the access of young readers—children whom they do not feel are ready to engage the maturity of the work within. This kind of thing isn't rare to our society. Our theaters restrict six-year-olds from seeing Rated-R films unaccompanied by an adult guardian. We, as a society, have chosen to prohibit junior highers from purchasing pornography. Websites that offer sexually explicit materials provide at least tacit barriers to prevent the young and the innocent from enjoying the adult fare within. That we even term such entertainments as ""adult"" gives evidence to the general consensus that there are things that are for children and things that are not.Still, when it comes to literature, we (as a society) tend to hold to a set of rules. We fear the removal of books for what is says about a formerly free society. We've been nursed at the tit of Fahrenheit 451. We associate the ban of books with Nazis and totalitarians and fundamentalist religious weirdos. When we hear of libraries whose books have been challenged, our hackles raise and we express righteous indignation against the backwards moralist who would dare target a particular work—forgetting that we live peaceably day-in and day-out with the MPAA, an organization that with capricious arbitration polices the availability of the cinematic literature. We should not be governed by fear. We should take every opportunity to approach the news of a ""banned"" book rationally. We should examine what banned means in the reported instance. We should inquire whether the issue is an outright ban (as in several cases involving ""adult"" comics in Canada and Australia) or if it's merely a lone challenger to a school system's library. Or maybe it's even a simple issue of shelving a book like Blankets in the children's section of a library. We need to consider the reason for the challenge. Was it for racially charged language, as in Huckleberry Finn's era-appropriate use of ""nigger""? Was it for ideological differences, such as Athanasius' conflagration of books that strayed from his view of orthodoxy? Or was it for what a society deems to be obscene content, as when Lady Chatterly's Lover encountered abiding censorship across the English-speaking world? The nature of the charge, the environment in which the challenge was given, and the recommended sanction are essential in considering the legitimacy of our concern for the removal of books.So it was with interest that I read that the second book on the ALA's list of most challenged literature last year was Kim Dong Hwa's Colors trilogy (made of of The Color of Earth, The Color of Water, and The Color of Heaven). The Korean series had been on my to-read queue for a bit over a year now, but new releases and returning to old favourites seemed to be forever pushing it back. When I saw that it had been so frequently challenged, I thought it would make a great second half of my Banned Books Week week of ing. And it would have been. Unfortunately,1 Building Stories happened and there was no longer any reason to hope that I'd get around to the books in anything resembling a timely manner. Still, after Building Stories finally unsunk its tenterhooks from my span of attention, I had Kim's trilogy waiting and though it's no longer timely, I don't care. I've thrown caution to the wind to bring you the PG-est book about teens discovering the sexiness of sex ever.[image][I'm with you Ehwa. That girl is the crazy sauce.]Which is, apparently the chief reason this series has been challenged over and over again. The teens being teens part, not the PG-ness of the books. It seems those who would challenge the book are happy to overlook how very little hard knowledge Kim's trilogy could impart on those who don't already know what he's talking about.Kim cloaks his coming-of-sexual-age story in Mather-Natural metaphor. Flowers and beetles and butterflies and summer breezes and fresh rains and chestnuts. These kinds of images dominate both the visual and textual space of Kim's story. There is not a single discussion of the male-female dynamic (whether overtly sexual or merely in regard to the difference between the sexes) that doesn't wade chest high in rather florid use of natural imagery. Everything is so very poetic—and therefore, so very obscured.You know how in Austen Powers, Elizabeth Hurley holds halved melons in front of her chest? Or obscures her breasts by pouring from a pitcher of milk? It's like that but less obvious. A chili pepper stands in for a little boy's penis.2 A lone persimmon seed plays the part of the little man in the boat. Gourd flowers represent a woman's sexy feelings in the night. There's all kinds of talk about blooming and blossoming and the rejuvenation of the spring rains. In one phantastic episode, a man skinny dips in a lushly reeded pond nestled sweetly between two softly rolling hills. In fact, while every chapter has its governing metaphor which gets played with throughout, chapters generally also have between one and five additional metaphors going on at the same time.Kim's book is all about avoidance.[image][I know some men who are like naked tiger lilies in their hearts too. But let's not dwell on it.]The Colors trilogy is the story of Ehwa's awakening to her womanhood, specifically in its physical presence as a distinction between the male and female bodies. At the start of The Color of Earth, Ehwa is seven and first encounters penises when she sees some neighbourhood boys peeing off an embankment. This begins a series of conversations with her mother, a widowed innkeeper with a reputation for being the town tart (even though she's entirely monogamous for the space of the trilogy). Through these dialogues and over the course of the next decade, Ehwa's mother gradually unveils both the physical and emotional use for Ewha's womanhood. But never directly. Her mother speaks in deep metaphor and it's almost entirely up to a sexually precocious neighbourhood girl, Bongsoon, to introduce Ehwa to the actual physiology of her own parts and pieces. [image][I'm going to pretend I have no idea what you guys are talking about.Actually, that might be true.]The mother/daughter relationship here is fascinating to consider as a template for child-rearing. This takes place probably3 at the end of the 19th century in Korea, so obviously there are going to be any number of cultural differences and things the contemporary Western reader will find primitive or distasteful (such as the clear patriarchy advocated in the mother's advice). The mother is clearly in a position of authority over Ehwa, but simultaneously cultivates a friendship based on trust and love. Ehwa, for her part, trusts her mother much more readily than I think many contemporary children would rely on and confide in their own parents. At the same time, she can be canny and withdrawn—especially if she has been embarrassed by her actions (such as when tricked into revealing her crushes on two local boys). I'm pretty sure that the care invested in the relationship between Ehwa and her mother was my favourite part of the books.Not being a fan of poetry in its textual form, I came to find that visual poetry doesn't strike me so deeply either and much of the probable delight of Kim's series was lost on me. Certainly many of the images were carefully considered and, taken on their own, I found myself admiring their beauty. I simply (and I feel somewhat the Philistine for admitting this) often grew bored in their preponderance. I wanted to get back to the dialogue and all its glittering metaphorical excess.[image][Poor dumb fireman.]As to the sexuality in these books (from which most of its challenges are reported to have grown), it's pretty tame. The MPAA is pretty arbitrary in its rating system, but if this was a movie in the pre-PG13 '80s, it would almost certainly merit a PG rating. Today, it'd probably sit pretty at a PG13. This is just about the most explicit image in the book. And regardless, Kim's story of this girl (based apparently on his mom's or grandmother's own life story) is never titillating.4 Did these books merit their challenges? Probably not. I suppose if they were shelved in the children's section next to Bone and Tintin and The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck, that would have been an awkward taxonomy. But these would be perfectly at home in Young Adults or, as my library shelves them, in Teen. It's not as if the broad approach in Kim's book will have teenage boys furiously googling ""persimmon seed girls -fruit"" while their parents are at Bible Study.NoteI remembered a while back reading some of the entries in a Manga Movable Feast that concerned Kim's books. They were largely negative and felt Kim's focus on Ehwa's sexual awakening and the way it is portrayed to be generally sexist and promoting of male fantasy. I approached the books believing I'd be reading a particularly chauvinist work as well as something scandalous enough to be The Second Most Challenged Book of 2011. It felt bizarre to have such a vastly different reading experience on both counts.While I can see someone being perturbed by Kim's single-minded focus on conversations that chart solely the tack of Ehwa's evolution from girl to woman, really, I don't think any reader should come away from the story imagining that's all Kim believes there was to Ehwa's life. More, it's just that's the story he was telling. Likewise some people might be bothered by Oishinbo's deliberate and unswerving attention to talking only about food All The Time, but that's the story Kariya and Hanasaki are telling so get off their backs already. I think to be disappointed that Kim doesn't spend more time developing the rest of Ehwa's life and interests is less to be unhappy with this particular book and more to be unhappy with the particular subgenre this book occupies. Which is fair. I just want us to be clear about what bothers us.In any case, I recommend reading some of the criticism of this book and taking in a number of perspectives. While I believe that many of Michelle and Melinda's complaints listed in the article linked above (and in their other writings on the books) are based on probably rushed readings of the text5  5  In the hyperbolically titled ""The Color of Hate"" Melinda ridicules a page in which Ehwa's mother waxes metaphorical while wondering when a wandering butterfly might alight on her daughter for rest, saying that the page is about ""attracting penises butterflies penises."" The thing is though: the books never use butterflies as anything other than metaphors for men and the joy romantic relationships with those men might bring. There are other metaphors for the phallus, for sure, but that Melinda misreads here made me distrust her narrative. Especially when one is already unhappy with a story, it's easy to force uncharitable readings on a text.

And has more pictures.][image][There are an unexpected number of grocery shots in this book.]Back in March 2011, during that year's Tournament of Books, I was introduced to what might be best described as a concept book. Nox is Anne Carson's literary project to unearth the identity of her recently-departed, long-estranged brother. Instead of pages of text bound between a front and back cover, Nox is a box containing a robust accordion-fold collection of notes, snapshots, receipts, journal entries, and other ephemera of a mystery life. Tournament of Books match commentator John Warner says this about Carson's project:I read Nox in a single sitting of under an hour, though ""read"" is the wrong word. ""Looked through,"" or ""experienced"" might be better. I’m one of the now many who reads in both physical copy and digital formats, and for most of the time, and most books, I can’t really say that the digital version alters the experience in any significant way. Regardless of how you’re reading something, often, text is text is text.Nox makes a strong argument for its necessity as a physical book. It comes shrink-wrapped, and upon opening, reveals itself to be a box which contains a rendering of a notebook, the pages connected via an accordion fold. The literally continuous nature of the book makes for an unusual sensation as you read, since the pages unfurl from one side and stack on the other. It was almost impossible to stop reading, as the next page was already partially unfolded, reminding you of its looming presence. This is unlike a digital text where you can only assume there’s more behind the next click.I was dead fascinated by the idea—especially by the idea of a book that justifies its physical nature, it's unwieldy spatial presence. I largely read my comics in bound-paper form. It's not that I don't find digital reproductions as worthwhile or powerful. More, I tend to avoid digital because the preponderance of unreasonable DRM schemes. Still, I wondered if there would be any Nox-like experiments to grace the medium of comics literature. Chris Ware's Building Stories is that experiment.The descriptions I had read of readers opening Nox and their surprise at its contents were the first non-experiential thing to grace my mind when I began unboxing Building Stories. I hadn't known what to expect. I had seen that Ware had a new book coming out, his first substantial work (I gathered) since Jimmy Corrigan's release more than a decade earlier. I believed merely that I'd be reading an amusingly shaped book, like Ware's prior publications (e.g. Jimmy Corrigan and his odd-dimensioned Acme Novelty Library editions). Instead, this large box (roughly 12""x17"") arrived at my office two weeks ago. At first I imagined it a tough slipcase for what would then be a Very Large Hardcover—and so I winced at the thought of trying to read such a heavy, unwieldy thing. Instead though: a box containing fourteen individual pieces of media of different sizes and dimensions. Fourteen stories, some hardbound, some in the form of pamphlets, some the size of newspapers (for those who remember newspapers). One was an 11""x16"" folding screen, like a boardgame board. Another two were single pieces of quad-folded paper (like travel brochures), about as tall as the width of a business card but maybe seven inches in length. I of course immediately laid out everything in our office lobby to get a better sense of what I'd soon be attacking. Here is our receptionist, posing with the unboxed Building Stories:[image]The first thing that will strike any unprepared reader when sitting down to actually read the thing is that there is no starting point. For the disparate apportionment of Ware's stories here, there is no indication of either ordo apocalypsis or even a recommendation of where to begin. From a purely metafictional standpoint, this is one of the more interesting aspects to Ware's project. Very few readers will share the same reading experience.[image]I mean, even though this is the case with your everyday novel, it's more so the case here. There will be those who approach by pattern, reading smallest to largest or vice versa, but the rest of us? It's entirely possible/likely that no one will have experienced the same story as I did when I read it or you will when you read it. The total possible number of different ways to approach Building Stories is 87,178,219,200 (or more that 87 billion, or 12 times the population of the earth).What's fascinating about this—for me at any rate—is how wildly different one's experience of the book might be depending on the order imbibed. The book could be read as largely depressing, largely affirming, harmonious, cacophonous, or even just bizarre. I happened to begin with two very downbeat stories, ones that led me to believe that Building Stories might be as depressing or more so than Jimmy Corrigan. This set a tone for me and I was disappointed at the thought that Ware had not graduated from the kind of character that made Jimmy Corrigan so painful and worthwhile. While I found Jimmy Corrigan a particularly worthwhile book, I'm always sad to find authors who exhibit no personal growth in their writing—i.e., our window into their personal reflections on life. When a fifty-year-old writes a song about love, you'd hope he'd write something perhaps more nuanced and incisive than he would have as a teenager[image]Fortunately, in my reading, things begin looking up. Everything is not quite so dour as I first believed. Ware's protagonist (so much as there is one) is more like a full-orbed person and experiences both highs and lows, even if she does show some indications of clinical depression—so far as my unclinical eye can diagnose. As well, her thought-life is... robust. I use the word robust a lot, but it really is very fitting. While she definitely does wallow occasionally in self-pity and a panoply of woe-is-me predictive scenarios, she's also thoughtful about social issues and the ethics of trivial actions. There's even fleeting interest in questions of philosophy and theology. She is a woman built of hopes, recriminations, desires, disgusts, fears, joys, and a waxing and waning of drive. Much like any of us.[image]With so many diverse pieces of comics literature included in Building Stories' box, a chief question will be How Well Does It Hold Together? Ware's pieces occur in different eras and while generally focusing on the Woman, some of the artifacts concern the Old Woman Downstairs, the Fighting Couple, or Branford Bee (a local apine denizen who intersects with the Woman's narrative for about a day). I held some small anxiety that Building Stories would be among those popular contemporary novels in which each chapter follows a different character but never comes together in any satisfying way (a la Let the Great World Spin). Those books are fine for what they are but I never find them as deeply satisfying as books that draw themselves together a bit more tightly.My concerns were happily unnecessary. While Building Stories may not function so much as a traditional novel—offering a common Western narrative structure of beginning, middle, end—it does what it does very well. There is no overall build of tension, no climax, no denouement—but there was never any pretension to such things. Beyond the impossibility of discovering The Correct Order in which to read Ware's creation, his intension is less about unveiling a plot as it is about discovering a life lived. This is the life of the Woman, and by the end of it you will know her as well as you know many of your friends. She is undressed, not for your approval so much as for your empathy. This is the closest many of us will come to walking in another's shoes.[image]Andrew Womack, the Tournament of Books judge who allowed Nox to move forward into the next round of the tourney says this about his experience with Carson's attempt to give shape to the outline of a brother she'd only spoken to five times in twenty-two years:I reached the end of the scroll and slid the box closed. Even with the book closed, I felt that discomfort again. When the task is to sum up a life, how adept can any of us be? Carson comes to terms with her brother’s death by accepting that she won’t ever know all the answers; sometimes out of chaos comes only more chaos. Nox is a beautiful new look at life and what comes before and after it, and an enrapturing read from beginning to end.Building Stories functions similarly, though possibly with greater clarity. Ware gives us to spend substantial time with the Woman, but we cannot possibly know her as we know ourselves. For all the many pages of insight, he still presents us an incomplete portrait whose history is scattered to the winds. Ware has picked up many pages from her's life's story, but certainly not all of them. There are gaps, holes. There are stories from her life that I wished Ware would have dwelt on more. Or at all. That, however, does not diminish from the work; it may even, in some way, magnify it.[image][I censored this image for nudity for the sake of the mothers of younger readers who really won't appreciate the book anyway.]At one point I had considered that the project's title, Building Stories, referred to the actual, physical structure in which the Woman spends much of her time in many of the book's discrete portions. (That building, after all, does even narrate one of the stories.) After a while, however, I came to believe that Building was not here used as a noun, but instead a verb. Instead of stories about or in the vicinity of buildings, Ware is focused on building (or constructing) the stories that round out the personhood of a particular individual, the Woman. He does not need his stories to add up to a grander story. He does not need them to fill out an over-arching structure. Such an over-story does not here exist nor was it ever intended to.This is why Ware doesn't concern himself with alerting the reader to a recommended order for approaching the work. Story, in the large sense, isn't the point. Because he is revealing a person, not a story. And which one of us ever lived a life that was a functioning story? Sure, there might be brief instances that might circumscribe a storylike structure. Or narratives that exist only as cherry-picked collections of moments, working toward an artificially constructed framework that we force upon our lives at a distance. But nobody's life is that neatly set and laid. Not mine, not yours, and not the Woman's. And this is why Building Stories is such a success. Ware deftly gives us both sense of person and sense of history's capriciousness. These are stories, but instead of adding up to a Story, they add up to more. They add up to a person, living and breathing, and tossed to and fro by the winds of circumstance, hope, and fear. Ware called his project Building Stories, but he could have as likely called it The Human Condition, though that might have been too on the nose.[image]Building Stories is a phenomenal work. I don't believe I was predisposed to think it so. While I enjoyed Jimmy Corrigan (as much as someone can enjoy something so relentlessly depressing), I haven't much followed Ware's work in the last decade. I tried one of his ""Rusty Brown"" collections but found I loathed the character so much that I never picked up anything Ware had done since. I even approached Building Stories with some degree of guarded caution. Despite this, Chris Ware blew me away with his vision of this Woman and her surrounds. Building Stories is deep and deserves multiple readings—already I'm forgetting things and struggling to remember how certain details fit together. And of course, no two readings need resemble each other in the least. This book gets my highest recommendation, and the next time I update my Top 100 it is certain to unseat Daytripper as my Number Two favourite comic._______________WhiningI wish so very badly that its ticket price were lower. I got it on a good pre-order discount and had some store credit to knock it down a bit more. It's not that I'm averse to spending money on the things I enjoy. It's just that Building Stories is such a rich, important literary experience that I'm desperate to share it with book clubs and friends. The price tag, however, makes that almost impossible. And the scattered nature of the box's contents makes me doubtful that libraries will want to carry the thing. As someone who spends substantial personal investment in evangelizing his social circle with the gospel of good comics, being unable to promote the medium using such a magnificent work is heartrending._______________Footnotes1) I've purchased and read several comics through Dark Horse's, Viz's, and Top Shelf's digital apps and the experience, while tactilely different and leaving the reader incapable of flipping through pages with any real facility, was not a far change from the more traditional means of comics consumption.2) Meaning that I, the purchaser, am not the owner of the thing purchased and am merely a leasee. I cannot loan digital comics to friends. I cannot give them to a friend to keep for as long as he wants. I cannot sell when I no longer want to keep the book around. The only two rights I am granted by digital purchasing under current DRM models are 1) the right to read my books so long as the service I'm leasing from allows it, and 2) the right to delete the book from my archive. I'm still excited by the potential of digital publication but I find the means through which companies distribute their digital content abhorrent.3) That is to say, a recommended order of revelation, an indication as to which piece should be read in which order.4) For instance, our own individual experiences and circumstances always colour our readings of even common novels, giving us each our own slightly unique filter through which we approach a work._______________[This  comes courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,35,1,not set,not set,"Oct 15, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13573235-building-stories

He was a brother whom I loved very much and I have never gotten over feeling his loss.""—Akira Kurosawa, regarding his elder brother Heigo.[image]I have never personally experienced a close and permanent personal loss. My whole apprehension of such experiences derives from film and literature.1 Certainly I have lost relatives to the grave—though none of tremendous personal meaning. I have been devastated by the ends of romantic affairs, but even the close of these relationships were tempered by the knowledge that so long as we both still lived, breaches could be shored up and repairs might allow friendship to remain. I was, at one point, led to believe that a close friend from elementary, junior high, and high schools had perished, but it had been more than a decade since our friendship had waned—and then he revealed that he wasn't dead at all, which (obviously) took any remaining sting from the news. [image]Still, I'm getting older and the odds say that if it isn't me first, I will with certainty lose those close to me to the permanence of the soil. But as the future is not yet, I still have no real knowledge of this kind of loss—and for that reason, I'm grateful to books that offer a peek behind such a terrible curtain. Not books like Harry Potter or Game of Thrones where the whole object of a character's end is to sell the plot forward, paying toll at the gates of reader interest—those offer no insight, only titillation. Stories like Jimmy Corrigan or the rending Three Shadows or even possibly Twin Spica are among those that truly let you walk for a time in another's shoes. They are stories that prompt you to experience (for even a moment2) something deeply foreign, if you are fortunate enough that this kind of story should still be entirely foreign. And Scott Morse's Barefoot Serpent joins the muster of stories that aim to treat this trouble for what it is.[image]Morse follows a very rough chiasmic structure here, bookending his central story with another and setting his climax in the book's center. The Barefoot Serpent begins and ends with a kind of children's picture-book adaptation of Akira Kurosawa's biography. Between these two bookends about a well-regarded Japanese filmmaker of the twentieth century, Morse explores the aftermath of a boy's death and the toll it takes on his family, particularly upon his little sister. One might be tempted to read this as a story about Kurosawa, informed by an episode concerning a little girl, which makes Kurosawa's experience from nearly eighty years ago3 a little more tangible to the contemporary reader. And that may be the case. I, however, am more persuaded that it is Kurosawa's story that provides the frame for what comes between. This is, after all, a common purpose for the chiasmus—to lead up to a climax that occurs in the narrative center and then back away from it in a manner that will draw attention to the climax and inform our reading of it. I'll deal with this more explicitly in an end note, but for now, let it suffice that I believe Morse intends us to read this as a human story that merely looks to Kurosawa for thematic purpose.Morse's books are always a pleasure to revel in for their artistry. He includes dialogue here, but keeps it off-panel and out of the way, allowing his images to breathe. His characters are cartoony in that way that permits them to be invested with great personality. His illustration technique gives him the opportunity to craft even supporting characters who possess the illusion of well-rounded characterization despite perhaps only being given a single line of dialogue.[image]The use of colour, as well, is a powerful device. The two Kurosawa bookends are printed in oversaturated hues and tones on glossy paper and feature sometimes bombastic, fragmented imagery—often more iconic than narrative. The central story, however, is printed on a cheaper matte paper and isn't even really black-and-white. Instead, the girl's episode in bountiful, colourful Hawaii is rendered in a smudge of greys. Even the lightest and darkest portions of her pages are at strongest an off-white grey and an off-black grey. When the girl first pulls a prescription bottle from her bag, it's easy to imagine that pharmaceuticals may be the cause of her story's dreamlike haze. I'll leave the reader to find her own interpretation of Morse's purpose in this kind of colour schematic and simply report that I think it works wonderfully.As a story, I likewise think The Barefoot Serpent acquits itself admirably. At a terse 128 pages it goes by rather quickly, but if the reader cares to linger I believe he'll be rewarded by its sweetness and calamity. I have never experienced permanent personal loss of deep significance and I don't expect reading a book like this will prepare me. But I do feel I'm better off for having read it. It's an engaging, playful, thoughtful, and hopeful work—one of which I believe Kurosawa would approve.[image]_____________________An End NoteIf I have on thing against The Barefoot Serpent, it's that Morse ends the book with an afterward in which he explicitly spells out a fair number of his influences and intentionalities. This book is, of course, steeped in thematic resemblances to the works and ideology of Kurosawa, which is one of the things I appreciated—having gone through a minor infatuation with the man's films in the late-'90s.The thing is: I wanted some time to sit and consider, to contemplate Morse's work and intentions. I wanted to be able to pick up on his references myself rather than have them pointed out to me. My wife, on the other hand, has never seen a Kurosawa film4 and found the immediate excursion into Morse's tribute to the director fascinating and helpful and not the least part intrusive._____________________Another End NoteThis one kind of does what I just chastised Morse for (i.e. it talks perhaps too explicitly about What's Going On). So skip it maybe if you haven't yet read The Barefoot Serpent unless you don't care. In which case: sally forth.If we were to outline The Barefoot Serpent, it might look like this:A. Kurosawa's young life  • Youth  • Low point  • High point      B. Family introduced          C. Family crises            • Intro of ghosts            • Girl's crisis journey            • Mother's crisis journey            • Father's crisis journey                  D. Climax at pool          C′. Family catharsis            • Girl's resolution            • Mother's resolution            • Father's resolution            • Outro of ghosts      B′. Family resolvesA′. Kurosawa's later life  • High point  • Low point  • YouthAs I mentioned earlier, while the chiasmic structure is present, it's not rigid. I don't believe I'm reading the structure into the book, but interpretation is obviously subjective. In any case, applying a common form of interpretation here, point D would be the story climax (which seems to be the case) and everything that emerges afterward is a reflection of what came before. As introduction to the chiasmus, the Kurosawa biography gives us a framework with which to ascertain hope and rejuvenation for Morse's characters—themes intimate to both Kurosawa's works and his own life._____________________Footnotes1) I find song too unwieldy and inaccessible to be a trustworthy source. The poetry of verse backed by the beauty and power of music is so hyperbolic that it seems designed wholly for those already in like circumstances. And so I prefer books and film, which are easier to parse down to the tangible, the believable.2) Of course, a good argument could be made that to experience such things for merely a moment is not to experience them at all. I would want to agree but I think I'd be happier to say that the momentary experience can give taste to something of the reality without bringing about perfect empathy, which is impossible.3) As The Barefoot Serpent was originally published in 2003, it was released seventy years after Kurosawa's brother Heigo committed suicide4) Demonstrating that I have been an awful husband to her._____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/703605.The_Barefoot_Serpent

Both vanguard and old guard are sacrificed in the collision of ideals. And sometimes the casualties aren't just metaphor and social construct. Sometimes there are literal casualties—human ones. Dotter of Her Father's Eyes relates the struggles of two such human sacrifices in the battle of ideological paradigm shift. Both Lucia (James Joyce's only daughter) and Mary Talbot (this book's scribe) were real combatants in a war they may not have even been quite aware they were embroiled in. Certainly, they recognized the fact of the skirmishes that framed their lives' choices and developments, but could they have known from the inside just how monumental the transformation being wrought upon the kingdom of Western Civilization was? (It's possible, of course, but the young are rarely the most aware of the larger struggles that govern the architecture of their lives.)Ideas are important and have value because people believe in them.1 And not just in the sense of casual assent. Not like how I believe that Antarctica exists but can't be bothered to shape my life around the fact. Discovering Antarctica isn't actually there or is there but underwater or is a flying continent—or probably really anything I could discover about Antarctica won't do much to ruffle the feathers of my life. If someone brings it up in conversation, the entire summation of my response would accurately be distilled to: Huh. Interesting. If, however, you and forty otherwise intelligent people tried to seriously convince me and society that having kids was actually evil, my reaction would almost certainly be more visceral (depending on how real I believed the threat to my way of life to be). At the least, there might be defensiveness and some frustration. As the threat escalates, tolerances strain and violence or unhappy legislation (for one or both sides) may erupt. In her biographical and autobiographical work, Mary Talbot (aided visually by husband and illustrator Bryan Talbot) confronts the struggle of society to lurch into the era of modernity and beyond. It's unclear whose story Talbot is more interested in (or if she even has a preference), but she introduces an inclusio whereby she in the current day finds an old ID card belonging to her now-deceased father. Inside the framing device Talbot pursues two narratives: one concerning her own formative years at the hand of her father James Atherton, a well-regarded Joycean scholar, and the other charting the development of James Joyce's own daughter Lucia and the relationship he had with her. Neither relationship is a thing of joy and beauty, but one suspects that if both girls were born to the same fathers a century later, the absence of certain social constriction might have allowed for happy endings all the way around.[image]As delineated by Talbot, both Mary's and Lucia's lives are welled up under the pervasive irony of being the children of bastions of modernism who cannot see clear to apply modernist principles to their own patriarchal relationships. Dotter lays special emphasis on the rallying cry of the paradigm movement: ""How modern!"" Everyone around both Mary and Lucia are caught up in the transformation of culture—of the evolution of the stilted, errant, grossly conservative pre-modern society into the glorious fortress of progressive social democracy found in the modern utopia. It's a period of hope and change. And each of these two fathers are in some sense heralds or ambassadors or representatives of this new civilization.The irony of course is that in the cold darkness of their hearts' hearts, they are still staunch defenders of the Old Ways—hopeless, helpless relics who will unconsciously stop at nothing to crush the Spirit of the Age in its most immediately tangible bastion. They will carelessly destroy their children (or perhaps die trying), unaware that in so doing they make mockery of those values they pretend to hold dearest to their hearts. Mary's father Atherton will do so by his direct actions built of disdain and outright dismissiveness of his daughter. Joyce, on the other hand, will combat his own values through a negligence in policing he and his wife's failure to recognize Lucia as something more than their provincial understanding of the female being will allow. [image]Compared to Atherton, Joyce appears a doting father—one who truly loves and admires his daughter but simply doesn't have the grounding by which to combat either his wife's vindictiveness or to understand the place of the female in modern applications. Perhaps he was more a doer than a thinker. Atherton, however, cannot claim such excuses (as if excuses ever really exonerate one human from destroying another)—he is a scholar, a thinker, and devoted to considering the ramifications of Joyce's body of work. Surely some mote of the new paradigm, some willingness to apprehend the world through inventive, fresh structures ought to have asserted itself through his studies. Still, as poor, blind humans, our penchant for adhering to comfortability and ritual and the tried-if-not-true will ever hold power over our sense of reason—so while tragic and ironic, neither Joyce's nor Atherton's failures are particularly surprising.""Sad life. Sad life,"" to quote a certain wise but immolated horse.2As a work, Dotter of Her Father's Eyes is an enjoyable, thoughtful read. (Or at least as enjoyable as a non-fictional pair of tragedies can be.) Mary Talbot's script was at all times interesting for me—even if I didn't necessarily understand the purpose of combining her own story with Lucia's. Though I described Dotter as an exploration of the irony of a particular conflict between ideology and praxis, that's a layer of interpretation that I read onto the story because I felt the need to draw out an overriding theme from the work. While the irony is there pretty unquestionably, it's unclear whether this is Talbot's primary aim with the narrative. When I first finished reading, I was frustrated with not being able to discern why Talbot may have tied her story to Lucia's beyond the simplistic connection constructed by Atherton being a primary scholar of Joyce's oeuvre. My wife felt a similar dissonance and we tried to suss out Talbot's point unsuccessfully. Perhaps it's there and obvious. Perhaps we were unqualified to discover it or perhaps our concentration was too divided by the conflict of late-night readings versus days filled with the stress of juggling earning an income against good, loving child-rearing. Perhaps we were just dense (momentarily or permanently). Or perhaps Talbot didn't quite succeed in tying together the threads of her purpose.[image]Regardless, the book is good and worth a reader's time. Both Mary and Lucia lived in horrifying and exciting times. I can't imagine the struggle of mind and heart. From my position of genetic and historical privilege, I can't imagine being a thinking person burdened under such constraints. I'm grateful then to the Talbots for bringing this segment of the historical record to light and life, no matter how nauseating. _____________________Art NoteFor his part, Bryan Talbot is in stellar form. My only other intersection with his work is his celebrated Tale of One Bad Rat. In the two decades since then, he's clearly honed his artistic sensibilities and as crisp as his vision was then, it's become something truly beautiful and evocative here. Talbot uses usually monochromatic palettes of washes to indicate narrative threads and imply mood and warmth and love and panic and everything else. I never felt any question as to what a scene was meant to display. I'd love to see more of Talbot's work, especially if along these lines._____________________Two Other Notes1) It only just occurs to me that Talbot introduces her story with the faerytale-esque: Once upon a timeAnd long agoA King and QueenHad a daughterHer name wasMarushkaOr LuciaOr Lucy MariaOr MrayI suppose then it's possible that Mary Talbot's name is Lucy Maria (named for Lucia) but she that goes by Mary, giving a touch more connection between the two women and better justifying the dual-nature of the book?_____________________Footnotes1) Terry Gilliam played this to interesting effect in his Baron Munchausen. Gilliam focuses his narrative lens on the birth of the age of reason and represents his ideological combatants as individuals with fantastic powers. Throughout the adventure, Gilliam treats us to the blending of the literal and the ideological such that the conflict between the two is made more tangible. Really, I'm not sure that Baron Munchausen has much to do with Dotter, but I think we shouldn't probably miss any opportunity to remind ourselves of Gilliam's genius.

Hopeless Savages is delightfully rollicking and more indie than it is punk.[image][Skank Zero = the hooskiest]Writer Jen Van Meter teams up with artists such as Christine Norrie, Bryan Lee O'Malley, Ross Campbell, and Chynna Clugston to deliver three very different volumes that exist as easily digestible stand-alone stories. Approaching them sequentially does enrich the reader's appreciation for Van Meter's world, but it isn't entirely necessary and I will sometimes loan out volume 2 to friends whether they've read the first or not.Since this is like a special holiday week—what with it being Band Books Week1 and all—I'm going to approach this  a bit differently and tackle each volume in a quick-paced mini- sort of fashion.What ho.Hopeless SavagesVolume 1, simply titled Hopeless Savages, is the weakest of the three. It's not bad by any stretch, but it serves mostly to introduce the family—by way of the kidnapping of the Hopeless-Savage parents. Dirk and Nikki are grown-up-and-settled-down former punk rock legends. Or maybe they're current legends and former stars. Something like that. In any case, they've been stolen and Van Meter uses their theft to introduce and spend time with the four Hopeless-Savage offspring (from youngest to oldest), Skank Zero2, Twitch Strummer, Arsenal Fierce, and Rat Bastard (all their real names!). [image]It's an amusing cast, but with the focus on 1) the kidnapping and 2) finding the prodigal Rat (he betrayed the family and went corporate a decade earlier), we don't get enough time with individual members to allow their personalities to shimmer. It's a fine diversion, but nothing spectacular.3 We'll leave spectacular for...Hopeless Savages: Ground ZeroVolume 2 is one of my comics heroes. A book that gets it and gets it done. Ground Zero, drawn principally by O'Malley in his pre-Pilgrim days, is a love story and one of the best I've read in comics form. It's also perhaps the most frisky that Van Meter gets with her narrative order, hopping back and forth and in and out of sequence, keeping things always lively, tense, and on the go.[image]Ground Zero features most prominently Zero, who is introduced in the volume at a hearing before her school's triumvirate to defend herself against the charge of a recent expulsion-level catastrophe at a school assembly. The title refers, at the least, to both the fact of this explosive event and the more literal (though punny) fact that Zero spends the entire volume truly and deeply grounded. The reason for all of this, it turns out, is a boy (named for Ginger Baker!). Several characters remark on how OF COURSE IT'S ABOUT A BOY and how cliche and obvious that all is. Van Meter basically says ""Screw that noise. I'm writing this thing about a boy and it's going to be awesome and it will make you wish you had your own story about a boy, so shut up forever.""4 And she does—she does write an awesome story about a boy, about a girl, and about finding out that you're in love and that love can be this awesome, dangerous, rewarding beast of an abstract thing.Ground Zero makes me fall in love with love.5Too Much Hopeless SavagesAfter volume 2, I was excited to maybe get more of Zero and Ginger—because I know it would be incredible. Instead, Van Meter aims her camera more squarely at Arsenal. I was disappointed at first but Van Meter delivers a solid adventure.Where volume 1 plays as an introductory comic romp and volume 2 turns in a very very sweet romance, Too Much Hopeless Savages spins out an international espionage thriller with comic leanings. Arsenal and Twitch are visiting Hong Kong with their boyfriends (to visit family and so that Arsenal might compete in a martial arts tourney against on old antagonist). In typical silly fashion a Russian sneaky type, knowing that customs is on to him, slips a package into Arsenal's luggage—thus beginning a series of bumbling interception attempts involving the Russians, a couple British spies (playing off Greg Rucka's Queen & Country characters6), the Hong Kong authorities, and eventually the entire Hopeless-Savage clan.[image]Because there are so many characters running in and out of frame, there isn't much (or enough) time spent with any one character and we get something of a similar problem to what hinders volume 1. It's not quite as bad because Van Meter does lean toward making this a story about Arsenal and so nearly all the flashbacks concern her, giving the reader at least one anchor in the tumult. Still, it's a fine volume and the focus missing from volume 1 isn't quite as necessary here because most of the characters are familiar by now.If there is one unfortunate issue that slightly mars the book, it's the change in artist for the final chapter (of four). Ross Campbell (of Wet Moon and Shadow Eyes) makes his published-comics debut in Too Much Hopeless Savages, drawing the flashbacks for each issue. He does a wonderful job and plays a great counterpoint to Christine Norrie's beautiful lines. For reasons unknown to me (as a mere consumer of the work), Norrie falls off the book with the third chapter and Campbell picks up for the entirety of the fourth. It's not a gentle transition, as Campbell's style is very distinct from Norrie's; and while Campbell's art might have been fine if expected, the jarring nature of the transition7 leaves a sour taste that lingers over the volume's conclusion.[image]Some Final ThoughtsOver the course of the series, Van Meter makes marked use of flashback. Every chapter contains a several-page flashback (drawn by a secondary artist so that it's easily discernible from the main story). These flashbacks not only embellish the current storyline, giving motive to otherwise unexplainable actions, but they serve to give the series a grounding in history. It's one thing for us to hear that Nikki Savage used to be a wild thing on stage but another to actually see what she was like back then. It's one thing to know that Rat left the family because of a girl but another to see it play out. These bits and pieces lend credibility to the work. Kind of like how Tolkien's inclusion of songs and legends helps the realization of his LOTR world.One of the recurrent themes of Hopeless Savages is family and its essentiality. With the exception of Zero (who is, I believe, a junior in high school), all of Dirk and Nikki's children are grown and leading their own lives (and generally pretty successfully). Dirk and Nikki are on the verge of being empty-nesters. But far from being on the verge of a certain lonely liberation, their family is still very close and they spend more time together than many families that share a single roof. For all of the Hopeless-Savage's anarchic roots, the governance of valuing family rules each of their hearts almost completely. It's a joy to see—and as a father to young children, I hope to see my life somewhat a mirror to theirs twenty years from now.Hopeless Savages is an enjoyable series and three volumes is tragically too few for characters who deserve far more. I very much hope Van Meter will eventually return to this creative corner and round out the cast a bit more—or at least give us a story about college-aged Zero and Ginger. _________________Footnotes1) Look. I know it's banned books and not books about bands. I may play at it, but I'm not entirely thick. Really, I just needed an excuse to write about Hopeless Savages and I have a friend who loves puns more than he loves breathing. So here we all are then.2) She goes by Zero. Or by Zed or Zee or Skankabelle. And talks in a smattering of fabricoated words that convey their swoo through sound and context rather than through any squalling relation to the English language.3) Though I will admit to enjoying Van Meter's framing device in which she allows Zero to narrate through subterranean-homesick-blues‒style placards.4) And in a supporting story that is also about a boy and runs parallel to Zero's, Van Meter gives us a touching bit of insight into and resolution to Twitch's own story. It's well done and plays well against Zero's heart and heartbreak.5) Plus, O'Malley draws Zero wearing the hooskiest clothes and how can you not love such a book. Actually, I think I may prefer his work on Ground Zero to either Lost at Sea or Scott Pilgrim, both of which I enjoy inordinately.6) Rucka is Van Meter's husband, so I presume it's alright.7) The jarring nature of the transition as well as the fact that he may not have been quite ready to draw this type of story. He's not here able to capitalize on any of the things that made him such a delightful artist in that era of his career._________________Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Oct 01, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9446190-hopeless-savages

I[image][This lady, who is old enough to know better, is being petty and mean.]Adaptations from literature into the comics form have it pretty rough. It's not like with movies where a charismatic star or a sublime musical score can provide lift for a work. Unless an adapter is wildly liberal in the work of adaptation, comics have exactly two things to work with: writing (provided largely by the original author) and art through which to carry forth the dialogical and narrative aspects of the work (respectively). It's not an easy task and the very nature of the transition is positioned as a serious obstacle to the success of any adaptation.Mediocre creators produce dreadful (though sometimes hilarious) works, like Marvel's recent attempt to bring Pride & Prejudice to the medium and the recent re-interpretation of Dostoyevsky, The Grand Inquisitor . Even works backed by incredible, no-fail talents like Eric Shanower and Skottie Young can falter and produce books that are merely enjoyable. Successful transfers of literature into the comics medium are exceedingly rare. Jiro Taniguchi's adaptation of Jack London and Humayoun Ibrahim's adaptation of Jack Vance are two examples—both do a good job of pacing story for the medium and using storytelling tools unique to comics in order to bring the reader into a special experience of an already existing story.Hope Larson is immensely talented and one of my favourite comics illustrators, but unfortunately her adaptation of A Wrinkle in Time fares no better than Shanower and Young's Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Like Oz, her Wrinkle in Time boasts a number of charms and excellencies, but the whole package fails to be Completely Wonderful. I was hoping for Completely Wonderful based both on my prior experience of Larson's work and how much excitement my friends had when I said I'd be reading Wrinkle in Time—perhaps it was those hopes and expectations that dimmed my love for the book. Also: it may be fair to disclose that a book has to be particularly spectacular for me to overlook my weariness of fantasy settings.1For the first hundred pages of Larson's adaptation, I was perhaps unreasonably excited by the prospect of there being a whole three hundred more pages to the story—and then four more original prose novels after that. I had even been prompted by my enjoyment of the adaptation to visit the library and pick up Madeleine L'Engle's original Wrinkle in Time, thinking that perhaps I would finish reading Larson's book and then read L'Engles in order to add some colour to my . That first hundred pages all occurs in our real, tangible, and not very sci-fi or fantasy world. It was delicious and Larson's play with these characters was delightful. I thought that I would want to spend hundreds and perhaps thousands of pages with these characters. Then the world-hopping began. I'm returning L'Engle's novel to the library unread. Maybe I'll read it to my daughter someday if she likes, but I no longer feel an urgent need to revisit these characters or their adventures.[image]While things don't immediately begin a downhill slide (and I don't even know that slide would ever be an accurate description of how my disappointments in the book took form) with the bending of timespace, that was where my easy alliance with the story began to strain. From this point onward, Larson's Wrinkle in Time experiences increasingly poor pacing until in the last ninety pages when things begin happening so abruptly that it's hard to get footing enough to buy into the motives of various characters' actions. Protagonist Meg establishes a close relationship with an alien creature after what seems like a few minutes' conversation—something that feels untrue to her character as established. Likewise, a romantic pairing springs up with barely more pretense than Thor and Jane's spontaneous romantic combustion in last year's Thor movie. Everything feels rushed and uneven and I stopped trying to guess what characters would do in the situations they experienced and simply decided I was now in it strictly to find out What Happens. And after this book's stellar beginning, this was a disappointment.[image][Science!]And of course, it's not all bad. Larson's art and visual characterization are superb. She constantly brings a sense of moment to the individual reactions of her characters. What initially won me over so strongly to her creative vision here (before the narrative intervened) was her depictions of the inscrutable Charles Wallace. Larson is one of those comics artists who is actually able to illustrate a range of expressions in her characters. A quick survey of the available product in the medium will highlight exactly what a great gift that is. By her treatment of the three primary child-characters before the adventure begins, I was completely wrapped up in the mystery of their everyday lives. A book of Meg, Calvin, and Charles Wallace just sitting around interacting with each other in the grip of thoroughly non-extraordinary circumstances would be fabulous. Maybe they could go on walks occasionally. Throw stones at abandoned beehives or something.*sigh* I'm in love with a book that doesn't exist.[image]I'm torn on how much to recommend Hope Larson's Wrinkle in Time. On the one hand, her art is beautiful and serves only to elevate the work. On the other, issues in pacing made it difficult to remain involved in the kids' adventure. It's possible that another hundred pages of padding—of focus on characterization—could have eased some of the alacrity with which the story spins itself out. I don't envy the task of the adapter because too often even great talents like Larson cannot emerge victorious against the challenges adaptations provoke.Additional NoteOne question I always struggle with when approaching an adaptation is how much blame to lay at the feet of the adapter if the adaptation is not a great product. After all, what if the inadequacies are intrinsic to the original work? In the present case, it may very well be that Hope Larson has faithfully adapted A Wrinkle in Time and the issues I had with the book are present in the original as well. I suppose that's fair enough and fans of the original will probably appreciate such deep fidelity, but for my part, I prefer that adapters improve on their source. Examples here: Fight Club, Snow Falling on Cedars, and Patricia Rozema's Mansfield Park. Mansfield Park is a fairly liberal translation of Austen's novel and reframes the context of the book to make a particular political statement only hinted at broadly within Austen's original work; but better still, Rozema alters the character of Austen's protagonist in such a way that the movie is actually enjoyable—a faithful adaptation would be painful to watch. Snow Falling on Cedars is a faithful adaptation that improves its source by simply shuffling the narrative into a series of non-sequential skips through the story's timeline. This increases the film's drama and makes it a slightly more enjoyable experience than the book upon which it is based. I haven't read Palahniuk's Fight Club, but even he agrees that David Fincher improved the work and made the story his own.This is what I had hoped of Larson, regardless of whether the original had the same deficiencies. I don't hold it against her because adaptation is very difficult and adaptation that actually improves a work is more difficult by far._____________________Footnote1) Even Miyuki Miyabe's Brave Story, which I loved inordinately, suffered a flagging of interest when the book's young protagonist—after two-hundred pages of stupendous-but-mundane earthbound narrative—gets whisked away to a realm of fantasy._____________________Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,not set,"Oct 01, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13513205-a-wrinkle-in-time

I wouldn't have noticed had seemingly arbitrary circumstances not come together as well as they did. Call it fate. Call it serendipity. Call it my doom. Or destiny or predestination or blind harmless luck. Or even all of the the above. The close of the matter is that when reading Thien Pham's Sumo tonight, I saw things that I entirely missed when I read Thien Pham's Sumo two weeks ago—and this due entirely to a change in frame of mind developed by forces exterior to Pham's book or my reading of it. Colour me appreciative.Over the last couple days, I'd been reading a text on the complex literary structures of the Hebrew scriptures. The day before that, a friend mentioned the works of David Mitchell, which brought to mind his wonderful and lauded Cloud Atlas, a novel distinct in its work-length chiastic structure. And the week before that, I had been thinking of David Foster Wallace's The Pale King and how often in contemporary literature (modernist and postmodernist) authors experiment and play with structures outside the straightforward linear narrative. With the consideration of these devices occupying so much of my thought-life this last week, approaching Sumo again revealed immediately a sense of Pham's intentional governance of his story and its order of revelation.[image]At its most basic and pared-down, Pham has written a graphic novella whose content is perhaps enough only to fill out a short story. Scott is a former American football hopeful who, in the wake of losing that dream and the girlfriend who came pre-packaged with it, is attempting to rebuild his life as a sumo wrestler in Japan. Pham isn't interested in Scott's whole story but instead approaches him in the first (and therefore most important) of many do-or-die moments in his career: just as he prepares for his final try to make the transition from rikishi to sekitori (that is, from lower division to upper). Sumo's entire present tense may only occur over the space of a couple days, but it's clear that Pham is putting forth a representative pericope of a whole life lived. What occurs in Sumo's narrative span is Scott's day of judgment—on this story will hinge our evaluation of Scott as a whole person. This is his past, present, future—weighed on the scales of the readers' subjective evaluation.[image]I was initially put off by how little time Pham allows us to spend with his characters—characters he ably turns into people whose lives I want to inhabit. I wanted to linger and see the result of their efforts, to see them overcome adversity or be ruined by it. I liked Scott and the coach and Asami, the girl. Their lives and dreams and future became important to me, but Pham robbed me of any of that because this wasn't the story he was telling. There was, perhaps, a bigger fish at stake—and it's through his literary structure that his intent finds its culmination.[image]Pham presents his story in a patterned series of segments that alternate between the present and two themed flashbacks, one in America and the other in Japan. The present-day narrative is coloured in orange, the American flashback in periwinkle, and the Japanese flashback in green. The way Pham alternates between eras in Scott's life gives the most time to the present and splits evenly between his two pasts. Here's a visual diagram of the pattern:[image]And beyond just his conscious staggering of narrative streams, Pham uses a technique whereby the length of each segment telescopes in ever-diminishing increments so that, finally, Pham is spending only a single panel in any given story period. Here's a small-scale representation of how Sumo's narrative is laid out in terms of page-length:[image]Generally, Pham uses episodes from Scott's past to inform our immediate reading of the wrestler's present; but from the above you can see that he ends the book in a longer segment from Scott's past in Japan. It's a surprising conclusion, but effective: using a moment from Scott's past not only to guide our reading of Scott's present but of Pham's book as a whole. What seemed an adequate conclusion in my first reading took on new light in second approach. Happenstance in the form of a sudden confluence of my interests in literary structure helped give me better appreciation for a carefully wrought story. [image]Additional Notes• Pham also uses his page-numbering conceit in thematic ways as well. Page numbers in orange sections are decorated by a tiny representation of the dohyo, the sumo wrestlers' ring. Numbers in the blue section are placed inside a water tower, representative of Scott's hometown in America. Finally, the green sections are numbered within a green fish, a symbol which is explored over the course of several of the Japanese flashbacks.[image]•Sumo's cover is interesting, showing on its front an idealized Scott, successfully parting the seas in full mastery of his sumo strength and wearing his kesho-mawashi, a ceremonial silk apron—something we never see within the scope of the book, as lower-division wrestlers aren't permitted the luxury of spectacle. On the rear of the cover, we see a pre-sumo and blond Scott—alone and engulfed in water up to his neck. Pham's book, of course, is the question that sits between these two extremes: which will Scott become and what will define him, the disappointments of the past or the impossible glories of the future?____________________[ provided courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,not set,not set,"Sep 24, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13538680-sumo

A young protagonist one day wakes in an unfamiliar place and—through a variety of struggles and trials—eventually overcomes the cultural hindrances that hold him back. Or a young protagonist's home is destroyed and she, alone and unprepared, must discover and come to control the wildness of the greater, wider world around her. Or a young protagonist arrives at a new school (perhaps even mid-term) and must learn to swim in the new, strange waters of his new social ecology. These are common stories—common enough that we probably don't need names or titles to prompt us to fill in some of the details about how these things will work out.But what if that sense of disorientation, that alienation, didn't give way to heroic success and comfortability? What if the story was less about success in a strange place than it was about acquiescence in the face of an inescapable foreignness, an otherness that cannot be overcome because its alien nature was too great. In a way, that's the kind of story Ryan Inzana explores in Ichiro. It's a book where success is measured not in fighting against disorientation but more in simply coming to apprehend that feeling and taking what ambiguous lessons one can from it. For this, despite the book's certain indebtedness to fantasy and folklore, it may actually be a more realistic story—and hence more valuable to the young reader.1[image][This kanji apparently means ""yellow"" for whatever reason. Or something. Don't ask me, I can't read kanji.]Ichiro and Ichiro survey through several layers of disorienting strata, investigating and coming to terms with vertiginous environmental, historical, and political paradigms. Inzana's protagonist is introduced immediately at the mercy of two common circumstantial troubles, as well as a third—this one less common but unfortunately by no means rare. In the first place, Ichiro is a young teen, which naturally places him at odds with every other living being (for even the best of us, traveling through puberty is an awkward journey—with our ungovernable bodies controlling us rather than being controlled by us). On top of that: Ichiro, the son of an American father (of indeterminate heritage2) and a Japanese mother, is hapa. Because he has Asian physical characteristics, even in a city so cosmopolitan as New York, Ichiro has to endure the stereotypical racist reactions that in America still haunt those of Asian descent. Even in his home country, Ichiro is made to feel a foreigner. He hides his eyes behind thick, dark aviators and his personality behind loud, angry music. He projects the ethos standardized across the disenfranchised American youth. Both of these are environmental and ontological struggles that must be endured rather than overcome. And while we all grow out of teenagerness into whole new insecurities, ethnic identity is as much the response of others as it is a projection of our own.[image][I mean, it will of course.]The third threat to Ichiro's comfortability in this world may be built of melodrama, but it fits the story well enough. Ichiro, by military accident, is fatherless. He wasn't abandoned so much as he was de-fathered. Remembering his father nearly only in dreams—a silent, almost ominous figure for much of the narrative—Ichiro is set at a heavy disadvantage so far as male influences go. While his dad (obviously enough) was world-friendly and adept enough at adapting to other cultures, Ichiro's grandfather Benny is characterized by the worst American ignorances. He's loud, boastful, and builds his interactions with the world off bias and presupposition. And so, Ichiro threatens to follow suit. Ichiro, at story's beginning, is a lost boy—and the storm into which he will soon be drawn doesn't promise to make finding his way any more likely. At best, Ichiro may discover himself better able to orient along his life's current, but he will only ever be carried where the rivers of fate will move him.[image]While Inzana sets Ichiro in the midst of a shaken, uncertain world, the author quickly moves him into much more disorienting worlds. If New York didn't understand him, at least he somewhat understood it. Or at least his place in it. Japan is quite another animal and beyond a presentable-though-obviously-foreign use of the language, Ichiro is a fish out of water. A fish out of water out of water. He vastly prefers America and holds onto the national arrogance that his Grandpa Benny built into the lens of Ichiro's foreign policy. Still, living with his Japanese grandfather will only serve to cause further disorientation, further disillusionment—though with his Asian grandfather's help, Ichiro may come to recognize that this kind of alienation from expectation is actually the common human experience throughout life. Perhaps his mother and both grandfathers are continually experiencing this at-odds-with-the-world experience as well. And maybe it's the way you deal with the fear that these experiences create—maybe it's your reaction that will prove what kind of a person you have been raised to be.[image][Mostly because we didn't see them as human. We were not great people.Ichiro's grandfather is way more charitable than me.]Ichiro can be a powerful, thoughtful work—an evaluation of what it means to be a human trapped by the arbitrary structures inherited by the capriciousness of birth. Male or female? Rich or poor? Red or yellow, black or white? American? Japanese? Ugandan? How are we responsible for the state into which we are born? Ichiro, among its other conceits (for instance, a decent story with well-crafted art), can give us a framework by which to better evaluate the existence we have been pushed into. It's not the path of victors, but it proposes something better than living as one of the conquered.____________________NoteI hadn't mentioned it, but a good portion of Ichiro—perhaps a full third of the book—takes place in a world of myth and magic reflecting traditional Japanese creation legends. Ichiro is drawn into this mythic world as much by his own volition as he was when when born into our own. It was not by his choice and he is as much at the mercy of that foreign environment as we each are of our own worlds. Ichiro's time in that fantasy realm seems to function primarily as a filter through which to understand his real-world struggles. It's a parable of sorts, and more or less works. As with Miyabe's Brave Story, I preferred the real-world side of the story to the myth-world side, but I do appreciate Inzana's purpose.[image]NOte: Word balloons in pale yellow-green are in Japanese. In white are English.____________________Other NoteI'd seen several ers describe Ichiro as manga. The appellation is baffling to me, no matter what sense you choose to honour for the term manga.• If manga means ""Japanese comics,"" it is unsuitable here, for Inzana is American.• If manga is meant to refer to a certain genre of comics, then it also seems an inane description as it follows none of the stylistic tics commonly associated by Americans as being hallmarks of ""manga""—big eyes, speedlines, chibi versions of characters, sweatdrops on the backs of heads, and interminable fights punctuated more often by inner monologue than by actual action. Visually, Ichiro is composed in a manner very consistent with Western comics culture—save for when Inzana homages traditional Japanese arts. In fact, his work looks reminiscent of that of GB Tran.3• If manga simply means ""comics,"" as it does in Japan, then the appellation is worthless in an English context because our word for comics is comics.It's possible (i.e. likely) that ers' use of manga to describe Inzana's book is a serendipitous intersection between 1) the narrative state of alienation that Ichiro experiences and 2) a similar state which Inzana himself almost certainly experiences to greater or lesser degree (cf. Gene Luen Yang's American Born Chinese). So I guess, in some sense, we can cheer the awkwardness created as an object lesson in support of Inzana's work.____________________Footnotes1) It may be slightly presumptuous to describe this book in terms of YA lit, as I haven't seen that taxonomy prescribed elsewhere. The jacket and indicia give no clue to how it should be catalogued. I only lean toward YA because the protagonist is a young teen and is fraught with young teen concerns. Ichiro, like all good YA lit, can be enjoyed by adults as well as young adults.2) Ichiro's father is at least a portion Westerner as Ichiro's grandfather, Benny, appears to be the typically ethnocentric Caucasian American. Although... the art is unclear as to whether Benny is Anglo, Italian, Jewish or of any other nationality.

Even with series that are well on their way and have gone some length toward establishing themselves, talking about first volumes isn't always easy. Some of my favourite books are marred by less-than-stellar, less-than-representative first volumes. Fables' initial story had me convinced the series was very much not my thing (though it later turned out to be very much my thing). Usagi Yojimbo, for all its storied perfections, boasts a first volume that is clearly evidence of a creator trying to figure out just what it is he wants to do with his character (and even shows that he's still learning how to draw his protagonist). Cerebus's first volume is so lackluster that I haven't yet taken the time to explore any of the much-praised later stories in the series. And each of these stories' initial volume can be contextualized within the scope of the rest of the work. And while Neil Gaiman's first volume of Sandman, ""Preludes and Nocturnes,"" ends on a high note, it stumbles substantially in its earliest chapters.It's so much more difficult for books that only yet exist as a single, introductory volume.Take Scarlet for example. Author Brian Michael Bendis almost certainly has some large story planned for his new character, but in the five chapters collected in this single volume, it's impossible to tell whether that story will be any good or not. And it's not even as if this should be any sort of surprise. Most good story-driven manga series (e.g. 20th Century Boys or Death Note) take a couple volumes to win me over—and American collections of manga typically have ten chapters per volume. Translate that dynamic to the American scene (where collections typically have around six chapters per volume) and I'd perhaps be expected to know whether I'm interested in a story after three or four volumes. And that's pretty rough on these series.1So when I pick up the first volume of a newer series like Scarlet, it shouldn't surprise you that I really won't know what to make of it. I'm trying to think of a series whose first volume made me sit up and think, Wow, I need to read the next collection from this. I have to see where this is going! Maybe Bride's Story. Maybe Powers back in the day? Stray Bullets, Bone, Yotsuba&!, and probably a small handful of others. In any case, Scarlet is not one of these. I'm curious to see where Bendis goes with it, but not that curious. My hope is that his further work on the book will redeem volume one and that as part of the whole, it will present a seamless and wonderful story. [image]It's not as if it's in any way bad—more just that this first volume of Scarlet doesn't give much of a sense of whether this book will be worthwhile or not. Quite possibly the only way to properly judge the book is to find out how it ends. It's one of those—one of those books that will stand as a kind of political statement in one way or another.Scarlet circles the drain of the question Just what the heck are we supposed to do with all the police corruption that is all over YouTube and Reddit, like, every day? The titular Scarlet, a young twenty-something Portland native, has her own solution and it is violent. And maybe even revolutionary. For reasons this volume lays out pretty early on, Scarlet has taken to executing corrupt cops. Bendis may keep things on that path or—and it seems this might be his tack—take things to other whole levels Tyler Durden–style. We'll just have to wait to see.[image]And that is why it's so hard to figure out what this series is going to be. Good? Bad? Trite? Revolutionary? Cliche? If Bendis goes full-blown political and tries to say something with the book, we'll have to wait for that thing to be said before we can judge how well he said it. It's entirely possible that he's only using the veneer of the political to give a fascinating backdrop to a straightforward story of revenge or psychosis or—who knows?—science fiction. And if he holds the fort down competently, it won't be until everything works out that we'll be able to judge whether his straightforward whatever-this-is completes admirably or otherwise.I guess the point is: whatever Bendis intends to do with the title in the future, he is so far holding down the fort. Scarlet is thus far neither spectacular nor failure. Bendis' writing is about what one might expect from one of his books. Scarlet is written in his signature style, self-referential, somewhat witty, somewhat approximating natural speech patterns, and flipping in and out of linear narrative. Maleev's art is again what fans will expect. In terms of evolution from his tenure working with Bendis on Daredevil (what, ten years ago?), I'm sure there's some growth but it's not obvious at a glance. If you liked him on Daredevil, you very well may like him on Scarlet. The style's pretty much the same use of drawn-over-and-shopped live actors. It doesn't work for every book, but I think it might be fine here.[image]See, the art's cool until you get to everyday things like conversations. These will almost always look uncanny valley kinds of weird.Beyond the probably unhelpful wait-and-see critique, the one thing that bothered me was Scarlet's ""costume"" on the volume's cover and on several chapter covers. She sports what looks like an impractical leather, zipper-fronted bandeau with a patched X on one breast and a patched O on the other.2 Scarlet never wears any approximation of this outfit throughout the book, so I'm not sure of their prominence on the covers. I will be perfectly happy if Scarlet never adopts a uniform for her business—as the whole idea of a costume in this situation seems a little silly—but it seems as if the creative team may be angling toward this direction. It's a silly kind of costume and I would prefer it remain only on covers—actually, it may serve as some interesting sort of commentary if it only appears on the covers.[image]Notes1. Actually, it's for this precise reason that I generally wait 'til four or five volumes of a series are released before I begin pursuing it. That gives me a better chance of more accurately judging a book and it gives opportunity for word of mouth to build on whether a series is worthwhile or not.2. In truth, they may not be patches. Maybe it's that craft-lovers' coloured duct tape? Maybe they're band-aids? Who knows?

Its armory storehouse is not filled with inconsequentialities but with the things that stick—with barbs and teeth and talons more often than not. Certainly memory can be a rewarder, but only capriciously so. [image]Do I remember my first kiss? I do. But not in the fidelity of colour and texture and temperature and tone that such a moment should deserve. Do I remember where things went wrong with that girl, so long ago? I do. And often in tantalizing, horrible detail. Do I remember where things went wrong with the next girl and the next? I do and I do. Scars, as it turns out, are more indelible than comfortable massages.Do I remember when my daughter was born? A little. More that it happened and that I was there than any sense of real presence. Do I remember my son being born? Not really. But I do remember, vividly, the first time my daughter fell down a flight of stairs, when she had a terrifying experience with croup, when she hit her head hard and stopped breathing. I do remember saving her with a split-second to spare from a rogue tide shift when she was only one. The things that break your heart are the things that build you for they are the things that remain strongest in your memory.And if memory has one single weapon with which it eviscerates the soul more gleefully, heartlessly, and permanently, that tool of destruction is surely regret. And it is against that particular blade that Jack Joseph struggles. He may not yet have put a name to the thing that is killing him, destroying his life, and leaving his personal society and civilization a derelict wasteland—but a deep regret (and its companion sense of guilt) is Jack's enemy, whether subconscious or not.[image]Jeff Lemire, as he has in Essex County, continues to explore the lives of broken people—people to whom life's treacherous circumstances have paid particular attention. In exploring Joseph's life, times, and other times, Lemire uses a mix of pages defined either by the strict and straightforward promise of black-and-white, cut-and-dried art or by dreamy, less-defined and less-defining water-diluted ink washes. The stark positives and negatives of the former are the ground on which The Underwater Welder's present day unfolds. This reality seems unshakeable and intentionally closed to interpretation and reinterpretation. The hazy, low-contrast mist that colludes with Lemire's usually strong-lined art is used strictly1 in narrative sections that cross the boundaries of the real, whether through memories or through imagination or through the imposition of some sort of world of magic and mystery that runs parallel our own. It's a good visual trick and works very well for a story that skips through all sorts of versions of What Is And Was.Through his visual storytelling Lemire has crafted a pretty wonderful tale of how the mistakes of the past, even when forgotten, can rule the choices of the present. Jack, the titular welder, is governed (almost maniacally so) by the ghost of decisions made as a child. Decisions that, while certainly selfish and childish, would hold outcomes impossible to predict. These are the kinds of choices that none of us should feel guilt over, but rationality and memory have never held any tenderness toward each other. We live our lives feeling responsible for things beyond our control (and inexplicably feeling not-culpable for a host of things we ought to feel responsible for—a topic for another story perhaps). We are confused souls and far more delicate than we usually prefer to recognize—and as Lemire explores, we are not that super at dealing with the wounds that memory not only leaves to visibly scar but tends also to draw to our attentions.[image]And at this point, I will discuss the ending, so if you wish for a spoiler-free experience of The Underwater Welder, please skip down to the Production Notes section below.Initially, I was disappointed in Lemire's conclusion to Jack's struggle with regret. It seemed too crisp, too easy, too pat. Unlike the rest of us, Jack was granted instant catharsis, a magical moment unearned and unendured. He gets what he wanted, an impossible forgiveness. And while it makes for exciting storytelling, it felt to me too hollow. I wanted a story that reflects my experience with the beast, with memory. I wanted to see what Lemire had to say as a reasonable, thinking artist of great works about how a man weighed down under the bondage of regret might resolve his struggle. And in the end, it seemed, his entire solution was that there is no solution save for the miraculous. I felt cheated in that Jack's story no longer bore any resemblance to our own stories—for the wronged dead do not rise to offer their unmerited forgiveness. [image]But then, I thought more about Lemire's ending and I thought that I perhaps got it wrong at first. That Jack's conclusion remains steadfastly a variety of grey washes prompts the reader to wonder whether Jack has had his instant catharsis after all. If he never does actually return to the real world, the reader is opened up to all kinds of interpretive joys. Did Jack die and the magic of his ending is some sort of afterlife healing? Did Jack somehow travel into a parallel existence—and remain, as that place would be his only chance for happiness and safety from his memories? This second look at The Underwater Welder's conclusion leaves a more satisfying taste. It feels less a cheat and more an acknowledgement of the brutality of regret. In that reading, Lemire doesn't answer any questions so much as he points out how unanswerable those questions would be.And that is good enough for me.Production NotesWhile The Underwater Welder is a solid project, both beautifully drawn and written, there is some evidence of rushed production that slightly mars an otherwise wonderful work. There are, for instance, strange interruptions of obviously computer-created graphics into what are meant to look like traditional-media pages—and not just the annoyance of the book's occasional digital fonting for signs. As awkward as that always looks, I'm referring to digital artistic elements, such as the low-res leg, ear, and blanket/gown that occupy the foreground of page 218.  [image]And whenever there is a smoke-like trail obscuring the background, it looks as if it were drawn with a mouse. Examples of this can be found on page 9 (as well as throughout) both in the cigarette smoke of panel 3 and in the trail of radio words snaking up the page. [image]A lesser offense is that Lemire seems to have pretty small stock of word balloons (possibly even just one for dialogue and one for narration). He uses the same balloons throughout, only stretching them and rotating them as panels require it. It's not terrible and at least they seem to be vectored and well built to withstand the push-and-pull of resizing, but again, it makes it seem as if the project was rushed. Which is a pity when one considers how powerful Lemire's art can be.[image][These three word balloons feature the same art. The lower two have the same orientation but one is stretched vertically. The upper one is rotated. Sometimes they'll be mirrored, rotated, and stretched. Lemire gets creative, but I kind of wish he just drew each balloon.]Another issue is textual and should have, I think, been caught by an editor. On page 99, Jack narrates that he is the same age his dad was when Jack was born. On pages 164 and 191, Jack narrates that he is the same age as his dad was when his dad disappeared (his dad having disappeared when Jack was around ten). The conflict is obvious and could be read as a clue that Jack's grip on memory and reality are not firm, but as there don't seem to be other clues (so far as I noticed—to be fair, I'm not sometimes the most attentive reader) to direct us toward that line of thought, it seems more likely to read this as an error. In which case, more evidence of unfortunately rushed production.Footnotes1. There is one notable exception to this (spoiler): (view spoiler)[In the finale, after Jack has his undersea reunion with his father, finds the watch, and is rescued, Lemire doesn't return to stark black-and-white but instead remains in ink-wash mode—which lends strongly to the idea that Jack hasn't actually returned to the real world. That he somehow remains in another world, in the perhaps-afterlife catharsis-land he entered when he abandoned his labouring wife to look for a watch.

She walks and talks and adventures around, but she doesn't yet read. She knows the sounds most letters make, but she's not yet stringing them together. She'll probably start reading in earnest in the next year or so. I've got big plans for her, all the books and games and things that I love that I hope to share with her. Plan is loosely and perhaps injudiciously used here.Less than any well-thought-out schematic for her education in the pop-cultural ephemera that I enjoy along with a splinter of the real world's populace, I have a rough idea: throw awesome stuff at her in hopes that she'll find something she herself will enjoy. Something that fits the nook of her own individual tastes and circumstances. I can't pretend to know what that will be, but more than anything I want her to be able to experience all the wonderful things out there in an environment of safety and comfort—for as long as I'm able to provide that for her.[image]I'm not opposed to her encountering mature, complex works such as Habibi or Sailor Twain, but I think it would be reasonable to ramp her up to such literature by first introducing her to less-confusing visions of the female person. With that in mind, over the next few months and years, I'll be looking for books that don't portray femaleness as an indictment, a weakness, or a reason to be victimized.1 And honestly, apart from a handful of books, I can't immediately think of much that fits the bill. Leave It to Chance, even though Chance's father is clearly sexist (it's a plot point)? Jeff Smith's Bone? Luke Pearson's Hildafolk? The works of Raina Telgameier? What else? I'm sure there's more. Nausicaä could work (especially as she already adores Howl's Moving Castle), but it might be a little harrowing for her in the next couple years. *sigh*At any rate I'm thankful, then, that Josh Tierney and his astonishing cadre of collaborators is putting forward Spera, the story of two very different princesses and the terrible, wonderful world they adventure in. It's not so far or properly speaking either a kid's book or even one of particular interest to females—save perhaps for the bald fact that it exists and may be friendly to both demographics. [image]Spera takes a note from some of the best adventure stories and seems to gleefully embrace a world with dark corners and dangerous tidings. For all its beauty, lives are at stake and not everybody gets to live happily ever after. It's the kind of story a kid could get behind—one that doesn't feel patronizing or pandering. It's a story that, ironically, takes off the kid gloves.2 Pira is a princess fleeing her own realm, abandoning a queen who is conquering and terrifying and merciless. She and her friend (?) Yonder, a fire-spirit most often taking the form of a great flaming dog, stop along their way to pick up a companion in the form of another princess. Lono's father, the king of her realm, has just been murdered by Pira's mother and their kingdom is fated to be put to the sword, so Pira's arrival and invitation to flee come with fortuitous timing. The three journey through mysterious lands to find a fabled land of peace and plenty, Spera.One of Spera's successes (in my eyes at least) is that it doesn't posit a single type of female character as being valuable. Too often, I think, authors tired of the cliches that for too long riddled the expression of female character in adventure fiction embrace a second (though reactive) cliche. As exhausted as the shrinking violet/distressed damsel has been for ages now, coming in close on its heels is the rough-and-tumble, hyper-capable, rash-decision-making girl-power girl. I'm sure that at one point, the character was somewhere in the neighbourhood of fresh, but that hasn't been the case for decades at the least.[image]So when Spera posits Pira and Lono as dual protagonists, I hold out hope for the story. True, Lono does seem at times to be something near the hesitant, dainty princess, and Pira cuts a quick figure for the badass tough girl; but as the story goes, it seems that they will be less of these things and more simply just capable foils for each other as they grow during the story's unfolding. At least, this is my hope.Spera is truly an all-ages book in that—though pretty simple so far—it can appeal to kiddies and grown ups too-oo-oo.3 And though this is the case, I'm mostly interested to see how my daughter takes to it. It's built around the ideas of adventure and loyalty—and maybe around the idea that loyalty is an adventure. There're swords and monsters and spirits and dark woods and hidden caves. No princes so far. Both princesses show themselves well and truly capable, albeit in entirely different ways. And even Lono, who is not naturally brave, shows herself to have a courage that rivals Pira's (after all, the naturally frightened must exercise far more bravery to do the things that come easy to the naturally courageous). It's only the first volume and hard to tell where Tierney is going to take his story, but so far, everything seems relatively light (as light as a story about fleeing a murderous queen could be).[image]One of the coolest features of Spera also turns out to be one of its biggest negatives. (Though for all that, not so big a negative.) Tierney, in order to convey his story, enlists an entire armory's worth of artists, each one taking on a chapter. Flipping through before sitting down to read, I immediately recognized Luke Pearson (of Hildafolk) and Emily Carroll (of His Face All Red), but for the most part, Spera was my introduction to a number of talented artists. The problem, beyond the discrepancy in narrative tone that a rotation of artists necessarily causes, is that some of the creators employed were better illustrators than they were visual storytellers. Each contributor had interesting takes on the characters, but some had trouble conveying through their drawings what exactly was occurring on the page. It's a common kind of problem with young illustrators, but while understandable and I can empathize, it does occasionally diminish the work.Still, these kinds of hiccoughs do not, in the end, supersede the value of Tierney's production and I'm excited to see where he'll take things in future volumes.[image] Note The organization of the book was a bit of a puzzle to me. The first four chapters are presented as The Story. These are followed by a section of short pieces that look like they are to be read simply as vignettes unrelated to the narrative flow. But (!) these stories really do end up carrying on the story and are sequential parts of the grander narrative strain and build off each other. That they should be presented as something separate was confusing to me as there doesn't appear any real reason for this. Maybe there is and I wasn't careful enough in my reading to catch it. A puzzlement.Notes1. It breaks my heart that there will one day be a very good reason for her to encounter these things in her fiction—that she might be better made capable to encounter them in the non-fiction that makes up her actual life.2. Kids, generally speaking, loathe kid gloves. The fastest way to prove you have no respect for a child is to shield them from all darkness. They might not realize right away that you're doing this, but sooner than later they'll catch on. And then they'll know what you think of them. And in that moment, they'll lose the tiniest amount of respect for you as well.3.

Even when the ultimate product of one's creative exercise is by most standards a failure, the mere fact of the creator's attempt to forge a virgin path instills their resultant work with something magical. So much of what we encounter in our common experience of the literary world is—despite well-fashioned pretenses otherwise—regurgitated formula. This isn't so much a bad thing as it is merely a description of The Way Things Are. There's a reason Robert McKee's Story is a popular introduction to writing stories that people will want to read: we, as a people, prefer for our books and films to play out in ways that are familiar, worn, and true. Whether in narrative or in style or in form, straying from best practice (i.e. the way everyone else does it) is a facile means to lose an audience. It takes a reader a special kind of patience or motivation to get past textual idiosyncrasies. When one first encounters Cormac McCarthy's taste for absconding with punctuation, there will be an almost instant evaluation: Is the praise this author has so far garnered enough to override my desire to read a book that seems to be making things more difficult for me for no evident reason? Many American readers, when confronted with the right-to-left reading format and some of the stylistic differences encountered in much of the manga imports1 over the last decade, have wholly dismissed entrants into the medium from Asian sources—the difference between what they expect from comics versus what they see on the surface in manga was too great and, in the end, alienated them. In gaming, the recent Dear Esther has polarized gamers over how little agency the game (some would prefer game to be in scare-quotes) offers the player—to the point that it's common to hear people describe Dear Esther as a walking simulator. In common amongst these examples is the distance between expectation and reality. When someone picks up a post-apocalyptic novel like The Road, they're generally ready for some dour survivalist melancholy but they're likely not expecting that dialogue won't be set off with quotation marks. When an American comics reader picks up something like Naruto or Death Note or (egads) Twin Spica for the first time, they're going to be surprised and confused and unfamiliar with stylistic tics, visual cues, and the decompression of narrative. When a Call of Duty player picks up Dear Esther, they're likely to wonder why a WASD game never really requires A, S, or D. These innovations or differences can be charming and wonderful and open new worlds to the willing. But at the same time, their alien nature may present an insurmountable obstacle for the majority of their potential audience. The fact is: it's much safer to craft a product that fits within the mold of expectation and relegate innovation and invention to the details. A reader who gets tricked into reading the same thing once more but is led to believe that the thing encountered is fresh and new—that reader will be a fan for life. It's not the kind of thing we discourage and we certainly can't blame either the authors or readers because it's not as if there's anything morally or aesthetically wrong with regurgitation. Entire species owe their lives to the concept.Still, despite the difficulty that experimentation poses for the average reader (and I include myself in this number), I think it's important that we praise the innovative spirit. When Murakami writes a good chunk of After Dark in the plural first person and present tense, I think we may owe it to him to see if it works—and if not, see if we can take any lessons from his failure (if he indeed failed). When Bolaño writes an obnoxious litany reporting the rape and murder of woman after woman over the space of hundreds of pages of 2666, even if we don't appreciate his work and maybe think his point wasn't worth quite so many words, we have to respect the effort.And that's why, even though I don't count One Soul as a particularly successful experiment, I do value both what author Ray Fawkes set out to accomplish and what he in actuality accomplished.As a concept, One Soul is entirely fascinating. The book presents an eighteen-panel grid, with each grid spread over two pages. Each panel represents one of eighteen lives and follows each from birth to death. So a reader can just read panel 5 on every pair of pages to take in the whole life of a Chinese woman born into the medieval silk trade or follow panel 13 through to see the life of an American slave unfold. This isn't the recommended method of taking in the book, but it's possible (and may make keeping track of stories a bit easier).  [image][This demonstrates how the 18-panel grid looks early on.Click for larger.]If that formal experimentation weren't high-concept enough, Fawkes adds a bit of narrative invention as well. One Soul is literally about a single human spirit, passing from one life into the next in some form of reincarnation.2 Fawkes begins his book with the birth of all eighteen of his protagonists in each of their individual eras and contexts. As the book progresses, he keeps all his characters at roughly the same age so that when we're seeing the freshly post-adolescent shepherd struggle with homosexual leanings, we're also seeing the freshly post-adolescent Parisian dancer hundreds of years later. Because the lifespan of individuals differs due time and circumstance, some lives end while others continue on. Fawkes blacks out the panels of the dead for the remainder of the work, though he will often continue those characters' voices through some sort of post-mortem rumination. This is a fantastic idea and really sells the potential reader on the idea that eighteen disparate life experiences really could have a profound and wonderful story to tell. And they may—though I'm not sure they quite do in this particular book.  [image][This demonstrates how the 18-panel grid looks after some lives have ended.Click for larger.]While Fawkes' concept is invigourating, a couple things stand in the way of him selling it as well as it does on paper. With a single panel out of every two pages being devoted to each person, the book at most offers only seventy-five panels in which to come to care about an individual's life and story. In some cases, the number of panels is far less than seventy-five—the shortest life is snuffed in less than twenty-five panels. It's not enough. And I can't tell whether the blame lies in Fawkes as a writer or in the slim page count, though Fawkes would have to be a phenomenal author to make it work in so little space. Throughout the book, I was never drawn into the characters or their circumstance. I was never tempted to empathize. While reading, I found myself only excited (and I use excited very loosely here) to discover which protagonist would be extinguished next and what would be the manner of their demise. Not exactly the ideal manner to approach a serious work about the human soul.Beyond the distance I felt from each protagonist, Fawkes eschews (I think wisely) character dialogue and instead employs a kind of reminiscence-narration, presumably from the One Soul. It's fragmented and nearly free-verse poetic (or maybe not even ""nearly"") and served, unfortunately, to distance me further still from the characters and their plights. It often reads as overly dramatic and self-involved. The voice of the soul wasn't (to me) particularly interesting. Further, the presence of the narration combined with the book giving away in its title the reincarnative aspect kind of saboutages some of the more violent wrestlings with forgoing theism for atheism. Several of the characters shake their fist at the heavens and seek solace in raw materialism, but any power to be read into their lives' decisions is muted in that the narrator flatly dismisses materialism by its overt celebration of the eternality of the soul. Maybe this was intentional, but it didn't feel like it was.[image]One Soul does have things to recommend it, of course. The concept, as mentioned, is brilliant. There are textual moments that overlap particular lives perfectly. And though I didn't find Fawkes to be yet a talented enough illustrator to make the project sing, there are several visual moments that are very well chosen. (The project appears to be very personal, so some level of awkward art is acceptable. I don't require every book to exhibit master draughtsmanship like a Jiro Taniguchi or Craig Thompson.)Unfortunately, at the end of the day, I didn't find these small recommendations enough to win me over. I adore Fawkes' idea and wish he'd either had the page count to make it what it could have been or proposed the experiment to a creator better suited to bringing his dream into this world. I would love to see others carry his idea into better forged realms, but I'm afraid that any creator who used the conceit in the future would invite accusations of ripping Fawkes off One Soul. Such a good idea—and I'm torn between rewarding it for how high it aimed or punishing it for failing its shot. I think this is an important book to read that isn't very good. It's important because it gives a hint to the vastness of the medium's potential. But while it demonstrates a glancing view of what it might have been, it really only shows What Might Have Been.Notes1. I do realize that manga shouldn't actually be considered experimentation. I only mention it and its dismissal by many American comics enthusiasts to bolster the argument that when confronted with product that lies outside the realm of expectation, the reaction is often negative.2. I'm unaware of whether Fawkes is employing any particular religion's version of reincarnation or simply positing a layman's understanding of the popular notion of rebirth._____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,not set,"Sep 12, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10942340-one-soul

They've got a lot going against them. Exactly half of the linguistic repertoire being forbidden, Silent comics are really difficult to pull off well. They've got a lot going against them. Exactly half of the linguistic repertoire being forbidden, the creator is forced to rely wholly upon visual language for all exposition. When characters cannot exposit their own motives to the reader, they must rely on illustrated cues to make their purposes, intents, reasons, and passions both knowable and then known. And as difficult as that sounds, the requirement upon the artist of these characters is phenomenal. Not only does the artist have to reliably draw characters recognizably and convey story through panel-to-panel storytelling transitions (as is the case even in comics featuring dialogue and narration), but beyond this, the artist must be able to convey all those burdens generally carried by the writer of words. Personality. Interaction. Interrogative. Exclamation. Thought. Emotion. Reaction. Success in these tasks takes the hand of a master.Silent comics are really difficult to pull off well. So it shouldn't surprise or disappoint us to discover that Ricardo Delgado's Age of Reptiles doesn't find a good pace until its final third. This is no slight against Delgado's abilities or craftsmanship. For the one, the silent comic is an incredibly difficult undertaking and I've rarely1 seen it accomplished well. For the other, he's telling stories in which his characters are dinosaurs, which compounds his storytelling issues expansively. And for the last, Delgado does end up succeeding—it just took him a while (understandably) to find his sea-legs. Delgado takes a high-concept comic fraught with potential but held back by its own experimentations and turns it into a masterpiece.[image]Age of Reptiles Omnibus, vol 1 is composed of the first three Age of Reptiles miniseries,2 each following the experiences of some dinosaur or other. Watching Delgado's evolution over these nearly two decades is a pretty wonderful experience. As he ages, one gets the sense that he becomes more and more comfortable with his production. What initially seems (for all its grandeur) forced soon becomes a thing of easy comfortability. His style, technique, and storytelling mature and the direction of his narrative becomes more profound as well.Delgado's first series, ""Tribal Warfare,"" features very detailed penwork. Every crease, crevice, and fold in his dinosaurs' skin is rendered in crisp black lines. Delgado's attention to detail is somewhat awe-striking, but generally (and despite a good sense of visual presence and doing a lot with negative space) the art in these pages feels exceptionally busy. It's possible that this line-heavy style could have worked with some of today's advanced colouring techniques, but Delgado was stuck with 1993's primitive colouring tools. Instead of softening his drawings' hard edge, his colours are garish and serve mostly to heighten the uncomfortability of his art. [image]Still, his3 choice here is fascinating. Where he (or colourist James Sinclair) could have made his dinosaurs from a palette of earthy tones—tans, greens, rusts, the occasional spark of a subtle blue—he puts forth a rainbowed array of reptiles. ""Tribal Warfare"" opens with a lime-green pteranodon whose neck is striped with vibrant white and blue and whose crest is bright yellow with a red-spotted pattern. As well, each wing features a large red spot like a Japanese Zero. There are much more colourful dinosaurs in store. The colouring was dissonant but it did make distinguishing different reptiles easier. Still, while I see what Delgado was aiming for and I think the choice both bold and imaginative, I don't think it ultimately helps so much as it could.On the positive side we do see Delgado occasionally insert broad vistas or well-positioned actors in ways that presage the wonderful scenes he would produce in the future. In fact, even in his earliest series, Delgado's ability to craft pages that impress is powerful.The second volume contained in this anthology, ""The Hunt,"" is a step in what looks like a better direction visually. Delgado's work is still incredibly detailed and he sometimes overwhelms his art with his lines, but his pen seems leaner, less heavy on the page. He's not quite there yet, but he's trying something different and that's good. As the book was published in 1997, comics colouring was undergoing a computer revolution. Artists hadn't quite evolved to the point they're at in the late Two-Thousand-Aughts (where colourists like Dave Stewart rule the roost with their phenomenal technique), but as with his linework, it's a step in a healthy direction. Delgado continues to favour wild colour variation for his dinosaurs—only now the transitions of colour on a single beast are less jagged and favour smooth gradients. Strangely, while I think this smoothing works pretty well on his landscapes, for the dinosaurs themselves I actually prefer the abruptness in the colour-design in the earlier work—after all, if you look at the stripes and splotches on a fish at your local pet store, you'll note that they don't gradually fade into the base colour of the fish.  [image][Click image to view larger]Where ""The Hunt"" really takes off is in Delgado giving greater reign to his penchant for one- and two-page spreads and to larger set pieces. The third chapter of ""The Hunt"" is especially compelling, as Delgado takes an excursis from the story of a lone allosaurus to follow several winged pterosaurs in an exciting dogfight. The chapter is filled with gorgeous skyscapes and some scenes of the flying reptiles that could have been cribbed from Miyazaki's Porco Rosso. It was a beautiful chapter and fit (along with chapter four) as a nice break from the less-exciting-though-titular hunt that comprises that volume's storyline.In the final installment of this omnibus, ""The Journey,"" Delgado seemingly rights all wrongs. Created twelve years after ""The Hunt,"" he's come to a design and illustration sense that is finally easy on the eyes, powerful in communication, and still adept at conveying the wonder of the earlier series' best moments. His style now resembles some happy hybrid between Guy Davis and Mike Mignola. His work is still incredibly detailed, but he shows a marvelous sense of restraint, allowing abstraction where needed. As well, there are moments such as a partially devoured anklyosaur floating in a river that are magnified by Delgado's talent with framing and negative space (I think it may have been this instance that put me most in mind of Mignola). What may be most jaw-droppng in ""The Journey"" is just how many dinosaurs Delgado draws on every page. His story calls for it for sure, but it's still a minor wonder to behold.   [image][Click image to view larger]Further, colouring for the book has come into its own at last. I'm not sure if the solution was bringing Jim Campbell on as colourist or if it was just a matter of Delgado witnessing the evolution of computer colouring over the intervening decade. Whatever the case, ""The Journey"" makes Age of Reptiles a beautiful book. The colours are muted and more in line with what a reader might expect from a book about dinosaurs. Delgado's reptiles still have distinctive markings but they aren't any longer gaudy, flamboyant party-goers. Bravo, whoever was responsible for the shift.Where ""The Journey"" also excels over the prior two series is in story. To illustrate, however, I'll have to complain about something central to the earlier two books.The reason, presumably, that Delgado chose to make Age of Reptiles a silent work is that dinosaurs are not people. They presumably have little facility for language and if they did and we could translate it, their way of conveying meaning might be so alien to us that we wouldn't understand anyway. My guess is that this book was made wordless in a bid for realism.4 It's a good idea if one can do it well— and by time ""The Journey"" arrives, Delgado is doing it well.[image]The problem, if realism is Delgado's reason for not verbalizing anything, is that the first two stories are built almost entirely on personification. ""Tribal Warfare"" features a grudge between a family of T-rexes and a family of utahraptors (I think they're utahraptors). The lead tyrannosaurus scares the raptors off their fresh, rightful kill and initiates a back-and-forth war of attrition that lasts four chapters and ends in all-out battle. It's a fine story but not a fine dinosaur story unless you want your dinosaurs fixed with embedded human motivation. ""The Hunt"" follows a young allosaur as he flees from the murder of his mother by some wildly coloured raptors. Their pursuit of him lasts for what seems years. Long enough at least for him to grow to full-size. Both the raptors' dogged pursuit of the allosaur despite there being far more docile game everywhere and the allosaur's plan to revenge himself against them left me incredulous. I couldn't be sure why Delgado didn't just give these animals voices if he was going to give them human motivation.[image]""The Journey"" solves this problem in two ways. The first is that Delgado gives no opportunity for these reptiles to act in any way other than as the animals they are. The other is that ""The Journey"" is not the story of a dinosaur protagonist but instead the story of a massive migration. I'm reminded of Planet Earth's segment on the migration in Africa toward the Okavango Delta. Delgado depicts a collection of herbivore dinosaur herds moving from arid lands toward a lush forest. Their way is perilous and they are followed closely and picked at by predators. If there is a protagonist at all, it is the combined herd, striving forward while being winnowed and whittled. It's magnificent and I'm so very glad that Delgado chose this direction for the third series. While ""Tribal Warfare"" and ""The Hunt"" are each forgettable, ""The Journey"" makes me curious if there will be a fourth series. I will read it if there is, because Ricardo Delgado has improved that much.Notes1. Off the top of my head, I can't actually think of any stellar examples beyond Shaun Tan's The Arrival.2. This volume contains three Age of Reptiles stories: ""Tribal Warfare,"" ""The Hunt,"" and ""The Journey."" (Published in 1993, 1997, and 2010, respectively.)3. I say ""his"" here, but it's entirely possible that these choices belonged to colourist James Sinclair, who colours both ""Tribal Warfare"" and ""The Hunt."" Still, I have a hard time believing that Delgado didn't at least direct Sinclair's choices by laying out a house style.4. Interestingly, Delgado doesn't even use onomatopoeia. No sound effects. No grunts or growls or moans. This, I think, is a great idea. Too often, creators will personify their creatures through clever use of animal noises that stand in for human intonation. A dog that looks quizically and says: ""ARF?"" Question mark included. Any sense that this is a real dog is shattered the moment he says ARF with a question mark attached._____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Aug 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10171411-age-of-reptiles-omnibus-vol-1

Over time, the old legends evolve from being terrible and terrifying to existing as pacified gentilities. As the world is industrialized (and more, technologized), our fear of the fantastic is replaced by something more civilized. We've traded the savage for the banal. And certainly, some of us prefer the latter to the former. Because fearing fantasies is distasteful to a society that is smarter than that, we make our monsters into men and our men into monsters. And as much as we gain for the transformation of our cultural lore, we do lose something in the process.Disney, for its part in revitalizing the traditional lore of Western civilization, has robbed nearly every legend in its stable of its teeth. Sleeping Beauty, Pinocchio, Snow White, Rapunzel, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Robin Hood, and The Jungle Book. Each of these have been sanitized for the consumption of post-19th-century audiences for whom the production company believes the raw source to be too stark, too grim, too violent, or too sexy. In some cases, the inoculation of these stories from more disturbing elements distances the Disney films so far from source that it becomes difficult to even posit the one as adaption of the other.The great (and deserved) popularity of Disney's 1989 adaptation of The Little Mermaid certainly defanged Hans Christian Anderson's story, but more: the Disney company's vision of mermaids all but obliterated societal consciousness of what mermaids used to be.1 Today, the mermaid is a creature of whimsy and delight—a creature who falls in love with humans and goes to lengths to win true to that romance. The end of the matter is that today, categorically, mermaids are not monsters.And in a way, this is too bad.As much as there is no reason that the myths of a former culture shouldn't be reappropriated, subverted, and recast to communicate something relevant to succeeding cultures, it can be worthwhile to retain at least a historical appreciation for the things that have been said previously. So as much as mermaids today are Not Monsters and Not Dangerous, it can be refreshing to rediscover an era in which they were.[image][Any sensible person would at exactly this point turn right around.       On the other hand: boobs.]For centuries, mermaids were known as creatures of havoc—happy to destroy the lives of sailors. Long linked to the sirens of Greek myth, the sociological purpose of their legend seemed to have been pedagogical, speaking to the danger of the seductress. Mermaids would use their allurements (both in voice and body) to draw sailors to a death of submergement. They represent the futility of the male passion in that their upper torsos (what would be visible above the waves) picture the truest and most desirable physical beauty, while the body existing below the waist offers no culmination to the male romantic expression.2 Doomed loves, doomed lives. And refreshingly, it is this kind of mermaid lore that Mark Siegel explores in his long-awaited3 graphic novel, Sailor Twain: Or the Mermaid in the Hudson.Sailor Twain is a triumph of collaboration. Lore, history, mood, social ethics, and romance swirl together, weaving a thing of ominous beauty. The mermaids' contemporary myth is subverted in the book's reclamation of the antique myth. In telling the tale of Captain Elijah Twain, Siegel skates through and about a world pitting loyalty against lust, where temptation holds court and the verdict is yet to be decided. This is a story about sex, about desire, and about how dangerous these things can be when directed without discretion. In a way, the book offers a moral as quaint as the lore with which it concerns itself—though even this moral is twisted in deliciously challenging ways as happily-ever-after careens drunkenly from comfortable expectation. Siegel raises delicious questions to challenge our presuppositions through a story illustrated and written with obvious care.Siegel's narrative concerns Elijah Twain, charged with the captaincy of the Hudson river steamboat Lorelei. It's 1887 and Twain (no relation to the author, who wasn't really named that anyway) is a man of strict personal governance, bound by his morals, his promises, and his watch. One evening, he discovers crawling onto his deck a wounded mermaid, a victim of a harpoon. Her name means South and he cares for her injuries; things both ravel and unravel from the beginning of his stewardship of her.[image]I'm not certain if I prefer Siegel the writer or Siegel the artist. The book in its sheer physicality is a joy to encounter. It's well-bound, has a nice mermaid embossed on its cover, and contains gorgeous art. Siegel's art is cartoony but expressive, reminiscent (to me at least) of some of the European comics I've encountered over the years and nearly the entire thing is composed in charcoals, giving the book a melancholy softness. In Sailor Twain's panoply of greys, the reader will find herself suffused in an exotic romance of dueling shadows. But for all that, it may be that Siegel's non-visual storytelling is still more impressive.It's clear that Siegel has put plenty of research into this book, from the requisite study of lore to investigations into the Hudson's historical environs. Beyond that though, it's his use of literary device that wins my heart. While Twain is tempted by the sea-born siren, whose physiognomy renders her impossible for romantic liaison, his own wife of seven years (Pearl) is crippled below the waist and is known especially for a singing voice gifted from the Divine himself. It is unclear whether Pearl's condition renders her incapable of sexual alliance, but Siegel almost certainly has this juxtaposition between South and Pearl in mind. When Twain asks his wife if they are a couple of cold fish, the reader is on alert and winking back at Siegel—and again on the next page when Twain asks Pearl if she's ready for the next day and she responds ""A few scales and I will be."" The captain is torn between the mermaid he rescued and the siren whom he married, neither of whom will give him satisfaction. And it's in the midst of this that Siegel's story finds its sinew, bone, and life's blood.[image][Whoops. Instamuse.]In all honesty, I found Sailor Twain breathtaking. I was predisposed to like it but I didn't expect to find it as beautiful and haunting4 as it is. Siegel's book will certainly find itself in my Top Ten for the year and is now entrenched in that collection of comics works that I consider Essential Reading for those interested in charting the medium. I will almost certainly be recommending this to scads of friends.Note to ParentsIf it's the kind of thing to concern you, the mermaid (as mermaids ought to be) is entirely topless for the book's length. That is to say: there is a half-nude woman on roughly a quarter of Sailor Twain's nearly 400 pages. It's important to the narrative and true to the lore but will bother some parents of young readers. There is, as well, a smattering of sexuality and some murderous violence and death—but for one reason or another, it's the nudity that tends to catch attention so I thought I'd mention it, lest you sight-unseen order the fun mermaid book for eleven-year-old Johnny and add greater fuel to his immature perversions, sending him deep into the realms of mermaid fetishism. Or something.Also, the above images have been edited slightly to render South's nudity less distinct. Because fetishists.Footnotes1. All blame for the pacification of mermaid lore cannot be laid entirely at the 1989 movie's feet. All through the 20th century, mermaids had been moving toward something friendlier and more human. Disney's Peter Pan, for instance, softens J.M. Barrie's dangerous mermaids (who would have drowned Wendy had Peter not been vigilant) into something naughty rather than outright nasty. Also, my wife here interjects that the mermaid in Little Bear, for all we see of her, is a kindly soul. Even Anderson's original Little Mermaid (which included cutting out the mermaid's tongue, the mermaid contemplating murdering the prince in order to restore her mer-form, and the mermaid failing in her quest and being dissolved into sea foam) was a departure from the traditional lore and rendered the mermaid in softer tone than predecessors.It might be more fair to say, then, that the pacification of the mermaid was gradual and only culminated in Disney's 1989 adaptation.2. Certain expressions of the mermaid have sought to subvert this—notably, Starbucks' original mermaid icon, featuring a topless creature with two tails, spread as legs and inviting romantic consummation.[image]3. I actually first encountered Sailor Twain what feels like a long time ago when Siegel first began publishing pages as a webcomic. As I don't have the patience to return to a webcomic week after week to make incremental progress through its story, I promptly forgot that it existed—despite thinking it looked beautiful. When I discovered that it had been collected into a single hardback, I was excited and knew I had to see where Siegel went with things. I was, fair warning, predisposed to enjoy this book.4. I think probably 85% of all s of this work will find some way to use the word haunting to describe it. The others will use chilling._____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,37,1,not set,not set,"Aug 07, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13538702-sailor-twain

These moments are notable in that they trigger more cataclysmic events years later. And they are genuinely interesting because the true weight of their value cannot be discerned in the moment of their occurrence.[image]Naoki Urasawa's 20th Century Boys is a work founded on such moments. Part of Urasawa's thesis seems to be that while one can never tell what will result from his or her actions, it is also impossible to discern which actions will have far-reaching implications. What could bring about the end of the world? The Apollo moon landing? The 1970 World Expo held in Osaka? The destruction of a child's fort? A chance encounter? The theft of a trinket? The discovery of a haunted house? The playing of an obscure American rock song on a junior high school's PA system?20th Century Boys is a sprawling, complicated work. It's all over the place. Its plot spans from the Apollo moon landing of 1969 to the near-future of 2018. Its narrative bounces back and forth between a robust and ever-expanding cast of characters—even while skipping all over its own historical scope, sometimes through flashback and sometimes through a particular sci-fi conceit. Yet through it all, Urasawa never abandons his exploration of Today having been built on the bones of Yesterday.[image]For all his story's complexity, Urasawa is always certain to give the reader plenty of historical hooks to help us keep our bearings. References to cultural phenomena abound. From raw historical notes like the 1969 moon landing and the 1970 Expo to related cultural realities (such as the proliferation of salesmen hocking ""NASA-approved"" pens, foods, and other ephemera). Urasawa especially excels at noting pop cultural artifacts that boys of the '70s would have remembered: wrestling stars! manga! anime! These were every bit as essential to the cultural landscape of Urasawa's cast as the Atari, Wolverine, MUSCLE men, Transformers, and ""We Are the World"" were to my own. These things ground 20th Century Boys in a real world so that when things start going crazy, readers will at least have a foothold to rely upon before the ship begins to sickeningly sway.Principally, 20th Century Boys concerns a group of friends and how the club those friends formed as children in 1970 somehow laid seed for a cult that would try to take over the world. Twenty-five years later, a virus that causes the human body to expel its blood is released and the Friends cult may be responsible. Kenji, one of the two former leaders of the group recognizes that the virus and some other things line up with the Book of Prophecy he and his friends developed in their secret hideout. What was once a story of crude, cliche-ridden heroism has seemingly become a reality. It's up to Kenji to discover the identity of The Friend and stop his cult from destroying the world.Or something like that.[image]Urasawa does a good job of keeping the story from being about one thing for too long. He seems to have no interest in maintaining anything resembling a status quo and migrates from protagonist to protagonist with alacrity. Kenji's the hero, but sometimes its Otcho. Or Kanna. Or Chono or Kyoko or Father Nitani or Yoshitsuni or whoever else might fit the bill in the moment. 20th Century Boys is a true ensemble, not just of cast but of era and genre. I'd be tempted to say it can't make up its mind but for the fact that it seems so meticulously plotted. Small details from the first volumes show themselves to be essential in the later ones. The whole thing plays out as one exuberant thrillride and Urasawa rarely lets up.Beyond proving himself a masterful plotter, Urasawa does something rare in having his characters age. We see them as ten-year-olds, as teenagers, and at ages thirty-five, forty, fifty-five, and older. While most authors would want to keep their protagonists young, handsome, and beautiful, Urasawa lets them spend significant time in the form of raggled muffins. Their lives are hard and few age well. All of this, of course, plays well with one of Urasawa's themes: the question of growing up vs measuring responsibility vs and wondering if the games children play ever really end. For all its compulsively delivered thrill sequences and hell-yeah moments, 20th Century Boys can sell poignant pretty well when it wants to.[image]With the final volume of 20th Century Boys (vol. 22) releasing in September and the two-volume epilogue, 21st Century Boys, releasing in November and January, the hot question is going to be how well Urasawa wraps it all up. While volume 22 does tie up the main story fairly nicely, it does feel as though Urasawa is rushing a bit near the end. There remain a lot of questions regarding loose ends. It's an exciting climax and he tries to reward readers who stuck with him through a long and perhaps psychologically draining work. I'm not sure if dissatisfaction with the series' conclusion is why the second collection, 21st Century Boys was released, but those two volumes resolve a lot (though not all) of the remnant story- and character-points.[image]I'm grateful for the epilogue and found myself entirely satisfied with Urasawa's conclusion to the work. While it feels a touch weird to have the story linger on after its initial conclusion, Urasawa invests the follow-up with its own climax and takes the opportunity to further reward readers with answers that harken back to 20th Century Boys' first volumes. I can't wait to have Viz's English translation of these final three books on my shelf—I'm excited to be able to loan these out in my ongoing quest to evangelize friends to the merits of the comics medium.20th Century Boys is a fantastic story and Viz's production of the American release is stellar. They're handsome books with French flaps, good paper, and a satin feel. I highly recommend.Notes1. In one sense, this is much not the case. Since history is merely a collective parade of discreet moments, one leading seamlessly into another, it is impossible for one moment to be more important than the next—all moments are merely the product of all the moments that lead up to their occurrence. Bolaño puts it this way:""Mickey was not only irritating but ridiculous, with the particular ridiculousness of self-dramatizers and poor fools convinced they've been present at a decisive moment in history, when it's common knowledge that history, which is a simple whore, has no decisive moments but is a proliferation of instants, brief interludes that vie with one another in monstrousness.""_____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,44,1,not set,not set,"Aug 02, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4339836-20th-century-boys-volume-1

There is a wave of unhappiness directed at this slender day-in-the-life recountment of a teenage girl's struggle to grasp the cruelness of a world she is yet to be prepared to understand. People don't like it and are happy to talk about how little they care for O'Malley's artistic vision in this case.I generally like to reread books I've enjoyed every several years or so. (It's easier with comics than with prose fiction, obviously.) But with buckets of Lost-at-Sea-related negativity sloshing viscerally from one end of the internet to the other, my anticipation for the book began to wane. I chalked it up to my having first read the book in a vulnerable emotional state—despite not actually remembering what state I had been in when I had read Lost at Sea (but I mean, I had to be in some sort of unreasonable condition to have enjoyed so much a book that everyone seems to hate). I put off reading O'Malley's earlier work and contented myself with perusing the gradual release of new volumes of Scott Pilgrim. After a while, I wasn't even sure whether I had liked the book in the first place. Maybe I hadn't? Stupid book. Why did I even spend the money on it? So embarrassed that it was even taking up space on my shelf.[image](I'm not usually one to be driven by the opinion of others. Look, I still don't think Watchmen is among the greatest comics of all time.1 I read superhero books, manga, independents, and books from Europe. I'm not usually the kind to allow my enjoyment of a book to be coloured by any hue developed by someone else's tastes. But the lesson here is that even those vigilant against ad-populum persuasion will occasionally fall to the pressure of peers.)So here, thinking I needed to  something less than grand in order to keep up the illusion that I don't only  books that I think are good, I thought I'd reread Lost at Sea and garner myself a nice one- or two-star —the better to pad those woefully2 slim segments of the site. And here, in the reading of Lost at Sea is where my plan fell apart completely.Because this is a good book.Lost at Sea covers the space of three days and three nights—long enough to be stuck either in the belly of a whale or in the heart of the earth. Or in Raleigh's case, stuck in a car with three near-strangers, some kids from her high school whom she knew of but didn't quite know. She's just left the love of her young, young life3 behind in California where she was visiting him for the first time. (Internet relationships, ho!) She hugged him and left to go back home and then found a letter in her duffle and just fell apart. The pregnant potential of that letter sends Raleigh into a spiral of despair and doubt and questioning life and its meaning and everything.[image]And then she ends up, insanely enough, in the car of some road-tripping kids from her hometown in Canada. The reason for this is thin and stretched and implausible and exactly the way these things sometimes happen. At the end of the day, whether you call Lost at Sea a road-trip story or a coming-of-age/bildungsroman or something else—at its most basic and pared-down, Lost at Sea is a book about going home.I can't begin to suspect why those who write the book off as ""emo bullshit"" do so, nor would it be very much a fruitful endeavor to try. Everyone's got their reasons, their biases, their preconceived notions. Maybe mine are why I enjoyed the book.At any rate, the four kids dialogue in a cadence unknown in everyday teen conversation. While they speak in that arbitrary selection of rejoinders that don't really say much but fill up space nicely (though not unique to teens, this repartee was certainly a large part of my own teen years), their speech flits back and forth with a fluidity possible only by following a practiced script. It's fun, winsome, entertaining, and not remotely realistic. Lost at Sea, in this way, seems to have been the proving ground for Scott Pilgrim's later enjoyment of the dialogical style.[image]At the other end of the spectrum, Raleigh's narration is hyper-uncomical and over-earnest—and for that reason really does seem like it could be the work of a genuine teenager (who journals!). She says things like ""Soon we'll be home. We'll be home sweet home sweet home sweet home. And now I want to cry again."" And ""I get thoughts like: I look in the mirror and I don't belong there. I see myself and I look all wrong. Stephanie looks bold and bouncy and fresh and normal, and I look like something else. Too long, too stringy, too pasty, too squarish, kind of inhuman."" All that sounds dead-on like something a kid in high school might write if he or she were of the particular kind of disposition possessed by Raleigh.From that I guess you might be able to see where the ""too dang emo"" criticism comes from. From another perspective, however, we have Blankets' Craig Thompson saying that Lost at Sea ""captures the clumsiness, isolation, and aimlessness of adolescence."" So, whiny emo whininess or accurate portrayal of the teenage experience. Choose your own adventure.I enjoyed Lost at Sea for what I perceived to be a kind of fantastic (as in fantasy) verisimilitude, a portrait of what young life and young love look like. Even if Lost at Sea's version of those things is too magical to ever actually exist, the tone rings true. Raleigh's friends were my friends or maybe idealized versions of my friends. Their problems and reactions may be heightened, but the kernels are the same as mine were; the seeds from which their apocalypsis germinates are probably common to us all. Lost at Sea isn't as madcap as Scott Pilgrim. It's got its own rhythm—and taken from the right vantage and in the right mood, Raleigh's three-day pericope in the tapestry of life can spur a kind of thoughtfulness on which solid self-reflection might stand.[image]Plus, if you like cats, Lost at Sea has tons. Like, at least twenty cats.Notes1. Truth is, I think Watchmen is expertly crafted so far as formalism is concerned, but the book strikes me as ultimately soulless. Additionally, Alan Moore is often praised for applying a quasi-realistic (or at least a pessimistic) lens to the question of the superhero story. I will grant that he was one of the first to do so, but I'm not sure how novel the idea was—seeing as how the same framework had developed decades earlier in every other narrative medium. It's nice that someone finally thought to expand the scope of the genre, but the idea stopped being fresh by the 1950s at least, as the noir cinema drew its curtain closed.2. It’s actually ludicrous for me to say “woefully” here. In my opinion, the more three-star s I can give, the better. I like comics to be good; I don’t like them to be bad. I’m happy to be able to recommend a book as Good if it really is good. And I’m glad that there exist as many worthwhile books as I’ve been so far able to catalogue on this site.3. I know what you’re thinking, because I thought it too. Or at least I thought I should think it, which may be the same thing. Come on, Raleigh. You’re what, eighteen? It’s not like this is the end of the world. There are a million trillion fish in the sea and this guy was probably not even all that great. And what do you know about love and heartbreak anyway? You’re just a kid! And maybe we’re right to think that, but maybe we’re wrong too. After all, what the hell do we know about someone else’s heart? Maybe they’re different than we are and experience things differently than we do? After all, I can bet almost anything that I experience things differently than you do, so maybe I (and we) should just give poor Raleigh the benefit of the doubt and at least recognize that hurt is hurt is hurt, no matter how “real” that hurt is._____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,61,1,not set,not set,"Aug 02, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/564758.Lost_at_Sea

Thor and Odin and Loki and all the Asgardian menagerie seemed goofy and stilted, an artifact of an era of publishing when I imagined readers were happy to read corny BIF-BAM-POW comics. The Asgardians were garishly colourful and bizarrely spoke in a kind of false Elizabethan English. And worse: their adventures, from what I gathered, were far divorced from the mythological tales I had learned as a youth.It was Walt Simonson who turned Thor into a viable character for me. [image]In the mid-'80s, I happened across Simonson's Thor via some crossovers with Simonson's wife's own series, Power Pack, and Claremont's New Mutants. I picked up the relevant issues of The Mighty Thor in order to get the full story, and while those issues weren't necessarily enough to instantly win me over, they gave me a foothold into Simonson's vision of Thor.11 Five years later, in rereading Power Pack to feed a nostalgia for my juniour high days, I pulled out the one or two issues of Thor I owned and reread them as well. Though my portrait of Simonson's hero was drastically incomplete, I was intrigued. I then went ahead and picked up the rest of the series over several months (and visits to several comic shops). They were odd and exciting. I had a basic understanding of Thor's identity as Donald Blake and the fact that he would be returned to frail human form if he was separated from his hammer for too long. Simonson re-crafts the god of thunder right from the beginning of his run and almost immediately does away with Donald Blake, allowing Thor to be Thor for the duration of nearly fifty issues2 Beyond this trick allowing Simonson to focus on Thor's godhood, it also gives new readers an easier time of negotiating the character and his place in Marvel's mythology—primarily by eliminating the whole human swath of his (former) supporting cast. I mention this primarily to assure those who are unfamiliar with the hero outside his appearance in recent films that this omnibus edition of his adventures is as fine a place to start as any—if one is interested in reading the source material.3So then, the Omnibus.At 1192 pages, this collection is a behemoth of computer-coloured bombasticism. When it arrived in the mail, I showed it off around the office to people who had no interest in comics whatsoever. Universally, the reaction was of awe and interest. The production is really rather breath-taking to behold. Not only does the book weigh about eight pounds, but it's so very, very bright—the colours used are vibrant, and while markedly different from those originally used (more on this later), they stray far from the desaturated palettes that have governed so much comics production over the last decade. Simonson's Thor is an exciting, epic tale and Marvel's printing here never lets the reader forget that.[image]Simonson's writing is superb. The ideas that govern Marvel's Thor are from another era and not in-line with the sensibilities of contemporary audiences. Simonson defeats this problem perhaps effortlessly (at least it seems so) by giving all his characters overly dramatic monologues, which they happily trade back and forth as if in dialogue. Their language is ludicrously flowery and their verbal ticks would be clownish if it weren't for their identities as gods. Somehow all this over-writing works—the characters and their lives become fascinating and engaging, something worth the readers' time to pursue.One of the glories of Simonson's run on the book is that the whole thing (nearly) reads as a single story. While that sort of thing happens much more often post-AD 2000, in the mid-'80s, such a long-running arc was pretty rare. The first chapter of this omnibus begins with a great and shadowy figure slamming down a tremendous flaming ingot (made from an exploded galaxy) onto an anvil. The sound that ingot produces as it makes first contact with the anvil is an ominous onomatopoeia4 that echoes across the universe: ""DOOM!"" It's a famous image from the era and recurs throughout the work while this particular piece of Simonson's saga works itself out. From there, story after story spins out, each the natural result of what came before. With few exceptions (and they seem to be publisher-mandated annoyances), nothing within the work stands alone.[image]Simonson also shows a wonderful knack for story beats. His narratives skip all over the place, with a page devoted to one character followed by two devoted to another followed by a half-page devoted to a third before returning to the first and then introducing a fourth. I'd say it was staggering to consider how he keeps so many narrative balls in the air while maintaining such a crisp story pace, but nowadays it seems like any number of worthwhile manga that hit American shores do the same. As well, Simonson seems happy to deliver several kick-ass moments per chapter—from charges against unbeatable foes to noble self-sacrifices to remembrances of those sacrifices to laugh-inducing come-uppances. Simonson the writer delivers.But as much fun as Walt Simonson the writer is, it's probably Walt Simonson the artist who most viscerally turns Thor into a hero whose songs we want to learn. Simonson himself is on art chores for the first two-thirds of the book and when he bows out to keep strictly to the writing aspect, the book is poorer for the loss. It's not so much that Sal Buscema is a poor artist—it's more just that he's not Walt Simonson. (Simonson returns for the the big climax in the third-to-last chapter, and if that battle had been drawn by Buscema instead of Simonson, we'd be missing one of the greatest single chapters in comics history.) Simonson's art is rough and tumble, full of a kind of visual braggadocio. He makes these gods look as if they might actually be warriors. His design sense reveals a kind of dynamism that was largely missing from the era in which he worked (and isn't really apparent today either).[image]That I can unreservedly recommend this massive collection does not mean that there aren't issues with the work. After Buscema takes over on art, it seems like some of Simonson's writing spark wanes as well and I've always felt it difficult to be as invested in some of the latter stories. Another issue is due to a couple interruptive crossovers. In the aforementioned Power Pack crossover, the kids from Power Pack suddenly appear and are suddenly gone, and today's readers will probably have no idea who they are or what place they have in Thor's world. Even worse though, the primary McGuffin from Marvel's Secret Wars miniseries shows up having resurrected one of Thor's foes who had been killed earlier in the volume (the resurrection happens in another series and is not reproduced here). Later in the series, Thor gets shoehorned into participating in the X-Men event ""The Mutant Massacre."" And in another instance, occupying three bare panels, a costumed supervillain is unceremoniously murdered by a homeless person; it's part of the Scourge storyline running through Captain America's book at the time, but doesn't make any sense to readers without that kind of knowledge. These episodes are a shock to the system and a great argument against crossovers in the midst of ongoing stories. While the pagecount is already high, it would've been nice to have had some sort of explanation of these things—if this book is meant to be a kind of stand-alone omnibus.The last diminishment to the book is a bit awkward: the re-colouring.It's hard to be too upset about the recolouring job by Steve Oliffe and his company Olyoptics. If I hadn't seen the original work by Christine Scheele, I wouldn't have thought anything of it. Oliffe is a good colourist and has done a fantastic job on other projects (notably, his work on Marvel Epic's edition Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira is just beautiful). I'm sympathetic with the problem facing Marvel in reproducing older works like these. They almost demand recolouring. Because of primitive, cheap printing methods and the poor-quality paper used before computer-colouring, straight reprints fair poorly on the higher-quality paper of today. Here's a comparison (click to see it enlarged and with better detail):[image]The first panel is a scan from the original issue of Thor #337. You can see that the colouring is made from little dots, but because the paper is low-quality the dots tend to bleed, creating a more uniform colour-effect. It was fine for the time, but when we update the print via the second panel to higher-quality paper (as Marvel did for the first volume of their Thor Visionaries series) the dots don't bleed and remain very distinguishable. The effect is jarring. Marvel addressed this problem in later volumes of their Visionaries series by having someone re-colour the book in a way that perfectly mimicked the original colours but did so at a higher resolution. Still, the style of colouring in those original Thor books, even if the resolution is upped, is still a relic from a former era, so Marvel commissioned Steve Oliffe to bring the book into a contemporary style (the third panel)—perhaps even one similar to what the original colourist might have used had the tech been available to her.As I said, there's nothing wrong with Oliffe's colours per se. It's just that they lack some of the marvelous invention of Christine Scheele's original work. Trapped by the severe limitations of the technology and budget Marvel was working with at the time, Scheele produced some incredible work. Here are two examples so you can compare Scheele's methods with Oliffe's (click to enlarge either).[image][Oliffe's art is on the left and Scheele's is on the right.][image][Oliffe's art is on the left and Scheele's is on the right.]Scheele's colouring on the Midgard Serpent is almost minimalistic, allowing the whitespace of the page to do so much of the work for her. Oliffe's is filled with colour but is somehow less grand—though without seeing the comparison, it'd be impossible to say Oliffe's was not good. In Scheele's work on the scene with the Executioner, she employs only flat yellows and oranges. The page is washed in a duochromatic kind of violence. Oliffe's use of gradients and more colours (returning blue to the Executioner's attire) robs the page of its original sense.Ultimately, I'm not sure what the solution here is. While I found Oliffe's colours usually refreshing, I probably would have preferred a bit more fidelity to Scheele's work—after all, that was a big part of what was so incredible about the original experience.Still, small problems aside, this Omnibus should satisfy old fans and newcomers alike. Notes1. Sadly, because these crossover issues were interruptions in Simonson's story (one, for instance, involved Secret Wars II's the Beyonder), they provided very little insight into the grand tapestry Simonson intended to convey.2. There *are* a couple of delicious and notable exceptions.3. Although, there is no Jane Foster save for a cameo appearance late in the volume. I’m not sure what happened to her, as I had always understood her to be a Big Deal to Thor. (Much like one might imagine Betty Brant was a big deal to Spider-Man had one only access to the Bakshi cartoons from 1967.) As Simonson’s run on the book spans chapters 337 through 382, I imagine that some writer along the way grew tired of the Thor/Foster lego and shuffled her off to married life safe from the clutches of Mr. Hydes or Absorbing Mans. In any case, Thor’s infatuation with the woman seems long past by the time chapter 337 rolls around.4. Onomatopoeia figures prominently in Simonson’s Thor. So much so that his sound effects even take on the value of characters in their own right. Years after having read the original production of this story, it was sometimes Simonson’s visual use of sound that stayed with me._____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,not set,not set,"Aug 02, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9480669-the-mighty-thor-omnibus

Growing up the son of a hippie surfer-artist, who surfs even to this day, I had the pleasure of ready access to Surfer Magazine. And to Surfing—and I confess to not knowing the difference between the two. At least one of them had surf comics in them. I grew up seeing the work of Bob Penuelas and Rick Griffin (who pretty clearly inspired Penuelas). I, from my childhood environment, had everything I needed to appreciate Pat Grant's 21st century extrapolation of the surfer-art movements of the prior century. But because Grant's Blue is much more than a exultation in wave-riding, I am fortunate that I've had other human experiences as well. Well, fortunate perhaps only in that I can relate to the experiential bones on which Blue's narrative musculature is hinged. When I was a kid, there was a short tunnel that passed under PCH1 connecting my neighbourhood directly to the sand at El Morro Beach. It was sprayed entirely by talentless graffiti that focused largely around the concept of: CDM FAGS GO HOME. CDM referred to Corona Del Mar, the town a five-minute drive immediately to the north along PCH. Localism was fierce, as it is at probably every beach.2 And Blue, more than even an exploration of Australian youth surf culture, is a pericope cut from the human society's natural antipathy toward the stranger. [image] In Blue, Pat Grant allows the grown-up version of a surf rat named Christian to narrate the changes that have taken place over the fifteen years since a new kind of foreigner began trickling onto Northern Australian shores. It's fascinating because Grant allows his protagonist to hold all manner of distasteful fears and opinions while simultaneously vindicating some of his protagonist's views. It's a delicate procedure, but I think it pays off. Greg Burgas was less sure and found Grant's unwillingness to condemn his lead's prejudices to make uncomfortable reading. I can see where Burgas is coming from, but I think that Grant's book gives the reader an opportunity to explore not just Christian's prejudices but their own as well. In extended, almost book-length flashback (acknowledged to be like Stand By Me in several ways), Grant introduces the book's principal foreigners as blue-skinned, four-legged, alien-looking beings who propagate graffiti at alarming rates, have awkward fashion sense, and are careless with their littering. Between the time of their arrival and the setting of Christian's narration, the town of Bolton goes from a thriving town and 1989 Tidytown Winner to a broken down village entirely covered by graffiti and dominated by noodle shops, a favourite cultural food of the blue people (who are now the majority population). [image] And here's the trick Grant plays on readers. In Christian's view (and quite possibly from the view of Grant's readers), the shift from Tidytown to Graffititown is a deeply negative experience—and proof that unchecked immigration is Bad. Where Blue offers the reader the opportunity to self-examine is in considering the same world from the vantage of the blue people. Grant is careful to humanize the foreigners through cues rooted even within Christian's prejudiced narrative. We see the blue people's attempts at assimilation and the loneliness in an orphaned blue child. Grant gives the blue people a mortality that mirrors the mortality of the native white Australian (we see a description of a dead body visualized as a non-foreigner, but when it is discovered to be a foreigner, it looks the same but is coloured blue). So then, the question: in the view of the blue people, is the town better or worse than it was fifteen years ago? Plausibly, the blue people would say it's better, more comfortable, and more in line with their cultural tastes. So who then is to say that the Tidytown version of Bolton was the better iteration? Whose culture gets to play arbiter? Grant makes it clear that adding new individuals to a society will alter culture within that society3 and that those comfortable within a society are going to suffer some measure of change. [image] And in any case, the damage to the Tidytown facade is showing even before the mass immigration strikes. Each of Christian's friends and Christian himself are the opposite of tidy, living in personal squalor. Christian's house is a disaster and its walls cracked and failing. To remember Bolton as a paradise is to remember a lie. That Grant gives us the tools to investigate one of Blue's primary theses (that newcomers change community cultures in ways that may be perceived negatively) but doesn't tell us what to think was refreshing to me. In a way, it's fitting that Craig Thompson should have endorsed the book because I felt much the same with his Habibi, a complex work that doesn't outright condemn much but offers readers the opportunity to join a conversation. Blue has a lot of little things to say that pile up into maybe a large thing. The trick, then, is partially in unraveling what Grant himself is saying through his wonderful pictures, but probably more importantly unraveling what you may be saying to yourself in the midst of reading his work. [image][This is actually a pretty cool page. The brown panel in the middle is meant to show the same spot on another day, when there were flawless sets and no chop.]  A Word on the Art  The above was actually going to be the conclusion of my  but I found it offensive that I hadn't yet mentioned Grant's superb art. His environmental sense is incredible and he uses his pages' paneling to lay out his story in inventive, evocative ways. His treatment of the natural world is lush, wild, and important—even as he shows the foreignness of the blue people within Bolton's society, he makes the Australian seem even more the foreigner when dwarfed by the wildness of the forest or the tumult of the sea. Grant's lines are thick and powerful and his work owes a clear debt to Rick Griffin (a debt he acknowledges in a wonderful afterward, playing with the history of surf comics and especially Australian surf comics). His palette consists of black-and-white, spare shades of brown, and spare shades of blue—and he doesn't need anything else. He uses these to virtuosically play his themes (locals and tourists) off each other. It really works. Notes 1. PCH stands for Pacific Coast Highway, aka the 1 or Highway 1, a length of road that runs nearly the length of the California coast.2. ""Localism was fierce, as it is at probably every beach.""As every surf break only allows a limited number of waves per hour and only a small fraction of those are set waves, competition for those waves can be tough. With locals, an uneasy hierarchy might form so that the top dogs get the best waves and leave the scraps for those lower on the totem pole. In more egalitarian surf societies, a first-come-first-served lineup will form, granting access to waves on a first-come-first-served basis. In either case, waves are a limited commodity and if additional bodies are jockeying for rides, those local to the break are going to be getting fewer rides than they would otherwise. Hence a traditional and culturally institutionalized animosity toward visitors, tourists, non-locals. 3. ""Grant makes it clear that adding new individuals to a society will alter culture within that society.""It's a facile point but one worth making since in trying to be welcoming to newcomers, we often gloss over the changes they will necessarily bring with them. It may be that our fear of causing offense or being seen as bigoted may cause us to pretend that stimulus to a system won't affect the system. _____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,not set,"Aug 02, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13389694-blue

Beyond a hard-won affection for his Buddha, I haven't come to take much enjoyment from the other books of his I've sampled. Phoenix, Adolf, Blackjack. They just haven't won me over. I think I may be too far divorced from the period of his innovation to view the works as fresh. They are so deeply products of their times that they appear quaint and stilted—to me at least (I've spoken before of my trouble with attempting to escape my biases). As the comics form has evolved and storytelling grown into using a more mature set of tools, I find myself unable to appreciate Tezuka as story. As artifact, sure. As an archaeological window into the development of the form, yes. But I do not find myself able to dive into his stories for the sake of those stories—I've always got to have an ulterior motive, usually one associated with academic appreciation.Because of this, giving Pluto a chance was a hard sell for me. I didn't know enough about Astroboy to be a fan or otherwise. I couldn't even be ambivalent. I was strictly apathetic. I had so little interest in the character or in a reimagining of one of his more famous episodes that even the promise of Naoki Urasawa's stellar storytelling chops wouldn't lure me out. It wasn't until I was bored at the library one day and happened to find the first volume on a shelf that the scales tipped.And now I wish that Urasawa would adapt all of Tezuka's works.[image]As is spoken of near ad infinitum, one of science fiction's greatest conceits is the ability, through its speculative technologies, to engage the mind in such a way that contemporary issues are seen in new light. 1984 could prompt its audience to reevaluate the pervasive role of the government in shackling liberty for the sake of security. Gattaca could help alert its audience to the value of the natural individual in the face of the future's promise of a better genetics. The Time Machine could prompt its audience to remember to value literature in the face of emerging mass entertainment options. And Invasion of the Body Snatchers could alert its audience to the insidious creep of subtle ideological evolutions, whether in the face of communist utopianism or crass commercialism.It's a common enough use of the genre that one might even consider it boring to talk about. After all, it's been done over and again. What Urasawa does with Pluto, however, is of another level and to a-whole-nother magnitude. Rather than simply engage the mind through conceptual challenges, he affects the heart. And by working upon the seat of the emotional mind, he draws out a kind of empathy for non-humans who straddle the cole between personhood and non-personhood.[image]Pluto is foremost the story of the murders of several robotic AIs. These artificial intelligences struggle with balancing their self-awareness with the shackles of their programming. In a way, Urasawa may even be trying to tackle, in some remedial way, questions of liberty vs determinism—something all those with any interest in metaphysics must come up against at one point or another. From another angle, these robots' lives spell out the same conflict that MT Anderson homes in on in his wonderful Astonishing Life of Octavian Nothing: the question of liberty and property; how can those who rally behind freedom, democracy, and liberty keep sentient beings as property.1Where Urasawa excels so ably is in making his robotic characters so human, so other-than-human, and so worthy of compassion in either case. There are moments for several of these robots (whose narrative destiny, set in stone fifty years ago by Tezuka himself, is to be destroyed) at which the average reader may very well need to take a moment to regain composure. We are never not aware of these characters' non-human status and the fact that they are creations of man, but all the same they become valuable recipients of our cares and well-wishes.[image]And it is through that marvelous narrative inducement toward empathy that Urasawa sells his point home. He requires the reader to consider the what-ifs of his scenario. Ignoring plausibility for a moment, he not only raises the question of artificial personhood but also gives the reader a reason to care about that question. Adam Hines attempted something similar in Duncan the Wonder Dog, by actually giving personhood to animals; but as much as I laud Duncan as probably the pre-eminent work of comics fiction, I believe Urasawa pulls this particular thing off much more adeptly.2 It's difficult to balance the humanity and inhumanity of these characters in a way that makes them both comfortable and alien, but Urasawa succeeds. Pluto, against odds, is neither too heady nor too treacle nor even too plot-driven. And for a book structured as a detective thriller, that's some achievement.The story Urasawa is adapting (Tezuka's ""The Greatest Robot on Earth"") features the seven most advanced robots in the world falling one by one to a new challenger, a mighty robot named Pluto. Rather than push Atom (adapted from Astroboy) to the narrative center, Urasawa tells much of the story through Gesicht, a Europol detective robot and one of the seven most powerful AIs on earth. (Urasawa, to lesser degree, moves the narrative around between the remainder of the other six robots.) Gesicht is investigating this string of robot-related murders. As the number of murders mounts, Gesicht draws closer and closer to discovering Pluto's identity—all while trying to reign in an apparent fault in his robotic memory.[image]Pluto is only eight volumes long and is therefore much more tightly plotted than either Monster (18 vols.) or 20th Century Boys (22 vols. and a short sequel). It's a good read and gives the reader opportunity to think about a number of fascinating subjects, all while carrying on a murder mystery/thriller. For a series that (at its most basic and dumbed down) is a book about a series of robot fights, Urasawa wisely shows very little actual robot-on-robot combat. He knows what's interesting and fighting robots is not quite that. Pluto is an investigation of emergent technologies, an investigation of the toll of contemporary international policies, and an investigation of the nature of the soul.Notes1. ""These robots' lives spell out the same conflict that MT Anderson homes in on in his wonderful Astonishing Life of Octavian Nothing: the question of liberty and property; how can those who rally behind freedom, democracy, and liberty keep sentient beings as property.""In one sense the question may be offensive, since with black people there is no question to their sentience and full personhood—while the question is still up in the air as regards the artificial intelligence. Still, within the scope of Anderson's work (taking place during the American revolutionary escapades), the same question is very much at stake for the people alive in that particular historical pericope.2. ""As I laud Duncan as probably the pre-eminent work of comics fiction, I believe Urasawa pulls this off much more adeptly."" Much of this is probably directly owed to the fact that we can much more easily imagine machines with self-aware intelligence and the capacity to communicate than we can mere animals._____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,47,1,not set,not set,"Aug 02, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1725523.PLUTO

Let's start over.Having only traveled internationally a handful of times—and always to Eastern Europe—and being left to rely on scattered reports from friends atop the untrustworthy testimony of pop culture for my understanding of various Asian cultures, it can be difficult to tell when a portrayal is capitalizing on pop fantasy and stereotype. Often, when reading a story that takes place in (say) Seoul, I'll have to ask myself, ""Wow, can Koreans really be like that?"" Being naturally and unfairly skeptical that anyone could be unlike myself, I generally just think: No, of course not. An obviously ethnocentric (and perhaps egocentric) conclusion.Of course it's possible that Koreans could actually, as a culture, become so distinct through hundreds of years of not being me that they, as a culture, might do all kinds of things I could never imagine. My wife, who represents (I think ably) smalltown Mid-Western America has a way of looking at the world that is wholly unlike my own—and we're both from the same country. It shouldn't be hard for me to believe other people are so different. But simultaneously, I'm well aware that people are prone to stereotype—especially cultural practices they do not quite understand. So when reading a narrative set in foreign lands that presents a picture of a people that sits far from my own normative experience, I struggle between my distaste for stereotype and my own tendency toward ethnocentrism.And so we arrive at Jonathan Vankin's two stories collected in Tokyo Days, Bangkok Nights.[image]The first half, fantastically illustrated by the late Seth Fisher, is a story that follows an American Nipponophile around Tokyo in a thoroughly madcap adventure. Vankin turns the pop sensibilities of the Japanese metropolitan society to blistering levels and gives the reader an eye into nothing but the most overblown Western fantasies of what Tokyo life must really be like. Or does he? It seems impossible that even a fraction of the things, people, and events represented could come even close to reality, but (!) never having lived there, maybe I'm wrong to think these things can't be real. I mean, the picture doesn't comport to anything I've seen in manga or anime, anything I've read in Murakami or Miyabe, or anything I can imagine my Japanese-exported friends could have engaged in before moving to California.(It's kind of like Portlandia. I've never been to Portland so who's to say for sure, but it just doesn't seem plausible to believe the show accurately represents any viable experience in the city.)[image]The second story, far darker in tone, capitalizes on the stereotypes of Thailand we learn from reading stories on their icky sex trade. How the cities are mob-run. How Western ""tourists"" make the country their destination in order to have cheap sex with thirteen-year-old girls. How prostitutes would rather get abused by men than live as nobodies back at home. This story is just as unlikely and seems ripped out of 100 Bullets, only minus Brian Azarello's obnoxiously snappy patter. It caters to all the Western fears about the terrible, dark, exotic underbelly of Asia. Surely, no city could be so wildly corrupt as Vankin's depiction of Bangkok, here. Or could it? Again, I have no real means to ascertain the story's plausibility or the veracity of the kind of portrait that Vankin's painting.[image]It's frustrating. I'm never quite sure what to believe—though I lean toward feeling as though the stories abused my goodwill. Maybe some thoughtful reader can enlighten me to the truth of things.So ignoring all that (as if I could), we have two mediocre stories. Neither are particularly investing, though both focus on the part of Americans in these foreign places—and on how foreign these Americans feel in these foreign places. The Tokyo half benefits from Seth Fisher's wild visions (though Fisher's wildness may actually contribute to the untrustworthiness of the narrative). Fisher is an artist of the first class and his energetic, anal illustration gives the story a sort of Pop! that it would otherwise lack. The colours are bright and unforgiving and the pace manic. There are yakuza, boy-band J-pop stars, overly polite everybody, a lavender-haired lolicon flight-attendant hopeful, and a girl who wants to take over the world through throat-grabbing, lapel-throttling soft power. It's all a bit much and, at the same time, rather slight—since there's not really any rewarding story- or character moments.[image]The Bangkok half is drawn/inked in a style reminiscent of Eduardo Risso's fun, noirish work on 100 Bullets, capitalizing on visual cues to illustrate the darkness of men's souls. The story's all a bit bleak and plays to all the typical Bangkok cliches. Merited or not, I felt as though I had been there and done that. (Though not literally, human rights groups!) It was an alright effort, but didn't put anything on the table to make me come back for seconds. Flipping the artists would have maybe been inspired: having Seth Fisher draw this moribund story with his buoyant flair would have been subversive to the utmost and might have made this better worth my time.All told, Tokyo Days, Bangkok Nights struggles but never quite gets out from under the weight of my discomfort with the way the book tells its stories. My fault? Maybe, but I can't help who I am. Your mileage may, of course, vary substantially._____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Aug 02, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4806025-tokyo-days-bangkok-nights

So while I can appreciate talent and imagination in all kinds of cultural produce, I cannot enjoy a fair number of those books, movies, and records. It's not easy on me—in a spiritual sense. I would love to take as great a pleasure in these superior incarnations of the creative spirit as I would had they only been crafted closer to my tastes.All this is to preface why I didn't enjoy Infinite Kung Fu despite it being a marvelous, carefully produced work and house to the exhibition of a major talent.In the late '70s, I adored weekends because local television syndicates (KTLA 5 and KCOP 13, if I recall) would fill the weekends with Godzilla movies and kung fu theater. It was a glorious time to be a kid. I distinctly remember the delicious terror of The Flying Guillotine and other violent, bizarre martial fantasies. I'm not certain if it was being over-saturated with violent, action-y media in the thirty-plus years hence that did it, or if I just turned smug and elitist, but none of that appeals to me anymore. I watched Jason Statham's Transporter a few years back and despite lots of testosterone and choreography and kinetic dynamism and explosions, I was only interested in the character interactions. I felt let down by myself. Was this the kind of person I had grown into? I avoid rewatching Die Hard or Aliens or The Last of the Mohicans for fear that my former go-to action paeans will have lost their luster.[image]And if I had once-though-no-longer enjoyed martial arts films, I have never acquired a taste for explorations of the undead. I've actually never seen more than a few minutes of Night of the Living Dead and while I do bear affection for the Evil Dead series, that's more just a salute to my enjoyment of Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi than anything.1 I liked 28 Days Later and the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers okay, but in each case for reasons unattached to the horror elements involved. I haven't been interested in watching the AMC adaptation of The Walking Dead—a comics series of which I own three volumes and have only read most of two.So when you discover that Infinite Kung Fu is a hybrid of martial arts adventure and zombie stories, you might wonder that I could have been induced to pick it up at all. I wonder myself that I ever gave the book a shot. Still, it's well-regarded and there was quite a bit of excitement over its publication. And with good reason: it's a fantastic, amazing book—that I don't like. [image]Creator Kagan McLeod has an evident love for the genres in which he's working. Infinite Kung Fu's world is overrun by undeath and only the masters of good kung fu can defeat those of poison kung fu and return life and balance to the land. Every page is crafted with care and affection. McLeod employs a visual style reminiscent of Chinese brushwork, with the ink tapering off into stranded, nomadic lines of inky gravel. His figures are elegant and abrupt, delicate and angry—so much the better for depicting a beautiful young monk bursting open to reveal hundreds of centipedes. The story elements are deliciously reminiscent of the most gratuitous moments of the martial arts films I grew up on. And in case someone was skeptical, McLeod offers an afterward detailing his own history of martial arts and the Chinese film industry (so far as it pertains to the kung fu genre).The book is gorgeously printed and painstakingly crafted. It is, so far as any eye can tell, a labour of love. And yet, because the subject-matter was so far outside of my tastes, I couldn't find myself interested. If McLeod had subverted genre expectations (I mean, beyond crossing Kung Fu Theater with The Walking Dead), I might have found a rack on which to hang my hat. But that wasn't his goal. This is McLeod's love-letter to genre. If it could be said without disparagement, I'd describe the book as wallowing in its sources.2 For someone remotely interested in what this book is selling—kung fu vs. the undead—Infinite Kung Fu may be one of the best comics to come out last year. Because it really is amazing. If you like that sort of thing.[image]Notes1. I do bear affection for the Evil Dead series.Besides Campbell's gradual descent into a more and more comedic version of Ash (he's throwing out ridiculous and awesome one-liners in Army of Darkness as though they were shuriken), I adore a particular scene in Evil Dead II. The laughing shack. It's one of my favourite pieces of filmmaking. It's so bizarre and aptly placed that I can't help but love it. It is the scene that I think of first whenever I think of either Bruce Campbell, Sam Raimi, or the Evil Dead series. And that's saying a lot because there were so many inventive and interesting scenes in those films.2. If it could be said without disparagement, I'd describe the book as wallowing in its sources.I really do mean that in an entirely positive sense. It's refreshing to see someone so un-self-consciously dive into that thing that scratches their itch. _____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,not set,"Aug 02, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12090646-infinite-kung-fu

Authors of the former recognize the deep fictionality involved in autobiography at a foundational level and tend to play with such self-cognizance. Readers are then saved some of the work1 of discovering author bias and framing their interpretive grid around that. The story becomes less an exploration of a personal history and more an invited journey into the way a particular person perceives the world they inhabit. The non-self-aware autobiography, on the other hand, still in some sense features those same details and the questions they raise—only in a hidden or secretive way. Rather than actively promote self-evaluation, these other brands of autobiography drive the reader to focus on the romance of events instead.So while I'm not sure which type I prefer generally, I'm glad that Sarah Glidden decided to write the self-reflective autobiography How to Understand Israel in 60 Days or Less. As it's a book about the instability of opinion based on ignorance and complexity, Glidden's ability to focus on her own re-evaluations and conflicting emotions helps sell the narrative she's chosen to put forth. No one will come away from her book understanding Israel or its place on the world stage; but they will be left with a powerful explanation of why people have a hard time knowing what to do with a nation that is simultaneously despicable, noble, ancient, racist, beautiful, ugly, and deeply and abidingly ethnocentric.If I wrote a memoir about my experience as an American, it might play off similarly. Only maybe with less crying.2Birthright is a ten-day, organized tour of Israel offered to young adults of direct Jewish decent. Its proposed purpose is to foster comfortability between the Jewish inhabitants of Israel and the ethnically Jewish in foreign nations. Over 80% of birthright participants are Americans. Sarah Glidden was one of these—though she only agreed to participate reluctantly.[image][Israel would undoubtedly be able to garner much more affection for their little imperialist endeavors if they rode into battle on the backs of dinosaurs. Get on that, Israel.]Glidden, as she reveals herself in the character of Sarah, sees international politics from a leftist or progressive perspective. Before travelling to Israel, she becomes well-acquainted with the nation's human-rights record (especially in regard to what she considers their foul treatment of the Palestinian people). Before her trip, she's very antagonistic and cynical toward the whole endeavor—and views birthright as a propagandistic means of brainwashing the young Jewish into adoring a fundamentally broken imperialistic system. Before her trip, she reads up as much as she can about birthright trips, so she'll know what to expect and how to best guard against the poisoning of her mind/heart/soul. (Sarah has a lot at stake. Beyond her political convictions, her boyfriend is Arabic.) How to Understand Israel is somewhat the story of whether Sarah will succumb to the charms and emotional resonance of the birthright trip.Glidden illustrates her story in a loose, crumbling style of pen-work that, if intentional, adds to the story-like quality of her recollections, pushing the reader to further see her memoir as a fictionalization of reality. Her colouring is all watercoloured (or some digital approximation thereof) and adds further to the dreamlike quality inhabiting her narration. This is fitting as Sarah, from almost story's beginning, meanders through her ten-day tour as some kind of somnambulist. Much of her trip is built out of warm dreams and crisp nightmares. She's never in any real danger, but we do get the sense that despite her vigilance she could at any step fall to the narrative her minders hope to sell her on: that the situation is more complicated than she believes.[image][Murky presuppositions: they'll get you every time.]While Sarah finds herself well-guarded against the corny, overt propaganda of some of the museums and demonstrations her tour group encounters, she has less defense against the hearts of the proletariat. It's the reasonable tour guide who thinks Israel's treatment of Palestinians is deplorable; it's the empathetic young Israeli soldier who thinks Israel's treatment of Arab people is inherently racist; it's all those Israelis she encounters who don't come off as fundamentalists but still have reasons they believe they need walls and guns and curfews that really threaten to erode Sarah's clear moral high ground. How to Understand Israel isn't a book intending to answer or solve any questions for the reader. It's simply an exploration of Sarah's (and perhaps even Glidden's) reaction to (and interaction with) a series of perceptions that run counter her expectations. How will she respond? Will her convictions crumble? Will she embrace Israel? Will she forgive Israel the abusive identity it's molded for itself? Will she concede that the nation has a right to exist as a Jewish state? Will her cynicism poison her friendships? Will it poison even her own soul? [image]This is where the book's value lies—as the story of an individual stuck by the arbitrary caprice of genetic fate into the middle of a ridiculous international-historical Situation. If people (and the method by which people live in the world) are of any interest to you, then How to Understand Israel will at the least provide fascinating reading. It may even offer more: an education in empathy? a lesson in historical complexities and narrative ambiguity? an encounter with people you might not otherwise understand? So much the better.Notes1. ""We're saved some of the work of discovering author bias.""Of course, just because an author makes a play at self-awareness, that doesn't mean she is perfectly so. Even her self-awareness must be read as biased and narrowly perspectival.2. ""Only maybe with less crying.""Glidden cries a substantial amount of the time. This is not a judgment. I merely found it remarkable (i.e. something to remark upon) and wasn't sure whether to read it as Glidden being a very emotional person or as the birthright trip being a powerful catalyst for emotional release. Quite probably, the truth lies somewhere between those two things (we aren't privy to seeing many other traveller's tearful breakdowns)._____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,not set,not set,"Aug 02, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7941986-how-to-understand-israel-in-60-days-or-less

For all his cattishness or pantherishness, he's definitely a guy—a tough guy with brimfuls of moxie and the good sense to wear a hat that matches his attire.[image]I'm not particularly well-schooled in the history of literally anthropomorphized animals (or are they zoomorphized humans?). There may be some long and storied tradition stretching back centuries, but for the time being let's talk about cartoon animal development over the course of the last hundred years. With George Herrimann's Krazy Kat and later Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks' Steamboat Willie, talking animals (usually living the lives of normal people) became more and more popular. Then there came Donald Duck and Bugs and Daffy and a whole proliferation of non-human humans. Many of these were successful and both the newspaper strips and cartoon circuit were inundated with the enjoyable interactions and stories of innumerable Uncle Scrooges, Wile E. Coyotes, and Pogos. By the '70s the trend, while entrenched, began to wear thin. Maybe it was Kennedy. Maybe it was Vietnam. Maybe it was Nixon. At any rate, funny animals comics began to seem juvenile and stopped capturing attention (save for twisted outliers like Fritz the Cat). And just as with every trope that begins to stale through overuse, continued success demanded either renovation or subversion. The '80s marked a revival of the anthropomorphs and gave the idea a new* twist: the animals were no longer funny. (Or if they were, then at the least that was not their primary attribute.) The independent comics scene was flooded with books like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Omaha the Cat Dancer, and Cerebus. One particular book, Usagi Yojimbo, did something kind of neat that I hadn't seen elsewhere previously: creator Stan Sakai put some effort into pairing characters' personality types with appropriate animal representation. So Gen, the grizzled and tough bounty hunter, is a rhinoceros and Hebi, the sly and duplicitous lord, is a snake. (Amusingly the worst villain of the series, Lord Hikiji, is a human.)[image]Check out John Blacksad in the doorway admiring the view.Blacksad creators, Juan Díaz Canales and Juanjo Guarnido, have taken anthropomorphized animals to the destination for which I believe they must have always been intended. Mickey Mouse (who rarely exhibited any mouselike qualities) was merely a nascent form in the evolutionary process of the anthropomorphization of animals, something like the nadir of the genre where Blacksad is the zenith. Guarnido's characters are to be loved with the heart, studied with the mind, and ravished with the eyes. The artist makes the polar-bearish character move and act like a polar-bear person might. The weasely, ferrety rag-journalist acts and moves both weasely and ferrety. Crow-people, lizard-people, tiger-people, turtles, rabbits, rhinos, a German shepherd: they all inhabit their animal skins pretty much as you expect. Which brings us to John Blacksad.[image]Blacksad's animal avatar is a dark panther with white muzzle. He's got plenty of feline qualities (curiosity, predatory nature, fleet violence, and a certain sleekness to his movements), all of which contribute to his occupation as a private dick. He's got luck with the ladies—though perhaps not enough that he can ever keep one for long. He's a tough-bitten customer, but leans toward acts of charity that tend to get him beaten up more than he deserves. Essentially, he's a young Philip Marlowe (maybe Big Sleep-era), only with less verbal wit and penchant for dialogical gymnastics. This volume of the Spanish creators' noirish tales collects three separately published stories about the cattish detective. The first is a standard revenge pursuit (like the first volume of Sin City), the second twists a kidnapping in with WWII-era klansmanship, and the third deals with McCarthyism, immigrant thinkers, and the Bomb. None of the stories are particularly novel, but each is visually well-spoken enough that most readers will never mind. While the mysteries rarely keep ahead of astute readers, the real fun is in devouring this lush, over-detailed world—and the beasts that inhabit it.[image]The Artic Nation will rise again! You shall know them by their pelts.Guarnido is an incredible artist. Not only are his character designs prodigy-level, but his use of these figures is completely liquid. His miniature biography reveals that he's trained in animation. It shows. Characters move in believable, extra-human mannerisms, filling the space of their panels with regality or temerity or fury or pathos or joie de vivre—with whatever aura their stories demand. Guarnido's sense of locale is likewise impeccable, and he supplies a full-fledged world for these denizens to inhabit. And all of this is painted in palettes wholly suitable to moods governed by story concerns. Honestly, I can't say enough kind things about the art. It's simply magnificent.[image]Spooky.Additionally, Dark Horse did a wonderful job in packaging here. The book is gorgeous. It's sturdy and oversized, meaning it will take many multiple readings in which the reader carefully pours over every large drawing before it finally, reluctantly falls apart (if only to prove universal laws of entropy). The only downside is that it doesn't contain four Blacksad stories. Or eight. Or thirty. I can't get enough.[image]No furs allowed, silly.Notes* Of course, doing serious zoomorphs in comics wasn't entirely new. But this was probably the first time it became wildly popular. Eventually, though, even the over-serious TMNT became a kids' show and moved back toward the silly/funny animal zone._____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,not set,not set,"Aug 02, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7342071-blacksad

It's not so much that I'm fond of westerns. I'm not overly fond of genre fiction. Though I'll enjoy the occasional sci-fi, superhero, or fantasy tale if it lopes across my path, I don't generally set out to pick up the latest detective thriller, survival horror, or baseball romance. Once upon a time, perhaps, but not so much these days. Still, I do like to maintain a diverse library—more to the end of lending (as a form of comics evangelism) than to satisfy any personal whims of mood or taste.I think what had spurred me to the decision to seek out more westerns specifically was reading the second volume of Mignola and Arcudi's Witchfinder. Where the first volume is entrenched in the generous gloom of merry old Britain, the next takes the Witchfinder to the Old West, to fight zombies or some such. I didn't actually enjoy it all that well, but it did remind me that I didn't own a single graphic novel western. So the next week, when I saw the cover to Dark Horse's first Milo Manara collection and read that within its pages was held a sumptuous frontier built in the shadow of the Spaghetti Westerns, I was sold. As it turns out, this was a mistake. That single book quenched any desire I had to seek out more westerns. So when I was given the opportunity to spend time reading Bloody Chester or something else, I chose something else. As it turns out, this was a mistake. Bloody Chester is just a fantastic little book and something that pretty much everyone over fourteen* should check out. One of the fun things about the Western is that people have been subverting the genre for-almost-ever. At least since High Noon turned its tail on white-hatted heroism back in 1952. I don't know about before that (maybe it took the advent of Noir to spur the Western similarly), but at least since Gary Cooper threw his badge in the dirt, the Western has been a place to toy with an established moral ruleset. The Searchers, The Shootist, A Fistful of Dollars (and the rest of Leone's Spaghettis), High Plains Drifter, and The Unforgiven. Each of these worked so well as they did because they played loose with viewer expectations that had been ingrained by social understanding of a mythologized Western. By now, perhaps the only way to subvert the Western is to subvert our expectation of subversion, to play the story as a straight return to an Old Timey Western ethic that perhaps ever only existed in the early days of Hollywood. Bloody Chester doesn't quite do this but does put some effort toward twisting reader expectations. I think.[image]I won't come right out and describe the kind of book I thought I'd be reading as I made my way through Bloody Chester's opening pages. The book seems to evoke one kind of story only to leave the reader wondering if that was all in her imagination—I certainly wonder if it was all in mine. Creators Petty and Florido craft their story ably enough that I cannot rightly tell if I was reading signs that they put in place with some measure of intentionality or if my cognizance of the creative zeitgeist caused me to read my own presuppositions into the text. A delicious proposition.What we're left with is something simpler than what I expected; and yet in that simple story are revealed complexities of character that might have been overwhelmed had the narrative gone in more lurid directions. Which is not to say Bloody Chester isn't lurid—it is. Just not that much so. [image]Petty's story, like so many latter-day Westerns, butters its bread on the capitalist shenanigans that marked the railroads' journey west. Chester Kates (Bloody Chester to you, or Lady Kate if you prefer) is hired to burn the town of Whale to nothing—to the end of inexpensively paving the way for coming rail. The situation in Whale—mostly deserted—is not what it seems, and unearthing the truth to this mystery and surviving long enough to burn the town comprises the duration of the book. It's a good story and one well told. Petty writes his characters well, employing a naturalistic kind of ungrammatical dialogue that one might find in a Flannery O'Conner graphic novella, replacing should haves with should ofs. Petty, in concert with Florido, crafts some subtle, rewarding character moments (such as Chester explaining to Caroline the origin of his ruthless-sounding nickname). And there's enough foundation laid that the climax of the book's climax plays out believably enough,** what with foreshadowing and all.Bloody Chester is, apparently, Hilary Florido's first graphic novel and I'd like to say that it shows just a little bit—but then again I can't quite tell for certain whether the sometimes scrappy look of her figures is by style or by license or by the need to practice more. It's very possibly that the answer lies anywhere within those options. At any rate, the book looks good and with a few small exceptions (like where I couldn't quite tell what someone was holding), she acquits herself marvelously. Her depictions of Caroline are positively adorable and she experiments enough with panel design to keep the book lively.[image]2012 has been a good year for comics and Bloody Chester adds one more to that tally. It's anyone's guess whether the year will see a major work like an Asterios Polyp (2009) or a Duncan the Wonder Dog (2010) or a Daytripper or Big Questions or Habibi (all 2011). Maybe 2012 won't see anyone's magnum opus—but if smaller, less ambitious books like Bloody Chester keep coming out, this may be one of the best years for comics yet. I get excited just thinking about it.Notes* The age, fourteen, was pretty much arrived at arbitrarily. I really just wanted to say that anyone mature enough to appreciate a story told with subtlety should appreciate Bloody Chester.** Well, save for a skyward-fired shot that takes (to my ballisticsly-uneducated eye) an unnaturally long time to return to the ground. Maybe it takes exactly the right amount of time, but that would surprise me. This possibly-physics-bending instance took me slightly out of story for a moment while I stopped to think about bullets and universal laws and how fast a horse-drawn wagon can travel.Now you're conjuring images of the conclusion to Chinatown, aren't you?_____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Aug 02, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2404623.Bloody_Chester

I grew up loving various non-American mythologies and found the cultures that produced them to be interesting. Greek, Roman, Japanese, Norse—oh how I loved the Norse mythologies. And the idea of that Norse mythos coming to life in contemporary North America sounds delectable in purely conceptual terms. It's just the loud, boisterously costumed Jack-Kirby Asgardians that I couldn't get behind, the Norse lords who spoke in a faux-Elizabethan pidgin and wouldn't kill humans for whatever reason. They were too sanitized to tempt me.*This was the opinion that reigned in me until I encountered Walt Simonson's vision of the Asgardians when I was in high school. I still held many of my reservations, but the sheer bombasticism of Simonson's rendition was so dramatic, so intense, that I was won over for the space of his run on the book.** After Simonson finished his run, I too departed, unenthusiastic for the direction new creators might take. I grew skeptical that I could ever take Marvel's Thor seriously again. It took twenty years,*** but eventually I found another creative team who could make the thundering Asgardian a worthy diversion of my time. Unfortunately, Marvel cancelled the book after eight issues—a move that infuriates me as a reader who wants to read good books.[image]So what's so great about Langridge and Samnee's Thor: The Mighty Avenger? Honestly, nearly everything. I'm pretty well on record as not being any longer excited or too interested in superhero comics. Apart from rare exceptions, I simply avoid the books, not wanting to be disappointed by most of what I might read. This Thor, on the other hand, hits all the right notes for me. The story is engaging and charming. The art meets narrative and characters perfectly. And best of all, it left me wanting more.Well, best of all if Marvel hadn't cancelled the book.Apparently, and I hadn't had ear to the ground enough to know this 'til now, Thor: The Mighty Avenger is/was part of Marvel's more kid-friendly line. One can see the trailmarkers if one looks. A re-introduction of the character. Chapters that while accommodating a larger general arc are self-contained enough that readers could approach any one of them on their own and be relatively satisfied. The violence is clean and the more mature romantic instances are only hinted at—and in such a way that many adult readers might gloss over. The story is brisk, fun, humourous, romantic, sweet, and adventurous.[image][Case study in subtlety:This panel means that Thor and Jane engaged in nocturnal romantic relations.]Chris Samnee's art is wonderfully expressive. While much of the contemporary superheroic genre demands the highly detailed and too-realistic art styles we've seen in Bryan Hitch and Alex Maleev and Greg Land, each of those styles (for whatever benefits they might bring to their books) all suffer one substantial deficit: their inability to convey easily a range of emotions. (For example, for all Tony Harris' talent, it can be difficult to watch him struggle to portray a particular instance of emotion in practically every chapter of Ex Machina; Greg Land, on the other hand, seems limited to maybe three.) Samnee's work is more fluid, relying on some of the tricks and exaggerations that animators prefer. There is never a point at which the reader will be confused as to what Thor's or Jane's expressions mean. This is not something that can be said for the bulk of contemporary America's superhero books.[image][I mean, look at this scene. It's gorgeous and hilarious.]And because this book may actually be more about relationships than it is about heroic deeds, Samnee's ability to convey winsome character interactions is essential to its success. Thor: The Mighty Adventure, if meant for the cinema instead of the comics form, would probably be one of those films that gets marketed as a summer blockbuster but is really much more successful because it appeals to more than just the testosterone fantasies of teenage boys. The building relationship between Thor and Jane is sensitive, believable, and actually pretty compelling. Probably lots of people would like it if they gave it a chance.Honestly though, I think this would have perhaps appealed better had it not been a story about Marvel's Thor, a character with fifty years of history and expectations. The characters are solid and we like them, but they're built from the ground up out of new material. There's no necessary relation to the Marvel hero and the insinuation of Thor's old opponents (Mr. Hyde, Fin Fang Foom,**** etc.) feels tacked on—as if their inclusion comes only due to a marketing mandate. These are things that happen because this is a Thor comic, not because they ought to happen. The fact of the matter is that this didn't need to be a ""Thor"" comic at all. It didn't have to take place in the Marvel Universe (even one of their dusty, unused/unusable ones).[image]In fact, seeing how poorly Marvel supported the book, it almost certainly would have been better had Langridge and Samnee made this book wholly apart from the big publisher's bumbling. My gosh, even imagining what could have been had this creative team made their own book—one that happened to follow the story of a mythological god of thunder finding himself stuck on earth and meeting a nice girl? A book wholly of their own, investing the creators with the ability to compose it as they would, with beginning, middle, and end? Holy cats that would have been something.Something to look forward to, I guess? A dream, a hope, something to believe in.Notes* To be fair, I wasn't exactly entranced by Neil Gaiman's expression of the Norse pantheon in American Gods, either.** I'm curious how much of my abiding adoration for Simonson's work on the book is due to nostalgia's grasp upon my sense of things. I hope to read through Marvel's recent Simonson Omnibus soon to reacquaint myself with those old stories.*** Technically, more, but I wasn't reading Simonson's Thor concurrent to its original publication save for an issue or two. I probably first read through Simonson's entire Thor arc around 1990 or so.**** And I actually really enjoyed how they made Fin Fang Foom just a form that Heimdall took in order to confront Thor._____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,not set,"Aug 02, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8846503-thor

That padding, to my mind, generally just gets in the way and diminishes from my overall enjoyment of the collection. Still, I can see why a consumer might be more inclined to shell out for a book of nine stories of varying quality than for one of just three solid efforts. Even at this, the highest point of civilized sophistication and critical knowledge,* consumers still mistake quantity for quality. I wanted to take a break from ing collections of short works because I felt like I was essentially saying the same thing over and over again: ""This anthology was a mix of better stories and worse stories. I would have liked it more had the balance tipped more toward better stories and I would have liked it less had the balance tipped more toward worse stories."" That's my general feeling toward collections and if I got bored writing that over and again, I was certain that you were bored reading it.The problem is that 1) that meant I wasn't talking about books that deserved to be talked about and 2) a worthwhile  (to me) is less about whether something is good, okay, or bad and more a discussion of other aspects of a work. And so, are there things to talk about in regard to Megan Kelso's The Squirrel Mother beyond the fact that some of the stories are better than others? Yes, there are. So let's do that.While The Squirrel Mother is mostly concerned with small pericopes drawn from the lives of young women and girls, far and away my favourite segment was a series of short reflections recapitulating the life and times of Alexander Hamilton. In the first, a girl explores in an essay the interactions and relationship between Hamilton and James Madison, focusing on their collaboration on ""Publius."" And when I say she explores their relationship, I really just mean that she ships them hard. It's an amusing way to get across the dynamic of their work and eventual falling out. In the next story another girl (or perhaps the same, but older), her indignation inflamed by a teacher's earlier recountment of Hamilton's death from dueling Vice President Burr, launches on the subway into a telling of the Duel That Should Have Happened: Hamilton vs. Jefferson at twenty paces. So exciting is her proposition that her fellow commuters exit the station to reenact that very scene. And in the third and final act in the series, an old woman presents a speech detailing Hamilton's friendship with Washington and Washington's recruitment of a young Hamilton during the Revolutionary War. Enlisted as an aide-de-camp, Hamilton quickly began to influence Washington with his political and strategic acumen. In each of these stories, the narrating female blurs the line between admiration and infatuation, turning appreciation into romance in a charming sort of way. Kelso's Hamiltonian tales are the high-point of the collection and may function as sort of a proto-Beaton treatment of the historical. I would absolutely read an entire book by Kelso, devoted to Hamilton and written in this manner: humourous, educational, engaging—saying perhaps as much about Kelso as it does about Hamilton himself.[image][Oh, Alex. You're basically right out of a Decemberists song]The rest of her stories (I say that as if they are all cut from similar cloth, which isn't accurate) all demonstrate a careful attention to the mundane moments that constitute the grand panorama of a person's life. I obviously preferred some of these stories to others, but recognizable in each was a certain kind of existential patience, an ability to focus on that which might otherwise escape attention. One wordless piece extends only so long as the duration of a family slideshow. Each page is comprised of four equally sized panels, one of which is a Kodachrome slide featuring some aspect of the family vacation. The intervening three panels may depict all the uncaptured moments to which each slide alludes in the imaginations/memories of the family members. These are a sweet several pages, and while the story's purpose may be slight, it's a lyrical presentation and novel idea. Another story, of two girls learning to waltz, invokes images of 2001: A Space Odyssey as a mother retreats happily to her imagination. A highlight of Kelso's storytelling in that piece is in her drawn exploration of how in a waltz the dancers should find themselves within the flow of music as if in a gentle river. It's a beautiful use of visual metaphor.[image]One curiosity is the book's title: The Squirrel Mother. It's also the name of the collection's first story, which is I presume the reason the book inherited the title. I'm rarely sure of the wisdom of naming a collection after its first story (or even of naming it after a particular story from a collection). My favourite short story collection, Murakami's Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman is also named for its initial story and that has always bothered me. The story is not indicative of what else fills that book. It's not representative and it doesn't relate. Though they're lesser collections, I much prefer titles such as After the Quake (also by Murakami) and Nocturnes (by Ishiguro). These are indicators of what awaits the reader, clues as to what lurks within the books' pages. Choosing a name for a collection is difficult, of course, but rewards I think both the author and the reader, giving a better hook for approaching and understanding the works collected. This is really a trivial complaint and doesn't affect my opinion of Kelso's book save for in the least consequential of ways. I was just disappointed that 1) ""Squirrel Mother"" was far from my favourite story here collected and 2) it wasn't indicative of some of the great pieces that Kelso elected to include.[image]Camping sucks, ammirite?As mentioned, The Squirrel Mother, like the vast majority of anthologies is a mix of strong and weak stories. Save for the rambunctious, exciting Alexander Hamilton bits (which really won my heart), Kelso's stories seem quiet, reflective pieces more intended to invoke a mood, a feeling, or an era than to pursue any great narrative purpose. Some readers will enjoy and some won't. It pays to be aware of what kind of a reader you are before you choose whether to approach Kelso's work. If you need closure and dislike a story that abruptly ends without resolution, then The Squirrel Mother may likely only frustrate you. If you enjoy spending a little time among characters with whom you'll never share more than a transient acquaintance, then The Squirrel Mother may be just the book to take in over lunch one day. If you like Alexander Hamilton at all, then Kelso's book demands a place on your shelf.** Notes* I'm being funny here. While I think that in many ways criticism has access to a wider breadth of theory and critical tools than at any other point in recognized history, critics are still just people who are swayed by their biases and hampered by their ignorances. And consumers still regard critics with suspicion, aware that for all their pronouncements, critics are just as governed by their tastes as consumers are—and the average consumer is more aware of the fact that tastes don't reflect any objective aesthetic rule.** The Hamilton stuff is that good._____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Aug 02, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/47090.Squirrel_Mother

The primary hurdle is[image]In my Baby's in Black , I discussed the difficulties that confront non-fictional accounts of historical events. The primary hurdle is reader foreknowledge. If you're already aware (spoilers!) that Amelia Earhart doesn't complete her round-the-world flight, that Lee surrenders at the Appomattox Courthouse, that Jesus comes back to life in the end—then all the drama surrounding those events is sucked out of the telling. Reader investment, then, must be engaged in other ways. Titanic, for instance, couldn't just be a movie about how a boat sank (since the only reason anyone is aware of the Titanic is because it sank). James Cameron decided to make it a love story set on the backdrop of a sinking boat because everybody would go into it well aware that the boat wouldn't survive the end credits. The drama then was not in whether the boat would sink but in the romance and survival of its principal couple.True crime is as much beholden to this rule as any other genre, and in many cases everyone goes into the story knowing the end of the matter. The Ted Bundy story ends either with Bundy getting caught or with his execution. The Unabomber story ends perhaps with the arrest or trial of Theodore Kaczynski. The John Wilkes Booth story ends with Booth dead on a porch at Garrett's farm. And the Green River Killer was Gary Ridgway and he was discovered and arrested two decades after his first murders. These are known facts, and prior knowledge of them could destroy any sense of anticipation in reading a retelling of the events. Fortunately, author Jeff Jensen has something better up his sleeve.[image]When one recalls the stale story direction of David Fincher's film adaptation, Zodiac, which followed the unsolved case of the Zodiac Killer, it becomes doubly apparent how deliciously good The Green River Killer is. Rather than give a rote recountment of events and try to hold onto the mystery of the murderer's identity for as long as possible, Jensen rather quickly zooms the reader from a chilling introduction to the killer in 1965 to Detective Tom Jensen's 2003 interrogation of Gary Ridgway, two years after his arrest. Ridgway is introduced as the Green River Killer by page 32. From then and onward, author Jeff Jensen treats the reader to a narrative that hops back and forth across the prior twenty years as Detective Jensen and Ridgway discuss and to some extent relive Ridgeway's murder of more than fifty women. The tension and drama come in as we discover that the detective (who is the real-life father of Jeff Jensen, the book's writer) wants to come away from his 188 days interviewing the murderer with a very particular piece of information. What is it and will Tom Jensen's curiosity be satisfied? Will he and his family survive in the meantime? These are the threads that weave through Green River Killer: A True Detective Story, and watching them resolve is exciting and satisfying.Serial killers hold an often irrational grasp over the imaginations of the public. When I was a kid growing up in Orange County, the entire community (so far as I could tell) lived in terror of Richard Ramirez, the Night Stalker. Even though no one in my town (a small beach community far from the freeway) was a potential victim, we lived on alert, fearing that we could be next. Seattle (at least in Jensen's book) likewise reacted to the Green River Killer—who only killed prostitutes—with a kind of widespread, irrational panic. Perhaps it's the loss of faith in a city's paid protection that sparks fear in a victimized community. Or maybe it's founded on the sense of helplessness that accompanies the knowledge that there is a serial murderer at large—a killer that the police seem inadequate to the task of detecting, let alone capturing. Jeff Jensen and Jonathan Case do an admirable job capturing Seattle's sense of panic, even if rarely showing any member of the community who isn't either a detective, a corpse, or a killer. [image]Jensen does this other interesting thing with Green River Killer: he writes Ridgway as almost sympathetic. Certainly he's still a creepy sociopath with more victims than perhaps any other American serial killer. But by the time the narrative catches up with him, Ridgway's just a sad-sack, middle-aged man trying his darnedest to be of assistance to the detectives interviewing him. He's a little bit bewildered and a little bit vulnerable. And he rarely exudes anything resembling an aura of menace. He timidly jokes with his captors and tries to make friends with them even as he details his murders in order to plea bargain down to a mere lifetime-imprisonment. It's unnerving once you recognize that you've grown comfortable with the character. (That is if you do grow comfortable, of course. I did, but I presume others might not so easily forget how sinister the man is.) This on its own is a huge triumph of the book and one for which Jensen should be proud.[image]Still, enough about Jeff Jensen and his ""words."" I have a crush on Jonathan Case and want to have his art babies. I'm not certain who exactly is responsible for pairing Jensen and Case on this project (Sierra Hahn, maybe?), but the marriage is unblemished. I actually can't imagine a better artistic direction for depicting these figures and the macabre muck through which they must wade in their quest for Truth. Case's art is reminiscent of David Lapham's Stray Bullets-era work, only slightly more polished and employing far less punk-lunacy. His opening salvo of a young Ridgway testing the waters of his mania is devastating and perfect. In ing Uzumaki, I wrote how I didn't believe comics could adequately convey a sense of horror because of the unsurprising way in which panels pace a story. If there was ever a counter-argument, I believe this story segment is it.[image][This panel of Ridgway is so pregnant with apprehensive malice that a book filled with such moments would be utterly exhausting.]I'm not huge on true crime (though I've enjoyed Eric Larsen's The Devil in the White City—me and 98% of the people who've read it!—and Rick Geary's Treasury of 19th/20th Century Murder) and I rarely see it handled in a way that makes me want to take it up as a regular staple in my reading queue, but I loved Green River Killer. If I run into a few more examples of the genre that are this good, I might just revise my position to: Avid Reader of Good True Crime._____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,not set,"Aug 02, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11489682-green-river-killer

It's to presume a sort of easy familiarity, the kind that brings to mind a warm comfortability or provokes a sense of native intimacy. To a person who could say ""Tokyo is my garden,"" the culture, language, people, and geography of that city must be known in a manner that surpasses mere acquaintance. To such a person, Tokyo itself must be family. For that person to be a Westerner? Well, that plays into a host of Western male fantasies and is therefore ripe for thought experiments and criticism.Successful integration into Japanese society has at least for a few decades been an idle dream for many Caucasian Western males. The fantasy carries some of the romance of the early twentieth century ex-pats who made their beds in Europe and mixes liberally with the exoticism of a historically rich culture that remains, at best, only vaguely understood in the West. Throw in whatever mythologies surround the concept of geisha (for a demure yet ferocious sexuality mixed with what appears to many Caucasians to be an exotic kind of ageless beauty) and then add in the various honour codes associated with bushido and samurai ways. Stew these with a collection of visual delights from across the ages—sumi-e paintings, views of Mount Fuji, manga, anime, kanji, yukatas—and you've crafted something irresistibly delectable to a very particular kind of man. This is a recognizable social fantasy and there are off-colour* terms like ""yellow fever"" for a reason.[image]I myself, as a youngster, thought that nothing would be cooler than moving to Japan, embracing the culture, and being readily able to partake in life in that country. I would, of course, live in Tokyo. That was in junior high and I didn't have in mind Rivers Cuomo's fabled half-Asian cellist or any sort of erotic/romantic conquest. I just wanted to be where Nintendo games came out years before my American friends would get them. I was a man of simple pleasures. With age and wisdom, I began to realize that successful integration into such a foreign culture wouldn't be any facile sort of experience (this is expanded upon in my  of Love As a Foreign Language). My grasp on reality was too firm for my dream to survive. It's probably a good thing that I hadn't read Tokyo Is My Garden while I was still young: I might have fooled myself into believing I could easily adapt to Tokyo life by simply possessing an earnest appreciation for kanji.That's how it is for David Martin, Tokyo Is My Garden's protagonist. The people he works with at a fish market shout out his name in welcome. He wows Tokyoites with a knowledge of kanji that is daunting even to natives. He knows where all the best night spots are. And though he might have just been thrown out of his girlfriend's apartment (she was a model), he's quickly picked up a new one (a slick business professional who might as well be a model). He may have troubles, but none of them have to do with his reception by the people of Japan.[image]Playing to type, David's one constant thorn relates to his own native land. Generally, the Westerner who dreams of exotic success in Japan is someone whose life in the West isn't panning out glamourously. It's like the kind of dorky kid in junior high who's not even in the running for being considered popular—he imagines that if he'd only move to a new school, that'd be his big chance to rewrite his fortunes. When that kid grows up a little, he'll recognize that just changing schools isn't enough. He'll need to go somewhere where his novelty won't wear off in the space of a single day. He'll need to go somewhere where he'll naturally stand out. And if he's white, then Japan is a natural destination candidate. Sure, he could go to Kenya, but he's a little bit uncomfortable with all those black people. He could go to Peru, but he doesn't remember seeing any Peruvian comics that go out of their way to show off teenagers' panties, so... Japan it is. I mean, fraught with biases and misconceptions as he is, it might as well be Japan—which he doesn't actually understand any better than he does Kenya or Peru or even his own high school's cultural pool. And he'll be fine so long as his old school doesn't come back to haunt him.[image]David is haunted by his real job and the ostensible reason he's in Tokyo to begin with. He's a sales rep for a small French firm that produces brandy. He's been in Tokyo for three years, supposedly learning the lay of the land and preparing contacts and hocking the company wares. Only: he's really only majored in girls, parties, and studying kanji. His boss is set to arrive in three weeks to evaluate his performance and he has yet to sell a single bottle of the product. He's worried that his dream could vanish, that his celebrity could be left behind while he's dragged back to France. It's a hard-knock life.While Tokyo Is My Garden is the story of what will happen to David and how on earth will he pull out of this scrape, it's also the story of a dream. This book is the compiled navigation charts for a group fantasy. David is kind of really completely obnoxious in that he's living the life so many nerdy young white males would drain the blood of virgins for—and worse, he deserves it as much as they do. He's kind of losery, kind of a bum, kind of not the kind of person you'd expect to be rolling in models. Unless you're the very particular kind of person who could find Boilet and Peeters' story remotely believable.It's a strange mix. Boilet has made it his goal to produce nothing that is not taken from reality. As we saw in Yukiko's Spinach, his images are drawn from video footage. His poses are realistic and his figures are believably proportioned. And yet, his story must take place in a dreamworld. David Martin is the envy of Tokyo and he does nothing to merit that goodwill save learn the language. It's preposterous. Then again Boilet, who is a cartoonist and not a rockstar, takes video of all sorts of things that the average joe probably couldn't imagine taping. All for his drawings, sure, but nonetheless: if a cartoonist can experience that degree of worldly hoo-hah, then perhaps David Martin's story isn't so wholly unbelievable after all. Score one for the white and nerdy.[image]In any case, up until the halfway point, I was ready to think mediocre thoughts of the book. David did nothing for me, I didn't find his position very plausible, and I couldn't be concerned to know that his three years of fraud might be found out. I was, plainly, not invested in his problems. Then, strangely, I began to warm to his plight. With the arrival of his boss, I found myself taken in, charmed by this guy and his life. David never approached becoming a charismatic figure for me, but I did find that I came to care for him. Perhaps out of pity. Perhaps out of a sense of lost romanticism. I can't say whether my newfound good feeling toward Tokyo Is My Garden was due the creators' efforts or wholly some chemistry lodged internally within my heart. The end of the matter was that I enjoyed the book and was happy to have read it. How others will take to it, I cannot begin to know. I can only say that I thought it a good book—in the end.Notes* Punned!** Boilet does this interesting thing that I hadn't caught on to until late in the game.He'll set these two examples of kanji (what they mean, I do not know) in the corners of certain word balloons.

One can take the idea and simply run with it, expecting readers to give in to the demands of suspendable disbelief. Alternatively, an author can exert a lot of effort to couch his concept in plausibilities, striving to explain things in scientific terms (or at least in terms that could be scientific). Each method has its fans, but generally in the last few decades anecdotal evidence leads me to think that all but the lowest common denominators in our culture appreciate authors who will put at least some effort into the conveyance of Believability. Most contemporary authors, I believe, will find themselves somewhere in the middle, wanting to focus on their stories but still feeling the responsibility to at least offer tacit explanations for the strange and amazing things that happen in their stories.To that end, we have the writers of LOST toying with concepts of electro-magnetism and quantum theory. We find Brian K. Vaughan using socio-scientific theory to explain the plague he unleashes in Y: The Last Man. We get movies like Moon and Jurassic Park. We also have George Lucas turning the mystery of the Force into an empirically quantifiable convocation of microscopic organisms. (So it doesn't always result in wooing the audience.) Matt Kindt, with 3 Story, finds himself in this set of authors—and he succeeds better than many of them.When you write a story about the tallest man in the world, a man who eventually will grow to be the size of skyscrapers, you may be tempted to leave it at that. Maybe settle on solely focusing on the troubles that go with (physically) not fitting in? Maybe let him be a hero worthy of his (physical) stature? I actually don't know what could be done in a story with a giant man. (I may actually have satisfied the whole of my interest in giant-man stories because Kindt's is so deliciously composed. More on composition later.) What Kindt does, beyond providing a throwaway explanation for Craig Pressgang's abnormal lifelong growth spurt, is propose a couple possibly reasonable side-effects to a human attaining such a size. I don't know how plausible Kindt's extrapolations of Pressgang's condition are, but they seem fairly reliable and may have been developed from verified difficulties experienced by Robert Wadlow, the Giant of Illinois (the tallest-recorded man in the world). [image]In the end Kindt's fidelity to medical accuracy, while a particular charm of 3 Story, is probably unnecessary to the effect of the work upon the reader. The book works well with these details but I imagine it would work well without them. At heart, the story of Craig's life (as told by the three primary women in his life) is about alienation and community. And while details like Craig's inability to register physical contact in meaningful ways heighten our sense of his distance from those around him, the tableaux on which Kindt paints is bleak enough that such particulars—while decorative—are not foundational to the work.3 Story, though telling a single story, is (appropriately) divided into three discreet narratives. With growing awareness of the presence of a culture of sexism, a story narrated by three woman who tell the story of a man might put many readers on alert. After all, there continues to be a tendency in male-penned literary media to use females to magnify male protagonists. And while it's true that in many ways these three women's lives are circumscribed by Craig Pressgang's presence in their lives, the story might be seen as being at least as much about each of them as it is about Craig. Their lives are not defined so much by Craig's maleness as they are by their relationships to him and what his condition means to all four of them. 3 Story is the story of family and the alienation and closeness that can result when circumstances cause one member to be highlighted for good or ill. Craig, for much of the story, is an impenetrable person, walled off by his condition. It's in his mother's, wife's, and daughter's words and experiences that we learn who these people are and who tragedy will shape them to be. Kindt's treatment of his characters is often spare on words, but it's in gestures and timing that his tapestry of their heartbreaks unfurls.[image]Kindt resumes the kind of inventive page design and formal experimentation that was such a winning choice in Super Spy. I don't know how great an illustrator Kindt is—his style (as revealed in the three books of his I've read) is rather simple and keeps any sense of photorealism at arm's length. It doesn't really matter. He could be a terrible cartoonist who really just adores the opportunities of the medium. He could be Alex Toth. It doesn't matter. His drawing is good enough for the stories he drives because his design sense is impeccable. Similar to Adam Hines, whose visual work on Duncan the Wonder Dog was one of the stand-out comics achievements of 2010 (Hines is up front about not being a talented illustrator), Kindt uses a number of texturing tricks to add body and weight to his work. In addition, adding to 3 Story's visual aesthetic with what I presume is some handy photoshopping, Kindt relies on interview-style narrative interruptions as well as the kind of x-ray-style perspective that made Super Spy a treat. These little flourishes add an immeasurable something to the work and help elevate it from being merely another exploration of the human condition. Even in the depths of the human murk, Kindt displays an evident playfulness—and that sense of play makes more winning a vaguely morose story.[image]In writing about Kindt's Super Spy, I concluded:The book’s strength instead lies in the very human way in which it approaches a world that is far beyond the coping mechanisms of its contributors. These people, no matter how thinly sketched, are always people—are always worth the time of your consideration. They are just as sad, broken, and hopeful as real people are and when their stories end, those conclusions are just as stupid, pointless, and tragic as they would be in real life.This may be safely said of 3 Story as well. For while this book ends on a slightly more buoyant note, Kindt's story about a very tall man and the women whose lives his stature dominates is just as much about real people—no matter how fictional they may be.[image]_____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,not set,"Jul 25, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6351480-3-story

Whether a positive or negative bias, these prejudices [image]I've written before about expectations and how they cheat us of our reading experiences. Whether a positive or negative bias, these prejudices do unquestionable damage to the natural formation of opinion. A strong positive predisposition toward a book can push us to massage problems in a work to reflect our existing good will toward it—or, if the work too abruptly veers from our expectations, those expectations can lead to a sense of betrayal that wouldn't otherwise come about. A negative feeling toward a book can likewise either sour us unfairly toward the work or too easily endear us when things turn out better than we might have guessed. And this isn't just a dynamic that exists before a book is opened. Expectation is interlaced throughout one's experience of a story in a manner both complex and largely unpredictable. What we expect of a book is a force that plays in every moment of a book's consumption, from taking in its cover to its method of introduction to its characterization to those characters' arcs to plot points along the way to its use of thematic elements to its climax to its conclusion. And to any number of other parts and pieces along the way. While reading a book, our expectations will naturally shift as we assimilate new information with our experiences and awareness of other stories and formulae. So while we may try to give books a fair shake, it's impossible to approach things from an entirely neutral vantage. This is all very elemental critical theory of course and probably doesn't surprise a single one of you. I only mention it so that you'll be well on alert to my own predispositions in regard to King City.Among the myriad tastes and experiences that influenced how I would approach reading King City, there were two major (and conflicting) things that exerted some force me. The first was the excitement/praise cycle that caused me to buy the book. If it wasn't for tremendous word of mouth, I wouldn't have been aware of King City in the least—let alone have been persuaded to spend of my limited budget to secure a copy. That right there is the kind of good feeling toward a book that I mentioned earlier, usually a boon but sometimes an albatross. In any case, I was excited for King City when the package arrived in the mail. Opening the book, however, led immediately to a sense of betrayal, as Brandon Graham's visual sense conjured a whole host of predispositions—none of which were conducive to a just approach to his work.So I took a couple weeks to let those dueling expectations dim before I read a single page of King City. I think that was probably the right decision.King City is a wonky, sly-futuristic extrapolation of a ton of implausibilities caked in that kind of alt-formal art style I (rightly or wrongly) associate with a skate-punk, indie DIY aesthetic. It's the art style that made me put down the book for two weeks. Generally, this visual method means cluttered, cacophonous pages filled with too much Stuff and disastrous visual storytelling. The characters are cartoony and not always super consistent. There's nothing necessarily wrong with the style save for the fact that I just don't have the patience for it.But Graham's work in King City, though often busy and often manic, surprised me by being easy to follow and sometimes even a raucous joy to experience. There's a lot going on in this book both visually and narratively, but it doesn't bog down in overly detailed renditions of scenery. It may be that the importance of King City as its own kind of character gives meaning to all those flourishes that would otherwise be decorative trivialities.[image]While King City is principally concerned with Joe, a spy-thief and cat master, and his feline companion Earthling, the city he's returned to on Page 1 is nearly as important. King City in Graham is like L.A. in Chandler or Tokyo in Murakami or New York in Auster—only hopped up on two fistfuls of crazy. The city is populated by ninjas, mercenaries, spies, hoods, thieves, cults, aliens, and weirder things. There are secret passages into even the most mundane places. There are hideouts and tentacles and drugs made from humans. And puns. There are a lot of puns. If puns aren't your thing, then King City is not your thing. For that matter King City might not be your thing either. A knack for wordplay may be low-ball humour, but that's only tip-of-iceberg here. Graham has built a world that, while thriving on sex and violence, glories more than anything in a sense of humour and comic timing. Personally, I found very winning the particular joy Graham exhibits in giving his characters the stage and ability to make so consistently with the funny.So far as story is concerned (and it really isn't too concerned), King City reflects on cat master Joe as he returns from a couple years away. He had fled the city after a bad break-up and holed up on The Farm, where he learned the Way of the Cat and received his boon companion, Earthling, whom he carries around in a bucket. Joe is doing some sneak-thief work to ingratiate himself to the locals while he tries to find his feet in a city that's changed while he's been away. Meanwhile, his old friend Pete Taifighter (who wears constantly from a collection of wrestling masks) has decided to cross his employers Transporter-style after having grown a conscience. Meanwhile still, Anna Greengables (Joe's ex) is painting graffiti moustaches and worrying over her drug-conflicted ex-mercenary boyfriend, who's got bad PTS from the last Xombie war. And then, on top of that, there's a death cult and tentacle monster and the fate of the world. Or at least King City.[image]It's a good mix of everything and kitchen sinks and bathroom scales and old-timey refrigerators. King City boasts a healthy menagerie of wild abandonments and ridiculousness and tempers it with a lot of heart. More heart than I would have expected from something that wallowed in so much indie-skater-punk aesthetic. Brandon Graham, in a word made of three words, defied my expectations. In a good way. Or maybe in the best way. King City was a wonderful experience.NoteIf there's one major issue with the book (and by major, I really just mean a triviality that's kind of a shame), it's with the printing. Most pages are crisp and lovely, but a good handful show easily-visible jpeg artifacting. It gives the linework on those pages a blurry feel that dims the enjoyment slightly. Below, I've provided an example of what I'm talking about. I've upped the contrast a little to take into consideration monitors that are too bright:[image]_____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,not set,"Jul 25, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13516050-king-city

I had heard a lot of good things about it both from friends who adored the bastardized American release fifteen years earlier, Warriors of the Wind, and from friends who regularly sought out Japanese fare. Weeks earlier, I was able to get ahold of a Hong Kong set of all of Miyazaki's works up to that point and was slowly working my way through the collection. When I finally arrived at Nausicaä, I was very excited, having saved the best for last.Long story short: it sucked. Or at least it did in my mind at the time. The problem was that I was still too much a purist, too much a fan. It's an issue that I've mostly sewn up in a burlap sack for disposal into the nearby lake, but at the time my disappointment in the cinema realization of Nausicaä was tremendous. The source of my complaint was that I had read Miyazaki's manga by the same title. Two works, both named Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind. One was a masterwork, an epic adventure fraught with complex characters, intrigue, and a sense of grandeur; the other was just a movie.I'm sure that I would have loved the animated film as much as anyone else had I not read Miyazaki's collection of the story in comics form. The problem was that once I had immersed myself so deeply into a sprawling world in which characters were built as if human, with multi-layered motivations, histories, cultures, and customs, the film version almost had to suffer by the comparison. Nausicaä, for many, was an example of Miyazaki's directing and Ghibli's animation style in top form. But for me, fresh from what I considered to be one of the best examples of the comics medium, there was no way for me to see the film as anything but a sad, incomplete replica of what was a staggering work of genius.[image]Granted, Miyazaki was only one-quarter-finished with the story (in comics form) when he made the animated film version of it, so there's no way it could have the depth of the graphic novel. Granted, it would be impossible to convey even a fraction of Nausicaä's story in a single two-hour film. Granted again, I was an overly-invested simpleton at the time, a purist through-and-through, demanding that film versions of beloved stories be faithful adaptations of their source material. It wasn't a happy way to live, being constantly disappointed by product that didn't hold its source as valuable as I did. Fortunately, I've been healed of my purist tendencies. Maybe I'll one day be able to approach the cinematic Nausicaä with new eyes. But for now, I'm just happy to reread the original.The story of Nausicaä is robust. It travels a lot of territory and the narrative terrain shifts constantly. The story at page 100 is different from the story at page 200 is different from the story at page 300. Et cetera. Miyazaki keeps the reader off-balance, constantly renegotiating what his story is actually about. In the hands of a lesser author, Nausicaä would seem a confused jumble of ideas, an evolving puzzle its own author could not solve. Fortunately, and I think most of the world probably knows this by now, Miyazaki is among the best storytellers of our age. It shows in Nausicaä. The sureness of his authorial footing in this book is never at doubt. From beginning to end, we are on his ground and it's a good place to be.[image]Nausicaä tells the story of the post-cataclysmic Earth, a millennium after its destruction by the hands of a weaponized robotic army (presumably created by mankind herself). Humanity has barely survived the nuclear fires that tore civilization apart. The earth itself, polluted beyond its ability to heal in a normal manner, has given birth to a terrible new forest. Called the Sea of Corruption, this roiling swath of strange new flora means death to those that it engulfs, for its air is unbreathable. As land becomes more and more scarce due to this growing threat, wars break out and the future of humanity is threatened all the more. In the midst of this, Nausicaä, a princess of a small outlying tribe, seeks to unravel the mysteries of the Sea of Corruption while negotiating a dangerous path between two warring nations. The princess herself is a mystery to all those she encounters, part chaos, part mercy, and always navigating her own path.[image][This scene ends pretty much how you might guess.]For those familiar with Miyazaki's films, the art will seem a familiar prototype, an early version of what would become the Ghibli house style for the next thirty years. In tone, Nausicaä probably closest resembles the sometimes violent action and environmentalism of Princess Mononoke (though those that weary of that message shouldn't be overly put off by its expression here). The story is long and many panels are more text than imagery as Miyazaki attempts to sensibly exposit his narrative. The tale requires patience and perseverance, but it rewards its pursuers. There are a number of great adventures told through the comics medium, but Nausicaä is so far—and pretty easily—the best of show.___________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,not set,not set,"Apr 20, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/626339.Nausica_of_the_Valley_of_the_Wind_Vol_1

I still probably wouldn't have thought it magnificent, but I definitely would have believed it more original, inventive, and surprising. I would have thought it high-concept instead of regurgitated concept. And I'm pretty sure that it isn't super fair for me to be so governed by the feeling that I had already been there and done that—by having read Joe Kelley's superior story of the overlap between imagination and reality.So let's question for a moment the value of originality. We often hear praise for a work nestled sweetly in terms like ""Creative!"" or ""Original!"" or ""Imaginative!"" In the end, this usually only tells the reader that the er hadn't before run across the ideas, plot, themes, or storytelling method. Because a er can't have read every book written or heard every story told, references to originality generally ring pretty hollow to those paying attention. After all, without complete knowledge, the  cannot possibly make any such definitive statement. Case in point:When I was in eighth/ninth grade, I was a moron. Well, maybe not a moron, but I had that kind of hubris typical to young teens who have made some discoveries about the world around them and then have the temerity to believe themselves Knowledgeable. As an eighth/ninth grader, I loved a newish band called Winger (you may feel free here to reassign my young teen self to the category of Moron). Winger had a couple songs I liked at the time* so I picked up the album on cassette. At the end of side one, there was a song called ""Purple Haze."" It was okay. Despite that, I heard the song a lot since you couldn't reliably skip songs on cassette without a walkman more awesome than what an eighth/ninth grader could come up with. So when I got into a conversation with a friend in Drafting class and ""Purple Haze"" came up, I was adamant that it was a Winger song. I allowed that this guy Jimi Hendrix (whoever he was) might have covered Winger's song, but insisted that ""Purple Haze"" by Winger was definitely original because I had never heard Hendrix's version before. When I got home, I asked my dad if he had heard of some guy named Jimi Hendrix. And man did I feel deflated.That right there was a hard and embarrassing story to tell—but it's apropos because every time someone revels in a work's originality, they're basically reenacting my conversation in Drafting 1. What they're really saying is that they haven't yet personally seen anything like the work being discussed. And that's fine. People deserve to have first experiences left and right if they're able. But we shouldn't ever presume originality because that would just be arrogant of us.[image][See? Arrogance]The flip side then is the question of whether something should be of greater value simply because we haven't yet experienced anything analogous. Put like that, we can probably pretty easily realize that No, of course a thing isn't inherently better simply because it feels fresh to us. Only, because we're people and people tend to enjoy new experiences, we also tend to veer toward over-enjoying things that feel new to us—things that we might be tempted to describe as original unless we know better. I do this and, I presume, you do this. It's natural. But with the understanding of our natures comes a certain responsibility to rationally approach our experiences, ready to divorce ourselves from the brunt of that feeling of Holy cats I've never seen anything like this before! (I mean, insofar as we intend to be critically concerned with the works we consume; I don't think there's probably any such responsibility outside the realm of equitable criticism.) And then, this applies not just to works that feel fresh but also to those creative products that feel like they may retread worn ground. It's fine, according to your personal tastes, to choose to indulge works that move in directions you've yet to experience, but as critics of the texts we devour, we should at least attempt to raise ourselves above that kind of pettiness. Or at least alert our readers to the present bias.So consider yourselves alerted. I will of course do my utmost to keep ""originality"" from infecting my reading of Joe the Barbarian, but I'll leave it to you to decide how well I succeed. Because, man, this felt like it shared a lot of common ground with I Kill Giants, an Image book from just a couple years back. I'll just leave that there.Joe isn't much of a barbarian. He's not much of anything outside of a fatherless teen with a big geeky imagination and the kind of disposition that makes him the target of bullies. He's also got diabetes bad enough that an errant journey into the land of hypoglycemia has him seeing all sorts of hallucinated extrapolations of his everyday world. And not just crazy hallucinations but full-fledged, rounded-out scene shifts built of a robust cast of characters and playing according to a coherent-if-bizarre narrative thread. I'm not even sure that's a possible effect of deeply low blood-sugar. So maybe he's super enough to be a barbarian after all. Or at least a wizard-alchemist.[image]Because he gets picked on one rainy day, Joe neglects to eat his candy bars. He makes some poor decisions and ends up finding his mind straddling this world and one made up of his toys and fears—all while his body is collapsing from some sort of hypoglycemic shock. All he wants is a Pepsi. But no one will give it to him. So things continue apace and he tries to get downstairs to the fridge while all sorts of fantasy tropes stand in his way or try to befriend him.It would probably be a harrowing tale if Joe was someone I could invest myself in more. It could be that we just don't ever get to see Joe at his most endearing. He begins the book mopey and glum—and angry at his dumb dad who had to go and die as a soldier in a pointless war. Within pages, he's no longer mopey but simple glazed by his diabetic condition. There's not a lot to work with. We do get to see a more loquacious version of Joe in his fantasy world, but for a fabricated self, Joe is pretty timid in that world too. He mostly gets swept along with the schemes of his allies, contributing occasionally as he comes to recognize that he sort of has to. [image]So a lot of things happen and something is at stake but we can never quite buy into the idea that anything is really at jeopardy in the more fantastic of the two realms. And then, if the imaginary realm in which these great battles take place is supposed to reflect Joe's real life problems (even if only psychological in nature), it's not very clear how any victories or losses there will effect Joe's life—if he can ever get his hands on that damned Pepsi.Still, while I remained unattached to Joe's character and unengaged by his story, Sean Murphy's art is HOLY KRACKINAMOLEY!!!** Forgetting the always helpful hand that Dave Stewart's colouring lends any book, Murphy draws the heck out of this thing. I don't believe I've ever seen his work before, but I'll be keeping an eye out for his name on projects from this point forward. His staging is superb and he breathes life into even his most fantastic creatures. The expressiveness he portrays through even the roguish barbarian rat outdoes what many artists can accomplish with human faces. As mediocre as Morrison's script and story are (to my eye at any rate), without Murphy's interpretations of that story, Joe the Barbarian would have fallen disastrously flat. [image]As it is, Murphy at least turns a mediocre book into something really pretty to look at. I'll let other people figure out how plausible Joe's descent into madness and the climactic wrap-up would be from a medical stand point. Though I scratched my head at all that, Morrison couldn't keep me interested enough in Joe's story to do the legwork myself. I like the idea of exploring the line between this world and the ones created in our minds while chemistry is at play, but I simply didn't find Joe a compelling version of the myriad possible tales that could plumb that concept's depths. Notes* As a fourteen-year-old, ""Seventeen"" was magical and fraught with all kinds of mystery that I wouldn't recognize as being ridiculously creepy until several years later.** Imagine that KRACKINAMOLEY is in Walt Simonson-style effects lettering.___________________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,not set,"Apr 04, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8714027-joe-the-barbarian

On the one hand, an author may hope to introduce in the reader's mind a critique of contemporary society, culture, or history by forcing a comparison of analogy. A Brave New World, 1984, Gattaca, Solaris, even Alien—these are stories whose goals are above and beyond the simple entertainment of the reader. These follow in the grand science-fiction tradition of giving readers easy tools with which to evaluate the current world-state by stripping the contemporary situation of its context. It's a time-honoured and noble pursuit.The other option, less praise-worthy perhaps, is the simple use of science-fiction elements to decorate well-worn stories and make them seem fresh or exciting. Star Wars, Predator, Treasure Planet, E.T., Aliens, or Back to the Future—there's nothing wrong with these stories in principle. They're fun and adventurous and make for an invigourating experience; but they're not exactly stories that couldn't exist successfully in non-science-fiction terms.[image]I have not read the works of Jack Vance—this Moon Moth adaptation is my introduction—but I hope his other works slide so neatly from these alternating taxonomies as well as The Moon Moth does. This isn't a work by which we examine our present culture's social ills; neither is it predictive, extrapolating out from some forseeable future. And it doesn't even so much dance a thrilling adventure epic to save the world from the A.I. threat or span galaxies to watch the combat of empires unfold. It probably wouldn't make a great film (though a great film might be set in these fascinating climes). Instead, The Moon Moth seems more a development of possibilities solely for the sake of deducing the directions they might take a people.The particular investigation at stake here is the quality and means of social communication if a civilization were to develop along a different, perhaps more elegant, vector. On Sirene, the world central to The Moon Moth, conversation is blatantly far from equitable. All discussion is embellished, pronounced, and finally given meaning through the use of instruments. Each instrument has a particular purpose, a goal through which status and intent is communicated. One instrument may convey wrath to a lesser member of the social hierarchy, while another when properly used may convey polite obsequience to a person of superior standing. Only the slave caste sings conversations unaccompanied by instrumentation, and that is a bare mark of their low station. Further complicating matters each citizen wears a mask, the make of which further codifies social station and directs which instruments should be played in conversation with each other citizen. All interactions on Sirene are conducted according to the concept of personal honour. There is no currency beyond one's personal honour—or more properly, what personal honour one may convince others he possesses. A citizen may wear a grand mask if he has the honour to pull it off. A citizen may take goods of the finest craftsmanship if he has the honour that would allow him to do so. On Sirene fortune favours not merely the bold however, for overstepping one's honour may lead to a speedy decapitation. Foreigners, then, are at a distinct disadvantage on this world, and being an offworlder ambassador would be a trial of great magnitude for even the most quick-witted diplomat.[image]The Moon Moth is constructed as a sort of thriller, engaging a not-so-quick-witted ambassador as he tries to unearth a murderer whose face he cannot know—after all, on Sirene we all wear masks and may change our masks at will so long as we can keep up with the demands of the masquerade. While there is some excitement over protagonist Ser Thissel's dilemma as he tries to detect a man who may be undetectable, the plot is not the book's central joy. This is good because that avenue is rather thin and even as the narrative turns to its final twist, we recognize that the story may have only ever been an excuse for us to engage Vance's strange, intricate world. I was fine with the story, but Ser Thissel (nearly incompetent for much of the book) and reaching the climax were never my motivations for remaining in The Moon Moth's grip.Vance and his adapter, Humayoun Ibrahim, have crafted a world that I've returned to over and again in thought over the several weeks since reading The Moon Moth. Not only is Vance's world fascinating, but Ibrahim's visual translation of the instrumental idea leaves me wondering how the story could have ever succeeded in bare prose. While I generally found Ibrahim's figure-drawing a weakness, the manner by which he effortlessly demonstrates both the instrument being used and the technical proficiency with which it is being played is so winning that I can hardly imagine the story in any other form. Comparing Ser Thissel's lurching melodic incompetence with the natural musicianship of Sirene's natives is caught by readers at a glance and the story's purposes are never hindered for lack of craftsmanship on this score.[image][In case you missed it, he's playing a violin with a sword. Badass!]There are some bumps to the road, however, the chief of which is the natural difficulty in translating a foreign language for readers in such a way as to make the text flow effortlessly. Because The Moon Moth is chiefly concerned with the exploration of a music/status based language, converting that simply to wholly verbal expression would be inadequate. There is some learning curve demanded of readers and Ibrahim does what he can to help by providing at the book's frontmatter a visual glossary of several instruments, the sounds they make, and the social implications of using each instrument. For the first few exchanges readers will doubtlessly be turning back to this glossary as an aid to understanding. Due this break in the reading rhythm, one's first experience of the text may feel staggered and a bit too staccato. I felt some of this myself but found a second reading to be far less punctuated and discovered a rhythmic sense that I missed on my first read-through. [image][This is basically like the inside cover of Vietnamerica that you keep flipping back to so you can tell who's who throughout the story]I'd be tempted to understand that kind of difficulty in the reading experience as a knock against the work, but in The Moon Moth's case I think the complexity of the idea merits the work it requires of the reader. As I said above, I've come back again and again over the intervening weeks to the concepts Vance and his interlocutor present in this small book. It's such a fascinating excursion into what makes a language and how language can direct a people that I can't help but enjoy it, despite any initial reservations I may have held. Ibrahim presents a colourful, intricate world—one only partially of his own making, but one worth our time nonetheless.___________________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Apr 04, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12632596-the-moon-moth

Concocting a story of one's own adventures to the end that they will be enjoyed by a readership of more than one's own friends and family takes a fair amount of self-confidence. Or hubris. Or arrogance. To imagine that one's own story is as valuable a use of a reader's time as a fictional character's takes guts. Or moxie. Or chutzpah. And then for an author to specially select for his autobiographical pericope a couple months' dalliance with a young woman and detail his own skill as an adventurous lover—what does that take?Frédéric Boilet's apparently autobiographical Yukiko's Spinach is part journal, part intimate recountment of a two-month-long interlude with a girl he meets at a gallery opening in Japan. So far as romances go, we learn from the start that this one is probably doomed to a brief lifespan since Yukiko, the object of Boilet's interest, is herself interested in someone else and will pursue that entanglement as soon as opportunity allows. It's in the meanwhile that she's willing to engage Boilet (or his autobiographical avatar) in some fitful and adventurous physical pairings, necessarily accelerating the evolution of their relationship at unnatural speeds towards its foreseeable culmination.As a book primarily interested in Yukiko's temporary place as Boilet's carnal muse, the book amusingly (from a very meta perspective) goes to deliberate lengths to demonstrate Boilet's part as a persistent, attentive lover. Whether absolutely non-fictional in this aspect or not, Boilet posits a version of himself that is a kind of indefatigable superman of the intimate. In the midst of their congress, he lingers over every part of Yukiko's form, making each portion of her body a new standard of beauty, even to the point of remolding imperfection (such as chicken pox scars) into aesthetic wonders. He turns every private moment into an opportunity to once more ravish his lover, disrobing her even as she dresses from their most recent congress. [image]As a story about two people luxuriating in a languid sort of passion, Yukiko's Spinach is actually pretty refreshing in that it sees little need to make any sort of narrative statement beyond this. This lack of pretension may itself seem ""artsy"" or even pretentious to some, but I found it elevated the value of the book. But when one considers that this is presented as autobiographical, the book moves beyond merely a statement about interpersonal intimacy and into a whole realm of psycho-social cross-cultural dynamics. Yukiko's Spinach is named for an instance in which Boilet lingers over every part of Yukiko's nude form. Ears, nose, neck, breasts, and so on. When he arrives at her navel, he mispronounces (as he is speaking entirely in Japanese) and uses a word that sounds like spinach rather than like navel. It's a humourous error and introduces a bit of levity into a scene that could have otherwise played as too heavily romantic. The mistake opens the book up to a number of interpretive frameworks. Is Boilet merely recounting an interesting sexual anecdote or does he wish to say something more? Whatever his purpose, Yukiko's Spinach at least functions as much as a glance into the marriage of distinct cultures as Yukiko's ""spinach"" does within the context of her and Boilet's relationship.[image]Boilet's character in the story seems part of an expatriated group of French artistic types and is familiar enough with Japan and the ins and outs of the culture to behave as some kind of nouvelle native. But despite having come so far, his culture and that of his romantic interest are each their own and it's clear that his goals are not hers (and vice versa). Even the manner by which they communicate uses different vocabularies—and though they may be able to suss out each other's meanings, there will remain any number of trivial obstacles like Yukiko's ""spinach."" At least such barriers will persist until the couple grows fully accustomed to each other, becoming natives in each other's personal kingdoms—or better, forging a new one, with its own rules, customs, and language, like Howard W. Campbell Jr's das reich der zwei. Yet because of the colossal strength of these individuals' particular personal anthems, we know such a nation of two will never likely come about.So Yukiko's Spinach exists as a revelry in a moment, a snapshot of the perfect vacation marred only by the inevitable collapse and loss at its conclusion. As autobiography, one wonders what Boilet was trying to communicate to himself—for memoir as often speaks some truth to the author as it does to the reader. If he seems somewhat set adrift (exemplified by the transient nature of his dalliances), perhaps that is a reflection of his status as a resident foreigner. He's clearly looking for stability but simultaneously doesn't seem to rely on its attainability. Boilet's character seems a man trapped in flux. It's an interesting place for a protagonist to be and most of us could probably relate on some level from at least one moment in our lives.One of the standout praises Yukiko's Spinach will receive almost across the board is in regard to its artistic vision. The reader sees the story unfold almost entirely in the first person. The camera through which we encounter Boilet's experience with Yukiko is, for the most part, lodged in Boilet's own eyes. It's a curious technique and we are treated to a man with a perspective that roams over the entirety of his surroundings, rarely meeting Yukiko's gaze eye-to-eye. Through this scattering of vision, Boilet unveils a character that might otherwise remain unknown. His avatar is made real by his evident distractions. [image]Boilet also uses a photorealistic style that generally pays off well. He almost certainly uses models extensively (and a later story, Mariko Parade, apparently involves Boilet and his next model, whom he meets in the final pages of Yukiko's Spinach). This lends to the veracity of these experiences and conveys the idea that these are real people with real motivations and personal curiosities. On a couple occasions, the drawings feel awkward (such as when he depicts a fellow French expat who may be leering bizarrely at Yukiko), but on the whole they are accomplished and flow well within his framework. The other formal trick Boilet uses to magnify his narrative flow is the inclusion of journal pages that contain a variety of sketches and written lines. These further ground the story in the subjective narration of Boilet himself. Despite how cool Boilet's art is and how well-chosen the moments, angles, and subjects are, it may have been the inclusion of the journal pages that solidifies Yukiko's Spinach as great art. [image]With its rugged and frank sex scenes, Boilet's book will not be appropriate for some readers and may put off others. Personally, I did not find the book (for all its explicitness) erotic. Perhaps it was the documentary nature of the thing or its surreal first-person presence, but I felt that Yukiko's Spinach was more an anatomy of a relationship than a lush and purposed turn-on for those in search of a sensual thrill. It's a shame that French books have such a difficult time finding a market in the US. Boilet's work here is pretty phenomenal and along with Fanfare/Ponent Mon's other books in the Nouvelle Manga line, Yukiko's Spinach marks a worthy direction for comics and there's plenty to investigate for Americans who take interest in the medium and its forms.NoteIt does occur to me that this may not actually be autobiography, that it may instead be some kind of hyperfictionalization of Boilet's experiences—a kind of codified wishful thinking on the author's part. While that would certainly complicate the reading, I think it would make for a more delectable interpretive puzzle.___________________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,not set,"Apr 04, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1554041.Yukiko_s_Spinach

It's proven itself so through several lackluster film versions (the only one that represents the book well enough is the 1995 BBC adaptation—and that only succeeds because its leisurely five-hour runtime allows it to indulge in more characters and more plot directions). The other viable conversion is the 1940 adaptation—its chief strength lies in its creators' ability to shear from the source novel with liberality. The problem with Pride & Prejudice, it seems, is that Austen crafted a story that is just too complicated, steeped in nuance and characters and pivotal plot moments. When any of these are stripped away, the result is something other than Pride & Prejudice as Austen envisioned it. And because the original novel is so well-loved, revision becomes blasphemy. Authors seeking to adapt generally either a) fall into the category of fans themselves or b) are at least well-enough aware of Austen's fans that they recognize any cut will be seen as betrayal. Where one of Austen's lesser works—say, Mansfield Park—could be filmed with a certain liberality and only Austen's most ardent admirers would care, Pride & Prejudice is another matter. So you have clipped, confusing products like 2005's Keira Knightley adaptation that rushes to its finish, packing in every plot point possible yet never allowing the viewer a chance to catch up. For a graphic novel version of the book to succeed then, it must either offer a sturdy page-count or be willing to refashion Austen's story to better suit a more diminutive length.Unfortunately for Marvel's edition, writer Nancy Butler proves herself unequal the task of adapting Pride & Prejudice, following after the lack of pruning that made Keira Knightley's version such a wreck. This is no big surprise, really. As mentioned earlier, the book seems ridiculously hard to bring into other mediums. Add to that the fact that Butler is a prose novelist as yet untried as a comics scribe. Predictably, she leans too heavily on her words (or Austen's words if you want to be like that). Panels are filled with walls of text, desperate to get out the requisite information before the book's finale—which comes way too fast. As Butler's version speeds to its conclusion, we have all the dry information we need to ascertain what just happened,* but we haven't been given the room to process it. And more than that, we haven't seen the characters develop in any ways not directly associated with their words.Which brings us to Hugo Petrus' art.Even had Butler's writing left plenty of room to make use of the visual storytelling unique to the comics medium, this adaptation would still be roundly considered a failure. The art, apart from being actively bad, is so great a mismatch to the book's content that one wonders how on earth this casting decision was ever made. Petrus' style, even if it was well-done (it wasn't), tries to turn Austen's Eighteen-Aughts romance into a sleek, sexy soap operatic mess. Here, look at the introduction of the Bennet Five:[image][Hi, I'm Larry. These are my sisters Herp and Derp and my other sisters Herp and Derp]Let's forget for a moment that Lizzy looks like she's just polished off a mug of vodka and that Kitty is gazing wild-eyed into the hole in the back of Lydia's head. This looks like the cast of an awful sitcom about five women who co-own a design firm and have wacky, wacky adventures with clients whose requirements they aren't really able to meet but still continue running their business because the show would end otherwise. And apart from their collars, it could probably be set in a period as recent as last year (though one of them would have to have shorter hair, maybe). They're even wearing lipstick and doing the whole pouty-lip/duckface thing.The real tragedy is that for months before the book came out, Marvel teased Pride & Prejudice covers. These are what we saw before the book came out:  [image][Seriously, aren't Elizabeth and Darcy just TOO adorable here? (click to enbiggen)]They were fantastic-looking. (I mean, apart from the faux-Cosmo text thrown up all over.) The illustrations by Sonny Liew were completely adorable. That was an Elizabeth Bennet that I wanted to read about—even if the writing was only so-so, Liew's art sold me on the series, easy. An artist who could create such a winning Elizabeth and Darcy was easily worth my attention. If you hadn't figured it out already, allow me to point out: Sonny Liew is not Hugo Petrus and Sonny Liew's only contribution to the book is cover art. This is why some readers get upset when the art featured on a book's cover does not at all resemble the art in the book's interior. Even though this is pretty common practice, it stinks of false advertising.So, Jane Austen gets stuck with Petrus, who (at least in this volume) seems incapable of matching character art with what is going on in the panel. Examples:The Elizabeth who has shown herself cynical enough to merrily jest about the folly of the class-conspicuous occupants of Netherfield suddenly appears dead inside, reacting to Jane's goodwill toward Bingley by being overwhelmed by the hopelessness of a world that will always beat down truth and beauty in every instance:[image][Note: Jane is supposed to be playfully exasperated in this scene]Mister Collins, buffoonish applicant to marital bliss with Miss Elizabeth Bennet, while talking of the girl's possible loss of income, decides to model Blue Steel for Mrs. Bennet:[image][Personally, I prefer to lead with the tongue or teeth, but if lips is what you've got then lips is what you've got.]Mr. Bennet takes off his glasses in time for the aneurism that will absolve him of any personal responsibility in steering his family in a manner that would guarantee Elizabeth's loss of both fortune and the bearing of Darcy's future-babies:[image][Looks like Mr. Collins will be taking on the house at Meryton sooner than later]Elizabeth, hearing of Mr. Darcy's devotion, happily bites her lip and squeezes out a fart:[image][Suddenly Squirtle!]You get the idea. The drawing style strangely shifts throughout, especially in the final chapter. He moves from the crisp (if badly chosen) linework at the book's start to something more thick-lined and chunky resembling Alex Maleev's work in Daredevil. While the later work is generally better, it's still a failure to take the job seriously (if not by Petrus himself, then at the least by his editor).Marvel fumbled the ball badly with this adaptation. While one might question the purpose of adapting literary fiction to the comics form, I do happen to enjoy a well done transportation of a text from one medium to its new home in another. Pride & Prejudice squanders the goodwill set in place by Sonny Liew's covers and offers nothing of value to the reader. On the off chance that someone will read this adaptation before approaching Austen's novel, it's very possible that they will abandon the novel altogether. And that, of course, is a verifiable shame.[image][Arf?]Note* Well, we probably have the information we need. As someone who's read Austen's novel four times, it's hard to approach this as someone who doesn't already know what's going to happen. I'm taking it on trust that it's all there and I'm not filling in plot holes with information I learned twenty years ago when I first read Pride & Prejudice.___________________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,107,1,not set,not set,"Apr 04, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6482046-pride-prejudice

The trick, see, is the fact that anyone who's aware of history, of the story being unveiled, will know how the retelling will end. When we watched The Perfect Storm, most of us were well aware that George Clooney and Marky Mark wouldn't make it to the film's credits (save perhaps through some kind of treacle flashback montage). We may know how Milk, Zodiac, Schindler's List, and Downfall end—depending on how aware of twentieth century history and culture played out. So for the sake of the high percentage of those for whom the ending is spoiled years before ever seeing the based-on-a-true story,* authors of stories based on actual historical events must ground their narrative on something beyond the typical need to know What Happens Next. If surprise and anticipation are removed from the storytellers' arsenal, they need focus on something outside an envigourating plotline. Certainly, plots are still valuable—most true-to-life stories are interesting because of how they surprise us in their extraordinariness—but that's not all they can rely upon. It's kind of like how thrillers that rely wholly on their game-shifting story twist suffer in terms of rewatchability.Instead, in historical adaptations, we look for things like ambitious character portraits, fascinating authorial technique, cinematic flourish, or some kind of thematic framework to add meaning to the whole enterprise. Maybe even some kind of historical fabrication to change the story's ending entirely (a la Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds). In any case, the author's got to make it so that an audience's knowledge of the finale won't be related at all to the power of the story. So then, what does Baby's in Black offer, being a recountment of the ill-fated Stuart Sutcliffe and the Beatles' time in Hamburg?[image]First an excursis. Because I'm like that.I'm a late-comer to the Beatles party. I hit kindergarten in the late '70s, had a hippie for a father (he still retains the remnant long hair and beard), and was exposed to a fair amount of classic rock. Still, despite understanding that the Beatles were a Big band (like the New Kids, right?), I remained pretty thoroughly unaware of their body of work. By junior high, I had figured out that the Beatles were responsible for ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand."" By high school, when I was waist-deep in Metallica and Motorhead, I had heard stodgy churchgoers—who evidently feared the pernicious influence of rock'n'roll—remark in solemn tones that John Lennon had declared the Beatles more popular than Jesus. I had a hard time seeing the I-wanna-hold-your-hand band being in the same league of perniciousness as Motorhead, who sang about Orgasmatron, but what did I know.** Finally, in college I heard some Sergeant Pepper's while working at a restaurant that had the album installed in its jukebox—this was where I discovered that the Beatles did that whole I-am-the-walrus bit.Pitiful, right? In fact, I wasn't to come to realize my interest and enjoyment in the Beatles until a particular videogame was released a little while years back. My wife and I, coming off a couple years of enjoying Guitar Hero, discovered Rock Band and enjoyed the division of labours allowed by the game. The only problem was that while I knew most of the songs featured, my wife didn't. Call it a lapse in her education*** or call it serendipity—the result was that when the Beatles edition of the game was released, we jumped on the opportunity because our distinct musical educations filled in each other's gaps. She was a fan and would finally be able to take real joy in the Rock Band experience. Because it's my way, the day after we first played the game, I spent an afternoon googling all their songs—so that I'd be able to sing along passably well. That led, obviously, to becoming a fan. And that new-found fan's interest led me to read their band's history, as related on Wikipedia. So yes, by the time I picked up Baby's in Black, I was aware of Sutcliffe and Astrid and Klaus and the bare bones of what went on in Hamburg. I was looking for something that would take what I already knew and do something special with it. Baby's in Black succeeds wildly.[image]Apart from relating what in many ways is a doleful tale (the book is titled after the Beatles' song, ""Baby's in Black,"" a song about Astrid Kirchherr mourning for the departed Sutcliffe), Arne Bellstorf's adaptation creates a lively mise-en-scene, filled with breathing characters whose lives, dreams, and hopes are affixed to reality without becoming sentimentalized. This last part may be the book's chief charm—that a book principally founded on unfulfilled longing could avoid sentimentalization is mark of distinction. It would have been easy for Baby's in Black to play to manipulation; that the book remains honest throughout is to Bellstorf's credit.Baby's in Black is told through Astrid's eyes. It is more her story than Sutcliffe's. And while Sutcliffe may fill the principal male role, as the object of her attentions, John, Paul, George, and Klaus feature only as supporting figures, filling the background and painting a raucous sort of peoplescape over which the story's romance blooms. Pete Best flits through the book almost entirely unseen and Ringo was not yet a part of history. Still, for all these small parts, Bellstorf does well in choosing these sidemen's character moments and gives the reader a sense of who these clowns were during the Hamburg era.[image][Oh John—you cad.]Visually, Baby's in Black develops its story through wonderful cartooning. The powerful black-and-white drawing helps underscore how indelibly this historical moment will carve itself into Astrid's life. While Sutcliffe admits an affinity for the colour red in his art, Astrid prefers black. For this, it's fitting that her tale should be told without colour—save for an appropriate dash of red text on the book's cover on the US edition.**** Despite the book's cartoony character designs, the figures' simplicity never threatens to diminish the story. Bellstorf conveys almost the whole of the burgeoning romance in a series of looks that pass between the eyes. We are allowed to see so much in such simple line gestures.The writing, translated, functions perfectly. It's always difficult to tell where to pin responsibility for a translated text, but whether on Bellstorf or on his interlocutor, the English version is a success. The words conveyed suit the story, mixing appropriately the melancholy, joviality, and beauty of life. Perhaps the most powerful moment of Baby's in Black occurs in a segment needing no translation, being wholly conveyed through appropriate punctuation. My one struggle with the book, perhaps, is in its choice of text-type for the word balloons. I don't know what was present in the original, but at least in this US edition, dialogue plays out in a sans-serifed font. It's not as unsuitable as a roman font would have been, but it still feels ungainly and unfairly austere. But with such an enjoyable work, this is a single small complaint.[image]I have been previously unaware of Bellstorf's work as a cartoonist, but Baby's in Black has made me interested in what other books he may have produced. I have not yet checked, but I hope there are many. And I hope they are even half as enjoyable as Baby's in Black. I can't think of how best to compliment this story, so perhaps this sentiment will suffice: that I want to read more from this creator.Notes* Now that I think about it, this probably goes the same for Nicholas Sparks stories (at least according to popular legend) and movies about dogs (dogs in drama never live and dogs in comedies will probably be injured but narrowly survive).** I also have a hard time seeing how Jesus in 1960 could possibly have been more popular than the Beatles, so it's likely that however great Lennon's hubris, he spoke accurately. *** Says the guy who didn't know the Beatles.**** I prefer the German edition's cover but really do think the First Second edition's use of red is appropriate given some of Sutcliffe's statements about the colour included in the book.________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Mar 30, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12510887-baby-s-in-black

Actually, amend that: in any medium, a successful adaptation is ridiculously difficult to pull off. A good adaptation requires the successful transposition of a story's essence from one medium to another in a way that, while not damaging the source, makes uses of the new medium's unique properties in a way that justifies the new product. And it doesn't matter if a story is being transferred from stage to film or from film to book or from book to film or from non-fiction to novel or from videogame to film: good adaptation is a rare commodity. And these are adaptations into established mediums, disciplines that have been explored and researched and tried and examined for a century or more. Comics don't have that luxury.The American graphic novel only began to approach being taken seriously by anyone outside its self-sustained genre-ghetto in the mid-'80s and only began to stretch its use and purpose in earnest around the turn of the 21st century. (Certainly there were efforts in the '60s and '70s—and even some interesting work in the Nineteen-Aughts—but these were exceptions within a medium largely uninterested in growth.) So it makes sense that comics would have far less grasp of its unique toolset than the cinema, which has been studied critically since the '40s at least. And with so light an understanding of what powers the medium of comics, we should expect successful adaptation in comics to be far more rare than successful adaptation in film. [image]And so it is the case. While it is rare to see film adaptations that are both superlative works of cinematic genius and successful adaptations, we still see a handful of films like Fight Club, Rashomon, A Thousand Clowns, Snow Falling on Cedars, and Ran. Sadly (but not unexpectedly), the diligent and lenient might be able to count successful comics adaptations on the fingers of a single hand. Maybe on those of two, if generous. Of course, I may be here speaking from ignorance. It's entirely possible there are a host of excellent adaptations available, books that a) avoid the trap of overly scrupulous devotion to the source while b) pushing the use of the unique tapestry of tools the comics form suggests. I just can't really think of many. Edginton and Culbard's Sherlock Holmes adaptations have been getting increasingly better and Jiro Taniguchi's adapted excerpt from White Fang was exciting though not exceptional. Almost certainly the best I can think of is Eric Shanower's continuing work adapting the siege of Troy in Age of Bronze. His juggling of characters and judicious excising of the gods from that story prove his hand as a revisionist. So it was with some measure of excitement that I cautiously approached his Marvel adaptation of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Unfortunately, Shanower's Oz does not succeed so well as his Troy.At this point, a brief history of my acquaintance with Oz may be valuable. I'm not in any way a fan of Baum's world—frankly, I don't know enough about it to declare myself either friend or foe. I had, therefore, the vaguely unique opportunity to approach this adaptation without any immediate familiarity with its source material. I had neither read Baum's original work nor seen the Judy Garland vehicle. A couple years back, I did have the misfortune to read Maguire's Wicked for a book club, but I understand that work to be largely apocryphal.[image][I like to imagine that the speaker in this panel is the Wicked Witch herself, realizing too late and a little bit surprised that there is now a house monopolizing her torso.]Still, some of the Oz mythos has filtered down into society at large over the years and I am broadly aware of some of the first story's more famous bits. I knew of the yellow brick road—upon which I presumed the entire tale took place. I knew of the ruby slippers, though little more than that such shoes were extant. I knew that Dorothy arrived in a house that crushed a witch and have in mind the image of two spindly legs clothed in candy-cane-striped socks emerging from beneath its deadly weight. I knew of a quest for a heart, a brain, and some other thing. Perhaps a bladder. I knew that the villain melted and suspected it was due to some sort of molecular aquaphobia. And I knew that one ought pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. Beyond this, however, my affinity for Oz lore runs dry, so my approach to Marvel's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is almost as if it were not an adaptation at all, but instead an actual story. Which, when one thinks about it for a moment, is probably how all adaptations ought to be approached anyway. And so it is on this count—as a full-fledged story—that I judge The Wonderful Wizard of Oz diminished.[image]The problem unfortunately falls squarely on Shanower's shoulders because there can be no fault at all found in Skottie Young's artwork. Young reimagines (so outside texts have informed me) Oz in such vibrant colour and form that it becomes glorious and beautiful and any number of other expressions one might hear an eager youth group director employ in describing heaven to his young charges. I was blown away by the forcefulness of Young's vision for Oz—the animals, the flora, the geography, the civilizations. These drawings were all so plainly wonderful that the failure of the text to capture a compelling story to go along with Young's visions is nearly tragic.The problem with Shanower's text is that despite having no predisposition toward reading The Wonderful Wizard of Oz as an adaptation, the book reads like an adaptation—and one requiring perhaps thirty more pages. The most glaring difficulty is the book's staccato rhythm of jolting from one point to the next. This is most evident in the first quarter of the book, from the touchdown of the twister through the gathering of Dorothy's quest companions. These pages are stilted and never fall into any kind of comfortable story tempo, as if there are a list of story points that must be met in a limited page count else the whole enterprise fail.[image]And that may very well have been the fact of the matter. Perhaps Marvel could not spare an extra chapter to their series. Perhaps Shanower was unfairly hampered by editorial mandate. Whatever the case though, the result is a book that could have perhaps been excellent but instead suffers from potential unmet. The more I think on it, the more I believe that an extra chapter's worth of pages could have saved the book. As it is, Shanower relies too heavily on dialogue to exposit his story. There are a lot of word balloons filled with a lot of text. More pages may have allowed Shanower to judiciously pare down his text and allow Young's very able visuals to carry more of the story-load.Still, despite the obvious feeling that I was reading an adaptation, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz kept me interested. Some may even find the book worthwhile on the strength of the art alone. For my part, I'm interested to see how later volumes in the series of adaptations will play themselves out. Whether Shanower will grow more accustomed to the limitations of the medium and begin capitalizing more readily on its strengths remains to be proven, but I am excited to see how he fares—even if chiefly for the pleasure of witnessing more of Oz through Skottie Young's imagination._________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,not set,"Mar 30, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6662883-oz

Overt manipulation overrides the creative impulse. Works find themselves too much vessels for an ideology and too little vehicles for the spark of imagination. Red Dawn, Left Behind, His Dark Materials, The Patriot: these each are successful in rallying the ideologically sympathetic but will never be known for their artistic achievement. Certainly, bald-faced propaganda is widely valued for its kitsch and is often cheered for ironic purposes—but for the most part, critics can't tolerate the stuff.Part of the problem is that by cloaking agenda in the guise of the arts, propaganda generates an air of dishonesty. Rather than simply laying out the claims of a position and allowing it to be tried before the juries of reason and rationality, propaganda tries to cloak its propositions in attire meant to evoke emotional responses designed to bypass the guardians of the mind. In hoping to arouse a response built on the passions, such works seek to hide their ideology's weaknesses, making it hard to trust them on any level.So I'm Not a Plastic Bag does something interesting right up front to help diffuse any threat of mistrust. All over the packaging is a bit of dual-branding advertising publication by both Archaia and Jeff Corwin Connect. That's curious enough to merit some poking around on the part of most readers—or at least a glance at the introduction, penned by Jeff Corwin himself. I was unfamiliar with both Corwin and Connect, but even a brief scan of those first pages (or of the several pages of appendices) reveals that I'm Not a Plastic Bag is concerned to significant degree with ecological matters. I considered myself fairly warned and proceeded, recognizing that I would be taking part in a book that would probably try to sell me pretty hard on the importance of both environmental cognizance and an individual's appropriate response to that awareness.The strange thing is that Corwin's introduction had me overestimating how much overt ideological passion I would have to confront across the following pages. In fact, I'm Not a Plastic Bag does so little moralizing of its circumstantial ideal that I probably wouldn't have even seen it as propaganda at all had I not been warned that it might be. Certainly, Rachel Hope Allison's book presumes a number of distasteful environmental realities, but none of these are arguable in any appreciable manner. The existence of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch only takes a brief survey of Google Images to confirm—unlike the struggle between Communism vs Capitalism, Just War Theory vs Pacifism, or Edward vs Jacob. In truth, anything that could be considered remotely propagandish is found in the foreword and afterward, where environmental concerns and calls for action are spelled out for readers. Allison's story itself seems to be unconcerned with these things—if not in some ways at odds with them.[image][Hi there.]I'm Not a Plastic Bag is the mostly wordless story of one particular Clump of garbage as it floats along, trapped in the middle of the Pacific. It gradually grows in stature but finds itself made lonely by its very nature. Allison uses some of the detritus our Clump accumulates to help it demonstrate personality—after all, if the Clump is in some sense our own creation, then it plausibly ought to reflect its creators. In the midst of its loneliness, the Clump seeks out friendship with local sea life and I'm Not a Plastic Bag is the story of how that clump fares in its quest.It's a short but genial story and one sometimes beautifully illustrated. Allison uses (presumably) a mix of illustration, painting, and photoshopping to bring her story to the page. Her technique is worthwhile and the book features a large number of double-page spreads, giving Allison's canvases room to breathe. The choice of presenting her narrative without word balloons may have been the right one, allowing the trash to speak for itself, but the absence of dialogical exposition does result in a climax that is difficult to pin down exactly. [image]The story's closing ambiguity is what may leave the reader wondering how exactly the graphic novel portion of I'm Not a Plastic Bag lines up with the environmental purpose of its more-spelled-out bookends. After all, the Great Pacific Garbage Patch is (by every estimation I've seen) a Bad Thing, but I'm Not a Plastic Bag's intentional conceit is to give the Patch a heart, making it a sympathetic figure capable of beauty and wonder. (She accomplishes this well—there are moments where readers may feel sorry for the Clump.) Still, while I found rendering trash in the role of protagonist a curious choice for an environmentally concerned book, just making readers aware of these garbage-laden gyres may be enough to prompt more responsible living. ________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,not set,"Mar 30, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13235845-i-m-not-a-plastic-bag

In truth, I largely* prefer an adaptation to stray dramatically from its source. The more wildly and inventively a work reworks the fountain of its inspiration, the more respect I'm likely to have for it. A film that takes Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials, sets it in 1920s' Chicago, and recasts it as a polemic in favour of Shintoism would be a phenomenal experience. Because, really, the only point in straight adaptation is to glad-hand the adapted material's most ardent fans with a slavish reinterpretation of the object of their infatuation. So repurposing Dostoevsky's ""The Grand Inquisitor"" (a piece from The Brothers Karamazov) to read as a Third Millennium exploration of the battle between conservatives and progresssives for the heart of the Papacy could have been incredible. As The Grand Inquisitor's two creators are entirely unknown to me and the book hails from a small Roman Catholic press, I couldn't have too many expectations to lay upon the work. Still, just looking at the book's large** cover portraying a black pope in all his apocalyptic finery excited me a bit at the possibilities—possibilities that due to both art and writing only ever remained a distant, unapproachable goal.[image]Author John Zmirak takes a unique tack, pressing all the text found in The Grand Inquisitor into the constraints of poetic verse. Readers will differ on how successful he is here, but allow me to betray a personal preference for a moment. I've rarely found a time when prose wasn't superior to verse in expressing meaning. Philistine I may be, but my predisposition to think lowly of poetry definitely colours my experience of Zmirak's writing here. The narrative is poetry, the dialogue is poetry, and the news casts itself in poetry. It's largely blank verse (and I imagine would be read in some sort of slam performance), though the newscaster reads in rhyming couplets.[image]The problem is that Zmirak has an interesting story at stake, but he obfuscates his purpose, forcing the reader to slog through what doesn't even look to be well-penned verse. On second thought, that may be my aversion talking. Here's a sample (that you might judge for yourselves):He looks like the nigger on the black boot polish can!<""Sambo brand,"" I remember. Used by Mussolini.And what if I let him go? Or better,embraced this extravagantly gallantnegro, and led him back to the Conclave?The thought warms an old heart like a ray of sunshine on the Appenine ice that packsan organ traveling for a transplant.One enjoys the warmth. But should one feed itwith a life's work? Let all that be consumedby sentiment, a weakness of the nerves?Sir, here's your chance to prove that you should leavethis room unharmed and ride to the Conclave.I'll call the taxi.By what authority proceed, what right?Tonight, the right of conquest will suffice.What is your post in the Conclave?I am its Holy Ghost.It is a role I've exercised some fifty silent years.Read that as you like but my take away is that Zmirak ruins his work by smothering it in device, by miring it in unlyrical artificiality—which is a shame, really. The story, when one comes to recognize it, is fascinating enough. The old pope has gone to ashes and the Conclave is trapped in deliberations, hunting for the next to wear the Ring and Hat. The progressives want a papacy dedicated to taking the new world on by that world's terms—at the low cost of dumping outmoded doctrine, if that's what it takes to be relevant. The conservatives, of course, wish to retain the majesty of two millennia of history's weight, of councils and bulls. Into this cacophony steps a Sudanese man, called from Africa to claim the Vatican for those who would throw the heterodox out on ears, a black man to woo the world's cameras and sooth the sting of doctrinal fidelity. He is kept from the conclave, however, by an old liberal man of cloth and designs, kept in a madhouse and questioned between threats of Thorazine. The Grand Inquisitor is laid out as conversational gladiatorialism, a battle between Old Nick's advocate and the church of the narrow road. This back-and-forth between the white liberal and the black arch-conservative plays out like Christ in the wilderness being tempted by the prince of the Fallen. It all could have been so notable had not Zmirak felt the need to torpedo his idea by forcing upon it the gimmick of poetry.[image]Beyond that, the art is a struggle as well. It's hard to tell whether Carla Millar is an honestly talented illustrator who's consciously wielding a stylistic tic or maybe she's actually got the chops of a talented ninth grader who's never had any official instruction as to anatomy or the formation of drawn persons. The Grand Inquisitor's pages, for all their complexity, resemble too much the mural on the wall of your local pizza place that had been painted by the owner's nephew who's had a couple semesters of art in high school. Drawn characters seem to have that whimsical variety of facial muscles that were popularized in the early '90s profusion of Image artists—despite having no earthly analogue.[image]I'll be honest in saying that I struggled to get through this book. Its provenance in Dostoevsky was my motivation for pursuing the thread to its happily ambiguous conclusion. There were things that I liked—things that crept out of the creative swamp as I pushed my way through. By the end, I realized that this was a story that I was excited about—in principle. If Zmirak would have scripted his story differently, the work could have been salvaged. One might have even been able to overlook the art or the fact that all dialogue is presented in Times New Roman*** had only Zmirak remedied his presentation of dialogue. As it is, I can't say I look forward to his next work. Maybe he'll surprise me (not that my approval is his goal, by any means). I might even light a candle to whomever the patron saint of good comics is.****Notes* There are of course exceptions. Fight Club is a generally faithful adaptation of Fight Club but puts all its bang into visual and editing tricks unique to its cinematic expression, making it a perhaps superior product to its source. Snow Falling on Cedars almost slavishly adapts its sources but does such a good job that it becomes a far more powerful experience than the text from which it derives.** By large I mean huge. And by huge I mean very big. Look at this thing. It's the size of twelve cows.*** It might not actually be Times New Roman. It might be Garamond or any number of other serifed fonts that look acceptable in prose novels but atrocious in comics.**** Just saying this proves I really have no idea how the Roman Catholic interaction with the saints (patronizing or otherwise) plays itself out. From movies, I understand there are saints and that there are candles. And I think that they sometimes go together. Or seem to in movies. ________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Mar 30, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2137568.The_Grand_Inquisitor

I wasn't homeschooled myself (heavens no!) but my second, third, and fourth girlfriends were all (curiously enough!) homeschooled. None of them knew each other and they didn't even share social circles. Weird, right? My mom was even concerned enough about the social wackiness of homeschool girls that she declined to introduce me to the girl who would become my fourth girlfriend (and eventually wife).*I don't have anything particular against homeschooling. Like any choice in any circumstance, it has its benefits and deficits. It's kind of like how when you buy a car that will have enough seats for four children (maybe your two and a couple of their friends), you're giving up a) decent gas mileage and b) the ability to ever approach looking cool again ever. Or when you opt for gas mileage, you're sacrificing the ability to take your family anywhere—heaven forefend the moment both of your children require a trip to the emergency room. So basically, whether you were homeschooled or publicly schooled or whisked away to that magical realm of the fabled boarding school, you missed out on some pretty cool things but simultaneously had an interesting and potentially valuable formative experience.[image][Vaulable formative experiences like this one!Also, this is a good place to once more note how much I adore overly descriptive onomatopoeia.]Do the positives of homeschooling outweigh the negatives? Possibly. Do the negatives outweigh the positives? Again, possibly. It all depends on personality and circumstance. Some kids will take to homeschooling like seagulls to a dolphin carcass. And of course, things aren't quite so barbaric and wild as they were in the early days of the homeschooling movement. Now you'll find homeschooling collectives that particularly focus energy on creating social experiences for their young guinea pigs. Homeschooling is more an acceptable alternative to public education today than it has been at any point in the last century. Still, though, questions as to the child's social preparedness persist as the most vocal homeschoolers continue to show themselves awkward and painfully unaware of how ill-fitted they are with a society that really doesn't care where they went to school.** Case in point.***With all this in mind, I was actually pretty pleased with Friends With Boys. Authoress Faith Erin Hicks parlays flavour from her own homeschooling experience into a young-adult vignette of a young woman's first days in a public high school. Maggie is anxious, unhappy, and maybe even a little bit terrified as she has to adjust to an educational dynamic that is not governed by her now-absent mother. My wife (Girlfriend Number Four and homeschooled, for those of you keeping track) confesses to having nightmares as a youngster that she would—for reasons contrived only in the logic of dreamworlds—be forced to go to a public school. There was even a time in junior high when she was invited to a friend's school for the day and she almost died of anxiety trying to concoct a scheme how to get out of the invitation. So Maggie's misery over her new situation is apparently pretty believable.And while Hicks obviously has her own thoughts about homeschooling, she doesn't bang any drums in defense of or aggression toward the educational alternative. Hicks even has the opportunity when a new friend of Maggie's (previously, her only real friends were her older brothers) remarks at how she's not actually completely socially dilapidated. It's a great opportunity for Hicks to spaz out and diatribe in whichever direction she leans, but instead the author plays the moment out quietly, amusingly, and with little fanfare. Maggie's story reads, for its duration, as believable, human, and not really at all interested in making any kind of dogmatic personal statement—a valuable lesson in storytelling for those who'd rather make their points overt (and therefore trivial).[image]After reading The War at Ellsmere a few weeks ago, I knew I had to seek out more work from Hicks. While I admitted a lukewarm feeling toward her subject-matter in that earlier story, I adored her art. I had hoped that years and experience would grow Hicks into a creator I could follow without reservation—and it seems my hopes have not been disappointed. I discovered in the last two weeks Friends With Boys and Hicks' webcomic Superhero Girl and both are a joy to read. Friends With Boys fully does away with any reservations I held after reading Hicks' Ellsmere. Not only does her writing improve dramatically, but her art (with which I had no problems) just gets better and better.Visually, Hicks' style shares some kinship with Bryan Lee O'Malley (in that if you saw one, you might be reminded of the other), but her technique is far more detailed. Friends With Boys' greatest success may be in its treatment of facial expressions. Hicks allows a sizable percentage of panels to tell the book's story silently, pushing panels to rely wholly on a character's look to convey the full force of whatever is going on in the moment. And she pulls this off better than most comics artists I can think of. As well, and this is really of minor interest, I enjoyed Hicks' fashion choices for all her characters. Their various and changing outfits add one more dimension of believability to the effort.[image]Friends With Boys is more than just a homeschooled-fish-out-of-water story. There's the part about adjusting to life without mom, the part about redemption from past mistakes, the part about forgiving and forgetting, the part about how jerks will be jerks. And there's the part about the ghost. When the ghost first popped onscreen, my initial thought was that First Second was in a rut—after all, Anya's Ghost, a young adult fish-out-of-water story featuring a ghost came out a bare year earlier. Fortunately, the two stories are nothing alike and both acquit themselves well on entirely different terms. In any case, while Friends With Boys is about more than just a homeschooler trying to adjust to the ""real world,"" it's the book's exploration of a particular homeschooler's life and distress that makes it such a winning story. Maggie is an endearing protagonist and her homeschooling-derived hesitations and insecurities are entirely understandable. When she makes friends, we as readers buy it. When she makes mistakes, we also buy it. She's a whole person and even if she has quirks that we ourselves may not exhibit, they're of an order familiar enough that any one of us very well might. We might even be surprised at how normal Maggie is for a homeschooler.[image]Notes* It's not that she had anything particular against those of homeschooled ilk. She just knew that my recent history with two such young women was probably more complicated than it ought to have been because of the manner of their former education and the kind of upbringing that one might experience as part of a home that consciously set out to countercult the normative culture like that.** Beyond the obligatory, ""Huh. Homeschooled? That's weird,"" nobody is interested in where you went to highschool. The fact of someone's homeschooling will only come to mind when they start acting weird. At this point, the homeschooler is at a decided advantage, being able to simply fall back on: ""Oh, sorry. I was homeschooled. Have a little grace?""*** This guy makes homeschoolers look really weird to those outside the bubble. From this video, homeschoolers come off as defensive, over-compensating, and desperate to be accepted by a social group that they pretend to not care about. This kid is not the hero homeschoolers need but perhaps the hero they deserve? I suppose the problem is that despite the fact that homeschooling probably churns out scads of ""normal, well-adjusted children"" every year, those aren't the types of homeschoolers who would make a video attempting to address misconceptions about homeschooling._____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,not set,"Mar 29, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11389398-friends-with-boys

Th[image]As I've mentioned in the past, even good anthologies tend to be a mixed bag—the good mixed with the okay and occasionally even with the bad. The negatives of this kind of arrangement are obvious. A collection of stories presents an uneven reading experience, making it difficult for a reader to grow comfortable with a work. If the quality of one story cannot reasonably be expected to carry over into the next, anticipation can lead to anxiety, bringing a level of non-narrative stress to the reader's journey through a book. And if the opening several stories do not win a reader's respect, the anthology may be abandoned well before reaching pages featuring more winning literature. Conversely, if a collection's opener is well-crafted but later stories fail to deliver, a reader may feel cheated—which may unfairly colour the entire experience.On the other hand, an anthology offers a number of benefits as well. The staccato rhythm of a well-planned collection of disparate stories can be exciting, keeping readers engaged and looking forward to What Comes Next. A bitter taste from one story can be quickly chased from memory by the changed pace proposed by the following. In a mere couple-hundred pages, a reader can experience a cornucopia of stories, themes, characters, and ideas. In a volume collecting a variety of authors, a reader may be exposed to numerous new voices and may end up following several of these to more fulfilling works. But sometimes, most interesting of all is the anthology collating short works of a single author—this can offer the reader a glimpse into the artistic development of that author. While veteran creators may have settled into a singular style and will not afford any ready purview into the creative evolution (cf. Jirô Taniguchi's The Ice Wanderer), the young creator's growth will be much more evident (cf. Fehed Said's in Talking to Strangers). This is very much the case with Byun Byung-Jun's Mijeong. While the volume's stories do not appear chronologically, a quick glance at the book's afterward reveals a rough sequence, one in which we see maturation. [image]Mijeong's earliest two stories are dark comedies. They're light but are ultimately not interesting or amusing enough to keep a reader's attention. The earliest ""202, Villa Sinil,"" plays with adolescent fantasies of the sudden discovery of a hidden, meta-natural power. A young, socially awkward cartoonist discovers that if he damages a representation of a person in his apartment, that person will die or be injured. It's the kind of cliched idea that tends to appear inventive to the young. I didn't mind the story, but it didn't have much life either. The other dark comedy, ""Utility,"" features a youth with a broken conception of the scientific method and how he gets roped into corpse disposal. ""Utility"" runs less along expected lines but still has little to recommend it. The art in both of these stories is prototypical of what finds better expression in Byun's later stories.Three years after ""202, Villa Sinil,"" we see the author shift into a mopier phase. In Spring 2003, he produced ""Mijeong"" (the story for which the collection is named), a short piece inspired by the film Wings of Desire. In it we find an angel who's fallen in love with a human girl—inexplicably, because she never demonstrates any attractive qualities, but since love is rarely explicable, we can't mind too much. The story is terse, more vignette than anything, and is fraught throughout with emo phraseology. ""Nobody understands my sadness."" ""I met her. She whose pain and distress are so familiar to me."" ""As long as she lives, she'll suffer. Infinite suffering. Eternal pain."" The story would have been perfectly designed to go over big with the Twilight crowd had only Byun's art not been so interesting.""Mijeong"" is where we first see the artist's eye and patience come to the fore. His style is a strange mix of spare and detailed, focusing deeply on rendering some objects of attention and leaving others subsumed in the purity of space. While his art will further develop and improve, we can happily see the makings of greatness in this title story.[image][Actually, that's her chest.(Also, I just noticed: that is one tiny car—since it's supposed to be driving through them.)]""Yeon-Du, Seventeen Years Old"" would be of a kind with ""Mijeong"" if it weren't for the tale's narrative value. The tone of ""Yeon-Du"" is similarly bleak to ""Mijeong"" but doesn't engage so much in the trite romanticism of the former work. There's certainly a focus on the heart and what kind of tragedies can destroy the abstraction of that organ, but it's not quite so over-cooked. It helps too that Byun's art gets even better by this point and his use of negative space is inspired. ""Yeon-Du"" features a young woman (to whom the title's age applies) and a man in late middle-age and describes their circle of acquaintances, what they might mean to each other, and how their lives were simultaneously collapsed. The story ends on the kind of downer note that teens of a certain disposition may find winning. Still, even while recognizing this piece's indebtedness to the stereotypically depressed kind of storytelling, the value of its craft overruns any deficits its typicality might enforce.One of the collection's standouts is ""A Song for You."" Visually, Byun heads in a direction many will hope to see him develop in later works. ""A Song for You"" trades Byun's scratchy blacks and whites for muted watercolours and a softening of his linework. The creator is still concerned with characters of wounded soul, but ""A Song for You"" is the first to show these characters taking positive steps to engage their situations, to take in the wonder of a shared community—even if these steps may ultimately be both too little and too late.[image]The dates of the book's other two works are not revealed. One was among my favourites of the collection, the other simply boring. ""Courage, Grandfather!"" posits a cat with an amorous eye toward a female schoolteacher and his anxiety over her affections toward one of her adult students. The art returns to the style of ""Yeon-Du"" but with a manic comic flare. ""Courage, Grandfather!"" was easily the most enjoyable of the volume.The last story of the anthology, ""A Short Tall Tale,"" gives Byun the opportunity to exercise his ability to visually tell the story of a man across the space of a phone conversation. Those are hard creative muscles to stretch so I appreciate Byun making the effort. But all the same, the story was rather uninspired and in the end feels hollow.Throughout, Byun shows himself a talent to keep an eye on, but the bulk of his ability seems to fall on his part as illustrator. His writing and narrative directions as evidenced in this volume are lacking. It's not so much that he does anything wrong, but more that he does little to maintain the reader's interest in the characters or the plots their circumstances contrive. Those who enjoy Mijeong will almost certainly be drawn to Byun's visual dynamic, his style and artistic choices. I found myself occasionally marveling at his visual technique (even at times when he seemed to struggle with what he was illustrating), but rarely appreciated his writing, plot, or characters._____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Mar 29, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6548006-mijeong

I would plan to be the typical touristy foreigner, to read comics in a language I didn't know, and to maybe even find a nice foreign girlfriend for my expatriated self. (Pinkerton's ""Across the Sea"" admittedly held unnatural sway over my heart.) It would be romantic and adventurous and the best life-building experience ever. Perhaps fortunately, J. Torres cured me of these delusions right quick. Love as a Foreign Language drew liberally from the well of reality and splashed its icy waters all over me—which is a funny thing for a romance comic to do.The problem is food. Forget the cultural differences. Forget not being able to make eye contact while talking. Forget my brash American ways. Forget the barriers of language, an absence of shared history, and the fact that I hail from one of the most internationally embarrassing nations from which to hail when traveling internationally. These are not insurmountable problems. The problem is: the food.While I prefer to describe myself as having a truly refined and delicate palette, it really all just comes down to the fact that I'm a picky eater. If it's not the taste of something that bothers me, it's the texture. The number of possibly delectable cuisines that these two guardian angels fell without discrimination are beyond counting. I don't mind it so much since I've never really known any other way, but my unadventurous culinary spirit is a real headache for my wife. Still, since America doesn't have any culturally prevalent dish, I can pretty easily navigate around the obstacles that present themselves to my tongue. This would be doubtlessly more difficult in Korea. Kimchi is right out. Kalbi is fine, but anything made of vegetable matter is probably going to present a problem. I would undoubtedly grow lean again were I required to spend any substantial time in Seoul. While this sound like I'm talking a lot about myself (and I am!), I'm really just empathizing with Joel, Love as a Foreign Language's beleaguered hero.Joel is a Canadian who has been nine moths in Korea, teaching at an ESL school. He's run down: weary and exhausted by the foreignness of everything he sees. He's no longer enchanted by the strangeness of the place. Rather, he's beaten down by it. He understands nothing, believes that everyone is staring at him, and generally just feels deeply out of place. And the biggest signifier of his alienation is the food. He can't eat spicy food and there is lots of spicy food. He characterizes many other Korean edibles as things that originated as the objects of dares. And kimchi is impossible. And I'm right there with him. Joel's story is my own hypothetical story.[image]And so, Joel can't take it any more. Nine months in a strange place. One would hope his gestation would complete and that he'd emerge newborn into a world he could be comfortable in, but it just doesn't happen. Joel is not adventurous enough, not brave enough, to ever be comfortable in this alien landscape. He's deeply homesick and hearing about his mom's Thanksgiving cooking seals the curse on his lips. He's going home because he cannot stand it any longer. In the battle between comfortable and alien foods, comfort wins out without firing so much as a single shot. And so Joel prepares to leave, abandoning co-workers who will miss him and a contract only half completed.But! Enter La Femme.[image]Joel's plans to return to a land that will love him grind perilously close to a halt when the school gets a new secretary. Hana is someone Joel's seen before, someone he's had his eye out for. She's beautiful and attractive and pretty and nice to look at and... well, that's all she is to him at first. She might be more but Joel couldn't know because he's never really spoken to her. But that doesn't stop him from flailing into love at her—not even for a minute. And really, that's okay. Raw physical attraction is how most relationships begin anyway, right? Only: Joel can't drum up the courage to get past goggling at Hana all moon-eyed as she walks by. But because this is a romance, we know (roughly) our trajectory. And we're not unhappily surprised when we discover there is even going to be something of a love triangle. And as we watch Joel start to grow up, we're not sure if it's because he would actually do that or because the kind of story we're reading demands it. But in the end it doesn't matter. Maybe loving from afar is destined to help all but the most embittered toward life to grow up a little. Maybe the romance of the tale is enough to smooth over the disappointment of having our expectations met. Or maybe we read stories that we know because we know that we like them. Maybe we need happy endings every now and then to ward off the stings we associate with the Blanketses, the Footnotes in Gazas, the Asterios Polyps. Maybe we need to see Joel return home and be happy about his trip so that we can believe that we might have done the same.Had we gone to Asia to teach English. Which we didn't. Grumble grumble grumble.At the end of the day, Love as a Foreign Language is a charming little story and one well-paced. Joel spends the bulk of the story (like 5/6 of it!) just getting to the point where he can talk to Hana, and then the final chapters speed to the story's conclusion. Some have complained about this and I think that reading it over the more than couple years it took to trickle out (originally as six slim volumes) left readers feeling a bit disjointed. But now returning to the book years later and reading it all in a fell swoop, the story seems perfectly pleasing (to me at least). After the climactic affirmation of the will-they-or-won't-they question at the end of Book 5, I didn't need much more from the story. The purpose was to bring two members of the triangle together and everything after that was merely a happy extrapolation of What Happened Next—like how at the end of certain (awesome) movies, the filmmakers will take a moment to offer a little snapshot of how the rest of the various characters' lives turned out.[image][Joel, being clueless, really has no idea what's going on here.]I can see why someone would want to spend more time watching a new couple get to know each other, to watch their love build and grow, but this wasn't ever probably going to be that story—which is okay, because it's not like that story doesn't exist in a dozen places elsewhere. J. Torres is one of my favourite creators of small stories and even if he leaves some hanging (I'm shedding a tear for Sidekicks even as I type), I'll follow him for as long as he has a career. Love as a Foreign Language is just one fine example among many of what he can do with a story._____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Mar 29, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/476921.Love_As_A_Foreign_Language_Omnibus_Volume_1

When I see a picture of someone with neurofibromatosis, my initial reaction, sadly enough, is not compassion but revulsion. Compassion may speedily follow, but that was a learned response and not natural to what my society has built into me. When I hear hip hop, my instinct is to brush it off as if it couldn't possibly concern me—causing me to miss out on probably some pretty decent music. Growing up with melody-heavy heavy rock and then straight-ahead jazz has built into my ears an immediate and unfair prejudice toward musical styles that differed too greatly from the mean of my experiences. And growing up with particular tastes in art and in a culture that favoured a narrow ground for appreciation, I have often found it a struggle to approach certain styles of comic art with a neutral eye. Many alt-comic forms leave me cold at a glance and so my predispositions often hinder me from taking the time to explore and then enjoy works that come from sources too far out from the mainstream.From the outside it's an amusing problem, for mainstream American comics art leaves me unimpressed and uninterested as well. Too great an adherence to what I perceive as formula and an artist may lose me. Too slick a presentation, too much style over substance (or at least my so far as my perception of these things go), and I may not ever pick up a book. It's a personal weakness. And one that I think most people suffer from to one degree or another. We tend to couch these prejudices in terms of Taste in order to alleviate the moral burden of expressing what amounts to base intolerance. But all the same, that's what our tastes reveal themselves to be: gently packaged bigotries against those things that we have, for one reason or another, been trained to find repulsive.And so we come to understand why I almost didn't get more than a handful of pages in Taiyo Matsumoto's Gogo Monster. My own inadequacies as a reader often govern the books I finish and the books I set aside. Too often I put aside books that I may not have given an adequate chance. Probably it's only because I needed something to  that I pressed forward with Gogo Monster, proving that being pushed into action by circumstances can sometimes be a very good thing—because after all is said and done, I really did end up enjoying both the book and its quirky illustrations.Gogo Monsters straddles some sort of line between absurdist, surrealist, and fantasy. It can be difficult to follow because the reader will often be uncertain whether the experiences depicted should be considered reality, imagination, or metaphor. There are textual cues that led me to vote for Reality, but only having had invested a single reading at this point, I can't speak to that matter with full confidence.Matsumoto's story, in its most overt, surface reading plays out over the course of a year and follows the story of a school that is increasingly beset by misfortune and misbehaviour. More properly, the plot may be said to concern three children in varying stages of social pariah-dom. Makoto, a third grader, is the most even-keeled of the three and spends most of his time alternating between interest in and alienation from his bizarre classmate Yuki. Yuki sees visions of another world, one that overlaps with our own, and he attributes much of the gathering social darkness to the activity of the other-worldly ""others""—though the flame of his faith is being somewhat diminished by recent conversations with IQ. IQ, a mathematical genius, is a fifth grader who wears a cardboard box over his head at all times and sees Yuki's beliefs about the other world as mere psychological extrapolations of his intense feelings of loneliness. IQ and Yuki are explicitly shunned by their classmates, while Makoto hangs on to some degree of social relevance despite concerns about his curiosity toward and friendship with Yuki. As these characters wend their way toward their individual fates, Gogo Monster may or may not (depending on one's interpretation of events) reveal whether Yuki's imagination has gotten away from him or not.[image]It's a curious book and each reader's interpretation will lead into a variety of questions about authorial intent and whether Matsumoto merely intended to tell the kind of trippy story that high-school–aged writers love to think is amazing and mind-blowing—or whether the author have bigger fish to fry. I'm not entirely sure myself, but my own reading is hopeful that the latter is the case. Matsumoto lays a lot of groundwork for a robust interpretative challenge, but having just finished the book some hours ago, I can't say I've had the time to mull it over enough to know. In any case, Gogo Monster is a thought-provoking work—and that alone is enough to recommend it.[image][Isn't that a rad drawing of a kid riding a bike reflectedin one of those fisheye mirrors?]The art that I earlier found so distracting, nearly prompting me to set the book aside, ended up being a high point of my experience of the book. His linework, shaky and abrupt, initially led me to believe the artist underdeveloped or incompetent. Still, after forty pages or so, I revised my opinion entirely. The page layouts and visual choices propel the work and support the story ably—and even his staggering, drunken line begins to inform the story by creating a particular world through aesthetic revelation. I wouldn't wish that all comics used Matsumoto's style of art but I was glad that Gogo Monster did.The book is challenging but, I think, rewards the patient and persistent reader. I'd recommend this to anyone interested in a book that falls a little outside the boundaries of the average comic story—especially if one can overlook what may end up being the fetishization of the stereotypical (and therefore infantilizing) mind-blowing trifle. Despite what may (or may not!) end up being weaknesses, Gogo Monster almost certainly demands thoughtfulness of its readers. And that is never a bad thing.[image][There are a buttload of drawings of jumbo jets flying overhead.It's almost like a thing.]Although, I'm still not sure why the book is called Gogo Monster._____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,not set,"Mar 29, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6949048-gogo-monster

From sixth through the beginning of eighth grade, I wore braces. Not brackets, but bands. On every tooth. Errant wires carved totems of the soft tissue at the back of my jaw—sacred designs that I'm sure exist there to this day. My smiles looked of cold steel. My jaw hurt from aggressive application of rubber bands. And my teeth would not get clean. At the end of those two years, I had the perfect smile—or at least the perfect teeth with which to perform that kind of smile had I known how to do such a thing in eighth grade. A quarter-century later and I still have the physical tools with which to enact the perfect smile as well as something of the social gearwork to make my attempts less ghastly. Braces, for me, worked their magic. And I'm still not sure it was worth it.Still, regardless of how difficult my own experience was, those pains, miseries, and woes pale when compared to the manifold sorrows with which Raina Telgemeier's young life was cursed. The author, when she was in sixth grade, fell and did substantial damage to her two front teeth. Knocked one out and smashed the other one up into the gumline. I'm getting queasy just writing about it because as Telgemeier relates the event and immediate aftermath in her autobio comic, Smile, the whole experience is rather harrowing. I'm not usually one to blanch at grusome displays of violence in either prose or comics or film or art. Caravaggio's Judith leaves me nonplussed. Murakami's manskinner in The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle is exciting but never nauseating. And the cannibalistic humour in Chew is merely amusing. But Telgemeier's recountment of her accident, the blood, the immediate visit to the dental surgeon, the x-rays showing where her missing tooth went—it all made me a bit faint.Fortunately, all that was just the first fifteen pages or so. After that, Smile shifts into something not dissimilar to the common Young Adult exploration of junior-high– and then high-school–insecurities. The drama of growing up and all that. Only: young Raina also has much more orthodontic work in her immediate future than would the average kid suffering the slings and arrows of burgeoning puberty. Telgemeier balances the telling between school drama and mouth drama nicely—though it helps the reader to know that this is not just a story but that it is Telgemeier's story. Through Raina, the author relives a streamlined and story-driven version of her own life and makes it palatable for general audiences.[image]If I have one complaint about the book, it's that its lessons seem too pat, its morals too well-placed. The whole experience is very After School Special—not in that this is a story ineptly told (for Telgemeier is obviously well-skilled and the book well-crafted), but simply because everything fits together so very nicely. Which we don't often come to expect from biography. Lives are too messy to be retold so crisply. Of course, it may be possible that Telgemeier really lives in the sweetness that lifts so pleasantly from Smile's pages. To that, then, my criticism is not so much that the history Telgemeier relates is not believable, but instead that it's just not complicated enough. It doesn't leave much for the reader to think on once the last page is turned.But that most likely wasn't Teglemeier's intent and her audience plausibly isn't a cynical guy who's more than twenty years older than Smile's principle figure. So make of that what you will.[image]To its fortune, Smile is a brisk read for all its pages and will keep most readers interested enough to finish the book in a single sitting. The book paces well and even the pieces that seemed familiar or predictable always escape feeling formulaic or contrived. And Telgemeier makes Raina into a sympathetic character who, even when at her most pathetic or bratty, is someone you kind of just want to hold on to and take care of.Telgemeier's art is lively and fluid and she seems to have little trouble putting her characters into whatever circumstance her story demands of them. Most impressive to me was how she allows her characters to age visibly. Raina begins as a small girl involved in Girl's Scouts, but soon makes the transition to junior high and then across that gulf of development into high school. [image]Telgemeier uses numerous visual cues to help us keep Raina's age straight. More than just the eventual appearance of breasts (the lazy artist's cue of choice), Raina's face, hair, and carriage all shift naturally as she matures. In the final pages, as her ordeal comes to a close, she has apparently grown up and has transitioned from childhood into young womanhood. I had trouble deciding whether Smile was Good or just Ok. At the end of the day, the book really is something of a trifle, an entertaining yarn that sits pretty firmly in the YA tradition of non-challenging reads. But simultaneously, Telgemeier does a good job at what she sets out to do and the care with which she treats her characters is evident throughout. And while Smile is ostensibly about overcoming a dental crisis, it also explores our common inability to be happy due to our common inadequacies. Smile points out that our reliance upon the things that sour us to life is often entrenched simply because those things are comfortable. In any case, while to adults Smile may just be an entertaining read, to its targeted demographic the book may read like a manual to no longer being miserable.________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,3,47,1,not set,not set,"Mar 29, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6393631-smile

Especially when visiting unfamiliar lands, having someone to help facilitate one's journey into the unknown can be a blessing. When I was wandering around Europe in the mid-Aughts, the cities in which I had friends waiting were comfortable stays. When things went awry—as they inevitably would—having a native's sturdy hand to navigate the unknown kept me from a great deal of unpleasantness in my journeys. And ready access to someone who could ease the cultural tensions between myself and those who didn't grow up in my precise formative circumstances was invaluable.The trade-off, of course, is adventure. Not all adventure—as one can still seek adventure in the partially-known—but a substantial amount of it. In my same European excursion, I came to several cities (Budapest, Vienna, Berlin, and Amsterdam) where I had no contact to contact, no guide to call upon. My experiences in these stops were far more varied and exciting; some left warmly cherished memories while others left impressions I'd as soon forget. In Budapest, I visited a zoological gardens, spent a day at the national art museum, visited a bathhouse, went dancing with strangers, almost got stabbed in a hostel, and pooped my pants while taking a lady to dinner. It was glorious. In Berlin, I got very lost, huddled cold on the floor of a train station, walked in on a crowd of soccer hooligans knee-deep in some rivalry-driven fight, and was generally just scared and tired. Not so glorious. Still, for all that, I'm still a fan of the idea of adventure.Mostly. As I've grown older, I've come to appreciate convenience a bit more. My back's not so good at supporting a full backpack for hours and hours. Sleeping on floors no longer sounds remotely fun. I spend so much of my day-to-day life worrying about what to do and when and how—kind of the last thing I want my excursions to be marked by is that kind of struggle. So when I say I'm happy to have Kaoru Mori serve as my guide into the history, locales, and culture of the 19th century Caspian region, I hope you'll understand and indulge my weakness. If it helps, she proves an able and inexhaustible docent.[image]In A Bride's Story Mori deposits the reader leagues away from the British romance of manners she crafted in Emma, instead exploring rural and nomadic life along the Western track of the Silk Road during the Great Game era. Mori has so far focused her attention specifically in what is probably northern Kazakhstan, near the expanding Russian border. The culture she describes is rich in a heritage and practice that will be largely unfamiliar to the average American reader. This is a land of yurts, shepherds, big families, khanates, delicate carvings, intricate weavings, and ornate embroideries. Much of A Bride's Story serves as educational documentary, explaining carefully the importance of these facets of the peoples the story concerns—and it's a mark of Mori's talents that these lessons are never dull. The story, while pausing its plot elements for a description of tribal politics or the importance of rug-hanging, is built and embellished and given life through these brief excursions.[image]The most obvious of the more unique aspects of the culture Mori explores in A Bride's Story is this people's tradition for youthful marriages. The author explains in her endnotes to the first volume that the average marrying couple in the region would have been fifteen to sixteen years of age. For dramatic purposes here, she adds and subtracts four years from the average for her principle couple—though in a subversion of the trope, the bride is twenty and the groom only twelve. This creates numerous opportunities for thoughtful consideration of how different cultures might deal with the man/woman dynamic—as well as plenty of related awkwardness for both reader and characters alike. Amir, the bride, is often torn between mothering her young husband, Karluk, and approaching him like a young woman who is gradually falling in love. Further adding to the dynamism of the work is the fact that at twenty years old, Amir is viewed by her society as an old maid and there is no small concern that Karluk may have been slighted by being given a wife who will likely bear him few children. In a culture in which large families are essential to survival, gaining a wife who will produce few offspring is like buying a new car that turns out to be a lemon. Amir, therefore, is eager to please her husband and new family, which gives Mori ample opportunity to display the bride's considerable talents. Amir hunts, herds sheep, embroiders, shows a talent at horsemanship to rival any of the men in the family, and has a good decorative sense.[image][I could not do this, but I'm glad somebody can.]A Bride's Story offers contemporary readers a delightful opportunity to exercise the skill of reading and enjoying a text without finding moral agreement with the circumstances, actions, or particulars of its protagonists. For this reason, A Bride's Story may even be desirable to get into the hands of younger readers (despite some occasional nudity) if for no other purpose than to promote this critical ability at an early age. Mori makes this an elementary text for this kind of exercise. Almost no American reader will approach the text thinking it good or appropriate that a grown woman should marry a boy who is only straddling the boundary between childhood and puberty—yet that is the circumstance this culture forces on its two very winning protagonists. Further, the reversal of the autumn-spring relationship trope presents opportunities to consider the contemporary sexual politic. As well, it's interesting to see a situation in which a clearly competent, intelligent, and mature woman should still be ultimately under the authority of a child (a kind child who evidently cares deeply for his new charge, but nonetheless...).[image]As with Emma, Mori crafts an exciting story that keeps a reader's interest—even while she explores all kinds of cultural nooks, crannies, etc.—but so far, the real star of the show is her artwork. Mori seems to have matured since Emma and her designs and layouts carry more interest. Atop that, she commits the biggest personal sin a cartoonist can. A Bride's Story is, in every page, filled with highly detailed and ornamented clothing. The kind of stuff that looks ridiculously cool on a cover or poster, but isn't the kind of thing anyone would want to draw over and over and over again. It would take me probably a day to draw a single panel that featured one of Amir's dresses. Or a rug. Or some throwaway eaxmple of embroidery. She makes American artists who can't keep a schedule seem like a sad, tawdry bunch. The truth is, I think she's probably a bit insane. Her art is that detailed and beautiful. People like to talk about Craig Thompson's ornamentation in Habibi. I think he did some amazing stuff in there and I still think he comes of as lazy compared to what's on display in an average chapter of A Bride's Story (no offense, man!). Actually, I'm aware that many manga artists employ a team in order to meet their deadlines and I desperately hope that Mori does the same. For her sake. For the sake of other artist's egos. For the sake of my ego. I think that highly of her work here.Earlier, I mentioned that I was happy to have Kaoru Mori as my guide in the foreign world of the 19th century Caspian region. My ignorance of the region and its history is complete. I know less about the 19th century Silk Road than I know about nearly every other place and time ever. I am, in other words, a complete foreigner. Mori has my whole trust and I have no idea how deeply she is embellishing or romanticizing the culture. She could actually be lying outright and I wouldn't know. The entire premise could be built on fantasy or sci-fi. But it doesn't matter, not to me. Mori's vision is so splendidly realized that the reality of it doesn't matter at all, not to me. I've been introduced to a world that, in any case, no longer exists (I presume) and I am wholly invested in that world. It's strange and frightening and exuberant. Despite the fact that I am being ably escorted through the region by a steady hand, the entire experience effuses a sense of adventure. And really, what better thing could be said for a book? ___________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,56,1,not set,not set,"Mar 29, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10105459-a-bride-s-story-vol-1

Books in the demographic are devoured and forgotten with an ease that must wound all but the most circumspect authors. Works directed at the youthful stock and trade so heavily on tropes that they have passed from the realm of cliche into something ritual, a liturgy of familiarities. It makes sense, really. These are books aimed at a people who, by the laws that govern universal process, have only the barest experience of the world we all inhabit. Authors aiming to interest nascent adults need drum up narrative conflicts with which these readers will be acquainted—and let's be honest, the well of experienced conflicts will run a lot deeper for grown-ups than it will for nearly any fourteen-year-old. It's not so much that teenagers are shallow (though many are), but their depth of experience certainly is. While I could have read and understood Franny & Zooey or Savage Detectives or The Long Goodbye as a freshman in high school, they certainly wouldn't have resonated with me in nearly so substantial a way as they did twenty years later. So those hoping to sell books to young audiences have a slender few options to choose from and the end result is a lot of books that are enjoyable enough but are generally just variations on a theme. Young adult literature is often therefore forgettable, disposable. It's not the stories that matter so much as the cheap thrill of the moment's entertainment. And this is even true of many wonderful examples of the demographic. It's true of The War at Ellsmere.[image]Between finishing The War at Ellsmere and beginning this , I also read Raina Telgameier's Smile and a couple volumes of Kaoru Mori's A Bride's Story. By the time I sat down to write, I could remember very little of what occurred in The War at Ellsmere. Here's what stuck: That it's a boarding school drama—girls' boarding school. That it's a typical outsider heroine-goes-up-against-the-queen-bee–type story. That it was enjoyable enough that I could swallow it whole over a lunch break. That I didn't regret reading it. And that I am now a lifetime fan of Erin Faith Hicks' art.She's amazing. Her art resembles roughly what you'd find in a volume of Scott Pilgrim—only with a touch more detail and (probably) a touch more heart. Hicks' characters are built of expressions and she sells these effortlessly, taking a character through a range of visible, discernible emotions across the space of a single page. She doesn't restrict herself to a particular grid-size and while not as free from the chains of the panel as, say, your average manga, she still uses up her paneling space in creative ways that further work to buy the reader in to her narrative tricks and treats.[image]I mentioned above the few things I'd remembered about the book and really, there's hardly anything more that one needs in order to understand The War at Ellsmere. It leverages common tropes enjoyably and employs some rad art. Still, in the interest of padding better informing the potential consumer, I glanced through the book again to jog the memory of it.Jun (Juniper to strangers) is a new arrival at hallowed old Ellsmere, a girls' school with a certain longevity built on the instruction of alumnists' daughters—and the occasional charity case. Jun is one of those scholarship students, the one poor girl in a menagerie of the wealthy. She (of course) catches the evil eye of a girl who is never really stated to be the most popular, though at least as concerns Jun's story, the girl is far-away the most powerful. Jun enjoys their antagonistic relationship until the moment, as on might predict, she doesn't. And it goes from there.[image]In some ways it's all very obvious and predictable and really exactly what we expect. But in the end, that doesn't matter so much. The War at Ellsmere's pretty much what it has to be, so we read and are aware of where it must go and what it must do to get there. But all the same, there's something special in the heart of the book. Hicks' art breathes life into characters who might otherwise remain hollow YA archetypes. Through her steady hand, we come to like and appreciate these characters and it's in their quiet, reflective moments that Hicks allows them to at least begin to transcend their form. They never do quite escape their destiny—a fate commanded by demographic—but it's an admirable attempt and I was happy to be there for it.________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Mar 28, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4065472-the-war-at-ellsmere

I try to extend some grace[image]One of the weird things about my  site is that I rate genre books alongside, quote-unquote, more serious fare. I try to extend some graces to the contexts in which these books operate, but completely divorcing genres from the general expectations of the medium would perpetrate some pretty wild discrepancies. After all, how far could you trust someone who rated Twilight and Brothers Karamazov as being Great Books because Twilight succeeds at its goal of being a mindless-but-amusing supernatural romance/thriller and Brothers Karamazov succeeds at its goal of being kick-ass, world-class literature that people will be talking about for hundreds of years or more. See? They're both great because they both succeed within their unique contexts!Well, maybe not so much. While it may seem unfair to compare the two books, one is entertaining trash and the other is awestriking and thoughtfully composed (at least according to most everyone who's read it and isn't thirteen). On a site that ed both books side-by-side, we'd expect ers to use at least most of the inches on the same yardstick to measure out their respective values. Certainly, a critic might make note of Twilight's purpose and express some evaluation of how well it succeeds on its own terms. But we shouldn't expect a neck-and-neck race.The same awkwardness exists here on Good Ok Bad. Because there are standards of good storytelling that sort of just exist over and above genre concerns, I'm not often kind (or perhaps better: generous) to superhero fiction. It's not that a superhero story can't succeed and rank among the best of the medium; that would be like saying The Long Goodbye isn't great American literature. Rather, the problem is that so much of superhero fiction doesn't actually succeed. There are Good books that find themselves nestled in the genre that has been Marvel and DC's bread and butter since the '60s, but they're rare and all the more special for it.And that's fine. We don't expect romance novels or westerns or Elizabeth George mysteries to be Remains of the Day or Cloud Atlas. They fill a niche and do so nicely. I read and loved The Hunger Games, even though it wasn't anything particularly special. Sometimes we just want to turn our brains off and take in an unbelievable story. And that's why, for the most part, I don't really  a lot of superhero books. On average, even the better books will only be able to rate an OK rating by the measures I use. And after a while, that just gets sad. So my general rule for this sort of thing is that I won't  a superhero book unless 1) I really found something special in it (and I really need to do more of this) or 2) the book was recommended to me. (And this saves my hide too. I mean, think how many enemies I've made by saying that Batwoman: Elegy was mostly awful and that All-Star Superman fell flat to me partly because Frank Quitely's people drive me crazy.)So then, Batman: The Black Mirror. Book critic Dan Goodman, knowing my reluctance to heartily endorse the superhero genre, gave the book a pretty nice recommendation and said he thought it was one of the best examples of the genre in years (I'm paraphrasing from memory here, but I think I'm doing him justice). He's proven himself to have great taste in the past and it was on his recommendation that I gave Big Questions a shot against a warehouse of reservations and came out quite pleased. And in some ways, The Black Mirror vindicates his sentiment. It's not the salvation of the genre and it does stumble awkwardly in places, but simultaneously, it does get some things right and those things are worth the time of the superhero enthusiast.[image]At this point, I should mention that the caveats from Batwoman apply here as well. I'm familiar with Batman and his mythos but I don't read his books save for special occasions — books or stories that come highly recommended or hyped. As well, though I'm not a regular reader, I am familiar with some of the changes to the title over the last several years. I believe Identity Crisis was about to begin when I last entered a comic book store on a Wednesday, but since then I've been tangentially aware that somewhere along the line Bruce Wayne ""died"" (comic book scare quotes in full effect) and Dick Grayson took over in his place. Also, apparently Wayne's son from Son of the Demon (which I did read back when it was released) is Robin now — or maybe was Robin because he doesn't appear in The Black Mirror. And now Wayne is back but doing something else. I'm also familiar with Batman's rogues gallery but not what they're up to currently (though status quo seems to be lock-up in Arkham Asylum, so I guess that'd be a safe guess). So keep that in mind, recognize that this  is coming from an outsider's perspective, and adjust your expectations accordingly.Scott Snyder's story, while taking several less than intriguing detours, has a solid backbone in its central exploration of What Happened to Commissioner Gordon's Son? Those who have read Frank Miller's thirty-year-old take on the titular hero in Batman: Year One will possibly recall that Gordon had an infant son who disappeared from comics (and continuity, I guess) until now. James is all grown up and returns to Gotham having recovered mostly from a debilitating sociopathy with the help of some nicely-tailored pharmaceuticals. His cousin Barbara, the former Batgirl, doesn't trust his transformation, but the elder Gordon is cautiously happy for his son's redemption.The Black Mirror is less a story about Batman than it is about the Gordons' chance at familial reconciliation and about just what Gotham does to its citizens. For a long time (so far as I understand), one of the popular in-comics deconstructions regarding the ridiculous state of Gotham's criminal environment (cf. Batman has a rogues gallery) is that the influx of zany criminals is really kind of Batman's fault. Once a man began dressing as a bat and patrolling the Gotham skyline, he became an amusement park attraction for every unhinged loser with a bag of make-up east of Vegas. Snyder attempts to rewrite that line somewhat by making Gotham the ultimate bad guy.It's not so much that Batman draws people like the Joker, the Penguin, the Riddler, the Scarecrow, and whoever else to himself. Instead, the city itself is this seed of darkness. Gotham is souped up on mania and violence and passions and so it is Gotham that makes Batman and Joker possible. The city twists the souls of those trapped within its grip. It was Gotham that took Dick Grayson's parents and Bruce Wayne's parents. And it was Gotham that corrupted young James Gordon and set him on a road of institutionalization. A road from which he's only now returning.[image]The tension between Gordon, his son, and Barbara—their hopes vs their expectations vs their histories vs their realities—is what The Black Mirror gets right. It's not earth-shattering stuff and it's sometimes a bit over-dramatic, but it really does work for a DC-universe story. And the art in these segments is perfectly well-suited for the story being told. Francesco Francavilla creates a quiet atmosphere in which personal conflicts might work themselves to an end. The colouring here is simple and off-bold: these sections are heavy on dusky oranges and purples, with other hues creeping in to up tensions or instigate a flashback.The art is a good place to talk about what doesn't work so well in The Black Mirror's favour. While half the book is illustrated by Francavilla, the other half comes by way of a man named Jock. Even as he provides some of the best covers to a Batman book I've ever seen, Jock fails to deliver an enjoyable story in the book's interior. His art on the book, to me, resembles a Bill Sienkiewicz who doesn't know where to go. There's a strange emptiness in the chapters to which Jock contributes—and not an emptiness that works toward the ends the book is trying to accomplish, I don't think. [image]Jock and Francavilla alternate arcs in the story, each tackling three chapters at a time until the book's finale—where they mix it up a bit, trading solos as the book strains for climax. As a kind of shorthand, Jock gets the superhero-y parts and Francavilla gets the human parts. And it doesn't help Jock that Snyder seems more at home with writing the human than he does the superhuman. While I pursued Francavilla's sections with interest, I found myself much more easily distracted from Jock's. They just didn't have any fire or intrigue. It was Batman, unconvincingly tussling with corny supervillains in abrupt, barely sketched out scenarios and I couldn't imagine how a reader was supposed to care. It was hard to imagine that these arcs were written by the same man who crafted the almost entirely acceptable Gordon drama.Here's an example. Snyder introduces a new villain, Bixby Rhodes, an exotic car dealer who has associates who call him Roadrunner. The reason for this nickname remains unsaid throughout, but it's possible they were mocking the fact that he says things like, ""Meep, meep, sucker,"" before running away. Here's how it goes down—and if you're averse to having a minor episode in the middle of the book (and the ending of Gattaca) partially spoiled, just skip to the next paragraph. Batman arrives at Rhodes' exotic car lot and begins sneaking around. Some hoods open fire with semi-automatic weaponry and Batman chastises himself for forgetting that he's not dealing with mobsters from the '40s—who apparently wouldn't have opened fire on him? Batman surprises himself by ducking down a loading ramp into a below-lot warehouse filled with more exotic cars. Rhodes closes the roof on the warehouse, remarks to a crony that he thinks it's possible they over-ordered that month (to which his crony agrees), and pushes a button that will crush everything inside. He has a button that anyone can push (it's just sitting on a post like a light switch) that will crush his entire stock of exotic cars? That's as silly as Jude Law in Gattaca having a button inside his incinerator that can start his incinerator. Anyway, Batman escapes by shooting electricity from his finger into the ignition of a car without a battery in order to start it. He drives up the ramp, busts through the roof in an explosion, flies through the windshield because he wasn't wearing a seatbelt, and dispatches the hoods. After defeating everyone else, he confronts Roadrunner—this level's end boss—and says: ""This is the part where you run."" Rhodes says, ""All right, Bats. If that's the way you want it, then all I can say is... Meep, meep, sucker."" (I told you he said that.) Then Rhodes rolls up his pant legs one at a time to reveals that they're mechanical. I know you're thinking: mechanical legs, they call him Roadrunner, he probably runs really fast. But Snyder (or Jock) has outsmarted you (and me), because Roadrunner then hops on the roofs of no less than four exotic cars (one of which is a minivan) with his ultra-bouncy machine-legs—all the while narrating for himself: ""He's at the twenty, the ten, and he—."" He gets cut off before the touchdown by being captured by Batman, who jokes with Rhodes and then says he never jokes.[image]That whole instance was awkward and is indicative of the tenor of all the Jock-drawn portions of the story. In other cases (e.g. Batwoman), these kinds of things were enough for me to rate a book as Bad, but I'm a bit torn here because I really did enjoy the Gordon story. So, in the interest of promoting what's good in an alright story, I'm going to grant that The Black Mirror was OK. Snyder is by no means the saviour of either Batman or the superhero genre, but maybe if he can reign himself in and show a bit more care with his storytelling, he can produce something I can recommend without hesitation.________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,not set,"Mar 28, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10889279-batman

It's a system that, for everything I can see, is essentially and fundamentally broken. As nation-wide protests have asserted in the last year, a very distinct minority wields the power in a nation that teaches its children to believe in democracy. ""The will of the people"" is routinely dismissed by those who would purport to be its servants. And even if the desires of the general populace were taken into consideration, the 99% are too ill-informed in the realms of history, economics, strategy, and political philosophy to be able to make adequate decisions in either national or international realms. We the people are puppets to our news sources, whether liberal or conservative or international or backwoods. If we are to gain leaders who will usher us into a golden age of peace and prosperity, it will be by accident. You may call me a bit of a cynic—and you would be correct in that estimation. So what's a guy like me doing pretty thoroughly enjoying a book like Eagle: The Making of an Asian-American President: a book that in many ways is a celebration (or fetishization) of the American electoral process?Honestly, part of it is novelty. The bare concept alone is interesting: 2264 pages following a candidate's campaign from the lead-up to the Democratic National Convention all the way through to the results of the Presidential Election—but written by a Japanese creator for a Japanese audience. Seeing how an outsider views and understands and interprets something that remains mysterious even to many Americans is a treasure of cross-cultural appreciation. When he mythologizes Texas, through heavy play on ranchers and late-night T-bones as big as your head, you can see where he's coming from. When he follows a trail into the sordid realm of labour union politics, American readers may well wonder how closely the author's original audience could relate (what with the differences in American and Japanese business ethics and practices). And when the book's candidate-of-choice, Kenneth Yamaoka, a third-gen Japanese-American senator (D-NY) is confronted by some of the racial difficulties that confronted Obama, you wonder how much it hurt to write those sentiments and how much author Kawaguchi was able to empathize with the more hateful elements he had to portray.[image][Wait. Isn't the organ grinder the one in charge? If this guy doesn't like East Asians, shouldn't he be happy that Yamaoka would be this guy's puppet? Racists, man: how do they work?]Eagle's subtitle (The Making of an Asian-American President) is interesting because you're pretty sure that Kawaguchi is giving away the whole bag of cookies at the outset. While reading, there may be some doubt in the occasional reader as to the author's destination, but as the story unfolds, presidential hopeful Yamaoka unveils to be perhaps the ultimate Mary Sue. There is no obstacle that he will not overcome—no scandal that will not either fade from memory instantly or turn out somehow to work in the anointed man's favour. It might be annoying if Yamaoka was ever really the point of the book. But he's not.[image][I like how similar Kawaguchi's people style is to Katsuhiro Otomo's.]Kawaguchi's primary interest seems almost wholly concerned with exploring what it takes to become president of the United States. And since someone is undoubtedly going to become president, for Kawaguchi's purpose, it hardly matters who. He just needs readers to willingly tag along for the ride—most likely to see just how crazy a ride it actually is. Or at least how crazy it is in a Very Dramatic reading of the quad-annual script. To that end, he offers up a bit of melodrama.Takashi Jo is our window into Senator Yamaoka's world. Jo is an unknown journalist for the Mainichi Shimbun and is mysteriously invited to all-access coverage of the senator's campaign the day after his mother mysteriously dies in a home gas leak. This mystery plagues Jo for the story's duration, but at least part of it (the fact that Senator Yamaoka is the secret father that Jo never met) is revealed in the first thirty pages of volume 1. Then Jo falls in love with Yamaoka's daughter, but it's okay because she's his adopted daughter. Probably. As I said, a bit of melodrama.Still, Eagle is paced like a thriller. Whether we're wondering how Yamaoka is going to gain points on his latest rival or how Jo is going to react to the latest bombshell about his life, his love, or his parents, the trip is an exciting one. I first read Eagle as it was released in America around the turn of the century, but with all the presidential campaign hoo-ha going on the last couple months, I thought I'd like to reread the book. After all, I remembered enjoying it a decade ago. When I say it's paced like a thriller, I'm not kidding. I blew through all five 400+ page volumes in two days. I may have stretched my one-hour lunch breaks to an hour and ten. I had a hard time putting Kawaguchi's book down. It's like if you took Twilight or The DaVinci Code and made them smart and interesting. Basically, Kawaguchi created something like crack in bound paper form, which makes it all the more tragic that VIZ is no longer publishing the book. Apparently, it just wasn't as popular as I believe it probably ought to be.[image][I would, too. It's a good book and deserves continued circulation.]And again, this is coming from someone who doesn't like American politics. Kawaguchi asked me (through his series) to empathize with a politician and support a candidate for a presidential election—something I traditionally have found myself unable to do. It says something that, despite my jaded perspective on the political realm, I was happy to read about Senator Yamaoka and his dreams and purpose. Basically, Kawaguchi did for politics what Mitsuru Adachi did for baseball—he got me following the game. At least for the space of his book.[image][Just to prove I meant it with the promise of melodrama.Also, you can't tell here, but Kawaguchi draws naked people funny and his women have awkward boobs. (Note: please don't be offended real people who look just like Kawaguchi's naked people.)]________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Mar 28, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1529010.Eagle

It's not so much Ben Stiller himself that I find unwatchable. He's perfectly capable of entertaining me or playing a role that I can enjoy. The affecting issue seems to be more with the type of character for which he is usually cast. Awkward characters. Men with little ability to suss out their social environment in a facile manner. Reality Bites. Meet the Parents. That sort of thing. Films that stock and trade on Stiller's ability to play a truly, madly, deeply embarrassing schlub.When I encounter characters doing terribly embarrassing things, I become physically agitated. Or at least my psychological agitation translates into a physical experience. I shake, cringe, and sweat. I start to become nauseated. I feel the same while watching Michael Scott interact with anyone outside of the employees of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton. After watching the ""Scott's Tots"" episode of The Office, I made a deal with my wife that I would leave the room whenever Michael Scott did anything and she would call me back when it was over. And I wasn't always this way so much. I think it's getting worse as I grow older.This is the long way about to explain my issue with Jason Shiga's Empire State: A Love Story (Or Not). Every critic comes to a piece of work from the context in which he or she lives. Every last one of us. You'll find no such thing as an objective opinion on a book or movie or piece of music. Our tastes govern us and our tastes are in turn governed by our experiences. We can employ certain means to help mitigate the effect of our tastes when we're aware of these kinds of imbalances, but we can never neutralize completely — and who would want to? Nostalgia is a big hurdle for a lot of people, rendering them incapable of seeing a book as it is. For me, the hurdle is watching a character suffer self-wounding humiliation over and over, never recognizing how it is by their own actions that their lives remain in torment. I can almost not judge a book or movie sensibly if that kind of thing is present. But I try. I do.The savvy among you will have discerned that there is something embarrassing going on in Empire State, perhaps some moment of shame or painful humiliation. It's worse, really. The book's central premise, the plot from start to finish, is that moment of humiliation. Our protagonist is awkward and socially oblivious — and even while feeling the initial pangs of shame, continues doggedly upon the horrible, scarring course he's laid out for himself. The book, for me, was painful from beginning to end. I had to read the short work in discreet chunks in order to even finish it. Apparently, for some of the ers who have lauded the work, the book was not difficult to take in at all. It is primarily for this reason that I make you aware of my... condition — to give you reason, should you need it, to entirely dismiss my  on grounds of mental instability. If your name is Jason Shiga, this may be the best tack.[image][Man, I remember not knowing what Perl is. Not really, I don't. But I can imagine my life was probably more carefree. I was also a newly minted bachelor. Oh Perl, you kidder, you cad.]Empire State is the story of a boy who likes a girl who moves away to a city essentially a million miles away from Oakland, where the boy remains. A better title may have been Damn the Middle States. The tough part is that while the boy has his crush (as boys will do), the girl remains either oblivious or aware-but-uninterested (my guess is the latter). That's painful and sad, but a pretty common version of the tale. Where it gets tough is watching the boy pin his hopes on a girl who won't ever have him, knowing this is the case, and witnessing him continue a hapless pursuit of her despite there being no indications that anything will come of it. He imagines some sort of Sleepless in Seattle meet-up at the Empire State Building but does so based not even on the flimsiest evidence. Every step he makes closer to that fateful moment and the inevitable lingering shame brought me a little bit closer to total mental collapse.I wanted to yell at him, to shake him, to pour sense into him. But a kid like that? There's no reasoning with him. He has to take his knocks and hopefully learn some lesson or another. It may be the lesson he learns is to seek a better reading of the signs before embarking on a journey of romantic proportions. More likely, the lesson he'll take away is that women are fickle, inscrutable creatures and are to be pursued wholly apart from reason and that the arbitrary hand of fate is to be accepted for whichever way it chooses to fall. I imagine this boy is well on his way to becoming Oscar Wao. And that's a hard thing to watch.[image]Look. I've made my own mistakes and miscalculations. I'm not boasting over how superior I am and how I can't possibly relate to this kid. I can — and that may be why I feel so deeply the humiliation that he himself should have felt even before he began his journey. I understand this kid, but that doesn't mean I want to read about him.But apart from that (apart from my personal demons), was the story any good? I don't think that it was. It may in some way have been realistic, but it wasn't really compelling or interestingly composed. Neither the boy nor the girl was engagingly crafted and I found no reason that either of them should attract the attentions of either readers or potential suitors. It's not so much that every book has to feature likable protagonists, but in a love story it's almost essential. And neither is it that these two are as despicable as the leads in Conversations with Other Women, but more that they're just flat, uninteresting people with not much to recommend them. The boy has a not-quite-developed fascination with mylaring books, but that on its own is not enough to round him out as a character.[image]The art is acceptable but nothing worth praising. It's simplistic and the emotion of scenes is often lost in the blank faces of its characters. The most exciting thing about Empire State is its use of colour, but even this isn't spectacular (not that I believe it was intended to be and it would be unfair perhaps to put too much weight on the book's central visual gimmick). The story is told in two parts, cyan and magenta — with cyan repping for the present and magenta standing in for the past. The colors twirl back and forth as Shiga moves the narrative with flashes back and forward and back again. And when the two periods reach a state of intertwine, we get a blend of cyan and magenta. It's a technique we saw somewhat in Asterios Polyp — only there, new colours emerge to visually describe the protagonist's psychological growth. In Empire State, the colour choices appear to be arbitrarily chosen. This may not be the case, but I couldn't figure out a purpose specifying cyan/present and magenta/past.At the end of the day, it's difficult to distinguish my evaluation of Empire State as a visual/literary object from my strong prejudices against experiences of this kind. I'm pretty certain that I wouldn't have enjoyed Empire State even if I were someone who could endure character humiliation as easily as I endure characters who have hair and wear clothes, but you'll have to take that for what it's worth. Perhaps it was unfair for me to  the work at all, but on that note, perhaps it's unfair for any critic to  a work, governed as we are by our circumstances, beliefs, histories, moods, and tastes. I trust that you as the reader will be able to discern whether Shiga's book is something you wish to pursue. After all, plenty of others have enjoyed it._____________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,not set,"Mar 28, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9501285-empire-state

It's not as if every immigrant's entry into a new culture follows a singular, well-trod path. The circumstances of each individual's introduction to and incorporation into a new national heritage are as diverse and variegated as the expatriated themselves. Still, there are certain commonalities that often crop up in every new experience — every immigrating instance — whether moving from one nation to another or simply moving from L.A. to Seattle. Or taking a new job or attending a new school.What Shaun Tan does in The Arrival — and does marvelously — is propose a cross-section of these immigrant experiences in such a way that even the reader who has never breached his own comfort zone might empathize. Tan offers to involve the curious into an experience that is confusing, disorienting, and alienating. That is, Tan wants to make us all immigrants for the space of his book. And he succeeds wildly.[image]The Arrival, for all its pages filled with complicated, detailed artwork, plays only one note. It has only one theme, only one agenda. The Arrival is simple and will not be distracted from its only purpose. To say that Tan's book plays one note should not be confused for saying that the book is one-note in any pejorative sense. It may not juggle two fistfuls of interweaving themes and character arcs. It may not demand seven consecutive reads in order to discover its meanings. It doesn't need to. The Arrival does what it intends to and does it so very well that it doesn't need anything else. In fact, the addition of more plot elements or thematic directions would probably only serve to detract from the compelling work that Tan has delivered.[image]The Arrival follows the experiences of a man who leaves his wife and daughter behind in order to pave a new path and new fortune for them in a land brimming with possibilities. He's abandoned a country beset by grave ills but his road through his new home is anything but smooth. He does not speak the language, does not recognize the customs, and misses his family terribly. He is a man lost and Tan pulls the reader into his experience first by making the book silent, cutting all dialogue or narration. Then, mounting on this already sturdy platform of alienation, Tan introduces a world filled with bizarre contraptions, foods, sciences, and rituals — and then asks us shuffle along with his protagonist. It's wondrous and frustrating all at once. We feel for the poor immigrant because if it's hard on us (outside the book with no investment greater than personal interest), then it's exponentially more difficult for him, with his wife and child and their survival on the line.[image]Silent comics have long struck me as a gimmick. One of the first Marvel comics I ever bought was G.I. Joe #21. It was called ""Silent Interlude"" and had no dialogue. As a young, inexperienced comics reader, I found it baffling and wondered if every G.I. Joe book was similarly quiet. The book demonstrated to me, even as a young reader, that silent comics were a cheap trick. This conclusion was drilled into me several times over the years as I encountered a handful of other silent books (e.g., the Spider-Man response to September 11th, 2001, Korgi, Eric Drooker's Bloodsong, the silent work of Jason, etc.). None of these seemed to use silence to any narratively purposeful end and in none of these cases was the story magnified by its lack of words. The Arrival is the first work I've read in which silence is essential to the experience. Tan uses the absence of dialogue, narrative balloons, or sound effects to propel his story and any verbal addition would doubtlessly hinder his purpose.The Arrival is one of the very best comics experiences I've ever encountered and is well worth your time.______________________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,not set,not set,"Jan 12, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/920607.The_Arrival

I didn't actually finish Monologues for the Coming Plague. Somewhere between two-thirds and three-quarters of the way through I ragequit, angered by my own dogged tenacity in pursuing a book that clearly wasn't going to be worth my time. This never happens. There are large numbers of books that I haven't finished due to apathy or dislike, but always the motivation for abandonment lies in the realm of disinterest rather than ire. Monologues carries the unique distinction* of being the only book to piss me off into retiring it. I don't believe in hipsterism (thinking it only a way for people to denigrate that which they fear might be more highbrow than they're comfortable with), but if I was prone to point at things being pretentious and obscure for the sake of being obscurely cool, Monologues would make that cut.** I don't plan to ever pick it up again. Despite the fact that Anders Nilsen's Big Questions is one of the best books I've read in 2011.Soured by my experience with Monologues, it took some cajoling to bring me to the point at which I'd consider reading Big Questions. And by cajoling, I mean reading nearly everyone rolling over themselves with praise for the book — even if they didn't understand it. (Not understanding Big Questions and being forthright about its comprehension barrier seems to be a requirement for ing it.) The book made numerous end-of-year lists, and upon reading, it's easy to see why. Nilsen's very large book is that rambling, haphazard kind of meditation on meaning and purpose that seems tailor-made for Critical Praise. Inexplicable things happen. Some of it might even be symbolic. Ideologies are stoked, questioned, and burned in some neo-pagan, nihilistic frenzy. Big Questions is the song that never ends. It just goes on and on my friend. And critics and high school lit classes eat that stuff up.If it sounds like I'm being a bit wry here, I blame the still-lingering aftertaste of Monologues. I'm still mad about it, apparently, and it's threatening to infect my read of what even by my standards is a very good book. Okay, I'll try to stop now.[image]Big Questions is a curious animal of a book. Its method of gradual production threatens the sense that Nilsen knew what he was doing all along or that the book can be read as a single cohesive work. Nilsen, as he explains in the book's backmatter, began collecting the occasional one-page scraps of talking-bird cartoons he'd been producing for years. Almost accidentally, it seemed, a narrative began to form around these sometimes thoughtful finches. And then at last, the addition of arbitrary violence from the American military machine set in motion a grand tale spanning a milieu approximately the size of a sprawling backyard.Still, Nilsen's production here shines even while it remains unclear how much stock we're meant to place in the book's place as single multi-threaded narrative (vs. that of intersecting anthology of incidents and stories).*** Despite the book's leisurely stroll through its story parts and Nilsen's often sparse storytelling, Big Questions ends up feeling a very full meal. There's a lot to think about and Nilsen's penchant for leaving his Big Questions often unanswered lends to its position as a Thoughtful Comic. (If it weren't for the book's $45 price tag, it'd almost certainly become a regular subject of graphic-novel–leaning book clubs.)[image]While there is a plot to Big Questions, plot doesn't necessarily drive the work. There are things that happen to prompt the characters to their various means and ends, but those events and the motivational vectors they produce are always secondary to the discussions (verbal and otherwise) they generate. Big Questions is a book about questions, a book about how to arrive at or depart from ideologies. Across the simple landscape of these birds and their simple lives, Nilsen draws out a number of parables to ask simple questions about our own existence. Sometimes the circumstances or questions might seem too simple, but even then, the opportunity for thoughtfulness blossoms.One of the unique attributes of a book crafted over the span of a decade is that readers will have a chance to chart the progress of the artist's abilities as cartographer of the world presented. We see this a lot with webcomics, as amateur cartoonists ply their hobby into a trade and are more and more able to practice their craft. Comparing the early, middle, and current examples of Megatokyo, Questionable Content, and Penny Arcade**** provides readers with a sort of metacommentary over the creator's ability to convey the story world — and the same thing occurs in Big Questions. Nilsen's early work appears larval and unaccomplished, but some of the later pages are simply beautiful — works of patience and attention. Even his birds, which remain simple throughout, are more readable and empathetic in the end than they were at the start. Not everyone will appreciate the evolution, but from an archaeological standpoint, the identifiable shift is rather charming.[image]Finally, I would suggest that potential readers give Big Questions their attention. It's a big book and a good book and one that, despite occasional clumsiness, provokes thoughtful critique and critical thought. What exactly Nilsen's game is might not ever be made clear, but maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe some books are there less for what they say and more for what they ask.______________________________Notes* Note to pedants: redundance is a valid literary technique.** In reality, I think it unfair to judge the motivations of a creator (especially if I didn't take the time to finish or understand their work). Nilsen may have had any number of reasons driving his production of Monologues for the Coming Plague. I suspect he may have even anticipated the kind of antipathy readers like me would hold over the work. In the end, the book simply felt pretentiously wrought and was deeply overpriced. *** Plus this adds to the delicious challenge of interpretation.**** Megatokyo: early, middle, currentQuestionable Content: early, middle, currentPenny Arcade: early, early-middle, middle, current______________________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,not set,not set,"Jan 12, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9970421-big-questions

It's not so much that everything should be whimsical[image]One of the things missing from too much of our narrative experiences is a sense of whimsy. It's not so much that everything should be whimsical, but more that it seems the vast majority of respected works are serious-minded, somber affairs. Much of what are considered to be the best examples of the storytelling mediums are works that challenge the reader's sense of the world or delve into the not-so-sunny depths of the human condition. As readers of Great Literature, we've become suspicious of happy endings. We've come up against this great wall of human woe. And because it is valuable to consider the suffering that pours from its gates, we may have focused our attentions too narrowly in our search for literary worth and merit. Whimsy doesn't come off so well in the critical eye when compared to the towering works of the literary canon. As wonderful as some of us know The House on Pooh Corner to be, it's hard to compare Milne with the likes of Kafka, Proust, Hemmingway, Joyce, and Conrad. Serious works just feel more literary, more artistically viable. Whimsy too is often mistaken for escapism and escapism (justly or not) has been targeted as the opponent of worthwhile artistic achievement. And if escapist narrative, by its nature, ignores with braggadocio the primary concerns of the Great Writers, then certainly books suffused with the whimsical must also be suspect.[image]But if we're willing at all to investigate these matters, we'll find that this is just not a helpful way to look at things. Especially as game studies begin to propagate, we're finding more and more that play is not just fun and not just good, but important. All of a life is worthy of consideration for those of attentive eye. The human condition is fraught with every manner of depravity but it is also marked by a resilience of pleasures. And really, as much as our literary examples of the whimsical betray a yen for the fantastic, so too do our more morose books — those books that detail the collapse of families due to lies and betrayals or the existential crises of characters burdened by self-inflicted woes. The novel is, in all cases, the bastion of fantasy. Story is, in its nature, a carefully composed unreality. And to miss that fact is to miss out on the value of even whimsy. And to miss out on whimsy would be to miss out on Luke Pearson's Hildafolk. And to miss out on Hildafolk would be a damned shame.I picked up Hildafolk knowing that I'd love its art and design. I saw a press release for Hilda and the Midnight Giant (slated for release in May 2012) and was wowed by photographs of the book's interior art. Knowing that I'd want to get my hands on The Midnight Giant, I thought I'd better acquaint myself with whatever Hilda-mythos already existed, so I picked up Pearson's earlier work, the slim, elegant Hildafolk. Also known as Whimsy Central.Hildafolk presents a terse tale of the precocious, blue-haired child, Hilda — and essentially just follows her around for a couple of days as she plays and explores and draws. Hilda lives in a mountainous hills-are-alive-with kind of setting and, as she is a child, has few responsibilities beyond staying out of Deep Trouble. Her current interests include reading about the different varieties of local trolls and scribbling in her sketchbook. Her companion is a blue-coated fox with adorable little antlers and her house is visited frequently and to her annoyance by a small man made of wood. [image][It happens.]All of that is well and good, but the great joy in Hildafolk lies in its visual expression of the girl's life. Pearson's art is playful and perfectly rendered and evokes the kind of easy familiarity one finds in Carl Barks' Donald Duck or Jeff Smith's Bone. Pearson's palette is striking — perhaps one of the best I've seen in comics — and he uses the book's sense of colour to suffuse the reader in the book's unique mood. While Pearson generally maintains traditional paneling, some of my favourite of Hildafolk's pages were departures that utilized elements of the hilly topography to present a picture of how Hilda is spending her afternoon.Hildafolk's story, while slight, exhibits a sense of humour that keeps even the book's darker moments from infringing too deeply on its sense of place. Actually, if I have one real complaint about Hildafolk, it's in regard to the book's brevity. It's not so much that Pearson didn't finish the story he was telling but more that I simply want a 400-page tome of Hilda. At forty-four pages Hilda and the Midnight Giant, when it comes, won't scratch that itch either. But I'm patient. If I live to life-expectancy, Pearson's got another forty years to satisfy me. For something this enjoyable, I'll wait.______________________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,50,1,not set,not set,"Jan 12, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9700137-hildafolk

The number of authors who can take a handful of seemingly contrived elements and produce an elegantly composed narrative admixture are few and rare. Plot-heavy literature, when it succeeds, is a wonder to behold; but in its failure, we find little to surprise us. So when I describe Kate Beaton's Hark A Vagrant! as paean to complex plot structures and hail it as deviously devised, I hope you'll pay attention. The book is a marvel.Of course some might blanch at seeing Beaton's book described as plot-driven, but those are simply people who have not yet grasped the book's primary aim, the goal to which it aspires and ably reaches. If Hark A Vagrant!'s single-minded storyline is to be described in succinct terms, here is probably the simplest explanation: Hark A Vagrant!'s plot is the story of how Kate Beaton made me laugh more than any author. Seriously.I have been been known, when reading a funny book, to let out a single ""Heh"" at particular points when humour and mood collide to produce tangible joy in the microcosm of my soul. I'm no opponent of mirth by any means. It's just that my expression of comic release is rather reserved when it comes to reading. While I'll laugh heartily at some amusing circumstance or other while watching the ninety-third funny thing to grace YouTube this month, for some reason — that probably has to do with the auditory lack connected to the written word — my response to comedy in books is muted by comparison.[image][Poor Verne. He could write all the Poe fanfic he wanted,but Poe would never ever understand.]Kate Beaton, for whatever reason (I suspect witchcraft), has reversed the current on this count. She is a funny, funny author and the volume and duration of my audible response to Hark A Vagrant! bears able witness to this truth. In fact, I am almost certain my wife was annoyed by the series of sustained chuckles, low guffaws, and outright laughs that from across the room continually interrupted her own reading of The Anti-Federalist Papers. Or it could have just been that she was reading The Anti-Federalist Papers. Regardless, the history I was reading was much more entertaining that the history my wife was reading.Hark A Vagrant! presents a collection of historically- and literary-minded humour strips that run the range from dry witticism to baudy toiletries. Being a fan of both history and literature probably helps a reader appreciate the particular kind of crack that Beaton's cooking up, but there's a lot of low-hanging fruit as well. Some of my favourite bits were a series of strips in which Beaton takes covers of Nancy Drew mysteries and extrapolates a scene or plotline based on those singular images. As well: there's a bunch of Canadian stuff I didn't get. Sorry Canada for knowing next to nothing about your history or culture (though I did recognize Louis Riel!). Beaton also does this wonderful thing where she'll add commentary to select strips, somehow further ennobling the experience (and sometimes actually educating or at least piquing curiosities).[image]Hark A Vagrant! is a rare work in that it shows what the newspaper comics page ideally could have become if it hadn't been overrun with uninspired and unfunny legacy comics for years and years and years. If Beaton makes you laugh only half as much as she made me laugh, Hark A Vagrant! is still very much worth your time, money, and whatever effort you'll have to expend to click BUY on Amazon (or whatever online provider of bound paper wonders you prefer).______________________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,not set,not set,"Jan 12, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10767466-hark-a-vagrant

Even the best are designed not to engage the philosophical beast but to entice the reptile man. Thrillers appeal to our base instincts, our demand for survival. They stoke the fires or our adrenaline and even the smartest of them fail to thrill if they get too smart. At that point, they cease to be thrillers and become some kind of careful literature that makes knowing use of the thriller's mode. Either that or they become bad thrillers.Fortunately, The Homeland Directive is neither of these (neither the inept thriller nor literary fiction capitalizing on the forms and tropes of the thriller). Instead, Venditti's and Huddleston's brisk work is pure thriller and succeeds in purpose mostly admirably. [image]The Homeland Directive is one of those mid-level-or-higher government conspiracy yarns, cut from the cloth of Harrison Ford's Clear and Present Danger and Will Smith's Enemy of the State (at least one of these was a novel, but in both cases I have only seen their cinematic expression). The good guys find themselves somehow at odds with special, secret, and murderous services without the U.S. bureaucratic behemoth and spend the story's bulk speeding toward two goals: 1) exposing whatever fraud or injustice they've run across and 2) surviving long enough to expose whatever fraud or injustice they've run across. Just because it's predictible doesn't mean it isn't fun.Venditti's script is smart in that way that television sitcoms may be smart. Its observations are never particularly astute and its dialogue is all a touch wooden, but it prides itself on its snappy banter. It's kind of like Brian Azarello's scripting in 100 Bullets, only so deeply toned-down that you no longer want to kick its teeth in with a boot made of schoolbuses. Venditti moves the plot along at a good clip and the reader will never feel as if he's simply treading water and padding his page count. For what it is, it's hard to find any fault save for maybe that one might wish it were slightly less... thriller-y?[image]The Homeland Directive's most evident strength sits in Huddleston's interesting art choices. It's all very explosive and fits well the bombastic tale of a government gone rogue. Huddleston's drawing and figurework would probably only be considered adequate if it weren't for the tremendous dynamism he infuses into the work through his palette. I couldn't always be certain why he chose one set of colours for one page and another set for another, but the colours he employs almost always excite and contribute nicely to the thrill of reading.[image][It's really not. Stop it.]At the end of the day, The Homeland Directive probably wouldn't be considered anything particularly spectacular outside of the genre-niche into which it carves a home, but taken on its home-turf, the book is quite good and accomplishes its purpose well.______________________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Jan 12, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8962287-the-homeland-directive

She's two-and-a-bit and, beyond an affection for Miyazaki films, her only truly manic love is for books. She will read them by herself but absolutely prefers to have them read to her. She's gone through several favourites, her canon constantly in flux, but right now she seems to be on a bit of a Frog and Toad kick. I tried out Johnny Boo on her and the result was appreciation though not adulation. Mainly, she likes Squiggle well enough and enjoys the voice I give to Ice Cream Monster, but I'm not sure if Johnny Boo will ever be a go-to book in her mind.The reason this matters, in case you were curious (since I don't usually lead off with my daughter's opinions on books), is that Johnny Boo finds itself pretty squarely aimed at a children's demographic. The book is simple, short, and boasts a ridiculous sort of plot: basically two ghosts argue about their respective abilities, make up over the promise of ice cream, run into an ice cream monster, and then reservedly befriend it. It's slight and unimportant and I probably wouldn't have much of anything to say about the book without dragging my daughter into it.[image]Johnny Boo features two ghostly protagonists, Johnny Boo and his pet(?) buddy Squiggle. Squiggle, a tiny white ghost shaped like a teardrop, can fly and performs incessant loop-de-loops — a gift he refers to as Squiggle Power. Johnny Boo is gravity-bound and maintains that his Boo Power (the power to say ""Boo"" loudly) is superior. Their shenanigans are endearing and humourous and overwrought in that way that seems to appeal to young children. A third character, Ice Cream Monster, monopolizes much of the visual real estate of the second half of the book and is characterized primarily by a) his garish pink and yellow colouring and b) his unquenchable love of ice cream (think cookie monster and then switch desserts). I wanted to punch Ice Cream Monster. (Squiggle probably would want to also but he doesn't have hands.)The illustration is spare in that manner typical of Kochalka's work and the pallet (until the advent of Ice Cream Monster) is almost entirely blue (for the sky) and green (for the grass and bushes) and white (for the ghosts). It's a suitably simple look and allows the young reader to focus on what's important in each scene. [image]After four readings, my daughter remains noncommittal. She likes Squiggle enough to follow his antics, seemingly ignores Johnny Boo altogether, and knows what's hidden in the pile of dirt on page 21. She might request a reading if that's the book that happens to be in front of her but won't go hunting over the house for the book or ask us to find it for her — as she will with any number of other books that have mysteriously wended their way into her heart(s). I don't mind reading Johnny Boo to her like I do certain annoyances like Go Dog, Go or the revolting New Tricks I Can Do, but missing out on the adventures of Johnny Boo and Squiggle isn't something I'll mourn if she never requests the book again.______________________________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Jan 12, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2245849.Johnny_Boo

I've spent my fair share plumbing the depths of Kafka on the Shore, The Unconsoled, Savage Detectives, and Duncan the Wonder Dog. Those books are treasured to me and I'll always remember to think of them fondly. There's a certain invigouration that occurs when one puzzles through a tough work and comes out the other end with something that resembles a solution—or even just a partial solution. There is life to be found in thoughtful consideration of things that are quite beyond our ken. But sometimes we just want to play.Gingerbread Girl is exactly that: play. It's light and uncomplicated. It's rambunctious and pleasant. It's got whimsy and verve and spark and a whole bucketload of other lighthearted descriptive nouns. It zips about and won't leave you exhausted from thinking too hard. It's like a night out dancing: sure there's going to be some interpersonal drama but—hot damn!—there's going to be some interpersonal drama! Gingerbread Girl is about what people—in this case, a particular young woman named Annah—are like. The 110-page graphic novella follows her over the course of a single night's date. Annah has a number of traits that crop up, either endearing her to or alienating her from her companion for the evening as they visit art galleries and rooftops. The book's exploration of these parts of Annah's personality form the story's meat, but it's the manner by which they are explored that makes the book as fun as it is.[image]Creators Tobin and Coover take a unique tack with the story's narration—one that I hesitate to reveal simply because I found great joy in experiencing it for myself. So I guess if you don't want this one small thing spoiled, just skip to the next paragraph. From the start there's a lot of fourth-wall–breaking, with Annah busting in to tell us exactly why the date she arranged for the night's engagement is going to be such a mystery. But Annah is not our narrator—at least not our only narrator. Over the course of the book, Annah's evening is excerpted to us by friends, associates, strangers, and even passing animals. Each has a unique insight into either the current situation or into Annah's own history and psychological make-up. It's an inventive device and I found it added immeasurably to the flavour of the book.The book's title comes from a little story involving Annah's cortical homunculus. The homunculus is a visual representation of the sensory inputs as they are located in the brain. It's a bit complicated, but the short of it is that there is a sort of geographical map of the body* laid across the topography of the brain. And Annah says that hers was skimmed off by her mad scientist father when she was a child. Annah calls this slice of herself, the Gingerbread Girl (Ginger for short). That cross-section of cortical homunculus was then grown into a fully functional girl through the magic of science. Or the magic of magic? Or maybe... luck? Whichever the case, Annah has a twin holding access to the depth of her sense perception and that twin has gone missing. And that sad fact is making it hard for Annah to connect with people in any meaningful way.Or is it? Yes, Annah is a tease and suffers from certain debilitations that threaten to kneecap her relationships turn after turn. But is the problem really something as sci-fi as a rogue homunculus or is the problem more in the realm of traditional psy-fi?** That's the central question that Gingerbread Girl explores throughout its twisting travelogue of Annah's life. If we were to judge truth on the basis of Life of Pi's ""better story"" criterion, then Annah's account of her missing sister Ginger would absolutely be the truth. Even if she's fabricating, Annah's managed to craft a version of reality that's much more enticing than any more rational explanation for The Way She Is. Still, her friends aren't sold and it's through their skepticism that we're able piece together our version of the truth.[image]All that sounds pretty thought-provoking and heady but Tobin and Coover take the edge off right quick by infusing their work with a tangible, earthy sense of humour. Gingerbread Girl is funny and warm-hearted. It's a little bit romantic but a lot bit just plain human. It's an enjoyable little book and one of the better releases of the year.______________________________Notes* So really, that's probably better termed a somagraphical map.

This is fitting, after all, as film noir was a critical designation invented by the French to describe a certain mode of crime thriller. Made popular in the '40s in the US, noir is generally counted to span the era of 1941 to 1958—from The Maltese Falcon to Touch of Evil, as it were. Yet though film noir in its traditional, classic sense dies off in 1958 with Orson Welles' tale of good cop/bad cop in a Tex-Mex border town, its influence would be felt for decades after—and not merely in the form of homage (to borrow another French term).While the American neo-noir scene has had some notable entrants over the years, it's the French who seem to have really taken the noir ball and run with it. While being outside the era and culture specific to True Noir, these French thrillers exhibit a delicious sort of indebtedness to the mode, rolling themselves out in such a way that they capitalize on several of the key elements of noir while forging new directions and destinies. From Rififi to Le Samourai to The Beat My Heart Skipped, the French have spent decades extrapolating the noir ideal—and not just in film either. Some of the best crime comics I've seen have been French and show strong sense of their noir roots. And Miss Don't Touch Me is just one more of those.Set around the turn of the 20th century, Miss Don't Touch Me concerns two sisters (one a flirt and the other a prude), suburban dance parties, a serial killer, a brothel, and the dish best served cold. When cold, reserved Blanche becomes accidental witness to the Butcher of the Dances (the mass media is every bit as fanciful a century ago in France as it is in America today), Agatha falls victim to the killer who hopes to cover his tracks. Blanche is destroyed emotionally but this devastation prepares her for the journey of detection and subterfuge for which she'll have to be steeled if she wants her revenge. Circumstances lead her into the employ of a brothel where her prudishness and refusal to be touched by a man lead her to become the shop's special dominatrix. Dressed as an English maid, she whips, beats, and savages every single one of her clients, earning herself the title Miss Don't-Touch-Me. Yet as she gets nearer to identifying the killer, she comes closer to falling into the killer's path. It's a treacherous road and one will wonder whether her violent loathing of men will be enough when she comes face to face with the man who killed her sister.[image]While Miss Don't Touch Me's story travels the necessary paces for every thriller—mystery, betrayal, reversals, and the big showdown—the true glory of the book is its art. I'd not yet run into Kerascoët's work but from this point forward, I'll be vigilant when I hear news of a book he's worked on. His characters are cartooned, with all the exaggerations of character that one might expect to see in New Yorker cartoons but with a degree of polish that makes them sing. Blanche herself is perfectly rendered and Kerascoët ably bounces her between rage and sorrow and fear and comfort and grim determination.For writer Hubert's part, Blanche is crafted into a character far more interesting than the standard cardboard protagonist that usually populates the revenge thriller. She's plucky, certainly, but inexperienced to the utmost. She embarks upon her quest for justice steeped in naivete and, to the author's credit, never does transform into an able, capable investigator. Despite her righteous cause, she's rash and easily leads herself astray. That she has any further contact with the Butcher after her original, accidental encounter is counted more to the ledger of blind luck and to wiser friends than it is to her powers of deduction. By the end, we find that Blanche's one true gift is her unyielding determination; whether this gift will also be her saving grace is only answered as the reader pursues her story to its finale.[image]The book is stereotypically (fairly or otherwise) French in its laissez-faire depiction of sexuality, which will almost certainly be off-putting to some readers. Hubert & Kerascoët walk a fine balance between depicting the attitude that sex is just sex and showing that sex has built-in consequences. While highlighting the tension between the two perspectives is not their object in this work, they still dally with the conflict—and this dalliance goes a long way toward turning Miss Don't Touch Me into more than just a common revenge thriller. The book may be a suitable jumping-off point for any number of discussions of the importance of sex to society and how cultural mores address some of our primal instincts.In any case, Miss Don't Touch Me is a fun work, a thriller that travels potentially awkward paths in almost natural ways. It's guileless in its forthright desire to entertain and hits many of the formulaic notes without seeming obvious about it. While writing this , I discovered that there is a second volume to the work and I am anxious to see how things turn out, since a number of threads seemed only murkily resolved.[ courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,not set,"Nov 22, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6136798-miss-don-t-touch-me-vol-1

This can be fine if all one wants is more of what one has already read. More hard-boiled detectives down on their luck who come up against the jealous or crooked police force in order to solve the case but ultimately lose the fight. More unsuspecting lads who flee their home villages to get caught up in a prophesied battle for the fate of the world. More intergalactic political drama. More beautiful, youthful vampires to throb the hearts of self-important minors. More Westerns, more superheroes, more romances, more magical girls, more Amish spanking fiction.The parade of derivative sameness seems an unceasing tide. If that's what you're looking for—something comfortable, predictable, and safe—then you're in luck because there's piles of the stuff out there. Personally, while a little bit of literary comfort food can hit the spot when I'm in just the right mood, I'm not usually super jazzed on the idea of indulging one more iteration of a book I've already read or already own. So while those piles of genre-steeped rehashes of copies do nothing for me, I too am fortunate because there are rare individuals working within genres in ways that seem ignorant of convention—and come off absolutely fresh for it.In Castle Waiting, Linda Medley accomplishes something unique by proposing a medieval fantasy setting and then using it mostly to set stage for a series of character-driven episodes of people who mostly just talk about their lives. The castle at Brambly Hedge is the product of a sleeping beauty-style curse. For a hundred years, the fortress was grown up with a forest of thorns dangerous enough to end the lives of any adventurers who set out to discover the mystery of the place. Generations later, a charming prince finds his way through unscathed, wakes the princess, and the two of them leave the castle (and its servants) behind for a bright and ego-tastic future somewhere less provincial. A generation after that, the only ones left in the castle are the princess' three handmaidens (now old), and they elect to turn the castle into a sanctuary for those in need.That was all prologue and at the book's real beginning, a pregnant Lady Jain arrives seeking safety inside the castle's walls. She is fleeing from her husband lest he discover her pregnancy by another man and kill her for jealousy. Of course, all of this sounds not exactly untypical of the standard fantasy work. Maybe it's rare to have a female protagonist open an epic adventure by running away with a baby in the belly, but everything else sounds pretty standard. It's just that when I said this is where the book begins, it's also pretty much where the story (in any grand sense of the term) ends.[image]The moment Jain enters into the Castle Waiting, all larger plot movement halts entirely and nearly all focus homes in upon the development of the relationships between Jain and those who make their home in the castle. Beyond the three handmaidens, there's the rambunctious bearded nun, the plague-masked Doctor Fell, Sir Chess (the horse-headed knight gallant), Rackham (the werestork fashionista), simple Simon and his widowed mother, and the silent, aloof Iron Henry (the adopted son of dwarves). Each member of the community has a unique and compelling personal history and the simmering of their persons and circumstances makes for enjoyable reading.[image]After Jain gives birth to a strange-looking child (the very image of his father apparently), most of the two available volumes (comprising a mighty 856 pages) involve Jain hearing the histories of her new friends. Some of these stories are funny (e.g. that of the convent of bearded nuns) while others such as Doctor Fell's are just plain tragic. While it may be at some point that Medley plans to bring some danger into the current situation (we get occasional glimpses into Jain's own past), the most climactic event thus far was the advent of a Leaky Roof.[image]As with any book that puts the interpersonal dynamic on the front shelf, Castle Waiting stands or falls on its characters. Medley puts a lot of heart into each of these, giving them each their opportunity to win the affections of readers. She approaches their interactions with wit and humour. Those in search of dour characters bemoaning the lot their life has drawn will be disappointed, for everyone approaches life with a certain optimism and joie de vivre—save perhaps Henry (who is still working through things) and Doctor Fell (who's really just kind of gone around the bend due his own grave circumstances). Castle Waiting is, almost more than anything else, a happy book. And one that I am happy to recommend.[image]Additional NoteThere is some curiosity with the second volume. By agreement with the book's publisher, Fantagraphics, Linda Medley's name has been struck from the volume. It only appears in indicia and as a sticker affixed to the book's rear cover. For whatever reason, Medley seems to have cut ties with either her product or with the publisher. As well, the final chapter of volume 2 ends abruptly. Not only does volume two leave the story in a kind of limbo, it doesn't even quite seem that the page on which the book ends was intended to be that chapter's final page.As a fan of the series, this is a nerve-wracking development. Of course I care about Medley and wish her the best and hope that her relationship with Fantagraphics can be repaired (if it was ever even damaged), but really, as any fan, I am selfish and my concern is primarily for the work. I am invested in Medley's welfare primarily because of what she is able to provide for me in terms of this wonderful genre-flaunting story and I want very much to see it continue to completion.[image]I'm not sure where things began to go funny, but volume 2 does experience the unhappy loss of letterer Todd Klein after two chapters (after Klein's departure, Medley employs a serifed font in all her dialogue and it's never not an awkward choice). There also seem to be some attempts at working with new page sizes that add some hiccoughs to the flow of the second volume. Fortunately, Medley's strong hand as an author is evident throughout and her writing suffers no diminishment.In any case, here's hoping that all is well in Medley's life and that she will return to the beautiful world she's created once more.[ courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,not set,"Nov 22, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/177395.Castle_Waiting_Vol_1

Then, in tenth grade, I discovered Marvel's publication of Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira. And then Akira, the cinematic adaptation. And then I saw pretty much every film Akira Kurosawa ever made. Then I read Shogun. Then I saw Princess Mononoke in theaters. Then everything else Miyazaki had done. Then Usagi Yojimbo. Then there was Haruki Murakami. Then Takaski Murakami and Superflat. Then the manga boom. Really, I've held a fascination with Japan, its culture, and its history pretty much since I first discovered that it had a culture and history that could hold my interest*—and so, the last two-and-a-half decades have left me perfectly primed for Ōoku: The Inner Chambers.Ōoku is a work of alt-history. It posits a Japan that never happened** and traverses eighty years of would-bes. Taking a page from Y: The Last Man, author Fumi Yoshinaga oppresses 17th-century Japan with a plague, called the redface pox, that decimates the male population of the nation (other countries seem unafflicted). By the time the disease has worked its course, there is only one man for every five women. The national character evolves quickly and drastically under these new terms and the roles of men and women within the society undergo sharp shifts in vocational direction. Women become the primary workforce, tending to all mercantile matters, all fieldwork, and all burdens of government—while men, now prized primarily for their reproductive function, are often sequestered and kept from any exertion that might tax their delicate constitutions. Many men are prostituted by their families to women who don't need the sexual release so much as they simply desire offspring. The Yoshiwara pleasure district quickly empties of women and falls into disuse until it comes to play house to men dedicated to the role of stallion. For their part, women take on the role of lords of households and rulers of domains—even claiming the Shogunate as a female role. And it is with this last that Ōoku is concerned.[image]Ingeniously, the first volume of the series introduces the situation eighty years after the plague hit, exploring this strange world through the eyes of Mizuno, a young man who enters into the service of the Shogun's inner chamber (what is known as the Ōoku). Alongside Mizuno, the reader learns of the situation of men within what I presume to be the most secretive palace in all Japan—though, to be fair, we have yet to see the Emperor or his/her own inner sanctum. The entire staff of the palace is men. The Shogun keeps for herself a stable of well over a hundred men, none of whom may ever leave the palace grounds—service in the Ōoku is a lifelong duty. With Mizuno, the reader comes to understand the duties, hierarchy, and politics of the place. Nearly upon his entrance into service, the sixth Shogun dies and is succeeded by her young daughter—who also dies soon after, still a child. The succession then passes to Yoshimune, the eighth Tokugawa Shogun, and it is with her entrance that the focus of the book shifts and begins developing a host of protagonists and points of view. [image]Yoshimune expresses a curiosity for the history of Japan and wonders if there wasn't a time when men were in greater abundance. Using a particular story device, volume two of the series returns to the time nearly a century earlier when the plague first arrived in Japan. Author Yoshinaga then records events from that point onward up until the advent of the eighth Tokugawa Shogun. It's a fascinating journey, one full of romance and politics. Yoshinaga is careful to describe in plausible manner just how the power of the Shogun might shift from Iemitsu Tokugawa to his daughter without upsetting the rest of Japan. Part of the genius of the series is that it is entirely history—with narrative embellishments, of course. All the female Shoguns carry the names of the Shoguns as we know them historically. The Shogun following the Iemitsu reign is Ietsuna. And after her, Tsunayoshi. And then Ienobu and Ietsugu and Yoshimune, just like in our world's history. Even the events depicted mirror events recorded as we would know them: the expulsion of the Christians; the plan to burn Edo to the ground; the circumstances surrounding the Forty-Seven Ronin; and probably coming in next year's seventh volume, the Ejima-Ikushima affair. [image]My only prior experience of Yoshinaga's work was her trifling comedic book of restaurant ""s,"" Not Love But Delicious Foods Make Me So Happy. The work here is altogether more substantial and her reinterpretation of history is careful and engaging. Every time I saw her shift her lens to focus on a new set of characters as she travels across the generations, I worried that I wouldn't find the new cast as compelling as the old. Happily those fears proved to be unfounded, as Yoshinaga shows an elegant command of her characters, investing in each of them a host of believable motivations, powers, and infirmities. Japanese history, as recast in Ōoku is excellent drama and I'm thirsty to discover what will happen next and how Yoshinaga plans to wrap the series several years from now.***[image]Notes* Tautological, no?** Some slightly spoilery speculation here (mouse over to view):(view spoiler)[I do wonder if Yoshinaga might be here recording not alt-history but presenting a real history—one that is only other than what we have previously known to be the case because it was lost to us. As she is careful to retain all these key incidents, keeps foreign powers from recognizing that the Shogun is female, and retains the male names of Japan's historical rulers (as well as their female consorts), I wonder if she might not—by series' end—return Japan to status quo, with men in roughly equal number to women and have the men return to the seat of power. In such a case, the history of women's tenure in rulership might be understandably lost to the passage of time. It would be an interesting way to take the story and there are some seeds laid to this affect in volume 1, but now that I've thought of it, I'm hoping she'll come up with something even more daring and inventive.

It [image][This is where I grew up.]When I was in second grade, my class took a weekend trip to Catalina Island off the coast of Southern California. It was Spring 1982 and we stayed at a marine institute. I had always been familiar with the island as a distant portion of our smog-soaked skyline,[1] but this would be different. We had spent the better part of our Spring trimester studying the marine life local to Southern California. We were going out to it in a way that our own tide pools rendered impossible. Limpets, urchins, sea cucumbers, anemone, sea hares, sharks, eels, plankton. Who knew what else. I was blisteringly excited for the opportunity. And it met and exceeded my expectations.Having grown up pretty much on the beach (a one-and-a-half–minute walk from it at any rate), I’ve long held a certain affection for the sea and all it holds. While a special joy for me surrounded the quality of the morning salt air that hangs so heavily in coastal regions, the creatures that inhabit the ocean—both at depth and in shallows—also struck a deep chord of interest. I’ve always been tied up in a romance with the ocean (my last eight land-locked years notwithstanding), but getting off that boat and stepping onto the dock in Avalon a little more than three decades ago was deeply affecting. I was for the first time seeing bright sea creatures outside the confines of an aquarium. The moment my foot hit the planks, I could make out the sunshine orange of garibaldi flirting beneath the surface. It was incredible and was indicative of the next forty-eight hours of attending presentations, handling marine life, snorkeling, and generally basking in the miracle of the sea.[image]Sadly, as I grew older and other concerns began to jockey for my attention, I experienced a waning of interest in the sea as anything other than the locale of some of my favourite youthful pastimes[2]. It’s not that the undersea world no longer held any interest, but more that the magic of girls and videogames and comics were novelties expressing an entirely more visceral kind of power over me. I still found sea hares, -horses, and -cucumbers completely intriguing, but there was this wholly other kind of unshakeable mystery wrapped up in the lines, curves, and movements of Lori Loughlin, Kathy Ireland, and the woman on the car in that Whitesnake video. Sea cucumbers, for all their strange wonder, really couldn’t compare.When I first saw Children of the Sea on a shelf at Borders several years ago, I was intrigued by the physical mass of the book. It sat unobtrusively on the shelf alongside the other manga digests. There was only a single copy available, dwarfed in number by more popular (and now I know, more banal) series. It was, however, nearly twice as thick as the average manga volume—which helped it stand out. Picking it up, my early love affair with the oceans and their bountiful life came rushing back. This book was clearly something special.[3] And now that the series has at last concluded and its five volumes have secured roughly six inches of shelf space, I’m so very grateful to have noticed it all those years ago. This is one of my most treasured comics stories.[image][Poke.]Children of the Sea is in surface the story of two young teens: Ruka and Umi. Ruka appears the rather typical daughter of a broken family. She lives with her mother but hides out at her father’s aquarium. Umi is a boy who, along with his brother Sora, was found as a toddler being raised by a pod of dugongs. Both Umi and Sora are more at home in the water than on land and their bodies have specially adapted to deep-sea free diving and swimming incredibly long distances with an ease unheard of by normal humans. Ruka shares with them a special kind of vision, a way of seeing and hearing the ocean and its inhabitants that is unique among landdwellers. There is a sense of reverence and oneness between these three and the creatures of the deep.Strange things are at play in the world of the sea, and Ruka and Umi seem to be at the heart of this mystery. While Children of the Sea could have very well established itself as a race-against-time adventure of discovery and world-saving (and romance?), it instead develops much more organically, evolving its story in unexpected directions at a gradual, contemplative pace. Information about who Umi and Sora are, about what the ghosts of the sea are, about the histories of various support characters, about where any of this is going—it all trickles in while the reader is busied with absorbing the beautiful seascapes with Ruka. The series seems to have at stake various questions of identity and an exploration of the human/animal place in the universal scope of things. As well, author Igarashi contemplates a cyclical cosmology centralized in the songs of whales and some maybe-not-unrelated reincarnative processes. I adore comics when they are willing to go beyond mere plot-driven entertainments and trawl in more critical depths. This is part of why The Nao of Brown and Duncan the Wonder Dog are two of my favourite comics of all time—and I’m happy that Children of the Sea can make a home in that category as well.[image]Visually, Children of the Sea offers readers an illustrative feast—double-page spreads of whales, rays, turtles, schools of fish that impress through their sheer cinematic scope. Igarashi uses an unpolished (perhaps gesture-based?) style of drawing that breathes life and sensuality[4] into characters and situations. His people aren’t just cartoon sketches; their dimensional presence (as rendered by Igarashi’s homegrown technique) is essential in conveying the naturalism required by his ambitious story direction. Igarashi tempts us to approach Children of the Sea in order to absorb it and be absorbed by it—to find a certain spiritual unity with the work—and the art assists this aim immeasurably.[image]Easily the place where Igarashi’s illustrations are most powerful is in his depiction of the seas and the lives and worlds they hold. His seascapes are lush and the variety of sealife he grants panel time is extraordinary. He draws his protagonists, each of whom have extraordinary capacities for undersea maneuvering, engaged in a near constant ballet with their aquatic hosts. It’s delicate and lovely and foreboding. I don’t know if you’ve ever swum[5] over deep waters, but even confident swimmers are often overcome by dread of the fathomless depths yawning darkly open beneath. The sea, for all its strange unknowableness, truly strikes the human creature with awe. And Igarashi captures the smallest fraction of this terror in his art (which is more than most any other artist I’ve encountered). It’s the kind of feeling I think Lovecraft tries to feel his way toward when he describes the madness-inducing horror of his cosmic things. Or maybe it’s Moses, peeking out from behind the rock at Yahweh’s hindparts. In any case, that awe, terror, respect, and horror are present in Igarashi’s illustrations—and I’m so grateful to have encountered a book that is able to convey at least some small measure of this way of seeing.[image]Children of the Sea's visual exploration is also incredibly detailed. Igarashi draws a lot of fish and draws them well. It took a long time for volume 5 to come out[6], but even a quick flipping through of its pages makes it obvious why that might be the case. Igarashi drew so, so much. Here is a small sample of pages:[image][image]  [image][Click for a larger version]For all that though, part of the wonder of Children of the Sea is that it’s more than just great art. This is a book of ideas, sometimes even big ideas. Even while proposing a fascinating cosmology, Children of the Sea starts off small, questioning the place of human primacy on the earth. There is a conversation in the middle of volume 3 that drives this home. Jim, an oceanic researcher, believes that Umi and Sora, while human, might be “special” in a manner similar to whales, whose cerebral cortices are much more developed than humans and whose peaceful lives might be devoted to thoughts entirely beyond the human enterprise. Dehdeh, a traditional navigator, counters his guess that either humans or whales are the special ones, pointing to the human propensity toward cataloguing and judging information based on what is analogous to our own experiences. By her watch, the human drive toward exhaustive taxonomy combines with our constant masquerading of subjective observation as objective experience to prevent us from recognizing the mysterious.As Dehdeh broaches our fear of the numinous (a fear from which the horror of the depths I mentioned earlier derives) and our unwillingness to account for it within our daily paradigms, Igarashi’s story continues to drive headlong into that kind of intangibility. Children of the Sea's central questions involve wondering at Sora and Umi’s nature, wondering why such strange things are happening in the seas, and wondering ultimately at the part earth’s unique seas play in the universe as a whole. And as if to drive home Igarashi’s point that we are uncomfortable with that which lies beyond the empirical, reader reaction to how Children of the Sea answers these questions will (I would guess) be largely one of frustration. There are answers, certainly, but there remains an expansive sense of mystery.[image]That the final volume of the series is largely wordless is evidence that Igarashi is less concerned with putting a bow on his neatly wrapped gift to us than he is in granting the reader the privilege of basking in a taste of the potentially deeply mystic nature of things. It’s important that Igarashi leave us without the kind of concrete answers that we long for. Near the conclusion of the conversation in which Dehdeh expresses her thought that all species exist in a kind of universe-wide egalitarianism, Igarashi invokes Gödel’s incompleteness theorem in a bid, I think, to prime the reader to recognize that the events in the book’s conclusion will be beyond “reason.” Later, Dehdeh expresses that people love to attach meaning to every little thing and that the most precious truths are best left unspoken, hinting that to describe them would be to bleach them of their preciousness.Children of the Sea is a gradual and complicated work whose strengths probably most deeply lie in its mysteries. One needn’t understand the link the book proposes between the cosmic and the marine to find spectacular value in Igarashi’s vision. It may even be for the best if one doesn’t. A better approach might be to simply enjoy the wonder of the seas as they unfold page after page through these five incredible volumes, and maybe use the discussions of metaphysics as springboard for personal reflection on the things that are just plain beyond us. Igarashi may actually have given us a perfect vessel for the consideration of the enigma of a world-cartography that cannot ever be entirely dependable. And I love him for that._______[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]_______Footnotes1) Those of you who visit the coast of Southern California today are greeted with crisp blue skies after the marine layer burns off by noon. Smog so thick it’d make your lungs hurt and your eyes burn is a thing of the past. Since the implementation of environmental protections, our air is surprisingly worthwhile. Whenever I hear people talk about EPA regulation as some terrible, mismanaged elder beast, I simply point out: But hey, you can breathe and isn’t that something?From the land where my house used to stand in the ‘80s, one can make out the details of the island with astonishing clarity across the intervening water. When I was a kid, a Catalina sighting was a fifty-fifty bet and a crisp vision of the island a rare treasure. More often than not, the entire land mass was obscured by the thick brown-olive band of quote-unquote air that divided the waters below from the waters above—Los Angeles’ own industrious attempt at reinventing the idea of firmament.2)Principally these included boogieboarding and then skimboarding. The vast majority of my life’s potentially lethal experiences revolved around these two activities.3) VIZ’s Signature line continues to distribute worthwhile books, series that challenge popular or common notions of what the medium is capable of or best-suited for. While most of the medium still adheres pretty strongly to genre conventions (crime, romance, superheroes, autobio, sports, horror, et cetera), there are still some books that seek to craft something truly literary. It’s easy to recommend a book to someone who likes noir detective stories, books chronicling the zombie-apocalypse, or even Austen-esque period romance. What’s difficult is when a friend tells me they like the works of Bolaño or Murakami or Hemingway or Salinger or David Foster Wallace or Alice Munro and would like to read a graphic novel in similar vein. These friends aren’t looking for a particular plotline. Instead, they’re looking for something thoughtful, critical. They’re looking for something that looks at the world and has something to say. They’re looking for more of what they like: challenging literature. And while I wish I could easily rattle off a list of comics that land squarely in that kind of category, it’s a pretty tall order. Certainly things are getting better and there’s more of interest available now than there was ten years ago, but the truly worthy books grow pretty sparse along the comics landscape. Fortunately, Children of the Sea just might be another entrant into that canon of valuable, interesting books that defies genre classification and holds its own as a thoughtful approach to the world.4) Not in the sexy sense of sensuality that people like to use to describe why a film might be PG-13. More in the sense that his drawings exude a luscious kind of vitality.5) Just a petty note: swum may be the stupidest-sounding word in the English language. Thank you.6) Long enough so that I was worried that the series would be abandoned.

Or at least colour me that way three weeks ago when volume one of The Manara Library arrived. I gave myself a cooling-off period before sitting down to untangle exactly what I thought of this initial collection of Milo Manara's work. But before I get to solving the Manaran knot, here's how things went down.A few days before release, I saw Dark Horse had posted a note on Twitter cheering the book's advent. Curious, I followed the link provided and arrived at their publisher's destination page for the series. It looked pretty good. The cover was gorgeous and featured a frontier-era couple engaged in some aesthetically pleasing romance. The promotional blurbs were promising: Milo Manara, Italian Comics Legend; comprehensive collection; seminal works; sweeping epic; first comprehensive North American hardcover collection of Manara's work! Not bad. There was an eight-page p featuring a hectic struggle between some cabin-bound settlers and a tribal raiding party fraught with some pretty impressive artwork. I was intrigued. And then, what sold me. A quote from Frank Miller: ""In the hand of Milo Manara, the Old West is a generous, delicious feast for the eyes."" Wow, that sounded exciting. Even though Miller doesn't usually impress me or guide my consumer decisions, I was really in the mood for exactly what his words described. I'm not a deep fan of the Western, but I thought it might be a nice opportunity to broaden the scope of my collection a bit further. So I pre-ordered the book.[image]When it arrived a few days later, I was excited. I squirreled away for an early lunch, holed up in a local coffee joint, and cracked open the book for some good Western excitement. I skimmed the two introductions very quickly because who reads an intro to a comic before they read the actual book? Okay, sometimes I do. But not so much this time. I did, however, glance some comparisons to Sergio Leone in terms of reimagining the American frontier. I was primed.Then the first story of the book, ""Indian Summer,"" begins with a rape. A sexy rape.[image][This is about three pages in or so. The scan is small so you can't see the manifest glee on the two men's faces. The scene ends with the woman bent over, presenting vagina to the reader. Joy.]It's not that I couldn't imagine a great story or work coming out of such a beginning, but it was a bit surprising. I supposed that despite the intentional sensuality of the scene and its dénouement (that thrilling, romantic cover I liked so much is an in-book scene that takes place on the heels of the woman's rape), this could turn into some kind of grander commentary a la The Searchers. I continued and there was a lot of nudity, sexual posing, and scenes composed from deep within the territory of the male gaze. The raw ardor and passion of much of what comprises ""Indian Summer"" took me wholly off-guard. And then of course there're the multiple instances of rape and tiers of incest and their titillating depictions. I turned the book over to look at the publisher's recommended shelving tags. Instead of a Western, like I thought I was purchasing, I had apparently procured a book for my new shelf of Historical Fiction | Erotica. And then my eye strayed down to the price tag. $59.99. Even though I had received a fat pre-order discount, I almost died from sticker shock. I felt abused. Abused by press and packaging. The publisher description little matched what I was reading. I thought I was getting Deerslayer and Last of the Mohicans but found I had been given Cinemax. And that coloured the rest of my reading. Which is why I needed a cooling-off period. I was too mad to write sensibly about the collection. So here we all are.The Manara Library: Volume One contains two stories, ""Indian Summer"" and ""The Paper Man."" Of the two, ""The Paper Man"" is unquestionably the better story in nearly every respect. Only in its art does ""Indian Summer"" show itself superior. ""The Paper Man"" is a silly, throwaway story following a romance through an absurd and quirky version of the environs surrounding Fort Laramie, Wyoming. It was an amusing romp featuring off-the-wall characters, impossible situations, and a good ol' barroom brawl. It wasn't anything special nor was it worth half of sixty dollars, but its charms are inoffensive and I could almost see myself reading the story maybe once more before I die of old age in a spacious undersea palace fifty years from now.[image]""Indian Summer,"" the introductory tale, is where things get murky. After my smouldering subsided, I gave the story a second chance. It fared better on a second read, though honestly, not by much. The art, as mentioned, is impressive. Manara has a fantastic sense of staging (whether you appreciate his subject-matter or not). Whether a quiet scene with a single man posed against a natural backdrop or thirty combatants racing toward and doling out death, Manara shows mastery over his composition. His sense of musculature is robust and his characters exhibit a liveliness that lends to his credibility as an ""Italian comics legend."" The cover itself, a blow-up of a small interior panel, demonstrates well the lyricism of his work. I found myself thoroughly impressed—and then I wished that he had spent his abundant talent on more worthy tales. ""Indian Summer"" is a problematic work on several levels. It's never super evident how much of today's critical eye one should bring to the evaluation of works from another era. Granted, ""Indian Summer"" was first published only slightly less than thirty years ago, so this isn't a creation belonging to the Renaissance or the imperialist sensibilities of 19th century Britannia. Still, in the '80s—at least in America—society was still struggling (and I suppose, we still are) with understanding how to treat the sexes. I have to imagine the same could be said in Italy. In any case, ""Indian Summer"" exhibits many of the challenges to readers that fill the worst examples of comics sexism in the contemporary scene today. Women are depicted presenting for seemingly no reason other than to play on the desires of a presumably male audience (or author). They are objectified in the extreme. After her return to safety, a woman victimized by rape early in the story spends pages wriggling out of her Pilgrim's clothes in her delirium in front of her male hosts (while a young teen skips around pretending to masturbate to the sight). A woman who has been sore abused, while tending to her wounded father, is commanded by him to disrobe and climb into his bath where they then have wild sex for several pages. It's all a bit impossible to digest in any believable fashion. And Manara uses his considerable skill to render these scenes each to the best visual advantage of his reader. I felt insulted and I imagine most women would feel similarly (though who am I to speak for most of anybody?). Then again, I pretty clearly was not the target audience for this work.It would be one thing to be subjected to irony- or subversion-free relishing of sexually objectified women* if the story built up around these things were of any substance or value. This, though, was not the case. ""Indian Summer"" presents a facile narrative built on a foundation of trite clichés. That's right: not just clichés, but trite clichés. If you were to pick up a story with the following characters, which would you guess to be the most wretchedly depraved and corrupt: a) the bastard son of an outcast woman, b) the forest witch, c) the tribal chief, d) the chief's son, d) the Protestant minister, e) the town's mayor, or f) the head of the town's militia? Nine bucks you picked out the minister. Probably ever since Nathaniel Hawthorne (or maybe it was The Bible), the biggest sinner on the block is always the holy man. It's easy. It's clichéd. It's boring as hell. And it doesn't make any statement that hasn't been better put in better works.[image]""Indian Summer,"" at the end of the day, has nothing to boast save for good art and some well-conceived T&A, if that's your thing. Despite his evident talent as a visual storyteller, the story is infantile and almost certainly not worth your time.A note on the production quality for the volume. I was surprised that while the cover and binding and paper are beautifully chosen and produced, the colours and blacks in the book are disappointingly printed. The colours of ""Indian Summer"" are inconsistent, varying from page to page. A character in the same scene under the same light source will have orange-hued skin on one page and on the next he will be yellow. In ""The Paper Man"" many of the pages feature blurred inks, washing out details from what otherwise might have been some nice art. It may be that Dark Horse faithfully duplicated the flawed originals and there may have even been some mention of that in one of the two introductions that remain unread. I just feel that sixty dollars is probably a bit much for inconsistent colours and blurry lines.Until I got to this point, I had imagined that I would give the volume a three-star rating of OK, but after writing all this, I'm not sure I can justify such a high rating. I had thought the whimsical enjoyment of ""The Paper Man"" combined with Manara's talent as an artist could give the book a bit of a lift, but in the end, the shallowness of story, repulsive depictions of characters, and textbook use of the male gaze for no reason other than to render women sexualized objects turned me off enough that I really can't view the book as anything other than Bad. Sorry about that, Italian Legend.*note: not really it wouldn't.[ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Nov 21, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11755460-the-manara-library-vol-1

""The girl’s scream. Had it been her last?"" Contex  [image][art by the stupendous Vera Brosgol]To start things off right, a quote from Hunger Games. ""The girl’s scream. Had it been her last?"" Context: Katniss has been confronted with a girl who had her tongue cut off as punishment and remembers seeing her years earlier just as she was caught. According to memory, as the girl was dragged away, she screamed. Now years later and in the present, Katniss wonders: ""The girl’s scream. Had it been her last?"" Because people without tongues apparently can't scream.We'll get back to this and what it tells us about Susan Collins.To start things another way, I'll admit this: I had no interest in Hunger Games until, upon hearing someone actually describe it, I thought: ""Holy smokemonsters. That sounds like an American rip-off of Battle Royale."" From that moment on, there was little that could stop me from diving straight into Susan Collins' derivative little world.[image]See, Battle Royale was this Japanese movie (adapted from a book I haven't read yet—Christmas, anyone?) in which the government, for inexplicable reasons, takes a class of thirty highscoolers every year and dumps them in this jungle-y arena and demands they fight to the death with a single victor remaining in three days lest the explosive collars they all wear be detonating, rendering no survivors. I mean, what's not to love, right?So Susan Collins basically takes this idea and expands it and tries to give the story a more plausible explanation. (In the movie, the Japanese government televises the BR in order to, get this, quell youth violence in the country. I know, right?) Hunger Games takes place in a post-apocalyptic North America. There is the ruling State, the Capitol, and there are the thirteen vanquished American colonies districts (or twelve since one has been destroyed). For the last seventy-four years, the Capitol has demanded the sacrifice of a teenage boy and a teenage girl from each district to remind the districts annually of how miserably their rebellion failed and to keep them mindful of how absolutely the Capitol rules every aspect of their lives. I don't know, but this strikes me as being only slightly more sensible than the Battle Royale justification. Apparently government officials in the future are as dumb as they are today.In any case, the beauty is that these two sacrifices from each of the twelve remaining districts are not just killed outright, like on an altar atop a stone ziggurat Aztec-style. No, that would be too easy. Instead, they fight in televised survival games (inexplicably called the Hunger Games). These are wildly popular (like I'm told Survivor or American Idol used to be), especially with the Capitol crowd and contestants take on a form of celebrity and their stylists are princes and princesses among men.So Hunger Games is the story of Katniss and Peeta,* two sacrifices from District 12. District 12 is the loser District. Katniss is a hunter (advantage) and Peeta is a baker's son (disadvantage). And since Peets has had a massive, sad, stalker-crush on Kats since they were, like, five, he is determined to keep her alive forever. Interesting dynamic when, Highlander-style, there can be only one. This is basically the same thing that happened in Battle Royale, so it was a comfy place to be.Seeing how Katniss is going to get out of one scrape after another is exciting and the three books are compelling enough reading that I finished the whole thing in about nine days. (And by ""about nine days,"" I probably really just mean ten days.) As demonstrated in the above, the writing's not fantastic by any stretch. Collins suffers from a typical need to over-dramatize, to the point where irrational things are treated sensibly. But (!) it's still a league-and-a-half better than Twilight, not that there isn't much that isn't better written than Meyer's delicious collection of vampire doggerel. I only compare them because they both occupy that meta-genre of light, compulsive reads that others may better know as Summer Reading. And yet, here we are in December! Regardless, I was several nights up far past my bedtime letting Collins plot have its way with me.And for the most part, I really enjoyed the experience. There were very few lulls, most of which occurred in the first fifteen percent of books two and three as they tried to recover from the burst of excitement that capped off the immediate predecessor. The mediocre writing is entirely forgivable simply because the books not about that. Hunger Games is almost pure plot, so that's really all we should be expecting from it. Still, there were two major difficulties I ran into while reading.The first is that the narration's kind of a cheat. Collins tells her story in the first-person present, meaning that we are supposedly getting new information at the same rate as Katniss is. Yet, the things this (largely clueless) girl chooses to report lead one to believe that she has future knowledge. She drops a ton of hints about the importance of the mockingjay, is constantly reminding us that she's wearing her mockingjay pin, and won't stop narrating about how the bird or its image is showing up everywhere. As a reader, we pick up that this is massively significant (because she beats us over the head with it), but since Katniss in the present she's narrating doesn't realize that, there's no reason for her to continue to point it out. That would be like you telling me about your day and stopping every five minutes to remind me that you're wearing your Chuck Taylor's and then after three months of this, Chuck Taylor's suddenly become sentient, rebel against humanity, and then install you as their king. Unlikely, at best. So narrator-Katniss knows everything while narrated-Katniss doesn't. It's a poor choice.Collins almost certainly chose the first-person present because it builds tension (FPpresent is a standard usage in thrillers), but she wanted to be able to use things like heavy foreshadowing, which can only honestly be done in first-person past tense or in the third person. With FPpast, you're almost assured that the narrator survives the climax (save for narration from the after-life), so you're missing the kind of tension and intimacy that the present tense can deliver. Third person stories leave any character open to plot-driven dismissal, but they lack the immediacy and intimacy of the first-person.The second is less tangible but perhaps the more serious offense. At this point, things may get vaguely spoiler-y so those who haven't read the books yet may wish to skip the following paragraphs and just end the  here.So then, in comics, a trend has been noticed. It's been going as Women-in-Refrigerators syndrome for lack of a more exciting term. Essentially, it describes authors' propensity to abusively use female characters to prompt character development in male protagonists. The bottom line is that it doesn't pay to be a female character in superheroland because you'll inevitably wind up raped, maimed, tortured (in a sexy way!), accidentally killed off, murdered, or dismembered and stuffed into a refrigerator just like Green Lanterns girlfriend was—all for the sake of motivating the male lead in some direction or other. Of course, in the male-dominated world of the superhero, female associations are one of the hero's greatest weaknesses and the best way to really stick it to him.[image]Since the lead of Hunger Games is a teenage female, in order to commit a similar abuse, Collins can't just use other male and female associations to give Katniss the gut-wrenching motivation she needs. So then, what is frail in comparison to a teenage girl. Children. Specifically, little, sweet girls. Collins uses little girls twice (once in Book One and once in Book Three) to give her protagonist a human side that is otherwise unseen. Collins realizes that her hero is just a little too cold and too distant and so she must find a way to get the reader to sympathize with her. She puts forth a sweet little girl whom you'll come to find endearing and wise and beautiful and in need of protection from the dirty, cruel world that Collins has crafted and, of course, what's more painful than watching that little girl be destroyed for the sake of a melodramatic tug at one's heartstrings.Kat cries and does something heartfelt and we think of her as human again. At least for a little while. And then we realize that this was the entire purpose for this character in the scope of Collins story and then we feel abused. These were never meant to be character; they were always only a means to humanizing a character that Collins didn't have the chops to humanize in a more talented way. I was a bit grumpy when Collins used the tactic in Book One, but when it reared up again in Book Three, the books became thoroughly diminished in my eyes. I felt abused by Collins' contrivances.For this reason, I lower what would have been (meta-genre in mind) a four-star book series down to three. It's still good and worth the read (unless you have more important stuff on deck), but Collins disrespect for both her characters and her readers lessens their value._____*note: Susan Collins should not be allowed to name anything. Not books, not characters, and certainly not real-life children. The one bit of silver lining here is that thankfully, this almost assures us that in four years we won't be babysitting a gaggle of brats named Peeta—apparently Bella was uncommonly common after the Twilight wave surged....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Nov 14, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2767052-the-hunger-games

Indeed, why he couldn't explain the phenomenon or any of the laws that govern it. The physicist was Richard Feynman and his answer was essentially that the question would demand an infinitely regressing series of Why questions, each one more complex and specialized than the last. Or in short, the interviewer wasn't smart enough to understand the answer.* I was amused by Feynman's response to the question and the manner of his delivery. I had always intended to seek out the documentary or series from which the clip was excerpted, but for one reason or another never found the time. Still, his name lingered in my cognizant mind and when I saw that a comic about the man was being produced, I happily sought it out.Through a happy coincidence, not two weeks before Feynman arrived on my desk, I had the opportunity to read Logicomix, the record of another luminous mind of the 20th century. Where Feynman lays out the life and intellectual pursuits of a great theoretical physicist, Logicomix follows the rigourous quest of Bertrand Russell, one of the era's great logicians. And despite their not-so-interrelated fields of expertise, the two books enjoy quite a bit of overlap, both in terms of characters** and themes.[image]One of the abiding motifs that Feynman's character in Feynman hopes to impress upon the reader is the infinite complexity of things, of physical things. Scientists have names and formulae to describe any number of processes that govern our world, but do they truly understand these things or are they just ridiculously dedicated to the art of taxonomy? Feynman, in a number of ways, cynically suggests the latter. After all, there's only so much headway the finite can make when rushing toward the infinite. The question of how to sound out our depths when we are out of our depth is the central conflict in Russell's story and is the bugbear that nearly drives him to ruin and madness.Feynman, being a clown, never seems too close to madness. He is always knee-deep in wonder at the gala production the universe displays for him in every moment to be concerned with sanities. He is, however, also well-aware of the genius scientist's humble position before the natural world—how the physicist must grovel before the unknown just to get a little further down that chain of ever-more-specified questions.Feynman is a lot more funny than I expected it to be. This is the story, among other things, of the development of The Bomb. Of ""I am become death"" and all that. The story of the 20th-gory-century. Both Feynman and Logicomix sit amidst the tumult of Hitler's Germany and horrible things that well-eclipse the dreams and goals of individual men. And yet while Feynman could have been a somber reflection on the works of men, because it contains the character of Richard Feynman as its central spirit and guiding light, it really cannot be anything other than amusingly interesting. [image][That's right Richard. You made The Bomb and all you can do is bang on your drum? Get real, man.]Even in the darkness of the human struggle, jest overpowers meditation. Feynman has thoughtful things to communicate, careful ideas to draw out—but it does so with winks and smirks. With an eye to the adventure that life can be if only one can see the adventure that life is.Feynman is a wonderful book, well-written (with the now-deceased physicist as our interlocutor) and presented with a relaxed art-style that communicates the easy-going spirit of the man effortlessly. The book also delivers what I had wished Logicomix would have: a concise, detailed explanation of its hero's central Remarkable Idea. Feynman won a Nobel Prize for his work describing and solving quantum electrodynamic principle (QED). If magnets are not the kind of thing that can be explained to laymen, QED is the kind of thing that probably shouldn't even be named. Still, I was hungry to get a taste (and therefore appreciation) for just what Feynman did that was so incredible. Feynman delivers by recreating, in the book's final pages, a lecture on QED that Feynman delivered in New Zealand to an introductory-level physics class. It's tough to follow, complex, and probably a bit above most of our heads, but I was glad that it was there. And the book is probably better off for its inclusion.[image]Both Logicomix and Feynman successfully translate their giant figures into human characters with whom readers can empathize. Both books function well as distillations of lives readers might not otherwise appreciate. Both books crack open doors into understanding the story of the 20th century from directions usually unmapped and unexplored. Both books are truly wonderful and very much worth the reader's time. Only one of them, however, will make one laugh.***[image][Oh Richard, you card.]_____________________Notes*To be fair, Feynman probably wouldn't have described himself as being smart enough to understand The Answer either.**Or at least one character. John Von Neumann, the great mathematician and one of the giants in the early days of computer sciences makes appearances both in Feynman's and Russell's lives at various points in the two narratives.***And I'm not telling which.[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,not set,not set,"Oct 27, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9844623-feynman

InWhen age-spanning epics are called for, there are few so often drawn from the Great Well of Story Archetypes as the battle between order and chaos. In the realms of the human and the personal, some variation of Boy Meets Girl is undoubtedly the go-to narrative frame. But when a teller really wants to up the stakes and sell his audience either a cosmology or an apocalypse, only gods and monsters will do. And such a pairing (almost until the postmoderns) demands Order in one corner, girded and ready, honed to perfection and waiting with grim determination to show ropes to Chaos, who spills out over the opposite corner, spoiling for blood and violence and the reckless anarchy of the brawl. It's the story of Yahweh and Lucifer, of Marduk and Tiamat, of Feanor and Melkor, of Gandalf and Sauron. And it's the story of Bertrand Russell as romantically couched by Apostolos Doxiadis and Christos H. Papadimitriou.I haven't read a lot of Bertram Russell. Apart from a couple scattered essays, breezed through nearly twenty years ago, my acquaintance with the man's work is nearly without existence. And those writings I have spent time with have been rather facile, wholly practical works—neither of which included any expression of maths at all. Honestly, while I knew of Russell's status as a logician, I was unaware of what exactly that meant and exactly how foundational was Russell's place in the logical pantheon. (And this after taking several semesters of logic in college. We studied the application of logic rather than the history of the stuff and I didn't study enough of it to get beyond base symbolics, which I rather enjoyed.) It seems that I missed out on a lot. [image]Logicomix is the story of what is apparently Russell's masterwork, Principia Mathematica, in which Russell seeks to ground mathematics in logic rather than in mere axiom. More though, as Logicomix unfolds, we see that the formation of the Principia is really Russell's struggle to impose Order on a world that seems to be built on Chaos. Doxiadis and Papadimitriou work hard to sell the concept, even to the point of overlaying the Oresteia as an interpretive framework. Will order govern chaos? Will logic come to supplant madness?The authors keep us excited and invested in the tale's outcome. We see the stakes clearly spelled out by Russell even at an early age as he wrestles with the arbitrariness of the world as described to him by his religious aunt. We see his conundrum as his excitement over the promise of mathematics collapses entirely when he realizes his supposed salvation is built upon what amounts to wishful thinking. We see his hopes laid bare as he looks to logic for a foundation for mathematics—and so a foundation for belief in an ordered universe. We see the detritus of a history of logicians whose minds broke against the fortressed walls of infinity and paradox. Will Russell succumb? Will he find the elixir to banish paradox? Will he in his alchemical balance of math and philosophy—in his inundation into the fountain of logic—find salvation? Will we? Or will he only find one more succubus, a myth that will drain him of life and reason, leaving him as much a wreck as his predecessors?Doxiadis and Papadimitriou excel at putting forth Russell's dilemma in terms easily understandable. We feel Russell's pain as he and his partner, Whitehead, struggle for years to find their solution. We wait with the rest of the early 20th century's logical community for a solution to Russell's paradox, what amounted to a devastating blow to the superstructure of logic itself. We understand why Russell teeters on the brink of madness, even as his forerunners Cantor and Frege succumb. Unfortunately, and perhaps this is testimony to its complexity, the authors only offer the most brushing glance at Russell and Whitehead's solution (and of Kurt Gödel's extrapolation). We see that it's there, that Russell has done... something. Only we aren't told what exactly.[image]Personally, I would have liked a page or two more on this tack. Even if a simplified explanation still sat over my head, at least I'd be able to pick at it, circle in on it, and take it apart at my leisure. As is, if I'm inclined to discover what Russell ended up doing, I'm forced to find that out on my own.Still, as the creators attest in one of their self-referential fourth-wall-sundering interludes, their primary concern in this saga is the persons rather than the ideas. While the ideas belong to the characters and help shape their figures in our imaginations, people who are well-sketched are people built of emotions and histories and romance and goals and anguish. They are made of their circumstances and their ideas are made of them. Logicomix fights foremost to tell the story of people as people. And here it succeeds unflinchingly.[image]Every one of its figures are persons with their own lives and histories, all of which I am interested to discover. Should the creative team here devote pages to any one of the mathematicians, philosophers, or logicians that wander across Russell's life as presented here, I will purchase and read such a book. Wittgenstein in particular marks a character who I'd love to see pursued in his own book—even though Wittgenstein inhabits a fair percentage of Russell's book, I was thirsty for more.[image][Oh Wittgenstein, could I ever not love you?]Logicomix as biography is somewhat lacking, in that it tails off a good thirty years before Russell's death and leaves the story of the Principia's final impact upon logic merely hinted at. But as a story of Russell's search for order against the winds of chaos, I found the book a compelling excursion.

The book was amusing enough but there was no real point of contact with the characters as they have their lives affected in meaningful ways by manga. Certainly I can understand that a book might offer some catharsis or personal breakthrough if experienced at just the right period in one's life, but that's nearly as oblique as saying things that happen can be meaningful to the people they happen to. Without sharing in the specific honoured cultural artifact (in Kingyo's case, a particular comic), it's all too abstract to be engaging.So I was worried when I picked up Not Love but Delicious Foods Makes Me So Happy and found that it was a non-fictional collection of restaurant s by Fumi Yoshinaga. I feared, I think understandably, the very same disconnect that governed my experience of Kingyo. I was concerned that what might be a good book would remain beyond my ability to ascertain. Fortunately, Not Love is more than just a celebration of Tokyo restaurants that I will never have the opportunity to set foot in.While it's true that in every chapter food is sampled at a particular restaurant and then that restaurant is discussed in terms of dishes, cost, service, and ambiance, the book is really about Yoshinaga herself. Or maybe it's about Y-naga. Fumi Yoshinaga's in-story analogue is F-mi Y-naga—and she introduces herself like so:[image]I'm not sure where the fact and fiction begin and end with Yoshinaga's depiction of herself, but I'll just roll with what the reader is given. Y-naga is a mangaka who mostly draws yaoi (comics about handsome young men romancing handsome young men). She's a bit of a slob, but she'll dress up well (I guess) in order to go out for dinner at a nice place. Because there is one true love in Y-naga's life: food.[image]So far as a book of restaurant s, Not Love is fascinating because Y-naga only visits restaurants she adores and so never has anything bad to say about any of them. Instead, she rhapsodizes over each dish and tries to force her dining companions (which usually include her longsuffering assistant, S-hara) to love food as much as she does. Her foodie experiences, as Yoshinaga reports them, are more an opportunity to see Y-naga's dysfunctional, perverted personality on display. And that's why Not Love is such a fun little book—despite the fact that I cannot connect with the restaurants (or, let's be honest, the dishes) that make up the backdrop of Y-naga's disaster of a life.But really, though the book builds Y-naga up as a social calamity and makes it pretty clear that she'll probably never find love, it seems equally clear that she might not even need romance. I mean, it's even there in the title. She's a foodie's foodie. Dining plays surrogate for her passions and though she exhibits a kinky appetite that remains starved, she still functions as a whole person, despite her lack. Food really does seem to satisfy her. At least mostly.[image][A Goukon is basically a speed-dating event.]I enjoyed Not Love but Delicious Foods Makes Me So Happy far more than I expected because the book was not what it seemed. Instead of boring, it was crazy.

Any glance at your newspaper's comics page or editorial cartoons ought to bring enough evidence to bear on that score—if you still get a newspaper. Certainly there are successes, books and strips that routinely have even readers with well-developed senses of humour smiling regularly—and maybe even actually laughing occasionally. Perry Bible Fellowship comes to mind. Or Mignola's Screw-On Head. A lot of the other stuff either only succeeds partially or, more often and sadly enough, not at all.Chew, on the upside, is actually funny and does exhibit the occasional moment of pure joy. Moments like this:On the other hand, Chew does not find itself in the company of other envoys of the humourous like Screw-On Head, Far Arden, or The Goon. It doesn't rank with books like Street Angel or Atomic Robo either. And it's not even as consistent in its joys as situational comedies like Yotsuba& or the works of Mitsuru Adachi. Over the last couple weeks since I read it, I've been trying to pin down exactly where the book goes wrong. And I'm still not even sure if I understand.Chew isn't straight comedy. Its goal isn't to deliver only laughs. As of volume 1, the book does have a story to tell and it unfolds in a kind of episodic adventure-comedy format. Kind of like if Indiana Jones released as a 21st-century HBO series that crossed adventure, extra-natural food powers, and lots of jokes. Entertaining as far as it goes but—to flip the channel for a moment—not exactly Must-See TV.[image]There are two points at which the series truly shines: invention and art.For the one, the extra-normal powers people in Chew's world are great ideas. They all relate to food. Protagonist Tony Chu (chew, get it? get it?) is cibopathic, meaning he can reading the entire history of anything he eats, be it hummus or human. Love-interest Amelia, a saboscrivner, has the power to write about food in such a way as to make her readers actually taste what she writes. Apparently, as the series progresses, more and more powers along these lines are introduced, and honestly, I find that fascinating. Actually, because I found the humour so variant, I think a book exploring all the things Chew does (and especially the powers) but focusing more on story and the whole drama of it all would have been a much more interesting work. The other piece that interested me was Rob Guillory's art. It's always interesting and occasionally breathtaking. Again, I refer you to this:[image][Amen sister.]Guillory's human form is where I think his illustrative powers best find their avenue. His forms are dynamic and cartoonish and, usually, not the least bit handsome. Amelia the love interest, for example, is this dumpy little thing with hips wide enough to give easy birth to birthing hips. Tony Chu is this squirrely little smudge of a man. And there was this slutty Russian girl in a fur bikini at the South Pole who was really just horrifying to look at—and even so, I imagine she was a knock-out in Tony Chew's world. And strange as it seems for me to be praising-slash-encouraging this, Guillory's handle on the grotesque makes him an ideal artist for a book that saddles itself on absurdity and rides that horse into its own sunset.And here we come back to the book's bugbear. Or at least its bugbear in my own opinion. As well as being notoriously difficult to pull off, comedy is notoriously subject to its audience. Maybe Chew is ridiculously perfect in its delivery and its timing but I was just not in a place to appreciate it. Maybe its blend of story and humour will be exactly what most readers who approach it will want. I can't really judge these things. I know some people adore the book and I can't really begrudge them their tastes. [image]That I wasn't really taken with the book is something I feel a little bit bad about. It's doing interesting things and quite possibly gets better in later volumes. All I know is that I can't say whether or not I'll be there to find out these things. I won't write the series off, but I'm not exactly comfortable enough with it to write it on either.[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,not set,"Oct 26, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6839093-chew-vol-1

I[image]Across the canon of the living dead, the spread of zombification has represented (or been said to represent) any number of social nightmares. In Invasion of the Body Snatchers, it was communism or consumerism or nothing at all, depending on whom you ask. In The Dawn of the Dead, Romero was said to have taken on consumerism. Or maybe he took on social hierarchies and the power struggles between the haves and the have-nots, between the whites and everyone else. Depends on who you ask. Still, Western visions of the undead plague have tended to revolve in some sense around materialism, around goods and what they mean to a society. Even latter-day hybrids combining zombie mythos and the Outbreak-style disease-control disaster story like 28 Days Later can be seen as treatments of the roles in which the masses are trapped by a consumerist society. Consumerism, materialism, and the fears that grow out of these broken social directions all find a bounty of indicators in Western zombie fiction, but what do the undead look like in other cultures?Probably something a lot like those who succumb to the mysterious plague in Inio Asano's What a Wonderful World!While American iterations of the myth generally sit pretty squarely in the realm of horror and are marked with gore and viscera, Asano's freshman work doesn't contain any of the stuff. It's not scary either, not in any traditional sense. In fact, until the final chapters, one might not even notice anything remotely zombie-ish about any of it. While there's death and those who fall prey to predators, there's no rotting flesh or buzzing flies (though, to be fair, there is a dragonfly in one scene). There's no mass panic and very few people hiding away in their apartments. All the same though, there is a zombifying plague afoot and I suppose it's even possible to read it as a reaction against the consumerist identities that Japanese society imposes on its citizens.Apropos of its title, What a Wonderful World! (note the exclamatory!) unfolds as a two-disc concept album, weaving numerous characters and themes together to propose a multifaceted vision of 21st-century Japan and its future. Each only tangentially-related track (as Asano refers to his chapters) spins the reader closer to his narrative crescendo, nearer to the book's ideological index case. And Asano seems full-well attuned to the irony with which Louis Armstrong's 1968 single pushed its way into a history rife with domestic racism and international violence; Armstrong sings as if blind or naive to the frustrations of the real world (though he was anything but). Asano, who seems interested in painting a portrait of the State Of Things at the dawn of third-millennium Japan, posits beautiful scenery and relationships even over the corroding husk of civilization. A lot of the more melodramatic manga wallows in apocalyptic imagery in order to speak of a broken Japanese society, but Asano—with the same subtlety he uses when approaching the undead trope—doesn't feel the need for a bomb. He just shows things as they are, believing that to be apocalypse enough for any rational being.[image]Tonally, What a Wonderful World! hops around a bit from track to track. Sometimes vibrant, sometimes somber. Asano doesn't hit the reader over the head with any one message. Some might find what looks to be a mere collection of short stories to be a bit scattered, but by book's end I personally saw him driving everything toward a single goal—something that quietly turns in the face of what everything in the world is saying and demurely gives it the finger. (Asano's finale is not so raucous as the punk bands with which his story begins—those musicians have, after all, been cowed and brought to heel by oppressive structures of consumerist society.) In the end, he mimics Armstrong's own rejection of what is sensible to the eyes and proposes that rebellion is found in beauty and the careful tending of our relationships one with another. Asano's solution to the slack-jaws that society never tires of pumping out with assembly-line utility: stop being such a cog, look around, and let's all exclaim together, ""What a Wonderful World!""And then we get hit by a car.Notes!Note 1: The art in this thing is spectacular. A couple years ago, I hadn't heard of Asano. Then I had the good fortune to be skimming Tom Spurgeon's site (unfortunately I can't find where anymore) and saw this image:  [image][Behold the image that sold me on the series. Click to embiggen.]That propelled me to check out what on earth could be the book that held such dynamic static images. And while What a Wonderful World! definitely has some of the marks of an early work, the seeds for some of the later wonderful images he's created are well-evident here.Note 2: What a Wonderful World! boasts an unwieldy assortment of characters. From reading s and talking to friends, a common complaint revolves around the difficulty in telling one character from another and in remembering how different characters relate within the scope of the story. To help readers place all the characters accurately, I've provided this chart mapping out the connections or relationships between Asano's characters. (Note that instances of smaller images are in place to provide visual reference to a character's alternate visual identity—e.g. Horita with mohawk vs. Horita in the present). I've also provided references to characters of low importance simply so that readers might help distinguish them from other characters (e.g. the Bear's Girlfriend vs. the Bear's hostage).

There is something transcendent about holding another person's brain in your hands, about receiving crystal-clear messages from the dead (if your author is indeed passed on). And books that explore this mystery are a delectable wonder to me.[image]Half my joy in reading Carlos Ruiz Zafón's Shadow of the Wind (beyond the entrancing period and twisting plot) was the book's love affair with The Book. Not a book but the book—the idea and instantiation of the book. Books. Whatever. Shadow of the Wind is a book that among other things explores the way a book can change your life, the way a book (the right book for you as an individual) can hover over your entire existence, giving it a unique taste and texture.Kingyo Used Books is interesting because this mysterious power locked up in books (and in Kingyo's case, manga) is the series' central interest. The sad thing is that it only ever broaches lightly the mystery. It's like if you were reading a book about Teddy Roosevelt and that book wanted you to know just how wonderful Roosevelt was, but every time it talked about him, it simply said, ""Teddy Roosevelt was wonderful""—or sometimes, ""Teddy Roosevelt was marvelous."" You could see the author's point, that Sure he thought that Roosevelt was a class act, but you'd never really know why. The same thing is at play in Kingyo.[image]The series never stops talking about the wonders of manga. All the characters eventually come to agree. We even see that reading the right manga can change lives, inspire confidence, stoke passions, etc. We just never get to see how. Kingyo is thoroughly romantic in its approach to manga as a panacea; I just wish there would be more exploration of why each chapter's manga of choice blooms the changes it does in the affected individual's life. Each chapter of Kingyo features prominently a different manga series, giving readers a potential reading list after they put Kingyo down, but delves little into what makes these individual titles special.I'm certain Kingyo plays better in Japan, where readers are undoubtedly more familiar with the different books mentioned. I was definitely more invested in chapters that dealt with books I was familiar with (e.g. Tezuka's Adolf and Moebius' Blueberry). In those chapters, just the mention of the books could conjure all that sense of a book's presence that I described as being missing from the series. I had to generate it myself, but perhaps that's what Kingyo's author is planning on. Part of the problem for Western audiences will be the unavailability of so many of the mentioned titles. It would be one thing if there were used manga stores commonly cropping up across the American landscape, but I suspect that I'll never see the majority of books these characters rhapsodize over.[image]Apart from that substantial disappointment, the stories are all engaging in a kind of breezy way. The central cast isn't so big, consisting of around eight regulars, but each chapter introduces more visitors to the shop (who may or may not recur), such that it's hard to grow that attached to the characters and their unique dilemmas. In some cases, I found the art hindering my ability to discern whether a character was a regular or a new addition. In any case, with so many people flitting through the store and through the narrative, it becomes difficult to draw a bead on exactly what certain characters are like, who they are, how their personalities work. Though I spent three volumes observing the goings-on in the Kingyo used bookstore, I rarely felt I had any better appreciation for who these employees were than I do with the employees of real-life stores or restaurants that I occasionally visit.Still, the stories are fun and even if I never felt either a connection to the book's characters or any real sense of why the titles featured were worth my time (and maybe being worth my time was never the point), each volume was an enjoyable way to pass an hour. There are little visual treats* as well that work to endear Kingyo's characters, even while they keep themselves at arms distance. The series cheerfully embarks on its single-minded quest to show people getting a lot out of reading—and there's something to be said for that, even when it's not quite as robust a quest as I might prefer.[image]*note: such as in the first chapter of volume one, when Natsuki wakes at the front desk in the store with Shiba's coat (?) draped over her.

Brown for[image]A couple weeks ago, I read and ed Chester Brown's Paying For It, a book singularly concerned with separating love from sex. Brown forwards the idea that fewer problems arise if we segregate sex as completely as we can from the relational sphere. He does this to such an extent that he proposes that sex is a pleasure best paid for and made entirely transactional. It's not spoiling anything to say that Brown, as he represents himself in the book, is more wholly concerned with sex than he is with relationship. Despite the author's protestations, readers will almost certainly feel some sorrow for him as he shows himself unable to enjoy the manifold blessing of romantic relationships. We watch his philosophy play itself out and wonder: is it enough?Craig Thompson's latest work, Habibi, may function well as a companion piece to Paying For It, only emphasizing the inverse of Brown's work: love that excludes sex. Thompson balances several themes throughout Habibi's unfolded history of two runaway slaves but perhaps chief among these is an exploration of love, of true love—and how it can exist, flourish, and grow even in the absence of sexual fulfillment. Chester Brown focused on his women as pure objects, as receptacles for his sexuality to the exclusion of their ability to exist as full-orbed human persons with dreams, hopes, loves, or even (for the most part) personalities; Thompson, on the other hand, uses the objectification of his characters to craft them into noble persons deserving of dignity, of hope, of love.Thompson walks a narratively perilous path, pushing envelopes with his characters that draw out the terror of the human spirit balancing against the redeeming power of a full-bodied and depth-defying love. His choices are dangerous because as his characters participate in choices that may seem abominable—and in some sense they are abominable choices, made so by their sheer necessity—Thompson risks the reader losing interest in the plight of these two characters. Still, the compassionate reader won't be able to help investment into their two stories, which are really just one story.[image]In Habibi, Thompson introduces us to his heroine, Dodola, as she is sold into marriage to a scribe who will teach her to read, to understand the power of stories. Dodola is nine and Thompson does not spare us the aftermath of her wedding night. What's worse is that the anguish of such a scene, such an experience, is small in comparison to the fate Dodola and her adopted son Zam will live out. Thompson makes a cruel god for his world and creations; yet it is in his cruelty that we see the beauty of Dodola and Zam spill out in Habibi's nearly seven hundred pages.[image]Habibi is a major work in comics literature and Thompson's first since the nearly-six-hundred-page Blankets. Comparisons will be obvious. Both works traffic deeply in religious language and colour their texts in displays of sacred ferocity. Both explore the boundaries and need for love and human contact. Both play with non-linearity in storytelling, skipping back and forth and only revealing the past in time to illuminate the future. These two creations are very much the work of the same author and it's a joy to see his voice maturing.[image]Still, for those hoping for another Blankets, Thompson has something very much different in store. In both tone and scope, Habibi is an entirely more ambitious work. We see Thompson redressing things that were focal points in Blankets. In the former book, Raina is depicted in such sacred light by Thompson that she becomes the ultimate example of female sexual objectification—all with the best intentions of course, but when young Craig deifies her, he makes her into little better than a graven image. In Habibi, however, when Dodola is depicted nude (which is often), she is wholly human. This is a triumph of Thompson's technique for in the midst of the narrative, she is being wholly objectified, yet these instances serve only to drive home her humanity. For the majority of those within Habibi's narrative landscape, Dodola exists much as Chester Brown's ideal woman—she is merely a receptacle for their sexual advances. Thompson, however, prevents the reader from seeing her in this way by refusing to give her the visual lyricism her bestowed upon Raina. Both are sacred and both are holy, but the one is made so by her sexuality while the other is made so by her personhood. It's a difficult line to draw and that Thompson illustrates it so well ably demonstrates why he is one the leading auteurs in the medium.[image][Even odds that Thompson actually tried this out at some point in his life.]Habibi is a book marked by rape, slavery, castration, forced marriages, the murder of children, harems, and love. While in its murk and depths, it may not seem possible that the last of these—love—should so completely over-power all else, but this is the case. Love is not always victorious, but it is always glorious. The love of these two for each other is simultaneously heart-rending and heart-warming. And it is for this reason that I won't soon forget that when Habibi asks of love without sex, Is it enough? the answer, though quiet in the face of the world's roar, is defiant: Yes, it is.NoteOne word about the art: it's manifestly evident why this book took Thompson six years to create. Beyond the research necessary to develop such a well-rounded story that borrows so heavily from the Qur'an, Habibi's art is a wonder. The intricacy with which Thompson approaches his pages staggers the imagination—especially when one recalls the stress-injury pain in his hand that he related in Carnet de Voyage. So many of the pages of Habibi feature delicate ornamentation pulled from Islamic culture, ornament that would take hours to complete. Here's an example:[image]These are corners from four different pages, showing the kind of decoration that Thompson wrapped around entire pages. At first I presumed that he drew this just the once and reproduced the designwork for subsequent pages. This photo though shows that each page's work was distinct. That Thompson took the care to patiently (or impatiently, it hardly matters) draw out these magnificent designs helps flesh out just how much effort was poured into this production. The six years shows and Thompson outdoes anything I'd seen from him previously.[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,194,1,not set,not set,"Sep 25, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10138607-habibi

Dayton. Birmingham. Boise. In order to simulate for soldiers the difficulties involved in urban warfare, the marines were tasked to carry their training, complete with helicopter drops and in some cases live ammunition, through the civilian streets. At least in some cases, areas were cordoned off in an effort to protect citizens from, well, injury and death. In others, city-dwellers were given the opportunity to play a part in these exercises. Some saw these events in a dim light and really, for the already mistrustful public, what does it say when a nation's military practices invading its own cities? That's probably neither here nor there so far as concerns Any Empire. Probably. But let it be known that until after I finished the book the first time and did some poking around, I had no idea that this sort of thing happened. And that ignorance cost me a perfectly enjoyable experience on my first read-through. I had gotten to this point in the last third of the book and I was just completely baffled, thinking that Powell had without enough warning taken readers into the same surreal territory as he had in Swallow Me Whole. (If you've forgotten Swallow Me Whole, the male protagonist talks to a wizard the size of his fist and the female lead becomes the Queen of Insects.)But see, he hadn't. I didn't know it at the time, but Powell's finale is largely literal. Based-on-true-events kind of stuff. Certainly there's a bit of subjective magical reality going on, but the stuff that happens there at the end? It happens. I wish I had known about these maneuvers before I had read the book. That's why I led off with the stuff. It would have helped a lot and made my first reading more enjoyable. Which would have been great because Any Empire is an incredibly rich book. Heck, it's an incredible book. And that my first experience of it should have been less than stellar just makes me sad. On the inside.Any Empire is an exploration of the essentially violent worlds that many of us have grown into. Powell's male lead, Lee, grows up in the late '80s or early '90s reading Larry Hama's G.I. Joe and imagining his town a war zone. Visually, Powell projects these imaginations and visions into real space, showing how strongly they exert their force upon Lee's interpretation of the world around him. [image][Worst date ever.Tip for the kiddies: never ever text on a date.] Similar forces play on the perspective of Lee's neighbour, Purdy. An insecure child, both bully and bullied, Purdy is at odds with a world that he cannot understand, a world that doesn't care to be understood by him. He's not quite a bad guy, but he's not good enough not to be. He too lives in a militaristic imagination and even during his childhood, the reader sees that he is a bit unhinged from any sort of plausible take on reality.It's as Powell follows these two through their lives into young adulthood that we see how their affections for the implements of war have impacted their lives. Powell creates a couple worthwhile lessons here, but even if those are his main point, he doesn't seem to feel any need to belabour them. Powell says his piece through several moments and leaves the story to unfold itself.He definitely has things to say both about our culture of violence and the human affection for war, but Powell spends time on the healing side of our nature as well. Any Empire's female lead, Sarah, cares deeply for animal life and goes to great lengths to secure the welfare of any injured creature she discovers. Just as Lee lives in a world propped up by G.I. Joe, the clockworks of Sarah's world grinds under the direction of Nancy Drew mysteries. And these affections follow her into adulthood. While as a child, she investigated the abuse of the local turtle population by a gang of ruthless children, as an adult she makes investigative housecalls for child services. Both are thankless jobs, but she pursues them because it was in her nature to do so.[image]It's Sarah and her mom who drive home the lesson that not all people are such as those described in 1939's classic animated short, Peace on Earth—a powerful, anti-war piece that Powell uses to good effect in one of the book's more poignant scenes. In Peace on Earth and its 1955 remake, Good Will to Men, some animated squirrel children (or mice in the remake) ask an older animal what men are, referencing the lyric ""Peace on earth, good will to men."" The grandfather figure explains how men were terrible creatures, bent on destruction, and how even when there were only two left, those two still ended up killing each other. It's a fearsome picture and I recall vividly the first time I saw Peace on Earth as a child. Powell uses this story to lead into a powerful moment between Lee and his father, but it's seeing Sarah live out a life counter the film's example that really sells the idea.[image][Powell retells the film beautifully,even if ther were squirrels in the original, not mice.]Powell continues to show himself a creator who is absolutely worth paying attention to and Any Empire may even be better than Swallow Me Whole, which was sublime. The great thing about these books (I mean, beyond the stellar art) is how well they stand up to multiple reads. Powell crafts a rich tapestry of both visual and narratory tricks that serve to inject subsequent investigations with a freshness and interpretive excitement. Any Empire is a good book, a great book.____________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,not set,not set,"Sep 19, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11242668-any-empire

In it, a frienThere was this one scene in Gene Yang's Level Up that struck truer for me than maybe any other two-panel pair in the history of comics. In it, a friend describes the Nintendo Entertainment System to a young Dennis. Let's listen in:[image]The reason this scene resonated so strongly with me was that this was word for word my own response to the discovery that such a machine would be coming to American shores. I mean, give or take a word. The impact of gaming systems on my young life was indelible, stamping my day-to-day routines with their sizzling brand. I had owned game systems before the NES, but it was that particular machine that unveiled a whole new tone to the possibility of digital entertainment.And like most of Dennis' friends (and therefore unlike Dennis himself), I was allowed to own a game system. Of course, probably unlike Dennis' friends, I had to earn the money with which to purchase said system (and later, systems). Still, this is where the similarities between my experience and Dennis' diverge. While Dennis' father prevents Dennis from enjoying frivolities in his youth (teaching him of the necessity of ""eating much bitterness""), my own parents promoted more balance in my youthful endeavors, allowing bitterness to mix with enjoyable pursuits in both athletics and the humanities. The point being, I had a lot of fun growing up—while Dennis studied.[image]Honestly, I was a little sad that Level Up moved in this direction after such a strongly resonant scene. There's nothing wrong with the direction the book takes save for that now it was no longer telling the story of my life. Instead of telling a story charting a path I would have been familiar with, Gene Yang and Thien Pham navigate a life of extreme conflict. Dennis is either wanton in his digital gaming orgies or brutally weighed down by a desperate need to work toward becoming a gastroenterologist. It's a hard road, requiring endless hours of work, so it makes sense that the falls off the wagon are steep and from height. It doesn't help that Dennis feels driven by the Fates.Destiny plays its heavy hand in Dennis' circumstances and hangs around like a turkey vulture, ready to pick at the carcass it intends to make of his life. Or at least the spectre of it does. Destiny gets referred to a lot. By Dennis and by the four cherubic angels that begin to haunt him, cracking the whip until he gets his work done—for destiny! Dennis is the child of immigrants and his father, having eaten much bitterness himself in order to give Dennis a good life in his new country, died when he was a senior in highschool. If there's an antagonist in this story, it's probably not destiny or the angelic quartet or even Dennis' dad. Instead, it's the memory of his father and what his father probably wanted for him.Really, Dennis is just weighed down by a conscience that will cut him no slack and will demand everything from him.[image]Along the way, we're introduced to three actually human characters who each try to pull Dennis toward one extreme or another. Takeem would have Dennis join him in the professional gaming circuit. Ipsha emphasizes the essentiality of doing as one's parents request and/or expect. And Kat strikes the note of individualism, demanding that Dennis learn to be his own man and grow into the kind of person who does well by doing what he most wants.It's a good story, but I wish we would have been given more time with any of the supporting characters who didn't have feathers. There were about a million interesting conversations that could have taken place but didn't. Or maybe they did but simply occurred off-camera. Level Up is a rather sparse work that almost races toward its conclusion. More interaction with Dennis' friends may have only served as padding, holding off the climax for just that much longer, but I felt the book would have been stronger for it. Because of the story's rather pragmatic manner of unfolding itself, most of the characters sit shy of three-dimensional. Even Dennis. Which is a little bit too bad.[image][Really, I probably just wanted more of this.]It's a worthwhile story and pretty well-told. The art is well-conceived and the watercolouring a beautifully simple touch. It just that at the end of the day, because the characters weren't as well-developed as they could have been, it was hard to care for their struggles and needs. Level Up approaches greatness but runs out of quarters before it can get there.____________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,not set,not set,"Sep 19, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9630403-level-up

Hiring an escort, like eating balut, is not a thing I ever plan to count among my worldly experiences. Like pretty much all of Chester Brown's friends—as depicted in Paying for It—I have certain qualms about the idea of paying for sex. That said, Brown, through this memoir chronicling nearly fifteen years of visits to prostitutes, presents a compelling case for the decriminalization of prostitution in a pluralistic society.Chester Brown, largely noted for his engaging biographical work concerning Louis Riel, stopped dating in 1996. In a conscious act of will, he abandoned the idea that romantic love was something that should be expressed in possessive monogamous relationships. He would later describe the kind of possessive monogamy found in romantic relationships as ""evil."" Brown became disillusioned as he noticed the jealousy, envy, and strife that seemed to eventually govern all such relationships. Though he began distancing himself from the concept of romantic relationships as a means to spare himself pain, he eventually came to see this abstinence as a moral position. Yet as we've seen in the Roman church too often in recent years, having an ethical stance doesn't diminish the presence of the appetites.Brown, as realized in Paying for It, recognizes his abiding desire for sexual contact and begins entertaining the idea of paying for it. This memoir follows the development of Brown's thoughts toward prostitution, from simply entertaining the idea to coming to terms with his plan to act on his desire to an easy comfortability with his frequent visits to different sex workers in the Toronto area. Brown is rather forthright throughout and the reader gets a look into a thoughtlife that may veer in radically different directions from one's own. Of course, as with Louis Riel's, Chester Brown's life receives a healthy amount of spit and polish and conversations are streamlined to most effectively convey the rhetoric. Still, Brown portrays himself in rather self-effacing and non-flattering visual terms—and the Brown he presents on the page is not anything of the obviously heroic sort.Brown may be his own story's hero, but you almost wouldn't know it.For a book that catalogues every one of Brown's sexual exploits between 1996 and 2003—and there are more than a handful—the work is decidedly un-sexy. Paying for It's artwork is simple and rather small and Brown typically fits eight uniform panels on each small page (Paying for It is roughly the size of a small prose novel). The work is very clinical throughout, and while the reader is presented with Brown's nude form often, the face of any given partner is always obscured. Instances of Brown's sexual experiences are typically dominated by his thoughts regarding events as they are playing out. Sometimes the reader sits in on Brown ruminating on his own insecurities or the etiquette a particular situation might demand. Other times Brown evaluates the attractiveness of the girl-object underneath him. Post-coital conversations abound, with Brown and the prostitute discussing the nature of prostitution or Brown's line of work or even the nature of love. After the fact, Brown often ruminates on what kind of  he'll later give the girl on Terb (kind of a Yelp! for sex workers, from what I gather).[image]But as fascinating as Brown's chronicle of these encounters is, I found his intervening conversations with friends much more engaging. Between episodes with prostitutes, Brown spends time trying to justify his opinions and new lifestyle to fellow cartoonists (usually Joe Matt and the mononymous Seth) and ex-girlfriends (with whom he is still close friends). It's in these discussions that Brown's philosophy emerges as each of his friends is in some way hostile to the concept of paying for sex. Each conversation focuses on different (though generally related) aspects of the moral neutrality of the sex-worker/john relationship and through these, Brown presents a pretty well-founded defense for about half his position.After reading Paying for It, I'm pretty well convinced that in any Western society today, prostitution should be decriminalized. This doesn't say any necessary thing about society's moral response to prostitution—just that like divorce or homosexuality or smoking or having bad opinions, it's not one of the things we legally punish a person over. The other half of Brown's argument, that romantic love is bad, is less well-founded and most readers won't find it too convincing (despite his occasionally astute observations regarding the monogamous relationship and romantic love). [image]As with Louis Riel, Brown presents copious endnotes that serve to enrich the text. Brown uses these often to spell out his beliefs further, which despite being pretty much raw text is still fascinating and worthwhile. One of the many appendices (#23, I believe) is devoted to Seth's response to his portrayal in the book. He uses this space to clarify some of the represented conversations and take a couple cute jabs at Brown—e.g. ""Robots don't have midlife crises.""[image]All told, Paying for It is a worthy package examining a lurid subject matter in a way that might even be appropriate in more liberal high schools. The book is certainly sexually frank, but so are biology and psychology texts. Many will find themselves morally at odds both with Chester Brown's arguments and with his life choices. Nonetheless, Brown approaches an old topic with fresh eyes (at least eyes that are fresh to many of us) and does so in expert fashion.____________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,not set,"Sep 19, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10108380-paying-for-it

I'm perfectly happy to not investigate superhero books, westerns, or efforts that seek to out-Tolkien Tolkien. Vampires, werewolves, zombies, pirates, ninjas? None of these really do it for me. And even though I was once a savage, avid reader of noirish detective-fiction, I've passed on countless opportunities to engage some of the newer works in the genre. [image][It Might.]So when I saw that the The Sixth Gun was a supernatural western adventure with zombies, my pulse remained resolutely subterranean. (After all, I had read and barely enjoyed the Wild West volume of Mignola's Witchfinder not three weeks earlier and didn't feel I was in the market for anything near the same neighbourhood.) Though I had picked up the first volume of The Sixth Gun on word-of-mouth alone, upon discovering the provenance of its primary story elements, I quietly slipped it to the bottom of my reading queue 'til I could finish ""important"" books like Duncan the Wonder Dog and Mother, Come Home and the next volume of Saturn Apartments (okay, not so important). I'd like to say that Bunn and Hurtt devastated my prejudices and wholly won me over to their rather unique brand of device, but I can't. Not really. I mean, sure, by the time I had finished The Sixth Gun I was happy I had read it and interested enough that I'll probably check out the next arc in their story of devil-forged weaponry and those cursed to wield corpse-makers. But, honestly, it wasn't until the last chapters of the book that I felt myself easing into their story. And I certainly haven't picked up any interest in pursing other works that mix cowboys and zombies.[image]So what didn't work for me? Actually—there wasn't anything I disliked. It's a fun yarn and pretty inventive. If it had one flaw—and here we use the term flaw loosely enough so that it doesn't mean flaw but really just means ""runs counter to my ideal preferences""—it's that The Sixth Gun focuses more on proving its action than it does in creating solid character moments. While the protagonist eventually have their portraits fleshed out somewhere in the neighbourhood of satisfying, it comes in trickles and most of the other characters remain at arm's length in terms of character building. But I mean: this is probably how this kind of book should be. And it's not really fair for me to wish that Bunn and Hurtt gave me something more like Before Sunrise with the occasional influx of undead, senseless murders, and a saber-wielding Confederate devilman, when really, their book almost demands the whimsy of an action-packed 28 Days Later mixed with Roman Holiday (in terms of tone, if not plot direction).[image]So then, what did I find laudable? I felt bad for Bunn since I'm sure most s are going to point to Hurtt's art before getting to Bunn's writing, but that's a tradition to which I'm going to contribute. Hurtt does a fantastic job selling these characters. Especially the women. In many cases, his men come off a bit flat—they're just rugged frontier brutes. But Hurtt invests a liveliness and personality into both Becky Moncrief and the Widow Hume that carries the rest of the book. There's nothing wrong with Bearded Drifter One or Clean-Shaven Rough Rider Two, but the two women sing themselves right off the page. The joy and excitement Hurtt invests into the Widow Hume's expressions are priceless (and her mania, contagious). When she sees Olivander Hume at work, his glory returning, she is exultant and the reader can feel the strength of her affections and ambitions. And Becky Moncrief is well-portrayed as the distressed damsel who is herself prepared to cause no small distress on her own. Bunn's script requires growth in her character and Hurtt is happy to provide.Bunn, for his part, stays out of the way enough for Hurtt and the story to run through their paces unimpeded. I suppose that's not entirely fair, since an author getting out of the way is actually a pretty admirable quality in an author. So I guess it is fair—it just didn't sound it. Bunn does a good job with the old-timey dialogue and its pretty accurate according to what a childhood spent watching Westerns and Civil War movies has taught me. From the book's cover, I almost expected a rollicking insane comedy (kind of an Atomic Robo, only with cowboys and zombies), but Bunn plays this as straight-up dramatic adventure—albeit with some pretty weird elements that lean toward humourous by their innate absurdity.[image]The Sixth Gun is a well-made book that I enjoyed in spite of myself. And it's got enough story chops that I'm interested enough to pick up the second volume to see if it can sunder my expectations as well as the first one did.____________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Sep 19, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9359546-the-sixth-gun-vol-1

He suffers under a cloud of depression that curdles even relationships he values. He hopes just like I do but as life rejects those dreams (since this is what life does), he is turned toward home countries where I find no citizenship. Small things set off a miasma of the psyche and drag his mood into the dimlands, into a world cloaked in malaise. John P is not the kind of person I really understand, but for that Perfect Example offers me purview into an experience of this world that is foreign to my own.[image]Many of the details of John P's life intersect with my own. The years are a touch off (I was a sixth/seventh grader in '86 while John was in the throes of high school), but in a lot of ways that's rather incidental to the social dynamic presented. John P is a bit of skater and I would skate from place to place in the days before I was a licensed driver. John P listens to music outside the mainstream of the high school mise-en-scène and I did the same. John P's hair doesn't match his mother's ideal for a teenage boy; and lest we forget, same here. I was stimulant free just like John P was. And girls were a tough nut to crack for both of us (though John P seems more successful than I was). And yet in one striking way, John P and I are very different and that is why I found this roughly autobiographical book as powerful as I did.[image][Pro-tip for the inexperienced guys: if you ever go over to a girl's house and she asks if you want something to eat, this means within minutes you'll be on the couch eating sloppy make-outs. This happens 100% of the time.]Pefect Example explores the day-in and -out of a young man with no apparent malfunction save for the inability to feel happiness. It seems like such a small thing, happiness. But its absence haunts him, chasing down and tarnishing even his more pleasant moments. In one moment he'll be having sloppy makeouts with a girl that he really does like (even if there's another girl he probably likes more) and seconds later some minor, abrupt alteration to the scene will shift his mood toward darkness and all pleasure in the experience evaporates. He wonders, fetally, at his inability to be happy.Despite the humour with which Porcellino infuses John P's story (and there is quite a bit of it), there are plenty of moments that are hard to take, times when your heart breaks for this hurting child, this young man with so much promise and so little confidence in the world's ability to not destroy him. When he jumps the gun to ask out a girl who is not ready for him, I shuddered. When he wanders off from his friends to find a savage sort of solace, I worried. When he breaks down in suicidal rage and ineffectual terror, I wished for Porcellino to give him some respite. A friend who could correct his listing, point his rudder in some helpful direction, and give wind to his sails.[image][This scene ends about as well as you expect it to.]I was invested. Porcellino had me involved enough in John P's journey and struggle that I devoured the small bio of Porcellino in the book's backmatter and went straight onto Wikipedia to find what information I could regarding the intervening years since Perfect Example was drawn in March 1996. And that says something there. I might not have been wowed by the book's art, but it does work to enhance the story a bit. It's simple and unaffected and tells the story Porcellino intends to tell—and probably does so in better fashion than many more detail-oriented styles would allow. Perfect Example is not the best book I've read, but it is worthwhile and I'm glad I took the time to read it and I'm glad for what it's given me: a portrait of a man I could never be and of a guy I'd love to know.____________[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Sep 19, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/584014.Perfect_Example

That should be enough to sell eight million copies of this book.]Adam Hines is careful to avoid framing the discussion of animal and human interaction in terms of ""rights."" His concern is both semantic and philosophical. Rights, as he sees them, are human inventions, distributed capriciously as the human society sees fit. He sees no rigourous foundation upon which such a thing as rights can be grounded, so instead he hopes to recast the discussion to focus on animal welfare—which, to his mind, sits in a far more objective sphere than rights do. It's a careful distinction to make and Hines proves himself a careful author.In fact, Hines takes such care with his story that the curiously named Duncan the Wonder Dog can be roundly considered a triumph of the medium. I've had the pleasure of reading a number of great books this last year, from Daytripper to Moving Pictures to Mother, Come Home to Elmer, and Duncan is quite possibly the best I've yet encountered. (It's a toss-up between that and the phenomenal Daytripper.) I was hesitant to pick up Duncan the Wonder Dog for two reasons. The first is the title. One could be forgiven for finding it off-putting, trite, and childish. I really didn't have any desire to investigate a book that was a cartoonish serial adventure of some canine in a cape who solves mysteries and flies and maybe makes boo-boo-kitty eyes at a spaniel over a plate of back-alley pasta. The second obstacle was that I had already read Elmer and as that book explores a world in which chickens become sentient and uses the concept to tiptoe through some social issues, I felt I had met my talking-animals-versus-social-dilemmas quota.Fortunately, neither of these monuments to my reluctance ended up keeping me from the book indefinitely. [image]Duncan is a large book, in a cornucopia of senses. Certainly its four hundred pages are impressive on their own, but Hines produces a product that expands along the other two common physical dimensions as well. The book—the first volume of a projected eight—carries the height and width of a standard sheet of American notebook paper: 8 ½"" x 11"". Being so large, the tome is naturally heavy as well, weighing nearly three pounds. And all of that merely touches on the book's physical imposition—where Duncan's true largeness is measured is in its content.Hines crafts an expansive story with immense value against a tremendous ethical background on broad canvas. This is the story not of the human race but of creaturely existence. And co-existence. And through Hines' masterful technique Duncan—for all its fantastic setting—essays a profoundly moving, astonishing set of stories, each contributing to the question of co-existence in fresh, exciting ways.[image][There are a number of horrificly tragic scenes in this book, but this one really hit me for its tit-for-tat retributive nature.]Duncan's structure is a slow-burn. At first it's not even clear that in this world animals can talk. And not just talk in that Watership Down sort of way, where animals have voices and can communicate amongst themselves but never to man. In Duncan the animals speak as plainly as you or I do. If you ask a whining dog what's the matter, she can simply tell you. Once it becomes clear that this is the kind of world that Hines is populating with his characters, a reader still has a hundred or so pages before the books' protagonists are firmly establish.Hines uses a lot of collage throughout his book to give it a distinct aesthetic, but the form of collage extends even to his storytelling style. Despite the fact that the book does follow (probably) four main characters through its story, Hines takes frequent, numerous narrative breaks to focus on minor characters or even non-characters for a page or fifteen. Sometimes these excursions paint in an emotional palette while other examples feature a discussion of philosophy. I found myself conflicted, not wanting to be torn from whatever sidebar Hines had just introduced and the excitement of watching the main branch continue to unfurl. Hines balances between his subjects with a virtuosity one has to experience firsthand.  [image][Hines here does a wonderful job conveying a man's life flashing before his eyes. Click to enlarge.]Duncan is a dense work. There are a lot of words on a lot of pages, but even more than that, Hines' pages of art demand scrutiny. His art serves his story and his story serves his art. It's possible that this volume represents the most ambitious use of the comics form yet. There may be other contenders, but I don't think I've seen them. This is a book that deserves second and third readings. Which makes it nice that the first reading was such an absolute pleasure.Note:I neglected to give any kind of summary of the book's plot or story conceit or anything that might hint at what Duncan the Wonder Dog is actually about. I'm not sure that it's even important for you to know. The book is that good. Good enough that you should go pick it up and sound out its reaches knowing nothing beyond the seal of its quality. Still, some may require a, quote-unquote, low-down.The world presented in Duncan is one that mirrors ours almost exactly—save for the fact that animals can express themselves in the language of humans. This doesn't change much about the world order. Cattle and pigs are still herded into pens and raised for the slaughter. Dogs and cats still live as pets. And foxes still prey on rabbits. The difference is that now the cows spread rumours about why none of them ever return after leaving for the slaughterhouse while the humans who are slaughtering them lie to them, explaining that the very idea of such murder houses is just silly. Animals (with a few humans) have formed activist groups, some of which have become full-blown terrorist cells. ORAPOST is one such group and it is helmed (for the moment at least) by a golden macaque named Pompeii whose attitude and methodology are as explosive as her name. It's a world with frayed edges, coming undone even as it seeks to forge itself into something worthwhile.Hines offers the series online for free. The impressively sized bound volume is for sale, but Hines suggests that ""if you are considering purchasing this book, please instead give that money"" to one of a number of animal-friendly organizations. Only after you've done that does he present the idea that his book is actually for sale.[image][Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,not set,not set,"Aug 30, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8499509-duncan-the-wonder-dog

When a person tries to act beyond the envelope of their abilities, I become put off. At least, I do when I notice. When an artist tries to create something amazing and succeeds without hiccough, I am wholly unperturbed—this due the nature of success. A clean success betrays no hint that the accomplishment was any kind of a stretch, no evidence that the achievement was anything other than perfectly in line with the creator's gifts.It's when someone reaches beyond their comfort zone to bring into the world something that they might not have the skill to bring about and that struggle is evident in the final product—that's when I begin to feel uncomfortable. As someone who frequently does not try hard enough and often creates plausible works far below his ken (likely in order to save myself from over-reaching), trying too hard embarrasses me. Reading Christopher Paolini's Eragon was tortuous for this reason; the poor kid was obviously trying to write at a level quite beyond his grasp. He had the vocabulary but not the knack for putting it together.And the first time I read Fun Home, I felt like Alison Bechdel was over-reaching, that she was just plain trying too hard. The literary allusions, while inventive, seemed forced. Her inclusion of such a wide variety of authors and themes seemed too pat, too cute. I felt she was trying to impress with the gravitas of prior works, fearful that her family's story wasn't strong enough to stand on its own.I have, happily, revised that opinion substantially. Three cheers for second readings, eh?There are still moments when I feel Bechdel is grasping for allusions beyond her ability to furnish,* but those instances are many fewer than I had originally felt. (Either that or my nostalgia for the book has since coloured my readings with good will and charity.) And on the whole, Bechdel's incessant reference to the works of others doesn't distract as much from her family's story so much as I originally felt. Or, actually, it does but in repayment adds a more robust sense of who these people are. Their lives—at least the lives of Alison and her parents—are so thoroughly dominated by the writing and words of others that to tell their story without these grand allusions might have been to tell a hollow version of things. My second reading allowed me to appreciate more fully the depth to which Bechdel's father was influenced by the Moderns and how substantially Alison was shaped by the writings of her own era and how those in turn influenced her readings of the others.When first approaching the book, I was under the impression that this was Alison's story—and to be fair, one can read for some distance before Fun Home's true object is made clear. Subtitled ""A Family Tragicomic,"" Fun Home is the story of Bruce Bechdel, Alison Bechdel's father. Some might also mistake it as an exploration of the homosexual problem, but both Alison's story and the unveiling of her own homosexual inclination merely serve to round out the portrait of Bruce the author has chosen to sculpt.[image]Even the recountment of Alison's own struggles and coming out revelations are couched safely under the shadow of Bruce's own toil and history and context. For the sake of the narrative, Alison's discovery of lesbianism means nothing apart from the tether of her father's experiences with young men. Alison complains at the revelation of her father's dalliances, even as she has just revealed her own lesbianism: ""Unmoored as I still was by my own queerness, this broadside swamped my small craft.""Flaunting sundered expectations, Bechdel thoroughly engrosses the reader in the mystery of her father. Bruce Bechdel was a man whose life and death were foundered by his queerness upon the precipice between an era that would have none of it and the new dawn when homosexuality would begin to approach wider reception as a valid choice of life expression. Alison's father is explored through his writings, through his reading, through his history, and perhaps most deliciously, through his family.[image]Fun Home is a hard book. Grave tragedy hangs over the entire reading as a spectre. Bruce's death, possibly a suicide, is never far from narrative view. Bechdel returns to it over and again, approaching not just as the mortician (relevant to the funeral home atmosphere) but as coroner and detective as well. What, in the end, killed Bruce? Cosmic accident? The troubles of an era? Harmful needs that could not be quenched? A marriage that he continued to break and conversely seemed to break him? In the end, was it a snake or a phallus that did him in? And does it matter which? Fun Home is a hard book, but—filled with love and hate and glory and discontent and tragedy and hope—it's also a powerful one.[image]Note:* It may be that the problems with the opening mythic allusion of the Icarus/Daedalus relationship coloured the remainder of my reading of Bechdel's graphic memoir. In the opening two pages, she writes: ""In the circus, acrobatics where one person lies on the floor balancing another are called 'Icarian Games.' Considering the fate of Icarus after he flouted his father's advice and flew so close to the sun his wings melted, perhaps some dark humor is intended. In our particular reenactment of this mythic relationship, it was not me but my father who was to plummet from the sky."" A fine use of outside literature, right? comparing her father's fall to that of Icarus? The problem here is twofold. 1) Alison and her father are shown practicing the described acrobatics and it is Alison who is hoisted aloft and Alison who falls. So, in the pictured ""reenactment of this mythic relationship,"" it really is the daughter and not the father who falls. 2) When Alison's father falls, it is not because he ignored Alison's advice. The second is a minor point and perhaps petty and stretching Bechdel's metaphor, but the first requires a more careful wording in order to be workable.[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Aug 30, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38990.Fun_Home

I don't know if we were treated to the all-words version as well. It's the film that I remember and it's the film that completely turned me off of both Jack London's body of work and the survival genre in general. [image]It's not so much that there was anything wrong with Cobham's motion picture adaptation but that I was unable to process that horrible situation as anything other than something truly horrifying. There was no room for interpreting the narrative in terms of man vs. nature. It was more just, ""Holy hell, I will never go anywhere if there is snow involved!"" And that was enough to put a sour taste in my mouth for London's work from that point forward. When our class in junior high was reading Call of the Wild, I skipped it. When the White Fang movie came out in high school, I skipped it. When I had the opportunity to see Sea Wolf on the big screen in repertory, I skipped it. Even though I was on a Gregory Peck kick at the time.So it's a good thing I didn't know how indebted to London this collection of Taniguchi's shorts would be, because otherwise I might have missed out on a truly wonderful set of stories.[image]The Ice Wanderer is one of those rare anthologies that include not a single weakness. Certainly some stories are better conceived than others but it's more a question of whether a story will be Good or Great rather than the more common Good, Okay, or Bad. The book is themed around the idea of man vs. nature (and sometimes man with nature), with only a single inclusion straying from that tonal direction. I had fortunately already gotten past my No Survival Fiction hurdle months earlier almost through trickery. I had been reading Taniguchi's Inu o Kau, a story of a couple taking care of their dog in its old age, and the final chapter attached (""Promised Land"") was completely unrelated— the story of a man's attempt to scale Annapurna massif in Nepal. I was already pages into it when I realized what I was reading, so I continued and it was very good and very much worth my time. Despite my hesitations.The same can be said for pretty much every story included in The Ice Wanderer. Worth your time and very good. Taniguchi has a unique ability to convey nature (and its nature) through his art. I first encountered him in The Walking Man and was impressed with the virtuosity with which he approaches his landscapes. His pen is very fine-lined and he baptizes his landscapes in a kind of detail that makes Arthur Adams look minimalistic. That attentive detail is very much present in The Ice Wanderer and after I devoured his stories, I enjoyed sitting back and simply admiring the art he pours into each page.In The Ice Wanderer's first story, Taniguchi tells a perhaps bio-apocryphal story of Jack London's days in the Klondike during the gold-hunting years. It's a sober reminder of the power of nature and its wrath upon those who fail to respect it. It's well done and intrigued me enough that I actually looked up London's biographical sketch on Wikipedia. Did you know that when London was 13, ""he borrowed money from his black foster mother Virginia Prentiss, bought the sloop Razzle-Dazzle from an oyster pirate named French Frank, and became an oyster pirate"" and that ""in his memoir, he claims to have stolen French Frank's mistress Mamie."" A thirteen-year-old oyster pirate and Lothario. The mind reels.The next story, one of my favourites of the collection, is apparently an adaptation of the first part of London's White Fang. I may have known this had I seen the movie when I was in high school. The story of two men hauling a third one, a corpse, through the frigid wilderness to civilization while being stalked by merciless wolves is tense and built on excitement. As members of the dog team slowly succumb to nightly raids, it becomes questionable whether any of these men—live or dead—will meet their destination. I found the story thrilling and ultimately satisfying. Still not enough to convince me to pick up White Fang, but I'm glad to see there's gold to be mined from London's works.[image]The next two stories are the two best of the show. The first pits an old man against the renegade bear that killed his son years earlier. (I know, right!) It's a hard story, watching a man possibly throw away everything that matters in a bid for revenge. Apart from the question of the man's own survival, Taniguchi asks whether the price for such action is too high in the end. The next tale pits a young boy against his own weak and cowardly nature and an older girl against her own perhaps too-strong nature—all while both strive against nature as a storm sweeps their small boat to sea. Each of these stories concern the dangers always present in the natural world, but are still more cognizant of the struggles that take place even within our own hearts.The fifth story, concerning a struggling mangaka, is good but out of place. Its inclusion seems as abrupt as the inclusion of the mountain-climbing story did in Inu o Kau. The sixth story, about a man seeking a humpback's sacred burial ground, is tender in its way and seems almost prototype for Daisuke Igarashi's wonderful Children of the Sea. [image]The Ice Wanderer is a fascinating book for how its particulars explore on the surface the struggle between man and nature—but use this setting to sound out more interesting ideas. Taniguchi, as he's shown in both The Walking Man and Inu o Kau, sees the human relationship with the natural realm less as confrontation and more as symbiosis. Certainly he sees nature's present boundaries, which will threaten to destroy the man or woman foolish enough to transgress those lines, but at the same time Taniguchi presents a beautiful, awe-striking world in which humanity does harbour some chance at living not at odds with but alongside the natural realm.[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Aug 30, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3429088-the-ice-wanderer-and-other-stories

No article of clothing moved in any particular direction due the influence of Sfar and Guibert's slim book. In fact, I may not have ever laughed once.[image]Which is not to say The Professor's Daughter wasn't either enjoyable or entertaining—it was both. This ranging tale of a mummy and his slight romance with the titular daughter of the titular professor isn't probably meant to be a generator of guffaws. Or even chortles, snickers, giggles, or smirks. It's more just an amusing kind of absurdity. One may be permitted to smile occasionally while reading, but shouldn't probably expect anything more exaggerated than an inner feeling of goodwill and something on the less expensive side of cheer.When I describe The Professor's Daughter as absurd, I don't mean that in any deeply fractured fashion. Imhotep IV, the mummy, doesn't answer the phone only to turn into a banana and ride off on the shoulders of an infant Hitler while your face melts and reforges twelvety-four piñata sauce Michael.

What a friend of mine would mistakenly call ""random.""[image]That right there is Queen VictoriaFortunately, it all works pretty well and even despite all the death and mayhem, the average reader will probably come away in high spirits.

Especially when the rest of the book is engaging and enjoyable. And moreso when the author hopes to secure readers.[image](Those who don't write to be read are more than welcome to make not just their introduction but their entire book a roadblock to diligent readers.)Personally, I'm working on a novel and the first chapter is a bit... high concept. And therefore, a bit obnoxious to the casual reader. It's important that it be this way, of course, but I do worry that those who might otherwise love the book will be turned off by its introduction. It was keeping that in mind that helped me through the introductory pages of Hornschemeier's Mother, Come Home.Mother, Come Home's opening set is a bit oblique and I feared I had picked up another bout of art comix childishness, that kind of book where you feel like you're spending time with a stereotypical high school theatre student (something infantile like Monologues for the Coming Plague, perhaps*). Hornschemeier continues on like this for six pages and by the fifth I had almost gotten into the flow of what he was doing. I was even able to sort of appreciate it. But I absolutely did not want to read 128 pages in the same vein, so turning that seventh page was like a boon from heaven. As if God in his wisdom had known exactly how much I could take and inspired Hornschemeier to rein it in at exactly the right moment.Of course later, according to the ordo apocalypsis, I came to deeply appreciate what Hornschemeier does in his opening. This is because Mother, Come Home is a Very Good Book.[image]Fig. 2: ""My mother loved to give presents.""It won't be revealing too much to say that Mother, Come Home deals with some heavy topics (as seen in figure 2, above). Told largely through the eyes of a child, the reader gets a rare sense of a very difficult set of extraordinary circumstances. Hornschemeier gradually unveils his narrative topography, controlling revelation in a way that should satisfy most readers, leaving them both affected by the story told and conscious that literature was absorbed.One of Mother, Come home's great charms is Hornschemeier's artwork throughout. His work is clean, uncluttered. I have seen more than one  compare him to Chris Ware, and while I cannot know how indebted the present author is to one of the obvious luminaries of the medium, common ground is aptly noted. Even beyond the book's muted palette, which recalls Ware's work in the nineteenth-century portion of Jimmy Corrigan, his panel focuses and strong linework evoke Ware's own. And of course the submerged tone, hollow of emotion by its very flood of emotion, is also evocative of Jimmy Corrigan (which some may characterize as a stoic sort of work).[image]Mother, Come Home is a work deserving reflection. Hornschemeier has filled his pages with mysteries of life, some demanding interpretation, others commandeering their own liberty from such shackles. In many ways I feel inadequate to speak for it, having only read the book once so far. I am going to rectify this lapse.*note: if you are Anders Nilsen, we can just shake hands and believe that I didn't understand.

It really is a handsome edition, a durable hardcover wrapped in pleasing design and containing in its backmatter an interview with the mangaka as well as an article describing the importance of the work. For those built to appreciate Katsumata's achievement here, this edition of Red Snow is almost certainly a treasure. I'm only sorry I couldn't be counted among those who would so value the production.Red Snow, for me, has exactly one use. It proposes an unveiling of a mid-twentieth century rural Japan that stands as an illumination of a society that may be forever lost to the march of time. The details of rural, traditional Japanese culture are fascinating and Katsumata does a good job adding in trivialities that add a sense of realism to often magical stories. In ""Red Snow,"" the story that gives the collection its title, Katsumata spends some pages showing the labour involved in preparing sake yeast. In another, he leans on the use and social texture of mulberries. Several tales involve the activity of traveling Buddhist monks. In manner similar to Stan Sakai (though more pervy), Katsumata involves some of the more mythical aspects of traditional Japanese folklore, such as kappas and tree spirits.Most forcefully what Red Snow accomplishes, however, is to present a picture of a people. I have no measure by which to gauge the honesty of the portrait Katsumata paints through his stories, but if they are to be believed, non-urban Japan was built on the lives of a very earthy people. These are men and women whose entire lives are built on hard work and sex. If memory serves, every single story featured infidelity, rape, whores, or some manner of lusty embrace. If Katsumata's world is to be believed, then mid-century Japan was a pretty horny place in which women are routinely beaten and the patriarchy is well established and indelibly ingrained.[image]Yep. This guy is more upset by the fact that the curly-haired woman was a little drunk than by the fact that she is plainly being raped. Charming.Not that the women don't sometimes give as good as they get. In ""A Pulp Novel about a Sack,"" the women of a village tie up a traveler in a sack and pass him from house to house while their men are away tending to the business of their agrarian society. It's never certain just how willing a participant the man in the sack is: has he simply accepted his lot, enjoying his time in the sack or is he being somehow raped in weakened state?[image]The problem with Red Snow is that as fascinating as this vantage into Japanese culture may be, the stories themselves play out awkwardly as the narrative sometimes lurches from panel to panel. Often, and this may be due to my ignorance of the culture being portrayed, it's difficult to tell exactly what is happening between panels and sometimes even in a particular panel. Katsumata's transitions, while sometimes beautiful, are more commonly too abrupt, giving the reader too few clues as to what he has in mind. And while some of his brushwork is handsome, most of his characters are drawn in a way that makes it difficult to understand exactly what they are meant to be expressing.In the end, while there were things I appreciated in Red Snow, there were more things that I didn't. It's not a work to which I will likely return. I felt there was value in reading it but there was no enjoyment in the experience. Red Snow felt more like a chore than it did one more step into enjoyable comics literature.[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad.]...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,not set,"Aug 08, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6455657-red-snow

The most common are stories that use imaginary technologies, alien races, and futuristic promise as a gimmick, a means to wowing audiences with slick bombast in order to distract from narrative deficiencies. The original Star Wars, for all its good points, makes prominent use of this technique. Viewers are confronted with impressive fabrications—TIE fighters, droids, a landspeeder, the Millennium Falcon, the Mos Eisley cantina, and the Death Star—all to the end of camouflaging bad dialogue and weak acting. Certainly we give ourselves over to the film's charms, but Star Wars uses its setting to disguise its weaknesses.Less common are examples that use science fiction as a means to approach social issues from a perspective divorced from a reality that may be overladen with presuppositions and biases. These stories extrapolate worlds that may someday exist in order to speak to present concerns. Gattaca, A Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, and 1984 each use their setting for the purpose of something more than simply providing an engaging entertainment.[image]Hisae Iwaoka's Saturn Apartments is somewhat enigmatic then in that it seems to fit neither of these categories. While the book does include a number of set pieces that provide fantastic viewscapes (notably, some gorgeous illustrations of the earth from outside the book's principal space structure), these have no narrative inadequacies to cover up. And while the book does present a world in which the strict class systems common to some dystopian fiction exert negative influence on its cast, making social statements seems to be the least of Iwaoka's concerns. (That may change as the story evolves, but as of the first two volumes, he doesn't seem overly interested in addressing social inequity.) Instead, the futurism and social state of Saturn Apartments seems in place wholly to the end of presenting a fully forged world in which Iwaoka's small story can take place.When I say small story that is only to say that this is not a book devoted to national or interspecies struggles. This is not a series about the end of the world (in a way, that already happened). This is not the story of good vs. evil, the rescue of a princess, or a race to recover a lost treasure before it's lost for all time. It's just the story of a boy who's just joined the workforce and is trying to come to grips with who he is in the shadow of his father's death five years early. And in that way, Saturn Apartments may actually be a bigger story than Star Wars or Lord of the Rings. After all, every person is an expansive universe of interests, motives, stories, treacheries, and dreams. And each of these universes is governed by an entirely unique set of forces, every bit as sovereign as gravity and entropy.[image]In Saturn Apartments, the earth, for reasons as yet untreated had been abandoned for decades, existing now as a global nature preserve. Whether due war or pollution or a humanitarian attempt at a Babel-like house to scrape the heavens is, seemingly, apart from the interests of the series. All that matters is that the earth has been abandoned and all the remnant humanity dwells on a great ring encircling the earth in low orbit, pretty much smack in the middle of the stratosphere. While never explicitly referred to within the text as the Saturn Apartments, the ring does make the earth resemble Saturn a bit. Or at least maybe Uranus. The ring itself is divided into three strata, upper, middle, and lower sections. The middle section is devoted to public works such as schools, parks, government, and scientific endeavors. Elites live in the upper reaches of the ring while everyone else is shuffled into the lower division.Saturn Apartments primary narrative conceit (I mean, beyond the ring itself) is that somebody's got to was all those windows. Dwellings that sit on the epidermis of the ring have windows that look out into the reaches of space (everyone else has to content themselves with artificial light and skies) and, even in space, a film of dust gradually accumulates. Those with the money to do so, hire window washers to help them keep their perspicuity. As washers require space suits, months of training, and hours to pressurize in order to clean windows, it's rare that anyone from the lower levels have the opportunity to clean their windows; ironically, its these grime-caked windows of the lower levels that face the earth and the spectacular view that such portals could provide.Iwaoka's protagonist is Mitsu, the orphaned son of Aki, a washer who fell to earth in a window-washing accident five years ago. Mitsu has just graduated high school and is accepted into his father's guild, where he encounters all of Aki's old friends and co-workers. Mitsu is both diligent and distracted, the presence of a hard-working father he barely knew weighing heavily on his life and direction. He's a little bit lost, a little bit unformed, and pretty uncertain about his purpose in things. He's eager to find and prove his place within the guild but until he discovers himself for who he is, he'll never be able to confidently chart his own personal destiny. Saturn Apartments charts Mitsu's course through the interpersonal exchanges he experiences with co-workers and clients and then through the friendships he forms as a result. Mitsu's path evolves from one marked by loneliness toward something a bit more rounded with a breadth of human contact. Much of the fun of the series is watching him negotiate these new relationships while he takes cues from those around him in an attempt to understand how normal people interact. He's a great observer and does his best to conscientiously apply the practical knowledge his observations lend him. By having Mitsu looking in on a variety of lives from the outside literally looking in, Iwaoka leaves herself plenty of room to explore numerous story and relationship paths before wearing out her and Mitsu's welcome.[image]One of the charms of Saturn Apartments is its unique visual sense. Iwaoka employs a style of illustration uncommon in, at the least, the manga I've yet encountered. Her character compositions sit far from what we may have come to expect from our Japanese comics, neither favouring the bold dynamism common in shōnen nor the ephemeral willowiness of shōjo. Iwaoka instead essays what I imagine would have to be some sort of indie manga. Her line is confident in its hesitance, a practiced stutter. In many cases, independent creators have more imagination than they have talent; this is decidedly not the case with Iwaoka's work. She creates big-headed people and her men are often distinguishable from her women by fashion alone—all, I suspect, by design. She also frequently employs visual gags to lighten the mood of what could otherwise be a book too sober by half.Saturn Apartments is an exciting book to take part in as its release gradually unfolds. Generally, I prefer to take in a series once its publication is complete (therefore eliminating the story-hindering two-to-ten-month wait between volumes), but Saturn Apartments is such a quiet pleasure for me that I'm happy to take it in whatever chunks are available to me.[Review provided courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,not set,not set,"Aug 01, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6759151-saturn-apartments-vol-1

For every well-received Frasier or Rhoda, there are many more that fail to capture that spark of interest that dazzled the audiences of their progenitors. The Tortellis, Just the Ten of Us, Joey. Every spin-off is something of a funambulist and over a variety of perils there are these fine lines they must traverse. Beyond the normal gamut of ways in which a new series might fail, spin-offs have additional baggage threatening. Too derivative. Not derivative enough. Under-developed characters. Too deep in the shadow of the original. Still, in some cases, a spin-off is the only way in which to preserve well-loved supporting characters when their series turns in a new direction. Such was the case for the cast of BPRD. While long at home in the pages of Hellboy, Abe Sapien, Liz Sherman, Kate Corrigan, and the mononymous homunculus Roger (each members of the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense) were left lurched in the conclusion to ""Conqueror Worm."" Hellboy, discouraged by the duplicity with which the Bureau had treated Roger, leaves the organization to pursue a more personal venture. The series Hellboy at this point cuts ties with the BPRD and, more importantly, with Abe, Liz, and the others. Hellboy becomes a book with a cast of one.The only problem here is that Hellboy's BPRD cohorts are great characters and readers want to know what happens to them. Behold the birth of BPRD, the series.I was nervous. I loved these characters. Kate was as yet underdeveloped, but Abe had a rich history to be explored, Liz's inner struggle was left unresolved, and Roger was just fun. I wanted BPRD to be as awesome as Hellboy was. I wanted this spin-off to be the exception to the rule.And then I read the first arc, The Hollow Earth, a story delving into a neat piece of 19th century fantasy lit legend. It fell flat. The story (with three writers) struggled to find its feet. The elements were there, but the tone was off. Ryan Sook's art was accomplished but felt too much like an aping of Mignola's work on Hellboy. When I first saw panels from the book, I thought Sook would be a good fit, taking over where Mignola left off. It didn't work out.The group of stories caused my fears to grow. A series of one-shots, each featuring a different artist/writer combination, almost wholly failed to do anything worthwhile with the Bureau's peculiar agents. There was one exception. ""Dark Water,"" written by Brian Augustyn with art by Guy Davis, was the perfect mix of who the BPRD should be and what the series could be. I suspected that it was Davis' art that really sold home this vision of the book. Sadly, ""Dark Water"" came early in this series of short stories, so by the time the next arc began, I was ready to bid farewell to the Bureau and to characters for whom I no longer cared.[image]Fortunately, the fates would intervene. The day the first issue of the next arc, ""Plague of Frogs,"" came out, someone from my local comics provider accidentally placed the book in my pull box. I got home with the week's haul and found chapter one of BPRD: Plague of Frogs shuffled in with my other books. I picked it up, discouraged that I had paid for what was in all likelihood a dog, flipped through and discovered that Guy Davis had drawn the story. Comforted that at worst I would be able to indulge in some very good art while trying to ignore some mediocre story and inept handling of characters, I plowed through the book. It was good. Very good. I wasn't ready to pronounce BPRD now a book that I wanted, but I wasn't any longer convinced that I didn't. At the least, I would get the rest of this arc. Again, at worst: I still had Guy Davis to enjoy.[image]The thing about BPRD is that ""Plague of Frogs"" is just the start. That story is when things finally click. The series not only becomes this dynamic mix of quiet character moments and large, Hollywood set pieces, but it takes on a harness of building tensions. BPRD is absolutely driven by Big Ideas. It starts in ""Plague of Frogs"" and even if you have some idea that Things Are Afoot, you really can't conceive just how tremendous these will be in scale.""Plague of Frogs"" does three things right. More really, but I'll focus on just three. 1) The third volume of BPRD stories introduces a driving story-force for the series. Previously, both BPRD and Hellboy had simply been a series of loosely connected (if that) investigations into discreet episodes of the paranormal. There had never yet been the feeling that there was a larger story at play. (While Hellboy did have the whole Ogdru Jahad thing going on, it was never really anything more than this ominous background to the series.)""Plague of Frogs"" introduces a Threat, something that couldn't be wrapped up over the course of a single arc. Something dangerous. Something that not only would bite the Bureau in the ass over and again, but something that if not contained, would pose a real threat to the entire world. Within ""Plague"" it's not clear just how big a threat the frogs would become, but this is where it all starts—and while it starts small enough, things rather quickly escalate over the following books.[image]One of the really cool things about BPRD as a series is that it doesn't fear alternating drastically the status quo of the world it takes place in. Not only do the characters age at the same rate we do, but if the story demands it, entire cities or nations can be destroyed (sorry Nebraska!). At the beginning of the series, the threats the BPRD encounters are generally unknown to the average citizen, but by even halfway through the series, everyone with a television knows of the frog menace. This sets up some very interesting storytelling possibilities for future series. 2) ""Plague of Frogs"" begins to draw Abe Sapien out from merely being a simple sketch. Previously, he had never been depicted as much beyond being a man-fish with no history prior the Bureau discovering him in suspended animation. ""Plague"" starts exploring that Prior and Abe, in many ways, begins to become the driving force for the series.[image]Taking lessons from the exploration of Abe, Mignola (joined by John Arcudi from volume four onward) take pains to focus on characterization for all the primary agents of the Bureau. These are complex people with complex histories living in complex circumstances. It makes sense that their personal stories would require special attention even in the midst of great cataclysm. Frequently, the book retreats from action-packed battles or investigations to eavesdrop on conversations between agents far from the field, holed up in cafeterias or offices, prisoners to mundane tasks and their own wounded psyches. It makes for a great story and BPRD's is built on the strengths of such moments.3) Guy Davis. Just as I can't imagine a Hellboy apart from Mike Mignola's exquisite artwork, it now seems impossible that a worthwhile BPRD could exist without Guy Davis helming its illustration. His presence and world-building are felt in every volume. His talent is awe-striking and he essays these figures with an imagination that rivals or surpasses Mignola's own. So powerfully has he inscribed BPRD with his autograph that I would prefer to see Abe and Liz and Roger et al drawn by him rather than by Mignola himself.[image]Davis' strength lies all over the map. He draws compelling visions of terror: frog-monsters, Lovecraftian elder-beasts, demons, and proto-humans from time-before-history. He illustrates believably down-trodden humans: doughy, aging people who wear their histories in their faces. He offers up set-pieces that are inexplicably detailed: lush jungle environs, cluttered Victorian mansions, and smouldering cities in ruin. Guy Davis is easily one of the most talented artists working in comics today. His sense of visual storytelling is unfailing and the emotion he can carry in even a single panel is only matched, I think, by the work of Fabio Moon. There may be others who eclipse Davis' abilities, but I cannot think of who they might be.Recently, with ""The King of Fear,"" the first arc of BPRD has wrapped up. Counting ""Hollow Earth"" this first arc fills ten volumes, nearly 1500 pages. Mignola has termed this entire storyline Plague of Frogs and having just finished reading its final chapter earlier this week, I can say I'm entirely satisfied with how the team of Mignola, Arcudi, and Davis have wrapped up the plague. Of course there are plenty of loose ends, but seeing where we (and the Bureau) are left at the end of ""The King of Fear,"" I'm hotly anticipating seeing where these three creators will take us next.I was hesitant to pick up the conclusion to Plague of Frogs because I had read a number of negative reactions, some bordering on irate. I was silly to have been concerned. The act ends well, giving some sense of closure to several lines of story that have run throughout the series while still putting pieces in place for Act II. The feeling I get is that these several other ers desired something more like a Hollywood ending, a big on-screen conflagration with protagonists combating their foes in a knock-down, drag-out bout of superpowered fisticuffs. Certainly, in considered Liz-Sherman–style, there is something of a conflagration, but it and its effects occur almost entirely off-camera. In fact, the greatest moments of explosive climax occur unseen between the pen- and ultimate chapters of the volume. In a very real way, this is probably more fitting than to have the disaster take place in page after page of gut-wrenching action. The conclusion seems easy to the untrained eye, but really: this finale is less about the solution to these characters' overt problems (i.e. the frog menace) than it is about what these events do to the agents' constitutions. BPRD remains one of my favourite books and Davis' art throughout sings in a way unheralded. That Arcudi should be the primary writer on this series and still not be celebrated as one of the Great Writers of adventure comics is astounding. Even the covers that Mignola regularly prepares are works of art. BPRD is an entirely worthwhile series (though I might recommend skipping volume 2, The Soul of Venice, and the other volumes that do not contribute to the storyline as a whole).

Things that slide so neatly between our hope for the world and our experience of the world that our rational mind is sheared momentarily from the engine of our dreams, that part of us that fuels and crafts desires, longings, hopes, and wishes. We sometimes encounter things that divorce us from the corrupting coolness of reason and leave us in a state, however temporary, of unblemished joy. These things are treasures. These things give us a glimpse of What May Have Been and sometimes even What Could Someday Be. These things are rare and wonderful.And sometimes these things are books.Yotsuba&! is one of these sources of magic for me. And, I suspect, for a great number of others as well. Kiyohiko Azuma’s series is an unexpected pleasure. Even if one approaches the work with the knowledge that Yotsuba&! bubbles forth as a fountain of joyfulness, this little girl’s nature and adventures will still surprise in how purely they deliver one into this momentary Other Place.Plainly put, Yotsuba&! is one of my favorite reading experiences of all time and the only one to so wholly transport me into a world of smiles and laughter.[image]Azuma’s story concerns a strange young girl—a five-year-old with green hair and pigtails—and the way she interacts with the world about her. (Her name, Yotsuba, means four-leaf and refers conveniently enough to the way she wears her green hair in four distinct pigtails.) While there is always some exploration of the outside world, the book primarily revolves around Yotsuba’s interactions with her father, Koiwai, and her next-door neighbours and their three daughters.Plot descriptions, of course, cannot remotely approach conveying any sense of why these stories are such a joy. Really, they have to be experienced firsthand to fully apprehend their power to carve out so magical a world, but here: let me at least try.[image]Yotsuba’s sense of wonder in the way she approaches an environment with which she apparently has had no experience is astonishing in its guilelessness. Yotsuba brims with enthusiasm and the pleasure with which she takes on each new experience leaves us breathless as that enthusiasm spreads. Her father is consistently amused by her naïveté and her neighbours are never certain what exactly to make of her. And yet, she really does inspire affection in everyone she encounters.[image]Again, my descriptions can only serve as a diminishment to what pleasures are actually found in the book. I am entirely out of my depth to sound out Yotsuba&!'s charms, but perhaps we should just leave it at this: whenever a new volume arrives in the mail, I curl up comfortably with my wife, finding the best lighting possible under such snuggly conditions, and I read each chapter to her aloud, trying to muster in my own voice the clear enthusiasm in Yotsuba’s own.And then we both smile a lot.______________________It should be noted that there are two English translations available. ADV Manga held the license for Yotsuba&! for a number of years but as the manga bubble burst due to over saturation and ADV experienced its own problems that from the outside simply looked like poor business management, the company let slip the license to publish the book in America. Yen Press thankfully picked it up and has been publishing ever since, both taking on the new volumes and republishing their own translations of the previously released volumes.While I am very thankful that due to Yen Press’ work, Yotsuba&! is still available to readers today, I really did prefer ADV’s translation. While I don’t speak or read Japanese, it looks like Yen Press’ translation is probably more faithful to the original language, retaining honorifics such and -san and -chan. That’s good and I applaud their fidelity, but as a reader, ADV’s work just flows better and breathes more life into Yotsuba and her supporting cast. While the books are still greatly enjoyable, whenever I read the books out loud, I find myself translating from Yen Press’ English into ADV’s on the fly. It’s tiring, but it makes for an altogether better experience for readers/listeners.[ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,100,1,not set,not set,"Jul 28, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/511240.Yotsuba_Vol_1

And I suppose this should be qualified somewhat because in some ways the man does some ridiculously enviable work.[image]WE3 actually exhibits pretty well where Quitely’s weaknesses and strengths lie. His human figures are lumpy, over-saturated bags whose movement is articulated by some awkward skeletal foundation. And yet his page design is sometimes superlative. His faces are alien renderings, where eyes float apart at too-great distances. And yet he can employ the tools of visual storytelling superbly when he wants. His organics are a mess and sit so deeply entrenched in the uncanny valley that extrication seems impossible. And yet his work with non-organics sings, leaping off the page with such unbounded joy that readers may threaten to forget just how terribly his people and animals are conceived. WE3 demonstrates all of this and it is probably because of how strongly the story relies on Quitely’s inventive page design and depictions of technology that I am largely able to forget that the book also contains drawings of people and animals.Apart from Sea Guy, the absurdist comedy, WE3 is far-and-away my favourite of Grant Morrison’s work. It helps that I’m not really a big fan of much of what I’ve read of the lauded author. I find his ideas intriguing but don’t think much of him as a writer. His characters don’t usually strike any chord with me, his dialogue is flat, and his storylines are fine but nothing special. So when weighing big ideas against the absence of much of the other stuff required in good writing, I find myself generally pretty nonplussed. Still, since I love big ideas, I keep returning to his work to see if he gets better at the other stuff that matters. One day, perhaps.[image]WE3 is something of a reimagining of the Homeward Bound-style animal quest storyline with some Plague Dogs thrown in for good measure. Three kidnapped pets, a dog and cat and rabbit, have been reconditioned as killing machines and given sleek and miniature battlemechs to make the whole enterprise more lethal. Having served to the end of their usefulness (though we’re never given any reason why this should be the case), these three are to be decommissioned. Like, forever. Not especially fond of embracing the past tense, the animals fight their way to an escape and then begin their journey Home—though none of them know what home is or whether such a thing exists for them at all (the cat is the most suspicious of the idea). The three animals, always on the run from government forces, have a variety of graphically violent misadventures before bridging to climax in a railway yard (perhaps one more homage to Homeward Bound).WE3 is terrifically violent. Blood, dismemberment, the shearing of flesh and bone, the puncture of eyes, the perforation of a body with bullets. Humans and animals are silenced with a manic sort of glee in numerous, inventive ways, each idealized for splatter-range. By showing the swath of destruction wrought by our protagonists, Morrison and Quitely offer an effective and in-its-way beautiful demonstration of the terror of what’s been done against these animals. [image]Of course, these three are not just animals and Morrison never honestly treats them as such (save perhaps in epilogue). Like the pets in Homeward Bound, 1, 2, and 3 (their names) exhibit one particular trait that makes them an evolutionary step ahead of their beastly peers: they can talk. Granted, they sound more like Stephen Hawking than Alex P. Keaton, but giving them voices—however rudimentary—strips them of their place as animal characters and makes them human characters, albeit in animal form. To be fair, Morrison does do some legwork in trying to envision what the personalities of a dog, cat, and rabbit would be had they only been given voices (and destructive tactical genius)—and for the most part, it works. But in the end, we care for these creatures not because of what they are or what has been done to them. Instead, we care for them because they talk. And we can’t really do anything else because the story never presents them as animals. They are always something more, something alien.[image]WE3 is a worthwhile read. Some will adore it, some will just shrug and say, “Huh. Neat. I guess?” The book is a largely enjoyable adventure masquerading as some brand of social commentary. It has some exquisite page designs and some truly monstrous looking people and animals. The twist on the common animal yarn is explored well enough that the flat dialogue doesn’t get in the way too much. I liked it well enough but its not one I’ll return to again and again over the years to come.[ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,not set,"Jul 28, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/22358.We3

Because the reader controls entirely the pace of a story’s execution, one of the primary tools of the horror genre is kept from authors in the comics medium. Additionally, revulsion is increasingly difficult to elicit from static imagery—a gross drawing is merely that and draws forth none of that sense of fear or terror that aficionados of the genre tend to relish. Certainly a compelling story about the affects of war on a civilian population can horrify, but only because it is humanity who is the monster and not some lumbering creature of the imagination. There seems little room for the supernatural to scare us from the immobile, two-dimensional page.When I first approached Junji Ito’s Uzumaki, I hoped for my understanding of comics horror to undergo a dramatic shift. I hoped that his mind-bending work would bring me to see that the comics page could truly deliver terror. Not so much because I like being frightened but simply because I love experiencing the expanding boundaries of what the medium is capable of. And Ito seemed the perfect guide if anyone was.Junji Ito is, so I read, considered to be a master of Japanese horror. He’s created several works that have been lauded for their depiction of strange horror. But as inventive as his stories are and as horrifying as I would find these tales had they been committed to film, they come off rather sterile in screentones.Which is not to say that Ito’s Uzumaki isn’t a good time. It is. What it isn’t, however, is in any way horrifying.Uzumaki, in Japanese, means “spiral” (hence the helpful English subtitle for the book: Spiral into Horror) and throughout these three volumes we become well acquainted with a town that is becoming possessed by the idea of the spiral. The theme of spirals makes its mark across every chapter and in numerous inventive (and usually gruesome) ways. In one case, a girl’s hair takes on a spiraling, hypnotic life of its own. In another, a boy grows a spiraling shell on his back and gradually becomes a snail. A scar bores into one girl’s mind. Another girl finds herself the love interest of a typhoon.[image]Uzumaki begins as a collection of interrelated short stories, each exploring one more aspect of the town’s strange connection with spirals, but gradually takes on the form of a longer, more interconnected narrative. There isn’t much in the way of character development because apart from the protagonist and her boyfriend (who wants desperately to get out of Dodge), most characters don’t last much farther beyond the chapter of their introduction. There is a lot of death (and worse) in Uzumaki and so the story soon becomes the question of how this couple will survive the increasingly manic terror being visited upon their town.Really, by series’ end, the moral becomes clear: Girls, when your high school boyfriend says that the town is possessed and you two should run away together, you’d be crazy not to do as he says. Perhaps Ito is projecting his own childhood’s discreet woes. Really, after even just one of these incidents, it’s not entirely clear why any of the witnesses don’t flee the town immediately. Perhaps they find the spirals too hypnotic.[image]Uzumaki, though boasting its share of faults (both in art and in storytelling), still stands out as something that may be worth your time. While it probably won’t frighten you or give you any kind of nightmares, you may find Ito’s images, in a certain sense, indelible. In the couple weeks since I finished the book’s last chapter, I have continually found myself reminded of particular story moments or ideas that were rather strikingly composed. If you’re curious what Ito’s all about, his short story “The Enigma of Amigara Fault” is a good starting place. It’s pretty representative of the kind of horror that is found in Uzumaki.[ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,not set,not set,"Jul 28, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25152.Uzumaki

He was the letterer for Groo the Wanderer and a creator of indie black-and-white comics. I didn’t approach his table. Not only was I painfully shy as a child (I would have been in sixth grade or so at this time), but I felt bad for this creator and didn’t want him to see the pity in my eyes. After all, he wasn’t good enough to work on color comics. Color comics like Power Pack.I was a moron. That creator was Stan Sakai. And I’ve been regretting the ignorance of my youth ever since.It wasn’t until late 1998 that I first encountered Usagi Yojimbo firsthand when I had one of the final issues of the “Grasscutter” storyline slipped into my pull list at my local store. Rather than return the book for a refund, I thought I’d give it a shot. After all, I’d heard of the rabbit samurai by that point and I was looking for new ways to distance myself from the superhero genre, a market of the medium with which I had been growing increasingly disenchanted. It was really much better than I expected a book starring people with animal heads to be. I waited a few months more for “Grasscutter” to be collected so I could get a little more context. And a month after reading “Grasscutter,” I had every volume of Usagi Yojimbo I could find. Sakai’s creation was invigourating.Usagi Yojimbo is the story of a fictional, idealized, totemic, and somewhat historical Japan. It is a story told by following (primarily) a single wandering ronin as he follows the way of the samurai, seeking enlightenment, honour, justice, and the beauty of living. Due to his wandering nature, the reader encounters a breadth of stories, regions, and cultures. These tales unfold circa 1627 and create, despite their (sometimes) almost mythical hue, a worthwhile vantage into real and historical Japan. [image]Sakai peppers his narrative with the fruit of a lot of research. The most popular of his stories, “Grasscutter,” begins with a lengthy-though-entertaining excursus into the mythological origins of Japan and her people. A shorter story, “Daisho,” explains the craft with which the samurai’s sword-pair is forged and the importance those two swords (called daisho) hold to their owners. Other chapters include overtly educational bits on kite-making, pottery-making, and the intrusion of the West into the Far East. And even when he isn’t completely halting his telling in order to instruct the reader, Sakai weaves a story that posits a seamless, discreet form of education—taking part in the story by simply reading it, Sakai’s audience is constantly learning more and more about a dead and foreign culture.One of Sakai’s great talents is in his visual storytelling. His art flows naturally and his panel design is masterful. Some of the most beautiful pages are silent and filled with panels; each of these panels illustrates part of a picture-story that initially seems unrelated to the narrative intent but ends up providing context or mood for everything that is to follow. Sakai’s art has a wonderful, lyrical quality to it and it’s incredible that he’s been able to maintain his more-than-twenty-five-year schedule of producing one chapter per month. He really is one of the best creators in the medium.Usagi Miyamoto, a long-eared samurai based on Musashi Miyamoto, is a near-master swordsman. Having lost his lord to a betrayal on a battlefield years earlier, Usagi has taken to wandering Japan on a warrior’s pilgrimage. As he follows wherever his paths lead him, he hones his skills, meditates on the way of life, and interacts with those whom he meets on the road. The rabbit’s nomadic nature allows Sakai to easily structure the book episodically, with many stories self-contained in a single chapter. Typically, the author will interject a sustained story arch in between groups of five or more shorter tales. Still, despite the book’s episodic nature, Sakai manages to keep a fairly large stable of recurring characters who help to build reader-investment in Usagi’s world.[image]Usagi is a morally upright figure who lives by a strict code of honour and generally prefers non-violent solutions. Regardless, because of his abilities, his willingness to assist the oppressed, and the general anarchy of the land, Usagi has personally killed more people on-page than probably any single real-world figure has throughout history.** Yet for a book filled with so much violence, Usagi Yojimbo is a nearly sterile work. Opponents die from deep sword cuts, but there is rarely any kind of blood shown—and never any viscera. Just as Usagi himself does not tend to rejoice in the violent outcome of his circumstances, neither does Sakai seem to relish gratuitous visualizations of what must be horrible deaths. For this reason, despite all the killing, Usagi Yojimbo may be an entirely appropriate and wonderful read for even an older elementary student.One of the great things about watching a series and creator evolve over twenty-five years is that progress and growth are tangible. Improvement in craft becomes easily evident. One of the not-so-great things about it, though, is that there is the early stuff to contend with, the material produced when the creator was still feeling his way around. Before he had time to grow comfortable with his art style. Before his writing could find its pace and voice.[image]On the left, Usagi as he originally appeared in 1984.On the right, Usagi as he appeared in 1998.Like with Fables (though not as grievously), I find myself conflicted when recommending Usagi Yojimbo. The first volume is really just not at all representative of the wonderful stories that fill the book’s twenty-four other volumes. The art is hard and abrupt, and there isn’t enough of a narrative to endear the reader to any of its stories. The first volume’s importance lies in its introduction of several recurring characters, including Usagi himself. My only fear is that some will approach the first volume only to give up on an otherwise stellar series.

You might not believe it exists and you’d be right to be skeptical. Books that straddle the line are rarer than books that praise the literary structure and depth of Stephenie Meyer novels. Or maybe not that rare. But still, pretty rare.The thing is: most books that call out to the passions either a) do so quite honestly and work hard to elicit their response through genuine means or b) are contrived pieces of brute violence whose whole identity lies in the ability to wrench tears from the reader. There’s not a lot of writing out there that makes you wonder which side of the fence a book comes down on. It isn’t often that I’ll actually need to have a conversation with myself about whether or not a book earned its response from me.Twin Spica is a book that plays against expectation, then.Twin Spica composes so grand a wealth of emotive moments that if a reader is at all averse to misting up within sight of others, the book should not at all be consumed in public places. I typically have ended up reading each volume on lunch breaks in coffee shops or pizza parlours* and every last time I’ve been stuck staring at a page waiting for the lines to stop being so damned fuzzy and regain their composure. It’d probably be embarrassing if I at all cared what dining strangers thought of the thirty-seven-year-old man biting his lip and reading manga in a booth by himself.** So yeah, Twin Spica delivers the emotionally devastating moments so frequently and with such apparent abandon that even though the book feels honest, I can’t help but remain skeptical. Could any book so frequently and so convincingly bring me to be whelmed with feeling without resorting to fakery? I mean, I don’t feel manipulated, not really. But maybe Yaginuma is really just tricking me with his winning characters and their lives built on hope and pain and their willingness to take on a world that’s clearly too real for their dreams.The thing is: I don’t care.[image]Generally, I have a pretty good nose for contrivance. And once scented out, manipulation bothers me enough to strip me entirely of any ability to just go along with the story. But with Twin Spica I don’t even care to know whether Yaginuma comes by his power naturally or through foul literary sorcery. The book so thoroughly has both my attentions and affections that it really can do no wrong. I adore Asumi and Mr. Lion and treasure all the terrible things they’ve endured to get Asumi to the stars.In the world of Twin Spica, the world’s third great astronautical disaster occurred in Japan in 2010. Japan’s first manned spaceflight goes awry when the rocket booster’s fuel errantly ignites, causing the rocket itself to veer into the nearby city of Yuigahama, killing many and leaving others injured, both physically and emotionally. Spica's story begins in 2024 and concerns fourteen-year-old Asumi, whose mother died in the accident. Asumi grows up speaking to the ghost of one of the astronauts aboard the Lion (the rocket’s name) and develops a passion for the stars. When an astronautical training school opens up to pave the way for Japan’s newly reopened space program, Asumi jumps at the opportunity to pursue her dream of space travel.[image]While the story largely unfolds in the present day, all of the volumes so far (1–7) have included back-up stories following characters when they were younger. This helps flesh out the current characters and halts them from merely being plot points that exist only to drive the story. These include heartbreaking memories of Asumi learning to deal with her mother’s five-year-long coma to sweet stories about how Asumi was inspired to take up her astronaut training even as a young elementary-schooler.One of the more interesting aspects of the series is that, while it is pretty thoroughly grounded in an extrapolated science of the future, Twin Spica spends a lot of time developing the relationship between Asumi and the lion-masked ghost of an astronaut (Mr. Lion, he calls himself). For what amounts to a sci-fi drama, this is a curious choice. Science, being thoroughly materialistic by definition, should have no overlap with the metaphysical. Perhaps mythic systems operate differently in the day-to-day lives of the Japanese people, but this inclusion of the supernatural in an otherwise mundane story might take many American readers off-guard. In the end though, Yaginuma’s inclusions of ghosts and an afterlife allow him to explore numerous story avenues and character explorations that would be impossible to otherwise sound out. It’s this combination of the physical and the metaphysical that gives Twin Spica its strength and so the combination of the two comes off less corny than it does inspired.Twin Spica thus far***  is absolutely worth your time as a reader. It is honestly one of my favourite series being published currently and I look forward to the new volume every other month. It gets me a bit teary-eyed almost every time, but in a way that feels satisfying—even if Yaginuma does seem to be suspiciously talented at drawing out an emotional response from readers.[image]Notes:*Do they still call them parlours? Parlour is a but quaint for my taste, but pizza restaurant sounds pretty clunky and pizza joint sounds too flip.**The lesson here is not that I am a lonely lonely guy, but rather: if you work in a place where no other employees are in your age range or share your interests, you will eat alone a lot.

I promise.***There are, as of this moment, nine more volumes waiting to be released and the series should wrap up in November of 2012.[ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,not set,not set,"Jul 28, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7618065-twin-spica-volume

Woefully i[image]My acquaintance with North American tribal histories, lores, and mythologies is what those in the know might describe as inadequate. Woefully inadequate, even. Certainly I have for these cultures a passing appreciation that I garnered piecemeal from elementary school classes (focused on Californian tribes), a smattering of books, a couple of films, and even the occasional article. Knowledge thus gained is likely apocryphal and prone to stereotype—and so I’ve largely abandoned any sense that I understand North American tribal culture at all. I’m much more knowledgeable as concerns Olmecs, Toltecs, Aztecs, and Mayans than I am of Cherokees, Apaches, Utes, or Choctaws. And my entire knowledge of Canadian tribal nations comes from an Elmore Leonard novel and Jim Jarmusch’s Dead Man, neither of which are satisfactory sources.So when the opportunity to read an anthology composed wholly by tribal Americans and trafficking entirely in tales drawn from the tribal mythos, I was demonstrably excited. I had grabbed seven books that day and this collection was the first I picked up. It was also, of those seven books, the last finished—and finished reluctantly.Trickster was, by all measures available to me, a bitter pill to swallow.[image]I frequently remark at the necessarily uneven tone of anthologies, with one story trumping another and the next falling far short of the bar set by the former. I expected this. What I hadn’t expected was for the bar to be set so low and for it to remain low for the book’s duration. These stories were almost* universally uninvolving and trite, offering no compelling reason to read further. It was only a personal need to perform my due diligence that pressed me to continue. Never a good recommendation for a book.Almost exclusively, the writing in the book was limp. These stories of the Trickster (usually a coyote or rabbit or raccoon) were simply uninteresting. Perhaps they make a better oral tradition than a written one, but my feeling is that almost any of the stories could have been made more compelling with a steadier author’s hand. Many of the tales take forms similar to Kipling’s Just So Stories. How the alligator got his skin, how the rabbit got his tail, how the raccoon got short and fat, how the beaver stopped being an unbridled killing machine, et cetera. There’s meat there for some decent stories. Or at least some lame stories told interestingly. But it just never coalesces.[image]And while very rarely all that good, there are times when the art is actually just plain bad. After several stories with lackluster art, I gave up entirely on hoping for good visual storytelling and merely crossed my fingers, hoping that it wouldn’t get worse. The inhabitants of the frame often looked like creatures in static poses, only rendered so still from the steady hand of some demented taxidermist. It was rare that I felt an artist had a good feel for the story being told.Probably the greatest tragedy is the squandered opportunity. I was a happy and willing student, ready to take on a culture decidedly foreign from my own. I came to Trickster with a thirst for being inducted into terra incognita. And here I stand, as much a foreigner as I was three weeks ago when I first opened the book. Heck, I may even be more of a foreigner now.I don’t know what to feel. Should I see Trickster as well-representative of the North American tribal folklore? If so, then what am I to make of that culture? I found the storytelling infantile and the artistry remedial. Am I then too quick to judge another culture by standards I have learned under the rigours of my own? If so, that would be deeply unfair, like judging the first novels to come out of Borneo by the standards to which we would hold the latest literary release from Knopf. I don’t want to be that person and yet: if Trickster is a fair representation of the North American tribal narrative art, I can honestly say that I’m not all that interested in sitting around, waiting for it to develop into something I can appreciate. Not that a culture’s goal is to develop into something I can appreciate, of course.[image]My real hope is that Trickster is not a good reflection of the stories of these cultures.** That it is, rather, simply the product of those who were willing to put pen to paper in the particular form required by the medium. Perhaps tribal culture generally views the comics form as infantile as most Americans did until (mainly) this last decade. Maybe there are great storytellers among the peoples and nations who can turn the legends into verdant tales, both relevant and riveting. Perhaps those people exist and were merely not interested in a medium that doesn’t get half the respect it often deserves. That is my deep and solemn hope.Because I would hate to judge cultures based on this one hollow product.[image]Notes:*Hm. I suppose I should note that I did enjoy two stories in the volume. The best of show were the story about the raven kicking sea anemones and the one about how the wildcat caught a turkey. Both were enjoyable, with fair art—the wildcat story’s art bore strong resemblance to Doug TenNapel’s. Still, these were two stories out of twenty-one and there’s a long stretch between the two tales.**With the very traditionally Americano cartoon styles employed by the artists, it’s easy to become hopeful that this work isn’t really representative of Native American culture at all. Or at least not representative of the best of it.[ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,not set,not set,"Jul 28, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7743662-trickster

The Hound of the Baskervilles was well-regarded and is still read by students and Holmes aficionados every year. I, however, have never read the book and approached this adaptation in near total ignorance. As mentioned recently, I have some familiarity with the characters and their inclinations via the cultural hivemind in the same way that I know about Bambi’s mother and the man behind the curtain without having ever seen either Bambi or The Wizard of Oz. And of course, I have now also read an adaptation of A Study in Scarlet.So while I’m starting to get a better handle on Holmes’ moods and methods, prior caveats remain in that I cannot judge the faithfulness of the adaptation but can only judge the story as it appears to me in the Edginton/Culbard work. Any issues I take with the story will be issues that may or may not be a reflection of the source itself.While Edginton and Culbard’s A Study in Scarlet chronicles the first of Conan Doyle’s Holmes stories, the pair adapted Baskervilles first (probably to help generate interest in a series I hope will continue for some time). In the backmatter, Culbard shares some of his original sketches for how he planned to render Dear Elementary Watson.* It’s interesting to compare Edginton and Culbard’s two adaptations. While Baskervilles is a fine book, one can sense certain refinements between it and Scarlet. The story flows better in Scarlet, but as I mentioned, I’m not in any position to judge whether that responsibility belongs to Edginton or Conan Doyle himself. Regardless, even in keeping our focus on Culbard’s work, we can note one singular improvement: less reliance upon technical gimmickry. In Baskervilles, Culbard experiments with Photoshop techniques to show skewed character reflections and these always look out of place. Later in the book, when rendering the moorish landscapes, he relies upon what I have to imagine are shopped photographs of the moors themselves. Each time, these additions look strikingly out of place, at odds with the wonderfully consistent style that Culbard brings to the rest of his work. Scarlet betrays none of these weaknesses so far as I remember and even though Culbard had the opportunity to experiment similarly in depictions of the American frontier, he thankfully restrained himself. I am always cheered to see an artist evolve through his work. (I am looking forward to seeing what Culbard does with The Sign of the Four, their next Holmes adaptation.)[image]As a detective story, I’m not sure exactly why it became such a popular event in Holmes’ life. Perhaps readers of the era were unduly enamoured with the Scooby-Doo-style crossover of science vs. the supernatural. After all, if it worked for X-Files... Honestly, despite the presence of several cheats in the former tale, I really did prefer A Study in Scarlet. The present tale is built upon an overwhelming implausibility, namely that the villain would pursue the inheritor of the Baskerville fortune from his first step in London rather than simply wait for the man to walk, unsuspecting, into his trap. As the story wraps up, I found myself baffled as to why any would-be murderer smart enough to outstrip Homes in the early game would forfeit himself in such amateur ways.On the other hand, I am kind of a sucker for glowing dogs.[image]Apart from my negative feeling toward the story’s plotting and my (mostly) positive outlook on Culbard’s art, there are two other points worth noting. For the one, the creative team again (for the first time!) does a marvelous job with Holmes’ character. He is exactly as distant and arrogant and wry as I imagine he is meant to be. He is conveyed perfectly. For the other, Edginton and Culbard take an early opportunity to present Holmes as a genius whose inductive process is incredible though far from foolproof. In the earliest episode from the book, Holmes and Watson take on the task of identifying the owner of a walking stick based on nothing save the stick itself. Holmes is patronizingly charitable toward Watson’s own attempt before revealing the whole truth of the matter. Which is then proven to be only partially correct by facts far more brute than his meager inductions. It is a humbling moment and Edginton and Culbard capture it flawlessly.[image]If The Hound of the Baskervilles was the creative team’s first attempt and A Study in Scarlet their second, I am well onboard to see what they do with their third and can only hope their improvements carry on in a similar vector.Note:*Myth busted: Holmes said, “Elementary, my dear Watson,” as often as Rick Blaine said “Play it again, Sam.” Which was zero times.[ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Jul 28, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6609203-the-hound-of-the-baskervilles

Thus cut off from the presence of the author’s overt guidance, readers are better able to take in the illusion that they are not being guided. That their experience of the history unfurling before them approaches objectivity.With The Borden Tragedy (the first volume of the Treasury of Victorian Murder that I’ve been able to get my hands on), Rick Geary succeeds ably in preparing the illusion. His art (actually very reminiscent of Rick Griffin’s work) is not sensationalist and his camera angles are subdued. Even moments of great horror—such as a hatchet cleaving the back of a woman’s head—are presented so modestly that the reader hardly imagines the images being taken in are great terrors. Geary does a fantastic job of using his art to distance readers from the viscera of the actual events.[image]He further draws readers into the sense that they are impartial observers to the gratuitous murders of Abby and Andrew Borden by telling the story almost exclusively through the journaling of a female acquaintance of the accused Lizzie. This isn’t Geary’s report of things nor the sensationalist speculation of a newspaper that only wishes to boost subscriptions. Instead, we are given a narrator with curiosity in the case of a woman whose prior demeanor hardly matched that of a reckless killer. This prompts a detached examination of events, compiled years later and apart from any of the natural hysteria that would likely govern in the season following Lizzie Borden’s arrest and trial. Readers can certainly understand that our narrator may have some emotional involvement that may colour her reportage, but as we’re aware of that, we can look for clues that might belie her telling.[image]The trick of course is that even taking into account that the narrator is a party outside Geary’s control, the entire book, from art to writing is his own production. And it’s a trick he pulls off wonderfully. Geary chooses the scenes to portray and how to do so. He chooses the words to report. He chooses the expressions to give his characters, where to place them in the rooms, how to depict their eyes. All of these things are fabrications he uses to tell the story he wishes to tell, and yet: for the space of those eighty pages, I never once was drawn out of his narrative to ask, What does Geary think? Where is he leading me? And then even so—and this may be due his own lack of personal conviction regarding the identity of the murderer—after finishing the book and setting it down, I still felt that I was unable to come to any conclusions as to either the killer’s true identity or where Geary himself comes down.And then again, perhaps this agnosticism was Geary’s goal for me.The Borden Tragedy is a short work and while not as thrilling as many examples of true crime literature, it serves as a fantastic primer to a famous unsolved double murder. Geary’s talent as a comics creator is evident and I’m now looking forward to collecting all of his Treasury Volumes.

Novels will set forth what seem like a number of unrelated short stories that—only when all finished and seen from the outside—combine to form a single narrative thread. Numerous protagonists will weave in and out of story focus, each propelling the fictive direction according to their own story needs but all the while vectoring the story itself down the author’s intended path.It’s not an easy thing to accomplish. More often than not, authors of such works are only moderately successful in the endeavor. While once the inventiveness of even attempting such a kind of story may have been enough to earn accolades, now that the form is no longer all that experimental (having been attempted over and again these last twenty years) readers require skill as well as invention. Many of these stories don’t hold together quite as well as an author should like, their narrative paths not quite intersecting so well as they should.I’ve read many such books that—while showing promise from the start—have ultimately disappointed. Books whose final product failed to deliver with a compelling narrative force. Super Spy is not one of those books. While there are certainly a number of points in which Matt Kindt’s collection of WWII-era spy stories could have been better or more competently wrought, those are rare and in the end do little to diminish the work.When I first approached Kindt’s book, I was not aware that he was weaving any sort of narrative tapestry. I thought Super Spy was merely a collection of short stories. It took the absorption of several stories before I came to realize that these stories were at all connected. It took several more to see that he was, through these disparate reflections, forging a single work. By book’s end, Kindt clearly and deftly presents his thesis: a portrait of the spy, a landscape of clandestine HUMINT.[image]Super Spy traverses the personal geography of the espionage circuit during the early-to-mid ‘40s. Touching on all manner of occupational involvement (from state-trained agents to assassins for hire to citizens caught up in their national loyalties to those bound up in the war beneath the war due to coercions of one kind or another), Kindt’s book grants a broad perspective on just who might become involved in the game of secrets and how their experience would likely end up.Several years ago I was doing research for a book I was intending to write. A book set in the world of spies and secrets. After reading fairly extensively in an encyclopedia devoted to espionage (both trade and history), my story gradually weaned away from being at all related to spies and nations and evolved into something else. Still, reading that much history of the craft leaves one with a certain perspective. Espionage is not glamourous. And more often than not, its practitioners come to bad ends. Espionage is, in reality, much more le Carré than it is Flemming. And Kindt’s work reflects this.While certainly not all of his protagonists meet bitter conclusions, it is most often the case that their lives, if not destroyed physically by bullets, knives, or bombs, come to other tragic conclusions, twisted by sadness, loss, regret, or any other dozen of the psychological bugbears that plague those who traffic in lies and deceptions. Super Spy, while occasionally humourous (depending on the story), is generally a darker sort of work. It peers into the human spirit in a period of great distress. There is, after all, a war on—and wars have ever been the destroyers of souls.[image]With few exceptions, Kindt’s stories are told without flaw. Art and word conspire together to craft unique narratives, each with purpose and goal, driving forward his story of secrets. Super Spy‘s greatest strength doesn’t lie in its inventive plotting or uncommon characterizations. (Many of his stories seem lifted from other works I’ve read or seen and most of his characters remain archetypical.) The book’s strength instead lies in the very human way in which it approaches a world that is far beyond the coping mechanisms of its contributors. These people, no matter how thinly sketched, are always people—are always worth the time of your consideration. They are just as sad, broken, and hopeful as real people are and when their stories end, those conclusions are just as stupid, pointless, and tragic as they would be in real life. Super Spy‘s strength may be in its verisimilitude: not technical but rather, perhaps, spiritual.[ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Jul 25, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/589072.Super_Spy

I’m sure that if I were of like age, culture, and circumstance with Skim‘s lead, Kimberly Keiko Cameron, I might find the book soul-piercing and intelligent. But I’m not and so I don’t.[image]There is one singular obstacle facing any author who hopes to present a story featuring realistically portrayed teenagers: teens are uninteresting. Their problems are generally overblown trivialities. Their insights are comically common, with the depth of a drying brook. Their social perception is little better than that of gradeschoolers—and what growth exists is generally diminished by an acute absence of wisdom. It’s good then that most authors diminish the realism of their teenage protagonists for the sake of their story, substituting instead younger versions of their adult selves.I mean, it’s fine to have the occasional literary novel posit a realistic kid just so readers unfamiliar with our younger world-companions will remember that teenagers are really just like adults minus the perspective, wisdom, and restraint that experience grants those who live to be older than teenagers. But really, do we need more Harry Potter: Book Fives? Because in case you forgot, Harry was a repellent little punk in that book. Whiny, moody, reckless, selfish, and irritable. Harry was not someone whom I really wanted to spend that entire book with.And it’s pretty much the same thing with Skim.Kim, as protagonist, is not someone who captures reader interest. She bears the typical marks of teen self-righteousness, believing herself wise and aloof, better than those around her. She describes herself—in that perfectly elitist manner that seems unique to those who haven’t really seen much of the world—as a freak, as someone whom those around her could never possibly understand even if given the time an infinite number of monkeys are usually allotted to complete literary masterworks. She’s kind of a more reserved, less acerbic, less funny version of Ghost World‘s Enid. She’s also a bit of a dilettante, dabbling in the arts and in an amateurish brand of Wicca (she has an altar in her bedroom, goes to the woods to summon a recently deceased student, and wears charms meant to bring her love). She’s exactly as miserable as you would expect her to be. She is, after all, a teenager deeply in love with herself and the prison she can turn life into. (No offense to Wiccans or teenagers who aren’t these things.)In the end, her troubles are typical and her response to them expected. There is no story to her story. Skim might as well be biography for how mundane it all is—biography of a perfectly average life with nothing to recommend it. There’s a reason that people don’t read biographies of the average person, that they don’t salivate to discover what occurs next in the life of Joe the bus driver or Cheryl the data analyst or Tom the elementary school custodian. It’s not that such people can’t be fascinating on an individual level or don’t lead wholly worthwhile lives. It’s more just that their stories aren’t different enough from our own to merit our interest.Now don’t read me as saying there’s no place for teenagers or average people or mundane stories in fiction. Great literature is lousy with the stuff. The problem is when these stories either don’t take their characters to new places or, in choosing to maroon their characters in personal stagnation, have nothing to add to the human conversation. If a Cheryl-the-data-analyst story chronicling the humdrum of the day-in-and-out had a point or explored Cheryl in an interesting fashion or gave us a better view of ourselves, then maybe a story about Cheryl would merit the pages devoted to her. Stories don’t have to be all about churning out one exciting event after another. Things besides plot are allowed to arc. An interesting bit of insight or turn of character could have turned Skim around in a heartbeat—or at least nudged it in the right direction. I kept waiting for that to come.[image]Note to teachers: it’s never appropriate to kiss your students in the woods. Even if it’s a lesbian kiss.Despite the fact that Skim, as a story, fails to generate anything better than ambivalence toward its characters’ plights, the book’s dialogue is competent enough. None of the characters seem overblown or outlandish and there’s not a lot of the kind of unbelievable soliloquy that often inhabits the day-in-the-life genre (writer Mariko Tamaki saves that for the journal-entry narration that interprets all events for us). Really, I could see almost everything in this book actually happening and I could believe that a sixteen year-old would write about these things in this manner. Unfortunately, I think Skim could use a little less believability.Really, it’s a shame about the story. And not just because I had to read through the entire thing. Artist Jillian Tamaki does a beautiful job with the script she’s given. Her characters flow naturally and her balance of white and black and midtones set a number of visually impressive stages. She excels especially in her drawings of the woods, lending a very organic sense to these two-dimensional representations. Actually, the same could be said for some of her figure-work as well. Particularly, the way in which she renders Kim in soft, rounded lines gives the girl a sense of believability.[image]Strange how I’m praising believability in the art but lashing out  against it in the writing,but that’s just the way this one falls out.I am not the target audience for Skim. The only problem is that I’m not sure who is. Maybe a very particular sort of teenager (or an adult attached to re-evaluating their own pasts through the mistakes of fictional characters) could find its contents invigourating. Maybe I’m not being generous enough. But at the end of the day, while the book has certain qualities to recommend it, Skim was a chore for me to finish and so I’m hard pressed to recommend the book to anyone.[ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,not set,"Jul 25, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2418888.Skim

I complained about a lot of the irrational things that we were for some reason expected to do as part of the social ritual. Unity candle. Bouquet toss. White wedding dress. Bridesmaids and groomsmen. Inviting people. The usual.[image]I’ve never been big on traditions and have always done what I could to pare down the detritus that’s accumulated over the decades and centuries on the shores of our celebrations. Like most people, I like the things I like and don’t like the things I don’t. Unlike some, however, I’m enough not a fan of tradition for tradition’s sake that I bridle under its yoke. In short, tradition makes me grumpy.In a lot of ways then, Adrian Tomine and I are pretty much the same person. I mean, I’m probably taller than him and am much more blonde. And have different personal ideologies and tastes and everything, sure. But in this one area, in answering the question of How to Throw a Wedding, we might be twins.Scenes from an Impending Marriage, as every  will mention (because it’s a neat detail!), was prepared by Tomine as a wedding favour for guests. This is hardly fair. We had handmade origami boxes filled with Starburst Jelly Beans at our wedding. Another guy I know had music boxes. Another friend made the mistake of doing goldfish (turned out a bit morbid for a celebration of love). Tomine’s favors make ours look like we were not even trying and I’ll forever loathe and love him for that. Still, having spent about a hundred hours designing our own wedding invitation (and another fifty building an artsy website), you probably couldn’t have paid me to put together something that guests might have actually kept… Danggit.*sigh*[image]Scenes is slight (at only fifty-six pages) and can easily be finished in under fifteen minutes. Tomine uses his page-space to chart the decision-making process of the newly engaged couple. As non-fiction, the book specifies Tomine and his fiancée’s experience, but really Scenes plays pretty close to universal in the struggles it represents. Nearly all couples probably experience these same struggles as they work to plan a wedding, even if the details vary.There is the question of the invitation list, whom to add and whom to cull—and you don’t even know these people your parents want included. There is the struggle of finding a place for the reception that at all fits the couple’s perception of what is acceptable, trying to balance taste, class, cost, style, and convenience, all while not lording their celebration over the less fortunate (a criterion which, to be fair, is probably not a bugbear glowering at too many engaged couples). Then there’s homemade invites vs. those professionally prepared, live music vs. a DJ vs. an iPod, and hairstyles and florists and favours. It’s a pretty rapid fire tour of what awaits those who will soon be engaged, but for those who have been through it (or at least have good enough imaginations), Scenes rings true and the humourous look at wedding prep is a happy diversion.[image]As always, it’s all about the finger-waves.Still, Tomine’s wedding favour threatens at becoming more than just a chronicle of engagement gags. It explores Interpersonal Interaction, that thing that makes relationships work or fall apart. We get insight into how at least one person views the dynamics of his particular experience of the boy-girl lego. And because of our sense of Tomine’s honesty in his depiction, it comes off as probably being a fair indicator of how their relationship gears mesh. Scenes, then, is a historical document that chronicles not just the events as they have taken place, but of the interrelationship of the two human persons who are the central figures of these events.And in comparison with other examples of intrusive entertainment that our voyeuristic culture produces, Scenes of an Impending Marriage is an actual joy to take in. (Only I’m not certain that it’s ten dollars worth of joy.)[ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,not set,"Jul 25, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9306087-scenes-from-an-impending-marriage

Not political theory—I understand to some decent degree the ins and outs of varPolitics is one of those things that just really makes no sense to me. Not political theory—I understand to some decent degree the ins and outs of various hypothetical governmental systems. I understand capitalism versus socialism versus communism. I understand monarchies versus oligarchies versus plutocracies versus democratic republics. I understand foreign and domestic policy and the reasons for supporting different perspectives within these spheres.What I don’t understand is how things within the political realm come to matter so deeply to people. There doesn’t seem any reasonable excuse why reasonable men and women should find themselves demonizing left, right, or centrist. There doesn’t seem to be any real purpose to the vitriol with which voters who appreciate Candidate A will approach voters who appreciate Candidate B—and vice versa. There doesn’t seem to be any plausible reason that a person should hate another simply because the other holds to a variant political philosophy.And yet, because our world is so often not a sane place to be, this kind of animosity does exist and from time to time feeds into brutal violence, taking ostensibly sensible people and turning them into monsters. Parade (With Fireworks) concerns itself with this very problem.[image]Cavallaro’s book is well crafted though slight. He relates a single story of political interest gone awry without exploring at all the depth that makes such a story believable. After digesting what Cavallaro offers, most readers will find the historical circumstance credible and the actions of its individuals plausible. Even though they are, from a modest standpoint, quite insane. Most readers won’t blanch at accepting events as the author lays them out because we all know how history has played out in the past and that wars have been perpetrated over such ideologies. Parade would have been much more fascinating had it sought to investigate the psychological framework of its cast rather than simply relate events as they happened. There is some treatment of those changes in political temperature that can be felt even across a single season of time. Cavallaro also broaches how deeply that alteration can abuse families and individuals caught in history’s maw, but on the whole Parade performs at a rather standard trot. Parade chronicles moments during and surrounding its central event, the escort of a band from the center of town to its outskirts. It’s 1923: Italy—back when the fascists and the communists were vying for power in the wake of the Great War. Spain set a similar tableau at the time. Tempers heated and venom bubbled. And into this mess of passions steps Paolo, fresh from Chicago (and therefore armed). [image]It’s Epiphany and Paolo’s brother Vincenzo is escorting the band he hired from the church to the edge of town to protect them from those who might do them harm. Vincenzo is an important man and, as a communist, someone with rivals. Gato has never gotten along with Vincenzo and he and his fascist friends follow along with the band as well, harassing them along the way and demanding they play some fascist anthem or other. When this small parade reaches Paolo, fuses light and the title-promised fireworks begin.The story, for all its lack of introspection, is competently handled and the artwork accomplished. If I had to guess, I’d hazard that Cavallaro held some kind of background in animation. This may not be the case, but his characters have the grace and composition common to those familiar with breathing movement into their drawings. Parade is well-coloured and Cavallaro is able to evince mood and tone with his sometimes dramatic shifts in hue and saturation.[image]Parade (With Fireworks) may not hold a lasting place in the canon of historical graphic novels, but it does capture the spirit of a historical moment well enough. As a terse read, the book can be digested wholly over a very short amount of time. This may be a positive or a negative depending on who you are and why you read, but for my money, I would have preferred a more thought-provoking piece—one that asked questions of our nature, one that demanded a reason for our reasonlessness.

That there are nearly no words means that readers will spend all their time reading pictures instead of divvying time between text and illustration. The stories are simple (even perhaps simplistic) and the characters are all dressed in heart-on-sleeve fashion. The art, too, is low on detail and finish, using broad brushstrokes and few lines to convey character and place. There is no evidence of brilliant craftsmanship shining through Runton’s illustrations (not that Owly‘s art isn’t brilliantly crafted, but more that it just doesn’t grab you by the collar to scream in your face expounding on how brilliant it is). [image]These are all things that can be said about Andy Runton’s Owly, and yet none of these adequately describe this charming little book.Without words, Owly may be the perfect investment for families with young children, a book that can be read over and over and told differently every time. Runton’s tales about an overtly sincere, disarmingly careful owl can function as a genuine vehicle for teaching parents better ways to tell stories. While the bones of the narrative (Runton’s illustrations) remain unchanged, the way a reader chooses to convey the story to small listeners will evolve and grow through multiple readings. I’m not sure if this conceit was one of Runton’s intentions, but sometimes even unintended ends justify a variety of means.[image]And with simple life lessons and the obvious emotional carnage his characters suffer at the hand of being perhaps too invested in their loneliness and pain, Owly marks a suitable tool for social pedagogy. Parents can use kids’ natural affection for Owly himself to draw out empathy for those outsiders who may be misunderstood, for those who cannot find the words to express themselves in acceptable ways within group settings. Owly is a caring, conscientious, and loving individual who cannot make friends because he’s simply too awkward to do so. He fumbles his opportunities and spends enough of his time alone that he’s come to expect that will be the way of his life—even though he consistently makes strides to overcome a life that causes him to grow despondent.And perhaps that’s one of the lessons as well: even when things are going badly and it feels like you have no friends, keep being a friend to others and that friendliness will not let you down in the end. For it’s true. Just as Owly’s perseverance in showing love to his neighbours wins him some fast friends, so too might your children’s own friendliness net similar results.But really, as true as these things are, none of them adequately describe this charming little book.[image]At the end of the day, perhaps the best way is to reflect the simplicity with which the book itself is composed. Owly is a very short, very cute book that is probably enough to warm even your heart—if warmth is something to which you are at all inclined.[ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,not set,"Jul 25, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/196924.Owly_Vol_1

I had heard a lot of good things about it both from friends who adored the bastardized American release fifteen years earlier, Warriors of the Wind, and from friends who regularly sought out Japanese fare. Weeks earlier, I was able to get ahold of a Hong Kong set of all of Miyazaki’s works up to that point and was slowly working my way through the collection. When I finally arrived at Nausicaä, I was very excited, having saved the best for last.Long story short: it sucked. Or at least it did in my mind at the time. The problem was that I was still too much a purist, too much a fan. It’s an issue that I’ve mostly sewn up in a burlap sack for disposal into the nearby lake, but at the time my disappointment in the cinema realization of Nausicaä was tremendous. The source of my complaint was that I had read Miyazaki’s manga by the same title. Two works, both named Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind. One was a masterwork, an epic adventure fraught with complex characters, intrigue, and a sense of grandeur; the other was just a movie.I’m sure that I would have loved the animated film as much as anyone else had I not read Miyazaki’s collection of the story in comics form. The problem was that once I had immersed myself so deeply into a sprawling world in which characters were built as if human, with multi-layered motivations, histories, cultures, and customs, the film version almost had to suffer by the comparison. Nausicaä, for many, was an example of Miyazaki’s directing and Ghibli’s animation style in top form. But for me, fresh from what I considered to be one of the best examples of the comics medium, there was no way for me to see the film as anything but a sad, incomplete replica of what was a staggering work of genius.[image]Granted, Miyazaki was only one-quarter-finished with the story (in comics form) when he made the animated film version of it, so there’s no way it could have the depth of the graphic novel. Granted, it would be impossible to convey even a fraction of Nausicaä‘s story in a single two-hour film. Granted again, I was an overly-invested simpleton at the time, a purist through-and-through, demanding that film versions of beloved stories be faithful adaptations of their source material. It wasn’t a happy way to live, being constantly disappointed by product that didn’t hold its source as valuable as I did. Fortunately, I’ve been healed of my purist tendencies. Maybe I’ll one day be able to approach the cinematic Nausicaä with new eyes. But for now, I’m just happy to reread the original.The story of Nausicaä is robust. It travels a lot of territory and the narrative terrain shifts constantly. The story at page 100 is different from the story at page 200 is different from the story at page 300. Et cetera. Miyazaki keeps the reader off-balance, constantly renegotiating what his story is actually about. In the hands of a lesser author, Nausicaä would seem a confused jumble of ideas, an evolving puzzle its own author could not solve. Fortunately, and I think most of the world probably knows this by now, Miyazaki is among the best storytellers of our age. It shows in Nausicaä. The sureness of his authorial footing in this book is never at doubt. From beginning to end, we are on his ground and it’s a good place to be.[image]Nausicaä tells the story of the post-cataclysmic Earth, a millennium after its destruction by the hands of a weaponized robotic army (presumably created by mankind herself). Humanity has barely survived the nuclear fires that tore civilization apart. The earth itself, polluted beyond its ability to heal in a normal manner, has given birth to a terrible new forest. Called the Sea of Corruption, this roiling swath of strange new flora means death to those that it engulfs, for its air is unbreathable. As land becomes more and more scarce due to this growing threat, wars break out and the future of humanity is threatened all the more. In the midst of this, Nausicaä, a princess of a small outlying tribe, seeks to unravel the mysteries of the Sea of Corruption while negotiating a dangerous path between two warring nations. The princess herself is a mystery to all those she encounters, part chaos, part mercy, and always navigating her own path.[image]This scene ends pretty much how you might guess.For those familiar with Miyazaki’s films, the art will seem a familiar prototype, an early version of what would become the Ghibli house style for the next thirty years. In tone, Nausicaä probably closest resembles the sometimes violent action and environmentalism of Princess Mononoke (though those that weary of that message shouldn’t be overly put off by its expression here). The story is long and many panels are more text than imagery as Miyazaki attempts to sensibly exposit his narrative. The tale requires patience and perseverance, but it rewards its pursuers. There are a number of great adventures told through the comics medium, but Nausicaä is so far—and pretty easily—the best of show.[ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,not set,"Jul 25, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/844349.Nausica_of_the_Valley_of_Wind_Vol_1

Ignoring the matter of interpretation, the biographer still has to grapple with the reality that Biography is always a tricky thing to pull off well. Ignoring the matter of interpretation, the biographer still has to grapple with the reality that there are not really any such things as brute facts. The biographer is never simply representing What Happened, but instead puts forth a version of what happened—a story that conforms more or less plausibly with the ultimately unknowable way history actually spun itself out. [image]In my response to Christopher Frayling’s biography of Sergio Leone, I wrote:Oh, certainly in the abstract sense, there could exist some ultimate record of events free from the colouring of memory, vanity, or nostalgia, but that would require an impartial, omniscient observer. And biographers, even if they had access to such an impossible (barring the metanatural) source, probably wouldn’t wish to make use of it for fear of losing some of the more outrageous possibilities in the unveiling of their respective subjects. See, the thing of it is: biographers are every bit as much storytellers as Dickens or Gaiman or Hemmingway or Stoppard. They not only have a responsibility to the historical record, but perhaps more importantly, they are beholden to the attentions of their readers. The occupation of a straight fictionalist almost must be easier—for the simple novelist may take a story in any direction and pace it in a manner that will drive readers to continue until story’s end. The biographer, on the other hand, is more like a film editor who has to craft a compelling story with found material he had no hand in creating. So it’s understandable that biographers might take some license with the truth.As if truth and history even belong in the same sentence.Chester Brown, as he unfurls the history of Manitoba’s founding rascal-hero, carefully chooses which directions to have Riel’s story take and which paths the man should tread. Often in his research Brown is confronted with conflicting reports, some from recollections published well and many years after any of the involved incidents. As interesting as Riel’s decisions and circumstances are, it may be still more fascinating to chart Brown’s own choices as to which of these to portray—and how.To this end, Brown supplies the reader with a gratifying section of endnotes, in which he is allowed to explore questions that his straightforward narrative is unable to ask. He will often use this as an opportunity to show how the history he presents is an amalgamation of reports conflated again with fictionalization to help the story spring to life. As an example, Brown shows a scene in which historical figure Thomas Scott and several others beat a Canadian aboriginal named Parisien. Scott, in the scene, is unhinged and savagely hacks away at Parisien’s head until he is dead. Brown, in his endnotes, discusses the seemingly straightforward scene:During the beating of Parisien, “Thomas Scott was particularly vicious; he struck Parisien on the head with an axe,” Siggens, p. 154). Still, my depiction probably exaggerates Scott’s viciousness. I don’t know whether his axe hit Parisien once or many times. The way I’ve written the scene virtually implies that Scott alone killed Parisien, and in reality it’s likely that the murder was more of a group effort. Neither Sutherland [another casualty] nor Parisien died immediately. Parisien lingered “a few days” (Howard, p. 159), “several weeks” (Bumsted, p. 153), or “a month and a half” (Siggens, p. 154) before expiring. (Stanley (p. 106) agrees with Howard, while Siggins is corroborated by Charlebois (p. 64), who gives Parisien’s date of death as April 4th [Brown in this book has Parisien die on February 16th].This is just one example among over a hundred. So Brown is forthright about his biographer’s role in the fabrication of Riel’s historical record—and really, that just makes the work that much more intriguing. Knowing that the author is not bound overly by, quote-unquote, historical fact draws more attention to Brown’s skill as a storyteller. He is unshackled enough that he can tell the story he is going to tell in the way he wishes to tell it. And while there is certainly some subjectivity at work, I can say that at least from my reader’s perch, Louis Riel is an unqualified success.With its abrupt and overly simplified style, Louis Riel is able to present Riel’s story in a way impossible for a prose novel. Visual space is used to create story beats, punctuating decisions or underscoring the humour in a given situation. Entire conversations, discussions, and arguments occur over two or three panels, with dialogue as spare as Brown’s art. The pacing and storytelling is excellent throughout. Brown attributes the drawing style he employs across the book to his love for Harold Gray’s Little Orphan Annie. Hollow, pupil-less eyes float detached in wide-open faces. Brown’s rendering of these historical figures is iconic and indelible. [image]Louis Riel explores the founding of Manitoba, the insurrection by the French-speaking half-native, half-European settlers of Rupert’s Land against their fresh landlords, the Canadian government. Brown’s book follows the numerous twists, turns, and double-crosses that littered that historical landscape. What Brown accomplishes by hopping from one vantage to another, unbound by the usual narrative constraints is to draw out very succinctly just how amazing it was that Riel’s rebellion failed. At any number of points, the Métis people (Riel’s group) could have successfully stymied the unprepared and disorganized Canadian government, but always little details conspired against that fate. At times, Riel’s own personal conflicts (both with his given role and with his psychological state) work to thwart the Métis’ goals. More insidious, however, is the blunt scheming of the Canadian prime minister to force Riel into open rebellion for the sake of some lucrative rail contracts. Things could have been greatly different, but that’s not the story Chester Brown chooses to tell. And his version of things might be more compelling anyway.[image][ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,not set,"Jul 25, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/269353.Louis_Riel

Comics from the era often suffer from During the ‘90s, as comics waded in the gentle throws of evolution, the medium struggled to find its new voice. Comics from the era often suffer from some of the stylistic impoverishments that had latched onto the published form over the previous century. As the books tried to assert themselves as worthy of attention, even many of the best examples of the medium offer sore points that seem stilted when compared to the contemporary product.Appearing concurrently with Starman, James Robinson’s better-known work, Leave It to Chance is one of that decade’s better examples of comics adventure fiction to come from either of the two big publishers of American comics (it was originally published by DC). Chance magnifies that sense of the adventurous that the young ideally possess when their spirits haven’t been sequestered by disappointment, shame, and humiliation. The book’s protagonist, a fourteen-year-old girl named Chance, embodies all of what we might expect to see in a youth uninhibited by personal boundaries constructed in moments of fear and pain and discomfort. [image]Chance hopes to inherit the role of protector of the town of Devil’s Echo from the many paranormal threats it regularly faces. This, after all, is the generations-old Falconer family legacy. Her father forbids her training, hoping to pass the legacy on to a male heir (because he lost his wife to supernatural elements years earlier, he cannot brook the thought that he might lose Chance similarly). Chance, as these things go, gets into troubles and adventures regardless—half through her own precociousness and half through author-scripted circumstance. Like I said: as these things go.The story is a lot of fun and Chance is a perfectly likable heroine. Being a big fan of Paul Smith’s art since his work on The Uncanny X-Men in the early/mid ‘80s, I was happy to be experiencing his work again. Smith’s character work is elegant and lively. He illustrates a world that arrives with a certain fluidity that is missing from the real world and this serves to elevate the adventurous aspect of Leave It to Chance. Readers caught up in current themes in fantasy-adventure illustration might find his work quaint and old-fashioned, but Smith’s cleanliness of line and clear cartooning reads like a breath of fresh air to those wearied by the dark attempts at realism that have proliferated over the last decade.[image]Still, as fun as Leave It to Chance may be, there are era-centered peculiarities that readers must decide to overlook lest they become frustrated. The book is clearly a product of its time and that is nowhere so apparent as it is in Robinson’s writing. Chance's narrative is governed by thought bubbles that don’t just give insight into the hero’s thought process but serve to exposit the story with heavy-handed mitts. In one early panel, there has been a scene shift from Chance’s kitchen to an alleyway. Chance is getting out of her small, sporty adventurer’s car (she’s only fourteen but it’s an adventurer’s car, not a real one). The following internal monologue takes place in a single panel:[image]Or if you couldn’t read that well:The case file Saunders left in dad’s study said that this is where Raven was staying.Bad area. The Maze. Full of dollar-a-day tenament rooms. Whatever brought the shaman to Devil’s Echo hadn’t paid off yet. Not if this address is anything to go by.So already I’m guessing he was attacked to stop him from doing whatever he came here to do.It’s overblown and a tool from another age. We wouldn’t forgive this kind of writing in the current era, but just like we’re willing to accept the unbelievably coy boy-girl dynamic in Casablanca or the fact that certain old Disney movies and Warner cartoons were brutally insensitive to non-WASPs, if we are considerate, we may be able to overlook these slights to our enlightened sensibilities and find an enjoyable product. Leave It to Chance isn’t perfect, but it’s still quite a bit of fun and should appeal to younger readers.[ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,not set,"Jul 25, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/573780.Leave_It_To_Chance_Vol_1

Author Nick Abadzis expects that the reader is aware of the poor dog’s fate and so works pretty hard to create gravitas, to fashion a sense of impending dread. He even reveals early on that Laika is doomed and spends considerable time turning the stray pup into a hero whose loss we’ll mourn. He even gives Laika a wholly fictional back-story and lets us drop into the dog’s dreams of flying happily across the cosmos. Because a dog that gets shoved into a tiny rocket capsule is a sad thing, but a dog who’s had a hard life but dreams of the freedom of space only to die out there in blazing hot, claustrophobia-inducing quarters is a damned tragedy.Throughout the book Abadzis reminds us with a nod and a wink that we oughtn’t get attached to the curly-tailed terrier—even as he pushes us to grow acquainted with a dog of Character and Resolve, a dog whose trust in the caretaker who will ultimately betray her is absolute. Don’t get attached. Watch as Laika is so tenderly loved by the girl who can’t keep her. Don’t get attached, but watch as her new owner abuses her and then throws her in the river. Watch as she finds a canine friend and learns to survive on the streets of Moscow. Watch as she witnesses the brutal murder of her friend at the hands of an overzealous dogcatcher. Don’t get attached. But here, watch as she is entered into rocket dog training in preparation for Sputnik II. Don’t get attached as you watch nearly every human character involved become attached to her. Don’t get attached, but watch how her handlers risk the Gulag by allowing their passions to govern their words on her behalf. Watch them cry and get drunk as she prepares to unwittingly die in space. Watch her get sealed into her flying coffin. Watch as the cabin temperature rises and she overheats. Watch as Laika dreams one final dream of spaceflight, born of her final fevered delirium. But don’t get attached.Nudge nudge. Wink wink.[image]And to seal the deal, Abadzis portrays those humans who do grow attached to Laika in human terms, having feelings and lives worth our attention; those who don’t take to Laika, on the other hand, are monsters—cardboard sources of antagonism with faces caught in perpetual scowls. It’s never wise to judge the motivations of authors, but it’s easy to read Abadzis (rightly or wrongly) as a dog-lover who cannot comprehend the person who might not love dogs quite so much. In this book, sacrificing dogs near the height of the Cold War for the protection of a nation might sound like an alright idea, but that’s just because you haven’t met the dog. I can sympathize, right? but did I really need to have the idea batter me over the head and shoulders until I promised to yield to its persuasive technique? Probably not so much.So with that out of the way, why is LAIKA worth your time despite its manipulations?It turns out that the human story Abadzis weaves is actually pretty fascinating. We follow, essentially, three individuals. Sergei Korolev is released from his imprisonment in the Siberian Gulag and in his stupor-state, believes himself blessed by the moon. Decades later, we find him driven and ambitious, the lead architect of Russia’s rocket program. Under his guidance, Sputnik has orbited the globe, striking fear into the American populace and making him a hero to the Russian government. Khrushchev demands a second Sputnik for a month later and this one will be manned. Korolev talks the premier down to using a dog instead and Laika’s fate is sealed because Korolev will do anything to remain at liberty.[image]Yelena Dubrovsky is the least interesting lead from a dramatic perspective. She exists as the book’s Laika-loving heart. Dubrovsky is hired on the same day as Laika’s own arrival at the space facility and begins her work as the dog’s caretaker immediately. She works diligently to prepare Laika for whatever missions might come, helping her to recover from training in the centrifuge or on parabolic flights. She harbours an affection for Korolev but imagines that he cares for Laika as deeply as she does.Oleg Gazenko is Dubrovsky’s superior and finds his own affection growing for both the woman and her canine charge. Abadzis excels somewhat at portraying the man’s frustration with his unreciprocated feelings. Gazenko and Korolev are easily the most interesting characters throughout and watching to see how their complexities will play out was, for me, the most rewarding aspect of LAIKA.Beyond some interesting character motives and interaction, the peek into Cold War culture may be especially rewarding for those too young to have lived through the era themselves. All told, LAIKA is a good book marred only by an unfortunate reliance upon contrivance and emotional manipulation.[image][ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,not set,"Jul 25, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1641695.Laika

As a first grader, I faithfully watched Spider-Man catch thieves—just like flies. In fourth grade, I picked up my first Marvel comic on a road trip. In fifth grade, my mother took me to my first comic shop. And for the next seven years, I was wholly devoted to the superhero and the hero’s genre. I belonged to superheroes and they belonged to me. [image]It was the kind of relationship that is built on a foundation of passive aggression and enablement. The heroes would string me along and I would love them for it.And then, at long last, I grew up. Or something. That probably comes off as being a bit of snobbery, the idea that no longer being a child, I put away childish things. A.K.A. superheroes. While there’s certainly some truth to the idea, it’s probably a bit of an overstatement as well. While the superhero genre is nearly overwhelmed by childishness and pandering, this isn’t entirely the case. There are occasional examples worth seeking out and spending time with. But I will say this:Good comics that are also superhero books are pretty rare.So while I’ve almost entirely abandoned the genre, I will occasionally pick up superhero books if a) they’ve come highly recommended or b) they glow with arcane magicks. We’ve seen two recent examples of just how well Option A has worked out for me. Still, undaunted, I picked up Gotham Central for the same reason: I had heard good things about it. It also helped that the three creators involved (Rucka, Brubaker, and Lark) have also produced work that I’ve enjoyed.(I may as well also note here that I haven’t heard anything about any books conferring arcane anythings, let alone books that would glow while in the act of conferring.)So after the last two underwhelming experiences, I was a bit reluctant to try out another romp through the DC Universe. It’s not that I didn’t believe that fun or interesting stories could be told there. More, I just believed that those kinds of stories weren’t currently finding their way to audiences. But I gave DC another chance despite my reluctance and because Gotham Central is actually pretty good, it kind of justifies my opinion. See, the thing is, every character in Gotham Central, a book about precinct detectives in Batman’s Gotham, is at odds with the DC Universe. These are detectives trying to solve cases in a world where Batman can seemingly solve any crime so long as he’s given enough time (there is only one of him after all). So really, less than being the only way that families and loved ones can gain closure after a terrible crime, these detectives really just find themselves stuck in a sort of game of Cops and Batman. The goal of the game is of course to close cases before Batman does. The detectives pretty much rely on the fact that Batman will get the collar if they’re too lazy or too dense or too unlucky or too overmatched, so the book tends to play a lot on their frustrations with a game that is rarely tipped in their favour.Of course, most of this is subtext and Rucka and Brubaker rarely get mired in that aspect of Gotham Central's world, but it’s always there, always present. And it goes a long way to explain these detectives’ short tempers and overtly competitive feeling toward Batman. They all seem well aware of the idea that were there more Batmen, they would all be obsolete, unnecessary relics of that brief period of law-enforcement history when there were no indefatigable costumed vigilantes.And because this foundation of the story generally remains in the shadows—much like the Bat himself, only appearing at opportune moments to assert his presence and remind us of just whose city we’re visiting—Brubaker and Rucka are able to tell some just plain good crime stories without having to worry so much about heroes and villains. Of course Batman has to make his appearances and of course his rogue’s gallery is bound to take their part as well, but Gotham Central succeeds in keeping a lot of that noise off-screen, where we’re aware of its presence but can pretend alongside the detectives that its the normal people, the citizens, victims, and detectives who are the ones who matter. It’s all part of the game and Rucka and Brubaker are happy to help us play along.[image]“It is finished.” Batman is like a Creepy Jesus.Michael Lark, for his part as artist, is probably the perfect choice to help the reader imagine that these detectives’ cases matter. He illustrates these men and women with a subdued, sober-handed treatment, eschewing both the more bombastic fantasy-indebted artwork that people will commonly associate with the genre and the facsimile-tracings that have seemed to multiply over the last decade. With Lark’s artwork, we are much more easily drawn into the illusion that these stories matter—that were these detectives not closing cases, Gotham’s civilized aspect would quickly grind to a halt. I loved Lark’s work for its ironic insistence that we could trust what we saw.So far as the writing and storytelling goes, with but one complaint, my entire experience in Gotham Central was exactly what spending time in such a story should be. I was excited by the cat-and-mouse chase. I was involved in the wonderful cast of detectives and their host of interpersonal troubles, affections, and loyalties. I was anxious for them to solve their murders and kidnappings, if only to see them stick it to the Bat, to sneer at the Fates as it were.My sole issue with regard to the story is in regard to the hinge on which each case is solved. For all the hard work these detectives put in, the solutions they find (at least in this first volume) each rest on unbelievable discoveries, recollections, or leaps of logic. Raymond Chandler would not be impressed. Rather than reasonably deduce a perpetrator’s identity or whereabouts, these detectives come across their answers by what amounts to narrative magic.[image]And as much as that disappointed me as a lover of the intrigue of a good detective story, it really does fit Gotham Central squarely in a universe where miracles and metanatural occurrences are a matter of course. A universe where a yellow sun can make a guy more powerful than a locomotive, where an invulnerable Amazonian warrior would employ a lasso as a primary weapon and still do okay, where a wealthy man in what amounts to a Halloween costume could keep the entirety of a criminal city in line (for the most part). In the end, even Gotham’s police force finds itself working miracles and making use of uncanny powers of observation, insight, and prediction, marking them as superheroes in their own right. In a world of Batmans and Supermans, these officers of the law will never be seen as more than just normal people, but in comparison to we readers, they are powerful examples of how in a fantasy world, even the mundane are creatures of fey magic.I very much enjoyed the three stories contained in this volume and look forward to reading the rest of the series.[ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Jul 25, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/106042.Gotham_Central_Vol_1

While the specifics will vary, my final analysis will almost certainly be the same as the last time. And the time before that. Ad infinitum ad nauseum et cetera forever and ever amen. With exceptions that are exceptional, an anthology is going to be Alright. It’s going to have a number of Good stories (perhaps some will be Very Good) and a bunch that are Just Okay and are probably only there to pad out the book’s length, and then maybe one or two that are Just Bad, stories that you’re not sure a) why they were written in the first place and b) how an editor let them into a collection that they might want readers to enjoy. That is the make-up of almost every anthology I’ve read. Of course, there are exceptions: the books that are really just mostly bad with only a couple mediocre stories to lift them from outright destitution and the far more uncommon books that are just a pile of storytelling goodness. Four Letter Worlds is neither of these and instead plays perfectly to type.The book’s organizational conceit is worthwhile. The collection holds sixteen stories (each with a four-letter title) and these are divided into four groups of four. Each group is themed around one of four four-letter words. (Literally, not euphemistically.) These are Love, Hate, Fear, and Fate. And each quarter has at least one good story and at least a couple that hit the so-so-and-lower range. Rather than focus on all the negativity, I’ll hit the highlights in each farthing and try to keep cheerful.LoveLOVE’s opener is its best effort and may even be tied for the anthology’s best as well. “Spin” (written by B. Clay Moore; art by Steve Griffen) is a pitch-perfect story of love and loss explored through a single record’s ownership. I don’t know these characters and their subculture is foreign to me, but I understood them entirely. Moore and Griffen speak across gulfs of age, gender, creed, and taste as they follow a rather clueless music lover through the lifespan of a relationship. The particulars of their narrative thread are unimportant; the evocation of the common experience is everything. Plus it helps that I love Sam Cooke.[image]LOVE holds one other good story. It’s not as powerful and may even be a little too cute, but Jeff Parker’s addition, “Bear,” is a little bit charming and as one comes to see it for what it is, recognition humps nostalgia and the reader comes away satisfied. The story mostly turns on that moment of realization, so subsequent readings won’t likely find much meat beyond that initial thrill. Which is fine—those stories have their place and purpose.HateHATE also has two good stories. “Junk” (written by Eric Stephenson; art by Mike Norton) examines the character-changing reality that divorce exerts on normally sane people. The story very much resembles a scene from Before Sunrise in that there is no action outside a couple walking from one place to another. The whole strength of the story lies in its conversational nature.J. Torres and John Bernales provide the other worthwhile bit in HATE, a small tale that comes in the form of anecdote. Whether fictional or non, “Cool” feels real. It has that half-polluted experience of memory by which we call to mind important, earth-shattering, paradigm-shifting moments and get everything wrong while still getting the most important thing right. “Cool” isn’t the story I’ll remember a year from now when the book comes to mind, but I was glad it joined the package and the book is better for its inclusion.[image]FearFEAR is the weakest quarter of the collection. There was only one story I liked and even that wasn’t a very strong addition. Even though I could appreciate the sentiment and experiment of Scott Morse’s “Mano,” it was Steve Lieber’s “Fell” that I thought best accomplished the task of helping me want to keep reading. There wasn’t really much special about Lieber’s story of a rescue-caver getting pooped on (did I read that right?), but it was well-paced and a little funny (did I mention getting pooped on?).[image]FateWhile I earlier said that LOVE’s “Spin” was probably the best story of the collection (and it probably is), my favourite would have to be Chynna Clugston’s “Anew.” I am, incurably, a romantic and stories that scratch that itch without devolving into trite sentimentalism or contrived pap will always stoke the fires of my enjoyment (note my earlier mention of and unmentioned adoration for Before Sunrise). The first story in FATE, Clugston’s diner-set tête-à-tête shows her typical strength for building relationship drama in a manner sweet yet not cloying. It’s only too bad that Clugston’s story was not posted last in the anthology for then it would have gone out with a bang instead of the whimper we get.[image]While I’ve certainly read worse collections, that’s really not a great recommendation for any published work. Some of these stories are certainly worth your time, but whether five or six decent-to-good shorts are worth thirteen bucks to you? That’s something you can take up in argument with your anthropomorphized wallet.[ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Jul 25, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/262851.Four_Letter_Worlds

Perhaps marked by th[image]Fractured faery tales and contemporary reimaginings of the classic fables have proliferated over the last several decades. Perhaps marked by the playfulness of postmodern revisitation, traditional narratives have seemed a ripe harvest for gleaning new meaning from old stock. So with Bill Willingham and Mark Buckingham’s Fables, we can’t really find ourselves wowed by the ingenuity of exploring third-millennium expressions of old yarns—after all, it’s not as if it hasn’t been done often and recently. Still, since Fables is a wonderful series, its charms must lie elsewhere from the bland ingenuity of simply traveling well-trod roads.Fables is, plainly stated, a wonderful series. It does indeed follow the figures of numerous traditional faery tales, fables, nursery rhymes, and best-beloved stories. It does indeed give them modern lives. And it does indeed attempt to interpret their predilections through a number of contemporary filters. Its successes in these reinterpretations are varied, with some faring better with some readers than with others—there have been some understandable frustrations with the fates, expressions, and motivations of both female and male characters, depending on what a reader brings to the text.Fables works well not just as Story As Story, but as a commentary on the contemporary reader. Obviously, the work says many things about its creators, but just as interesting are the reactions it provokes in its readership—whether joy or frustration or pleasure or groans or interest or rage. When embedded fans of the series will devote their time and energy to incisive critique and critical readings, that is the mark of a worthwhile read.Some readers take issue with some of Willingham’s female characters and their sometimes provincial outlook on life and on male/female natures and interactions. Others find the portrayal of Arabian fables to be stereotyped and representative of the book’s missed opportunities. Others boggle at the treatment of contemporary political matters, whether the abortion question or Israeli foreign policy. It is a powerful work that can elicit such responses from its mature readership and still garner praise from many of its detractors.[image]Fables’ foundation is built on the idea that all the faery tales and nursery rhymes that have been expressed over the centuries in our world are somehow reflections on a multitude of very real other worlds. Worlds in which Snow White and Rose Red live and breathe. Worlds in which the Big Bad Wolf roams around large and hungry. Worlds in which Boy Blue, Red Riding Hood, Beauty and her Beast, Pinocchio, and more each have full lives only hinted at in our own versions of their stories. And circumstances being what they were, these auspicious figures were forced to evacuate their fabled realms and flee here, to the mundane world.Because a grave and merciless Adversary had begun conquering their lands one after another, the fables found themselves escaped to 1600s Europe from where they then made passage to the New World. There, they established in New Amsterdam an enclave they call Fabletown. Protected by numerous spells and wards, Fabletown sits undiscovered in the midst of the growing New York City—and that is where Willingham first deposits the reader, four hundred years later. The fables have grown comfortable in their adopted homeland, leading relatively normal lives and holding jobs. Of course things are more complicated than that, but that is our introduction to what turns out to be a collection of indelible characters.Characterization is one of Fables’ three main strong points. Each fable has his or her or its surface story, the one that may be an amusing take on the legend. Pinocchio is an embittered 400-year-old in the body of a ten-year-old boy. Kind of like Edward Cullen but with a lot less sex. Beast is human most of the time, but begins falling back into his monstrous appearance as his wife’s love for him wanes. Goldilocks, married to Baby Bear, is an activist for interspecies marriage. Prince Charming, having wed Snow White, Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty is known as the town cad. Amusing, sure, but not much beyond that. And if that was where Willingham left his characters, Fables would grow stale at a rapid clip.[image]Fortunately, the stories and backstories of these fables pretty quickly begin to show some depth and thought. These are full-bodied individuals whose motives and actions begin to make sense through the perpetual revelation of who they really are. No character remains mere stereotype. And with a single exception (due to personal taste), each of these characters have become dear to me.The second strength of the series is its seemingly endless well of narrative ideas. Willingham continues to bring new and fresh developments to this company of fables and seems to actively eschew any sort of status quo. The series just hit its 100th chapter and Willingham shows no evident signs of flagging. After what seemed to be his first-act climax, I couldn’t be sure where he would take the story. It seemed as if, having wrapped up what probably could have been the series-long conflict, he didn’t have much elsewhere to go and yet even now, we’re seeing new story branches and hints of developments to come. I continue to anticipate a long and fruitful series.The other great strength of Fables is its art. And while the seventy or so James Jean-painted covers are a mighty beauty to behold, it is Mark Buckingham’s interior design work and character drawing that really pulls the series together. While many of the guest artists do well with what they’re given, I am always thirsty for the series to return to Buckingham’s hands. His art is not flashy in the overly detailed sense that has sometimes been a boon but mostly plagued mainstream books for the last two decades. He is steady and inventive and illustrates these fables with power and grace.[image]Personally, this is one of my favorite books to pick up every time a new collected volume comes out. I anticipate each new arch in the story and am rarely let down. In sixteen volumes (and one prose novel), the book has only been Not Good twice (individual reader frustrations over socio-political matters aside). Unfortunately, one of those books is the reason I have a hard time recommending the series.Because it’s the very first book.It’s pretty aggravating, but the first volume of this otherwise wonderful series—the one in which all the principal characters are introduced—is really just a mediocre book. It holds none of the charm of the later series. Essentially, whenever I do recommend the series (as I am doing now), I have to caveat by saying: “No matter what you think of the first volume, keep going and read the second one. And then the third. It just gets better and better.” Really, the next rough patch doesn’t crop up until volume thirteen,* so that’s a pretty good spread.In any case, if you’re a mature reader, I highly recommend Fables as an entertaining, thoughtful exploration of characters with whom you’re likely familiar in circumstances that are new and fresh.Notes:* I know. Others will point to the Arabian fables volume. Or the Wedding. Or any number of other points that illustrate issues that one may take up they interpret the book. And that’s fair. But, those are judgments on volumes based on personal values, not on the merits of comic-craft and storytelling. Volume thirteen is objectively Not Good,** whether one takes issue with any socio-political matters contained therein or not.** Insofar as anything in the realm of deciding whether or not you like a comic book can actually be considered objectively.[ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,not set,not set,"Jul 25, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/21326.Fables_Vol_1

Fortune favouringI’ve known several people over the years who’ve suffered on and off (usually more off than on) from seizures of one sort or another. Fortune favouring me over them, I’ve never witnessed an episode and have only heard tales secondhand. I have however witnessed several faintings. The two are not really at all comparable save for the definitive theft of control from their victims. So while I’ve never witnessed an epileptic event, I am suitably horrified by the possibility.Every person values control, and self-control above all. Children throw tantrums because they are denied control over a world that shuffles on heedless of their whims. Stereotypical mothers-in-law (and, I would hazard, all the other kind as well), bridle over the fact that another woman has usurped the office of responsibility for their son’s welfare. The lasting terror of rape is often described not as some revulsion for physical contact as such, but disgust or anger or horror at the abject violation of one’s right to control access to one’s physical self. Determinism and destiny are ideas that choke us on their callous disregard for what we want. Control is everything for us.[image]So it makes sense that David B’s recitation of life with a severely epileptic brother would stand as an unveiled monument to control. Control is the very thing that neither David nor Jean-Cristophe, the epileptic brother, possess. And in each their own way, they are desperate for it. After all, who wouldn’t be?Jean-Christophe, the elder brother by two years, begins his rather-too-short battle with epilepsy when he is seven years old. He fights for a time, but quickly succumbs. Life without control is too hard on him. He gives in to the monster who’s been pursuing him and becomes a pathetic creature and burden to his family. He is never not human, but in the end it barely seems to matter. He is rage and sloth and mania. He cannot see control existing on any horizon and so he relinquishes entirely his hope in self-control to the end that he might become a burden on those who spawned him, exercising at the least a measure of control over the lives and schedules of his caretakers.David, our Virgil on this descent into the heights of madness, is little better off than his brother. He is five when catastrophe hits his family with tidal force. The next fifteen years of his life are governed by his brother’s monster and his parents’ wild, grasping attempts to destroy it, or at least placate the beast. David is determined to fight and come out victorious. He will not give up control, even as it is wrested from his grip. He retreats to fantasy worlds, where he might gather strength enough to lay a siege in the real world. He makes his home among dreams and daytime imaginations, steeling himself against real monsters by governing those of his own creation. Fantasies being no match for the terrors of reality, he finally retreats to the last and weakest bastion of the truly defeated: a deep and abiding cynicism.[image]Epileptic, in many ways, is less the story of Jean-Christophe and more a cathartic journey by which David B can finally rid himself of his dreams, his fantasies, and his cynicism. And more than anything, it may be his way of finally exerting control over his life by coming to terms with the fact that he holds no control over such things and never will. It’s a powerful and compelling journey if one has the patience for it.David B brings rigid control over the medium to bear as he tells his story. His power over the page is evident and his illustrations do everything to bring Jean-Christophe’s monster to life. Every page is tightly composed and dripping with ink. Some of these pages must have taken days to construct for all their detail and weight. Panels are busy with totems and arcana, filled with the ricochet of aberrant ideologies and failed solutions. Animals and warriors and skeletons and totems and signs and wonders fill the skies of the world David B illustrates. These shadows dance to convey the darkness that all at once swallows his entire family only to digest them piece by piece.[image]Epileptic is terrifying and needful, boring and important. Portrayal of the syndrome is devastating, chilling readers with a possibility that is so far from expected that it can’t help but shock. In his own work* expressing the broiling dread that he feels from his own family’s monster, Steven T. Seagle saysYou have to be willing to spit in the eye of fate to have a child. And you have to be willing to accept whatever comes your way. But what if the kid doesn’t turn out like you want. There’s so much responsibility in those little eyes looking back at you for so many answers.There is no way to truly understand epilepsy or its power over the human frame, yet such explorations as David’s graphic memoir are essential. Epileptic incarnates the intangible and gives voice to the unknown. One may not come away having liked Epileptic but one absolutely retreats from the book with empathy, not just for Jean-Christophe but for the family his monster routinely decimates as well.Epileptic was not necessarily a book I liked. It was, however, a book that is important to read. David B is incredibly talented and the history of his family’s cyclical relationship to his brother’s condition is defiant and essential.[image]Notes*Seagle’s book It’s a Bird is, among other things, about Huntington’s Disease and the oppression its presence lords over the family of its victims.[ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Jul 25, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/39916.Epileptic

While the men of the household nap (after leaving the women to clean up the meal’s remains), the women banter and gossip, releasing the tensions of days and weeks and lifetimes as they speak. Catharsis through ribald storytelling. The topic never veers even once from stories of sex and the veiled sexuality of the last several decades in Iran. These are women of Tehran, several generations, and the lives they’ve led are each unique in their own ways. These women have struggled under a society that in some ways doesn’t value women as we do in the West—that is, as individuals with rights and hopes and dreams and desires. Their histories and choices have been hard and sometimes deeply unkind, yet as they unburden themselves, their souls find laughter.[image]The work is rather inconsequential so far as plot and character are concerned. Satrapi seems content to leave this as a series of Polaroid moments, an anthology of brief visits into the lives of women whose sexual history is sometimes dumbfounding, sometimes tragic, and almost always humourous if one is willing to find the humour in the horrors of a repressed culture’s sexual hang-ups. For instance, what about the elderly woman who though long-married and the mother of four has never seen a penis? Or the girl who feared her new husband would discover she wasn’t any longer a virgin so she took a razor to their honeymoon bed and had it all go wrong? Or the girl who married an old man when she was thirteen years old? All the conversations are fairly explicit and that’s really a breath of fresh air when one considers the world these women inhabit.[image]Despite being a rather inconsequential book in all the ways we commonly judge these things, there’s still something rather valuable in the telling of these stories. Readers, especially Western readers, are given window into a world beyond their experience, into stories that aren’t the mere fabric of imaginations but are the foundation of real lives. These women are not just the butts of Embroideries' jokes, they are its lifeblood. It’s only because they are real that any of this book matters. That these stories are veritas is what grants them their gravitas.[image]And yet, the title still remains to me a mystery. Are these women’s sexual natures revitalized by the surgery of words? Not really. I suppose one could stretch things a bit and say that their circle is stitched tighter by the histories and embarrassments they share, but that’s still a bit unsatisfying. Or maybe the tight bond formed through their catharsis renders them refreshed and immune to the intrusion of men? Grasping here. Or perhaps there was something lost in the translation (from French to English) and I’ll just have to leave it to the realm of mystery.[ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Jul 25, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/435951.Embroideries

I was a good fielder and good enough at bat that my coach called me Secret Weapon (I guess because I was reserved enough so that you wouldn’t expect me to have a swing?). I loved playing the game. It was spectating that I hated. I’ve always been that way. Some people are born without the sports gene, I was born without the spectator gene. [image]Because of this, I never paid attention to stats or scores. The existence of an ESPN baffled me and that my brother would religiously listen to sports radio appalled me as much as my unflagging interest in comics probably scandalized him. And more to the point, I would never indulge in sports fictions. Whether the movie was about baseball or football or basketball, I would avoid it. If friends were gathering to watch Field of Dreams or Basketball Diaries or Friday Night Lights, I would politely absent myself and play some videogames or read some books. Books that weren’t about sports.So when I say I adore Cross Game, a series which is rather unapologetically and blatantly about baseball, you should read in your tea leaves that this is a comic worth reading. Tasseomancy being infallible and all.[image]Also, when I say that Cross Game is about baseball, you should also probably (and rightly) assume that it’s also about much more. Certainly there is a lot of baseball. And there’s some nice family dynamic going on. And there’s some stuff about friendship. And some romance (yay!). But more than that, Cross Game seems to be about the power the deceased can hold over those who remain.[image]So vaguely spoilery but very early in the series, there is the tragic departure of a primary character. I know, you’ll now be completely on the lookout for which charming figure will buy it, sending the rest of the Cross Game world into the deepest despair. Trust me when I say that I didn’t ruin anything and the death is well telegraphed in advance and that in the end it doesn’t even matter because the important thing is not that this character dies. Instead the book is about what those left behind will do with their loss.And it has baseball.One of the things that is somehow necessary to post-funeral catharsis and the fulfillment of promises and the honouring of last wishes revolves around baseball. So these characters who might have only had marginal interest in the sport beforehand are now drawn tightly together, bound up in a memory. And consarnit if I don’t find the whole baseball endeavor fascinating.[image]In these first two volumes (which contain five regular volumes’ worth of story), the team forms, finds its first feet, and experiences its first major challenge. The team is founded on three kids who have gradually become friends over the four years since The Death and two of them especially find their drive torn between living for a memory and living for the future. Adachi, the creator, essays these scenes wonderfully, balancing heartfelt drama and a sort of madcap humour. And despite the fact that I shouldn’t find them interesting, the baseball scenes have been absolutely riveting. Adachi, by playing the drama of the game against the more relatable human drama, conjours a story that’s engaging and exciting. I cared about the outcome of not just the game but of each inning and the plays that comprised those innings—not because I cared for the sport, but because of what each moment meant for and would say about the characters involved.I believe there are six more volumes to be released (the series is complete in Japan and is only now being released here) and, lifespan permitting, I will absolutely be here for each one of them. And I don’t even like baseball.An Extra Note of Discussion:I was happy to see that the book generally stays away from the cheap and vaguely misogynistic gratification of the book’s demographically pubescent-male readership. There is very little of what might be considered fan service. Apart from a couple scenes in which a character, Aoba, dresses down to underwear (which may be contextually justified and are far from titillating) and lead character Ko’s observation of the hint of a girl’s underwear while riding an escalator (again, contextually justified), there is only a lone upskirt shot that seemed out of place. But, that’s within the narrative itself. The chapter breaks feature art capitalizing on one character or another in pose or action, showing off their character traits. For instance, Ko might be pitching or batting or concentrating hard or maybe just standing there with a glove in his hand and looking pleasant. Maybe it’ll feature the unstoppable clean-up batter from the varsity team looking suitably menacing. Or maybe it will feature Wakaba or Aoba (two sisters) in some way.The curiosity is that Aoba, when she appears, will frequently be drawn in a way that markets her as attractive. She might be wearing a school swim uniform or those very short gym shorts that appear in all the anime. Maybe she’ll be sporting a bare midriff and wearing denim shorts with the top button undone. And maybe she’ll be posed in a very lightly seductive manner. None of it is very extreme, but I did find it a curiosity.[image]Beyond the typical marketing concerns, which would propose that young men generally enjoy seeing good-looking women in their entertainments, I wonder if there isn’t a meta-narrative purpose to the choice as well. Aoba’s character is early on established as something of a tomboy. She changes clothes down to bra-and-panties right in front of Ko, a fourteen-year-old male who has already been established to have a lightly lecherous streak, and he doesn’t bat an eye. From these clues, the average reader might be excused from thinking that Aoba is unattractive. However, later reactions from others say this isn’t so, introducing a measure of cognitive dissonance in the reader. The plain, textual reading is that Aoba is an attractive girl but that Ko has rendered himself unable to see her in that way (at least up to the end of volume two). So, if there is to be romantic tension later throughout the book, Adachi needs to sell Aoba as someone who is desirable. Thus the seemingly out of place flirtations with fan service.[ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,not set,not set,"Jul 25, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8536796-cross-game-1

Or maybe there were but I was just too blissfully ignorant to notice. It’s not like I was especially popular. It’s not as if I wasn’t kind of nerdy or kind of artsy or kind of freaky. I mean, look at me.[image]Yep. This is exactly as rad as it looks.It’s more just that I never felt as if I couldn’t, if I had wanted to, talk to someone and have them not snub me outright. Maybe it’s different in other schools around the country, but according to my experience in Orange County circa 1990, school-based YA lit just doesn’t ring true.Generally speaking, of course. There are always a few works of the genre that don’t play to cliché. Thankfully, Anya’s Ghost avoids most of the usual traps of the form. There are even moments when I found myself gleefully surprised at a direction in which Vera Brosgol would choose to take her story. Anya’s Ghost, as one may have guessed by now, is about three things. A girl named Anya, high school shenanigans, and, of course, a ghost. So really, the joy is in the details of how the story all works out rather than in the genius of any of the three parts on their own.[image]Life Lesson #1: Don’t fall down pits in the park. Just not as healthy as you’d imagine.In the first place, Brosgol works hard to make Anya a character who very easily could be weird or strange or unwelcome but isn’t. She’s a typical teen from an immigrant family. She herself is an immigrant and by her word we learn that she’s worked very hard to compensate for her inauspicious country of origin. She’s overcome her accent, acclimated to the cultural diversity of young American life, and doesn’t dress like someone who’s just discovered clothes. (Apparently dressing like someone who can put together a plausible outfit is not something immigrants can naturally accomplish?) She’s also embarrassed by her native culture and goes to lengths to distance herself from that which will mark her as Foreign. Sometimes that means shortening an obnoxiously difficult-to-pronounce last name and sometimes it means forsaking the other kid from your country who hasn’t quite overcome his eager-foreigner tendencies yet.[image]It happens…In a lot of ways, Anya’s Ghost explores the same cultural experience Gene Yang looks at in American Born Chinese, the barrier between being true to our own identity and being accepted by the world around us. While Yang’s protagonist gets a perm and imagines himself white, Brosgol’s Anya is determined to be assimilated. Both books speak gently to the threat of alienation, to the social stigma attached to not fitting in. Both works, in the end, admonish the reader that fitting in isn’t the be-all, end-all of human—let alone high school—existence. And best of all, neither book comes off overly preachy in their lessons, which is always nice for stories that contain overt morals at book’s end.[image]Young women, know this: your fears of turning out to look like your mother are well-founded. Age is a terrible, terrible thing. It must be stopped. The world needs a new hero.Brosgol uses as much care with her exploration of the high school drama as she does in keeping her protagonist well-rounded. She doesn’t travel the typical lazy storytelling route of dividing the school into neat compartments. There are no jocks, nerds, cheerleaders, skaters, goths, or loadies in evidence here. There are no Heathers. Instead, there are just kids. And these kids have their social connections, but they aren’t divided down lines so plain as Extracurricular Interest. Anya has one best friend, an Irish girl named Siobhan, but she seems on friendly (or at least neutral) terms with most people. Dima, the Russian-extracted goodie-two-shoes, doesn’t pal around in a herd of nerds but simply offends on his lonesome. And Anya’s as-yet-unreciprocated romantic interest, Sean, is not the leader of the popular kids. He’s just a good-looking guy with a good-looking girlfriend. These are realistic persons forming a realistic net of relationships.And as for the ghost, I’ll refrain from talking too much about her, simply because her role drives the story. We’ll just leave it at this: I was surprised by what Brosgol did with what could have been a terribly cliched device. And that I could be so pleasantly pleased speaks highly for Brosgol’s product here.[image]I dated a girl once with haunted cleavage. Well, okay, no. I didn’t. But pretending I did makes the whole thing seem more worthwhile.In fact, the entire package is just extremely well-conceived. The art, while cartoony and fairly simple, is just about perfect. Brosgol employs a style that reminds me of Andi Watson’s work on later Skeleton Key (maybe crossing volumes 4 and 5), which is just a fantastic place to start. The panel composition is fluid, well-pronounced, and tells Brosgol’s story without any difficulty. It’s all very clean and tidy—and in this reminds me of Yang’s ABC. As well, Anya herself is drawn in such a way that we can see she’s a bit off from the cultural ideal but still beautiful on her own. It’s primarily her own lack of confidence that keeps people from noticing her.So far as the writing goes, Brosgol treats her characters with respect and even when she’s not giving them whip-smart repartee, she at least keeps them from speaking like imbeciles. This is trickier than you might imagine in the domain of YA lit. Consider the best-selling Hunger Games. Or the better-selling Twilight. Dialogue is hard. Smart or believable dialogue is harder still. Anya’s Ghost pretty much nails this. (It’s not Raymond Chandler, but really, what is?) [image]The ghost has a point, I guess.Prior to this work, I was entirely unfamiliar with Vera Brosgol or her work. Even now, I don’t know if she’s created anything else. But based on Anya’s Ghost, I plan to check out whatever bibliography she has as soon as this  posts. I am now a fan.[ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,206,1,not set,not set,"Jul 25, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9615347-anya-s-ghost

I have certainly encountered him in movies, television shows, essays, and other pop-cultural artifacts, but I have not read his cases and have no firsthand experience with his interlocutor, Arthur Conan Doyle. So when I speak of A Study in Scarlet as adapted by I.N.J. Culbard and Ian Edginton, you’ll kindly bear my context in mind. I cannot speak to their faithfulness to their source material but to the quality of their final product alone.[image]For the most part at any rate. It is an impossible task to approach this adaptation entirely unaware. Sherlock Holmes is, after all, one of the great and lasting protagonists of the English literary canon. He may not play part in literature in its capital sense (i.e., Literature), but everyone knows him as surely as they are acquainted with Captain Ahab or Tom Sawyer or King Arthur himself. So of course there is a certain fondness and familiarity built into the experience, and in approaching this adaptation there was a sense of anticipation, a curiosity to see just how the great detective would appear in this new iteration.[image]I don’t know the cadence of Conan Doyle’s work but if it were anything like the narration that Edginton puts into the mouth of Dr. Watson, then I can pretty easily see why people came to enjoy Holmes’ adventures. Watson is an able raconteur and his telling keeps readers at enough of a distance from the detective that the easy intimacy of the comics page never threatens to bring Holmes too comfortably close. The dialogue present seems smartly chosen and it’s not difficult to imagine that any holes stem not from Edginton’s work as editor/adapter but from the source itself.[image]Culbard’s illustration is almost universally plausible. There were moments in which Holmes was examining a thing or two and I wished he had chosen to represent the object of Holmes’ scrutiny. I suspect that in the end it didn’t matter because I suspect that Conan Doyle was less interested in giving readers a fair mystery to unravel than he was in creating an indelible hero for the next century. Raymond Chandler, in his essay, “The Simple Art of Murder,” says that “Doyle made mistakes which completely invalidated some of his stories, but he was a pioneer, and Sherlock Holmes after all is mostly an attitude and a few dozen lines of unforgettable dialogue.”Holmes is not Chandler’s primary target in the evisceration that occurs in that essay, but one has to believe Chandler would be less than enamoured with the mystery laid out in A Study in Scarlet. It may be a product of the adaptation, but Holmes finds a number of clues that he keeps to himself until he is carrying out the Unmasking. Still worse, however, is that while off-camera, Holmes makes a phonecall and discovers essential information, which is not revealed until the midst of the discussion concerning his solution to the murder.[image]In some ways I was frustrated that here was a mystery whose solution could not be logically inferred because we, the armchair detectives, found evidence withheld from us. All the same though, the depictions of Holmes and Watson and the rest are competently accomplished and Holmes especially carries with him an intriguing demeanor that pushes the reader forward on a journey of literary discovery.

Leukemia, cancer, some horrible incurable disease that causes the body to slowly shut down. It happens. And it's always distasteful. And Cyril Pedrosa made a comic about it.It's times like this that the term comic is grossly inadequate as a descriptor of what it hopes to describe.I am the father of a young daughter and the possibility of losing her haunts me. It's completely unreasonable. I live in Southern California and the probability that my daughter will at least get a full two decades of life is ridiculously high. I know this. And yet every morning I wake up and wonder if this will be it, if this will be the last day I get to enjoy my child. The thought is ever only fleeting and I don't spend my days weighted by a morbid gloom, but nonetheless the fear exists and is powerful enough to assert its presence daily.[image]One might reasonably presume that I would suffer some trouble while reading what amounts to a story concerning, principally, a father's reaction to the news that his only child will soon die. I didn't. And it may be to Pedrosa's credit that I could read through what should be some morbid, morbid stuff without curling up in a ball and hating the world for what it does to unlucky families.Three Shadows, for all its heartbreak, really is a wonderful work. Pedrosa's art is dynamic and assured, balancing a deep naturalism with necessary storytelling chops. I want to see more of his work and I want to see it now. His visual sense more than compensates for how little dialogue wanders through his book. Certainly Pedrosa uses words, but more often than not, he simply uses his pagework to bring texture and life to his story about death.[image]Any work about such a darkly emotional topic will find itself hounded by one great threat: the danger of becoming a cheap, sentimentalist ploy. A full ninety-three percent of movies about dogs fall into this trap. Easy manipulation. Contrived heartbreak. Formulaic beats. As Hollywood shows us at least yearly, hammering on heartstrings to get a reaction and jerk some tears is child's play for even incompetent writers. Pedrosa could have gone this route and let his artwork trick us into thinking we were reading something great and whelming. He, fortunately, is better than that.Three Shadows cloaks the misery of an unpreventable death in an almost faerytale garment. Joaquim doesn't start coughing up flecks of blood or feeling unbearably lethargic or getting shockingly sudden headaches that knock him off his feet. Instead, he one day sees three dark riders, watching him from the distance. While at first they simply seem to ride off, causing his parents to laugh off their concerns, the family soon finds that Joaquim's every movement is haunted by these dark horsemen. Lise is petrified and torn apart by her inability to care for her son. Louis, a man of tremendous power, is broken by his inability to protect his son. And quickly, Three Shadows becomes an exploration of how two parents might react to terrible news.Pedrosa's book balances between whimsical, fantasy elements and the darkness of real-world tragedies, delivering something closer to a meditation on impending loss than a critique of how one might deal with such an inherently counter-rational experience. Despite its subject matter, Three Shadows never threatens to be more than one can take. If anything, its lessons are delivered gently and with deep empathy.[image][originally ed at Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,45,1,not set,Mar 2011,"Mar 24, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1823114.Three_Shadows

Spiegelman tries to understand his father's place in historical events from a place divorced locationally, culturally, and historically from the world in which his father formerly lived. In Vietnamerica, GB Tran unveils his own association with a family history of which he was almost entirely ignorant. His work seems to owe a substantial debt to Spiegelman, at the least in that Spiegelman prepared readers to engage in this kind of story. Yet while Maus primarily focuses its lens on the experiences of those who lived through Hitler's Germany, only sprinkling in occasionally Spiegleman's own reaction to the unfolding story, Tran's Vietnamerica nearly wallows in the author's journey from ignorance to enlightenment.And does so greatly to the book's benefit.In the book's opening pages, Tran's father chides the author for trying to judge things in Vietnam from a vantage of ignorance: ""You can't look at our family in a vacuum and apply your myopic contemporary Western filter to them."" In a way that Tran likely intended, the entirety of Vietnamerica can be read as an exploration of how to become liberated from such myopia through actively seeking revelation. Heartbreaking revelation, sure, but revelation like this, if it doesn't sour us completely on the human animal, can build us into the beautiful people we might be. Certainly the Tran who wrote Vietnamerica is a more careful human being than the Tran that exists on the page.[image]Vietnamerica features a host of people who are simultaneously sympathetic and unsympathetic. Tran himself comes off in his younger days as apathetic and neglectful, caring little for whatever lives his parents might have had before they become the monolithic individuals he seems to see them as while he is growing up. His father is gruff and unrelenting, stoical and stereotypically demanding. His mother is argumentative and embittered by an American dream that turns out to be just another hard life. And yet his mother not only has reason to have been disenchanted and reason to be upset with her husband, but Tran shows that she is not just the caricature he concocted of her in his early twenties; after all it is through her own careful, passionate, and invested narration that much of Vietnamerica's story unfolds. His father, in the end, is so much more than the broad stereotype he seems to inhabit and Tran's investigation into the man's inner character (in part aided by his mother's narration) reveals, like the father suggests to the author earlier, that a one-sided perspective is inadequate for discovering who people are and what moves them. Even Tran himself does grow up—the publication of this beautiful book being primary evidence to his maturation.[image]Beyond just the reading, Vietnamerica is a joy to page through. The illustrations are well-composed and the colours pitch perfectly with Tran's narrative chase across a fairly complex historical journey. I first encountered Tran in 2003 when I chanced upon the Xeric-awarded short-story Content. Not only was the story intriguing but his page compositions were inventive and well-designed. With Vietnamerica Tran continues to work to his strengths and the book has so many wonderful pages that any number are noteworthy representations of what a great creator can do with a page.Despite the fact that, and I have said this a number of times over the years, I'm no great fan of memoir, sometimes authors can pull off something both interesting and worthwhile. GB Tran accomplishes these with Vietnamerica—the first by simply presenting an interesting story in interesting terms and the second by crafting something of a critique of the common Western gaze that is neither pedantic nor patronizing but, almost as if by accident, simply is. Vietnamerica is worth your time.[image]And it's probably unfair to say, what with the author having just finished such a major work, but really: I can't wait to read what Tran does next.[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,not set,"Mar 17, 2011","Mar 21, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8501710-vietnamerica

It helps that Thompson's art is beautiful and that she seems to really have a taste for painting animals. It helps that the book, while displaying a sense of humour, always takes itself seriously. It helps that the creators know how to give their suburban environs an atmosphere of danger. And it helps that I can't wait to read about these dogs' and cats' future investigations into paranormal research and defense.[image]And that's really what it comes down to, right?

Slow Storm is a pretty even blend of good and bad elements—and this elemental counterpoint so strongly governs the book that it may not be worth speaking about the short work in any other terms.[image]The art Novgorodoff employs is a strange sort of bugbear in that it represents both the best and the worst the book has to offer. To Slow Storm's benefit, the painted colours set both mood and stage wonderfully. Novgorodoff's colour sense is, especially in the land- and skyscapes, extraordinary. To her credit, she uses the art to convey certain non-abstracts in abstracted ways—giving the men who ferry immigrants over the border surreptitiously the literal heads of coyotes and having the corrupted immigration police ride around on the backs of pigs. Her penwork is loose and gives the story a fluid sense and demonstrates through immediate, visual terms the lack of rigidity that her story will hold throughout. Negatively, however, her loose character-work prevents her protagonists and their supporting cast from being able to express the things the reader (and Novgorodoff's story) requires of them. It can often be difficult to get a visual sense of why characters are speaking the words they offer. Further, apart from some special moments (like Ursa car being enveloped in radio static), there seems little sense of visual storytelling. I like that Novgorodoff is escaping traditional cartooning here. I just wish it actually worked better than it did.[image]The writing is lean and dialogue short. And while silence can convey moments of great depth, here they only serve to alienate the reader. It is fine that Novgorodoff doesn't delve too deeply into the animosity she feels toward her brother (that stuff rarely comes about in any way that a book like this could explain without sounding pat), but there is so much ambient chatter that any movements within characters are lost. Too little is said so that when characters do speak, it is often unclear what they are trying to communicate. It's as if the world of Novgorodoff's Kentucky is verbally delinquent. And maybe that's how the real world of Kentucky really is, but if Novgorodoff wants to bring me in as a tourist, the experience will be better assimilated if certain communicative dissonances are soft-peddled.Storywise, the book's strong point is Rafael's immigrant experience. Anything that doesn't involve him in Chiapas or him crossing the border into America falls rather flat. This may be because the verbal and visual inadequacies already mentioned hinder the storytelling or it may be simply that Ursa's story is dull. It's never quite apparent what the significance of tornadoes and horses are beyond the facile explanation given near the story's climax (was there a climax?). [image]Basically, from a rather stilted conversation, we come across the idea that if you are afraid, the storms of life will destroy you—because life, like horses, can sense your fear and your fear terrifies them. Or something like that. Though why that is important to the story is unclear. If Ursa fears anything that took place before the barn fire, it's unclear what it is. There is some sort of rejection in her of the feminine ideal, a rejection perhaps spurred by her own physical proportions, and that clearly causes some anguish (not that we can see it in her character, only in her actions), but beyond that?At the end of the day, I'm glad I got the chance to look at Slow Storm's art and visual choices, but I'm sad that I spent a whole lunch hour doing it. And isn't that just the saddest thing to say about a book that clearly took its author a fair amount of time to produce?[ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,not set,"Mar 03, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3340847-slow-storm

The shadows loom large and dominate the frame. The dialogue is sparse. And the book is about an artiste. Which almost guarantees angst, self-doubt, and a large cereal bowl-full of mopiness.[image]Tch, artists.The thing is: Sturm uses his protagonist's preoccupation with both artistic excellence and the recognition of those with taste to tell a quietly powerful tale of brute pragmatism versus the more fanciful propellant of idealism. Market Day, for what it offers, is a nearly flawless presentation. With the exception of one admittedly key event (that was difficult enough to interpret that my wife and I—both astute readers—differed on our belief of what Sturm intended), Sturm does a fantastic job laying out both the geographical and psychological landscapes his story inhabits.Mendelman is a craftsman par excellence, a weaver of rugs with a sense for developing abstract ideas into a rug's design. His thread count is high and his design-oriented eye sharp. He abandoned working for a lesser manufacturer and purchased his own loom for love of the game. He believes in beauty and believes that beauty, being inherently valuable, ought to be worth more money.[image]The typical collision between art and commerce forms the central conflict of Market Day. Mendelman is on the cusp of first-time fatherhood and goes to market to profit from his creations. He is already nervous about the prospect of his new responsibilities and is plagued by dark premonitions of his wife's death in childbirth (he, like the stereotypical artist, is something of a drama queen) , but what will happen if things do not go as expected at market? As the clouds of pessimism gather, Sturm allows us to spend more and more time in the tumult of Mendelman's psychological morass.Though the book is pare in both line and word, Market Day provides rich fodder for thought and even though he sometimes plays to stereotype, Sturm gives the reader the pleasure of a novella that finds its deep root in the soul of the human experience. Though Mendelman's fears are not my own and his interaction with them is an experience quite unlike my own, the character is accessible because of his humanity and intriguing because of his quirks.[image]Despite the one ambiguously presented instance (which occurs in the emporium for those who're wondering), Market Day is a laudable creation from and admirable creator, and well worth the small investment of time required to finish its ninety-some pages.[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,Feb 2011,"Mar 03, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7633404-market-day

One was pretty great and the other was Batwoman: Elegy. This is not to say that Elegy was bad. Unfortunately, it never actually gets better than pretty good. [image]The Rucka-penned adventure comic certainly has some worthwhile moments and Williams' art is varied enough to impress, but the book has several problems that prevent it from being better than it could be. But let's put the problems on hold for a moment to focus on what the book gets right.[I suppose some caveat should be interjected here. I am pretty much entirely unacquainted with Batwoman or Kate Kane (who plays Batwoman in the comic book adaptation of her life). I've read a couple Batman books over the years, so I have a tacit understanding of his mythology. I know enough about Cassandra Cain and Barbara Gordon to know about their relationship as Batgirl and Oracle (though I don't know if they're still maintaining those identities). And I remember a couple years ago, there were some news items about a Batwoman who was a lesbian and that she was somehow involved with Renee Montoya, a lesbian Gotham cop that I vaguely recall from the animated Batman series from a few years back. So there. That's it vantage from which I'm approaching the book. Those thoroughly embroiled in the Bat-universe might have appreciated the book a lot more than I did.]So yeah, the good. Well for one, J.H. Williams III is quite evidently a talented illustrator and designer. The page layouts are sometimes wild and abstracting and sometimes tame and straightforward. Which I imagine is meant to reflect the mood or era of that portion of the story. Which mostly works. Mostly. More on this later.What else is good? Rucka's story (somewhat), as well as the section on—You know what? No. *sigh* I'm sorry. I. I can't do this. The book was crap. It had moments that weren't but those were smothered the sheer weight of the rest of the book's abject silliness. It was a frustrating experience made more frustrating by the praise the book had received. Okay, so I'm going to talk a little specifically about some things that might count as spoilers (even though its their inclusion in the book at all that spoils Elegy), so be forewarned. No seriously, don't read any further if you don't want the mid-book Plot Twist exposed. Alright, good?[image]Kate Kane has an evil twin whom she thought was dead. And is the book's villain. And speaks only in quotations from Through the Looking Glass.[Okay seriously? I really shouldn't even have to continue this . I'll grant that I'm not really familiar with the kinds of stories that Batman fans have to put up with, so maybe this kind of thing is commonplace and readers have long become dead to the sense that what they're reading is stupider than Twilight or even The Da Vinci Code.] To be fair, Rucka tries really hard to build some emotional resonance into the twin thing, even if he doesn't do anything to make it sound even remotely plausible. He doesn't quite succeed, but at least he put the effort in. So yes, Batwoman's dead sister comes back to haunt her dressed as an adult lolicon version of Alice. She keeps a poisoned razor blade under her tongue, but you wouldn't know it for how much she talks. And amusingly enough, we're never given the slightest indication of a) why she's alive, b) why she's attacking Gotham/Batwoman, or c) why she quotes Through the Looking Glass incessantly. If Rucka was going to include a dead twin who quotes Alice, then those are really the only three things that I, as a reader, care about. Even if they aren't answered in this book, I at least want to see it hinted that the answers are out there.[image]And you know what? As much as I've read people praise Williams' art in Elegy, his heavily designed pages actually work to hinder the reading of the book. Especially in the segments when Kate Kane is doing her Batwoman thing, there are a number of two-page spreads. The problem is that Williams often leaves no indicators as to the order in which a reader should approach the panels on these pages. He's not consistent and so I often found myself reading the book in the wrong order. Which, as you can imagine probably, is obnoxious.*sigh* Okay. Let's end this on some positive notes. Here are a list of the things about the book that worked.• Scenes in which Kate Kane mills about in the civilian world, interacting with a stepmom she resents or a society she feels at odds with. If Rucka and Williams wanted to do an indie comic about a lesbian woman in her early thirties and the day-to-day trials of life she'd have to go through, this would make a good start.[image]• Kate's dismissal from military service for her homosexuality under don't ask/don't tell is rather well done and is perhaps The emotive moment of the book. Moreso than even the flashback in which we witness the death/supposed death of Kate's mother and sister.• Kate's relationship with her dad. This was fairly well done for a superhero book and we get to understand just how a father could assist his daughter in becoming a masked vigilante.• Batwoman's nipples presenting through her bulletproof and knife-resistant body suit. Just kidding. That was as stupid as it sounds. Though not as stupid as the twin thing.[image][Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,not set,"Feb 28, 2011","Mar 02, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6911529-batwoman

Consider yourselves warned.[imageLet's get this out of the way up front: Daytripper may be the best graphic novel I've ever had the pleasure to read. Consider yourselves warned.[image]Perhaps Daytripper's biggest success is that it saves itself from being cliche. All the things that people want to say about it (e.g. ""The book is life-affirming"" or ""The book shows that death is just another part of life"") are exactly the kinds of things that could be said about that new movie that you don't want to see, the one that is bound to be an oasis of sentimental schmaltz in the desert of valuable storytelling. Daytripper could have been one more lazy expression of what we all want to believe despite ourselves and despite the present evidence pouring incessantly from every media faucet, namely: that life is worth it.That's what Daytripper could have been. Instead, Fábio Moon and Gabriel Bá actively work to suppress cliche and to reign in formula. At least I imagine that they worked hard at it, because they deliver such a completely compelling work that I have to imagine bloodied sweat staining everything in their vicinity save for the gorgeous art. Daytripper is moving without contrivance or manipulation. And that right there is something.[image]In trying to pin down the crowning achievement among all Daytripper's perfections, I find myself struggling. There are so many wonderful things about this work that to attempt to elevate one above the others seems juvenile, a task for children who aren't really concerned with absorbing the book for what it is. So then, let's speak broadly.As mentioned, the art that fills and wraps the book is just wonderful. Through the pen and the brush (tools I imagine have been used here), the creators craft a world that is wholly believable, one that holds as much life as the characters that inhabit it. The set designs are so varied and detailed and appropriate that it becomes easy for the reader to just pass by never considering the time and thought that went into planning these breathing environments. I would recommend all readers take an hour after finishing the book and just flip through the pages and take in the world of Daytripper without the press of narrative or dialogue or exposition or monologue hurrying attention on to What Comes Next. It would be a shame to miss what Moon and Ba have done here.[image]The degree of life invested in these characters and—specifically—into our protagonist is something special when one considers that we are only given ten short chapters with which to acquaint ourselves with those who comprise the world through which Brás (our protagonist) explores his own life, purpose, and meaning. Well before the final page, Brás feels like a character fully revealed—as if, were the creators to free him from the shackles of the page, an attentive reader might be able to predict the course of his life. Or at least write a believable excursis on one's own. It is to Moon and Bá's credit that I never felt that I had been handed a stereotype or stock character. Both art and writing conspire to build a portrait of an individual in whom the questions of the world populous might be asked.With all the talk of life-breathing characters and art, it may be inevitable that some mention be given to the life-affirming nature of the work. I am hesitant here only for the fact that I find it may be impossible to, in some small paragraph, describe the nature of the book's accomplishment without resorting to the cliches that Daytripper ably overpowers. [image]Certainly, the book expresses a rounded philosophy that presents life as something both valuable and worth pursuing. And argues not according to reason or the comparison of premises but by simply presenting the stories of Brás' life. Daytripper asks a single question relentlessly. It demands answer from every moment of life, from the big to the small. What was this life and how shall it, in death, be valued?Brás is occupied as the writer of obituaries and it is through this peculiar vantage that his own story unfolds. It is established early on that death is a part of life—perhaps largely so that we might get that out of the way and begin exploring what that precipitates in a meaningful way. Through the book's constant return to the obituary, we are able to gradually piece together a philosophy of living, a valuation of lifespans. Moon and Bá present a carefully constructed yet simple meditation on what it means to be us and how life, death, and society conspire to bring meaning to the purposes we may invent for ourselves.[image]Brás' answer may not be your answer, but respect must be given to his search for and then development of that answer. Fábio Moon and Gabriel Bá have done the literate society a boon by allowing us to explore these questions alongside Brás, allowing us to take part in his life while he discovers its directions, purpose, and passions. This is something I do not do but: I recommend that everyone read this.[bookclub discussion guide][ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,231,1,not set,"Feb 10, 2011","Feb 16, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8477057-daytripper

The Immonens share a kind of creative chemistry that generates some of the most worthwhile comics to be produced (see: Never As Bad As You Think. Granted, for the most part, comics have only been producing worthwhile works in the last twenty years, so the competition is a bit limp compared to other media.[image]That said, Moving Pictures is a fantastic little book. A novella of sorts, exploring the interrogation of Ila Gardner, a young Canadian curator of third-rate art in German-occupied Paris, by Rolf Hauptmann, a member of Germany's Military Art Commission. The Commission is tasked to retrieve famous works from the French who have squirreled the works away to prevent the theft (and possible destruction) of their art. While the single interrogation comprises the backbone of the story, the Immonen's add depth and explanation via multiple brief flashbacks.The story is well-told and exhibits its creators' mastery over the medium.

Whether Bryan Talbot's intent or not, One Bad Rat became one of the arguments for comics being a medium of communication worth the same level of serious consideration as literature. Or if not literature, then at least the same sober reflection that cinema could garner. In a way, that's kind of an unfair burden to saddle upon the slim graphic novella.It's not that Talbot's exploration of abuse and homelessness and the by-turns-villainous-and-kind nature of the human animal is in any way bad, because it's not. It's more just that the book, as good as it is (in its way), doesn't do very much to prove the medium. It hints at possibilities and broaches potential, but it doesn't carry comics quite where they would need to in order to be taken seriously. Though I will grant that in 1994, this was a good step forward in the evolution of the medium and it's not as if One Bad Rat doesn't contribute anything to the argument.One Bad Rat does two things for the medium. It presents a serious issue in a dramatically plausible way and it incorporates literary allusion in a largely worthwhile manner.Young and homeless teen protagonist Helen plays refugee from two abusive parents, trying to muddle her way through a world that cannot make sense to a mind scarred so early and deeply by counterfeit love. Over the book's first half, Talbot offers an empathetic look at how life outside of a home might play out. It's a heavy read, though not so heartbreaking as it could be, largely because Talbot keeps the real problem off-screen and unspoken for most of the journey. Certainly there are allusions to the sinister throughout, but the true horror of her situation is never laid out gratuitously.[image]Beyond this, Talbot not only makes Helen an ardent fan of Beatrix Potter (her life and works), but skillfully uses that character-interest to build his story. Helen sees things in Potter-esque terms. For much of the second half of the Tale, she is accompanied by a human-sized rat, functioning as silent confidant. That Helen would grasp onto Potter's history and millieu so strongly makes good sense in the world of Talbot's telling and it gives one the sense that One Bad Rat is something more than just one more trite examination of abuse. Beatrix Potter becomes a talisman for Helen, one by which she hopes to find the strength to grow beyond her terrible past.And it all almost entirely works. Almost.The first problem is likely less Talbot's fault and more mine for not having the patience to read dialogue that is written in dialect. One Bad Rat takes place in Britain (specifically in the city and in the lushly-illustrated environs around where Potter wrote her own famous Tales) and some characters speak with one variety or another of British English. And Talbot writes his dialects out phonetically. This is problematic, especially for those readers unfamiliar with the ins and outs of various dialects. It only takes a few moments, hopefully, for a reader to understand that ""gel"" is just an abhorrent pronunciation of ""girl,"" but those moments serve to interrupt flow and create a distance between the story and the reader.[image]There is of course the possibility that this was Talbot's intent and that Helen herself is having the same difficulty understanding these persons as we are—though she never lets on that this is the case.The other problem is the final device: a Beatrix-Potter–style tale designed to show us Helen's growth and vector for rehabilitation. It's a good idea and is worked into the story well and believably, but it was pages longer than its use merited. The writing was, I suppose, a reasonable facsimile of Potter's style (though perhaps approximating one of her lesser stories) and reframes Helen's arc in a sometimes-amusing fashion. Still, it just seemed to go on and on and in the end probably wasn't worth the effort. (For Helen, it obviously would have been, but she's still just a kid and even kids who become adept at copying their favourite tales or art styles rarely have the discipline to know when to reign in their excesses.) [image]Apart from these few complaints, the art is marvelous and Talbot excels both in his depictions of landscape and his framing of scenes. Even (and sometimes especially) his quiet contemplative scenes pack a subdued dramatic power due wholly to the particular vantage he grants the reader. All told, a good book that suffers for the burden that had been unfairly placed upon it as the medium developed (much the same as with Spiegelman's Maus).[ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,Jan 2011,"Feb 10, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3185881-the-tale-of-one-bad-rat

Generally, their shtick gets a little long in the tooth well before the halfway mark and the same would have held true for Far Arden had it not gradually developed into a compelling story with decently well-realized characters.Following Army Shanks, a man ""as cold and unforgiving as the Artic herself,"" author Kevin Cannon treats the reader to a bizarre journey through arctic locales and jaw-dropping onomatopoeia. Shanks makes his way through fishing villages, queer universities, and frozen islands (which apparently actually exist in that nefarious and frigid land known as Canada) along with an entourage of friends, enemies, and former friends and enemies. All to the end of finding Far Arden, the mythical island whose discovery has devoured the lives of almost every principle character in Cannon's book.[image]Throughout the book Cannon skirts the border of believability, never quite falling into a world that jibes with reality, but never going so far into fantasy that we don't understand there are certain mortal rules common to both our reality and his. Relationships tack as they do in our world, those mauled by polar bears don't get up, and ambition can kill. That said, there are golden narwhals that will direct willing sailors to paradise. So, you've got that going for you.And then there's the humor.[image]Despite the fact that Far Arden offers a compelling (?) cautionary tale of broken promises and unrelenting ambitions, Cannon makes certain that the driving force of the book is its sense of the humourous. Nearly every page holds something amusing, especially moments catering to those of absurdest sensibilities. Cannon's use of inventive onomatopoeia alone makes Far Arden something worth picking up—even if you don't end up liking the ending.So yeah, the ending. It might make you mad or it might just make you furious. Or maybe it will confuse you. Or maybe, after a moment's thought, you might just find that you actually liked the ending and that Cannon prepared you for it more than you thought. Or maybe you'll read it and think, Huh! and then remember that part with the polar bear and the man-sized bite and promptly forget that there was even an ending at all.Whichever side of the apparently controversial finale Cannon prepared that you find yourself, I think most everyone should be able to sit back and think: yes, that book was worth my time. If they like, they can even pretend the epilogue didn't exist!_____________________________________For those curious about the sloppy-ish art style of the book, Kevin Cannon apparently began the book as part of an extreme 24-hour comic experiment—instead of creating a whole 24-page comic in a single 24-hour sitting, he would perform a year's worth of these sittings to create a single, large book. That lasted for four months, so each of the first four chapters were created in a discreet 24-hour period. After that, he adopted the same style but slowed down his pace to one chapter per month though not in a single sitting. (I believe the time allotted shows.)Far Arden can be read in its entirety (and for free) online at http://www.kevincannon.org/288hour/_____________________________________p.s. (In Which I Spoil Things)(view spoiler)[I actually appreciated the book's conclusion, even if it initially caught me off-guard. I thought Cannon was saying starkly what he had been saying obliquely throughout the prior 368 pages.From the outset, we discover that Far Arden destroys lives. At first by the possibility of its existence, then by the certainty of its existence, and finally by the experience of its existence. The end is foreshadowed by much more than Fortuna's quotation of Lawrence Oates and the book's gathering darkness shows a steady increase as it goes: deaths are first played for laughs with characters we don't know (Flue), then move into heroism (Anger), then to tragedy (Amber), and finally to meaningless.

""Tales from"" collections usually present a mishmash of stories varying in quality from good (very rare) to mediocre (very common) to downright bad (uncommon though unfortunately not so uncommon as good stories). My fears were largely unfounded here.  [image]Mouse Guard: Legends of the Guard sidesteps the major pitfalls of the format nicely. While, as typical with these ventures, there were a number of middle-of-the-road stories ranging from fun to occasionally ineffectual, there were also several good stories and nothing that would fall into the realm of bad. The art and writing, of course, vary depending on creator; and while none of the artists exceed the expectations readers have learned to hold having experienced Petersen's vision of Mouse Guard (some of it is downright cartoony and feels out of place in the world we've become accustomed to), the writing occasionally exhibits more depth. As each of these stories are being told by mice of different histories, personalities, and circumstances, the difference of story texture is absolutely plausible—I think my only complaint here is the art in ""A Mouse Named Fox"" (cute story, but the art is just too plain).  [image]The standout stories from my vantage were Jeremy Bastian's tale of the beginnings of the Mouse Guard, Alex Sheikman's emotionally satisfying story of a mouse king and his faithful steed, Lowell Francis and Gene Ha's reminiscence of a heroic mouse banker (told, of course, by a mouse banker!), Guy Davis' wordless entry contesting a critic versus the artist of his scorn, and finally Mark Smylie's adaptation of King David's historical epic of treacherous penis-think. Most of the other stuff is fine, but only these stories come close to meriting the erasure of a bar-tab.  [image]But (!) far better for the package than the stories themselves is Petersen's method for tying them together. Petersen uses the well-worn tavern storytelling trope in which a number of visitors to a tavern spend the evening swapping tales (in this case, the winner will have their bar tab cleared). The conditions of the telling: one tale per customer, the tales have to be partial truth and partial fabrication, and the tavern proprietress can't have heard the tale before. It would be easy to use this bridging technique and have it fail. Credit then to Petersen's grasp of character and the life-breath of his small world that the tavern-goers interaction with each other is so endearing as it is.  [image]And as an added bonus that most readers will likely skip over but really worked to win me over, Petersen gives summary of the Mouse Guard legend that inspires the art adorning each chapter's title as well as that of the collection's cover illustration. And these four (not including the collection cover) episodes adorn the walls of June's tavern and can be glimpsed throughout the book's segues. It's a light touch that really serves to embellish the world these mice inhabit and give it a sense of history and depth.  [image]All in, an enjoyable break from the main story. I would have preferred the next book in the narrative instead, but these were fun enough that I'll welcome the next volume of Mouse Guard legends despite its interruptive status....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,Dec 2010,"Dec 15, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8522794-mouse-guard

Context: Katniss has been confronted with a girl who had her tongue cut off as punishment and remembers seeing her years earlier just as she was caught. According to memory, as the girl was dragged away, she screamed. Now years later and in the present, Katniss wonders: ""The girl’s scream. Had it been her last?"" Because people without tongues apparently can't scream.We'll get back to this and what it tells us about Suzanne Collins.To start things another way, I'll admit this: I had no interest in Hunger Games until, upon hearing someone actually describe it, I thought: ""Holy smokemonsters. That sounds like an American rip-off of Battle Royale."" From that moment on, there was little that could stop me from diving straight into Suzanne Collins' derivative little world.[image]See, Battle Royale was this Japanese movie (adapted from a book I haven't read yet—Christmas, anyone?) in which the government, for inexplicable reasons, takes a class of thirty highscoolers every year and dumps them in this jungle-y arena and demands they fight to the death with a single victor remaining in three days lest the explosive collars they all wear be detonating, rendering no survivors. I mean, what's not to love, right?So Suzanne Collins basically takes this idea and expands it and tries to give the story a more plausible explanation. (In the movie, the Japanese government televises the BR in order to, get this, quell youth violence in the country. I know, right?) Hunger Games takes place in a post-apocalyptic North America. There is the ruling State, the Capitol, and there are the thirteen vanquished American colonies districts (or twelve since one has been destroyed). For the last seventy-four years, the Capitol has demanded the sacrifice of a teenage boy and a teenage girl from each district to remind the districts annually of how miserably their rebellion failed and to keep them mindful of how absolutely the Capitol rules every aspect of their lives. I don't know, but this strikes me as being only slightly more sensible than the Battle Royale justification. Apparently government officials in the future are as dumb as they are today.In any case, the beauty is that these two sacrifices from each of the twelve remaining districts are not just killed outright, like on an altar atop a stone ziggurat Aztec-style. No, that would be too easy. Instead, they fight in televised survival games (inexplicably called the Hunger Games). These are wildly popular (like I'm told Survivor or American Idol used to be), especially with the Capitol crowd and contestants take on a form of celebrity and their stylists are princes and princesses among men.  [image][art by the stupendous Vera Brosgol]So Hunger Games is the story of Katniss and Peeta,* two sacrifices from District 12. District 12 is the loser District. Katniss is a hunter (advantage) and Peeta is a baker's son (disadvantage). And since Peets has had a massive, sad, stalker-crush on Kats since they were, like, five, he is determined to keep her alive forever. Interesting dynamic when, Highlander-style, there can be only one. This is basically the same thing that happened in Battle Royale, so it was a comfy place to be.Seeing how Katniss is going to get out of one scrape after another is exciting and the three books are compelling enough reading that I finished the whole thing in about nine days. (And by ""about nine days,"" I probably really just mean ten days.) As demonstrated in the above, the writing's not fantastic by any stretch. Collins suffers from a typical need to over-dramatize, to the point where irrational things are treated sensibly. But (!) it's still a league-and-a-half better than Twilight, not that there isn't much that isn't better written than Meyer's delicious collection of vampire doggerel. I only compare them because they both occupy that meta-genre of light, compulsive reads that others may better know as Summer Reading. And yet, here we are in December! Regardless, I was several nights up far past my bedtime letting Collins plot have its way with me.And for the most part, I really enjoyed the experience. There were very few lulls, most of which occurred in the first fifteen percent of books two and three as they tried to recover from the burst of excitement that capped off the immediate predecessor. The mediocre writing is entirely forgivable simply because the books not about that. Hunger Games is almost pure plot, so that's really all we should be expecting from it. Still, there were two major difficulties I ran into while reading.The first is that the narration's kind of a cheat. Collins tells her story in the first-person present, meaning that we are supposedly getting new information at the same rate as Katniss is. Yet, the things this (largely clueless) girl chooses to report lead one to believe that she has future knowledge. She drops a ton of hints about the importance of the mockingjay, is constantly reminding us that she's wearing her mockingjay pin, and won't stop narrating about how the bird or its image is showing up everywhere. As a reader, we pick up that this is massively significant (because she beats us over the head with it), but since Katniss in the present she's narrating doesn't realize that, there's no reason for her to continue to point it out. That would be like you telling me about your day and stopping every five minutes to remind me that you're wearing your Chuck Taylor's and then after three months of this, Chuck Taylor's suddenly become sentient, rebel against humanity, and then install you as their king. Unlikely, at best. So narrator-Katniss knows everything while narrated-Katniss doesn't. It's a poor choice.Collins almost certainly chose the first-person present because it builds tension (FPpresent is a standard usage in thrillers), but she wanted to be able to use things like heavy foreshadowing, which can only honestly be done in first-person past tense or in the third person. With FPpast, you're almost assured that the narrator survives the climax (save for narration from the after-life), so you're missing the kind of tension and intimacy that the present tense can deliver. Third person stories leave any character open to plot-driven dismissal, but they lack the immediacy and intimacy of the first-person.The second is less tangible but perhaps the more serious offense. At this point, things may get vaguely spoiler-y so those who haven't read the books yet may wish to skip the following paragraphs and just end the  here.So then, in comics, a trend has been noticed. It's been going as Women-in-Refrigerators syndrome for lack of a more exciting term. Essentially, it describes authors' propensity to abusively use female characters to prompt character development in male protagonists. The bottom line is that it doesn't pay to be a female character in superheroland because you'll inevitably wind up raped, maimed, tortured (in a sexy way!), accidentally killed off, murdered, or dismembered and stuffed into a refrigerator just like Green Lanterns girlfriend was—all for the sake of motivating the male lead in some direction or other. Of course, in the male-dominated world of the superhero, female associations are one of the hero's greatest weaknesses and the best way to really stick it to him.[image]Since the lead of Hunger Games is a teenage female, in order to commit a similar abuse, Collins can't just use other male and female associations to give Katniss the gut-wrenching motivation she needs. So then, what is frail in comparison to a teenage girl. Children. Specifically, little, sweet girls. Collins uses little girls twice (once in Book One and once in Book Three) to give her protagonist a human side that is otherwise unseen. Collins realizes that her hero is just a little too cold and too distant and so she must find a way to get the reader to sympathize with her. She puts forth a sweet little girl whom you'll come to find endearing and wise and beautiful and in need of protection from the dirty, cruel world that Collins has crafted and, of course, what's more painful than watching that little girl be destroyed for the sake of a melodramatic tug at one's heartstrings.Kat cries and does something heartfelt and we think of her as human again. At least for a little while. And then we realize that this was the entire purpose for this character in the scope of Collins story and then we feel abused. These were never meant to be character; they were always only a means to humanizing a character that Collins didn't have the chops to humanize in a more talented way. I was a bit grumpy when Collins used the tactic in Book One, but when it reared up again in Book Three, the books became thoroughly diminished in my eyes. I felt abused by Collins' contrivances.For this reason, I lower what would have been (meta-genre in mind) a four-star book series down to three. It's still good and worth the read (unless you have more important stuff on deck), but Collins disrespect for both her characters and her readers lessens their value._____*note: Suzanne Collins should not be allowed to name anything. Not books, not characters, and certainly not real-life children. The one bit of silver lining here is that thankfully, this almost assures us that in four years we won't be babysitting a gaggle of brats named Peeta—apparently Bella was uncommonly common after the Twilight wave surged....more",Notes are private!,0,37,1,not set,Dec 2010,"Dec 10, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7938275-the-hunger-games-trilogy-boxset

The former was a winsome, compulsive read. Miyabe played with familiar fantasy and JRPG tropes using a wholly believable protagonist and did so with beauty and confidence. It was almost impossible not to enjoy her 800-page entry into young adult fantasy. Heroes has likewise been strangely shelved in bookstores' manga sections. It wasn't fitting for Brave Story and it wasn't fitting for Heroes. And unfortunately, similar treatment may wind up giving readers the impression that Miyabe is extrapolating on the same riff here.Which is where we come to the obvious collage of reader disappointment. Expectations can be brutal. And I myself expected this new novel to be something at least in similar vein to Brave Story. I was, however, fortunate to be mistaken.What Miyabe does with Heroes is just fantastic. It's not nearly so compelling a read as Brave Story, but it's not supposed to be. Just like Crime and Punishment, Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, and Gravity's Rainbow aren't supposed to be ruthless page-turners like Twilight, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, or Hunger Games. Not that Heroes is meant to be compared with those other books either. Honestly, it may be in its own category. I don't know. I haven't read everything, but I have read a lot. I've yet to encounter anything like The Book of Heroes.Miyabe's central conceit here is her villain. Rather than something mundane like a human or horrific like a goblin king or fantastic like a giant floating eyeball of mal-intent, she chose something more abstract. I won't be surprising you here, since I mention it above, but the bad guy is story. Or more, Story, with a capital Store. It is in the narrative form itself, perhaps even Platonically, that her antagonist arises. This floored me. I found the concept so brilliant and strange that for thirty pages or so, I muttered a string of Wows and Whoas and Whats and Huhs. I had a grand time.As you can likely imagine, explaining this concept takes a boatload of unpacking. That is to say, exposition. And exposition, in most cases, is the enemy of a plot-driven page-burner. So the simplest recourse is to reclassify Heroes as something else. It's not a potboiler or adventure novel or fantasy epic. It is, instead, literature. It finds greater pleasure in exploring ideas than it does in exploring new landscapes and cultures (though it does that too). The action comes in spurts. The climax is abrupt. The plot is nearly inconsequential.But Miyabe's novel is not about those things. It has bigger fish to fry and does so with a (mostly) deft hand. To be honest, there are still a couple point upon which I remain unclear. Likely a second reading would promote better understanding. The Book of Heroes is not my favourite book. But it is a very good one and deserves its readership.

As it is though, Vaughan's sparse story is not enough to stand alone in its hardcover place on the shelf. It doesn't merit the publisher's treatment.Vaughan has two interesting things to say in the book. One (1!), through his use of lions as protagonists, we note that the nature of the beast is a ferocious and arbitrary one, both fickle and dangerous. And two (2!), the story isn't about the lions. Pride, as the play on terms in its title suggests, is about some lions in the capital of Iraq. This takes place in the early days of America's second-millennium military extravaganza in Hussein's country. The U.S. Air Force, in a show of great subtlety, is dropping bombs everywhere. All over the place. Even on the head of giraffes (good aim guys!). Predictably (if only because everything is being bombed), Baghdad's zoo collects its fair share and animals go flying everywhere. Even animals without wings. Like lions. So the lions beat feet and aimlessly wander, looking for food and a better life. They really find neither and the lesson turns out to be both trite and affecting. Simultaneously. I think this is where length and format hinder the work. Had it been a less self-involved effort, Vaughan's moral could have been on point and well-received. Unfortunately, it makes too much of itself and by the time you arrive, you just kind of stand around looking at the wasteland of Baghdad and say to no one in particular, ""Huh. Is that it?

And sometimes it succeeds.Actually, taken as a straight up mystery, it's a pretty poor example of the genre. There aren't really any clues and the only way one could come to expect the conclusion to the matter is if one is given to predicting the outlandish. So it's fortunate that Miyabe's novel wants to be something other than simple detective fiction. It's kind of like Murakami's Wind-Up Bird Chronicle in that—save for that while Murakami's beast is a literary force to marvel at, slack-jawed and stupid, while it rapes the expectation of Platonic form of Literature in order to become progenitor of a genre all its own (that of the Murakami Novel), The Devil's Whisper merely dabbles in the ethics of the psychological, and in so doing becomes, well, a suspenseful novel with vaguely literary pretensions.Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed Miyabe's tale just fine. It was slight and breezy and fun. But, well, breezy and heft are kind of natural enemies, so The Devil's Whisper naturally feels less important than some of the more valuable additions to the canon. And probably actually less important than a bus schedule.Where most readers will stumble while indulging this suspenseful little novel is in its solution. The rigourous mind will recoil in pantomimed horror at the turn of the plot, stung by disbelief that willfully fights against suspension. I'm all for a little leeway being given to fantastic explanations, but in order to absorb the finale without reserve, readers will be persuaded to make detritus of pretty well everything that science, history, and credulity have to say on the matter.That aside, the story is a terse, compulsive exploration of growing up outcast, living with regret, and escaping oneself from the hived mind. All in the guise of a mystery. And Miyabe proves once more that she's quite comfortable writing young protagonists.

The younger of the two narrative forces in Barbery's book, the genius twelve-year-old Paloma, expresses a fondness for the works of Jiro Taniguchi (specifically his Summit of the Gods).

The work is sumptuous and gorgeously rendered. And more than anything, it serves as a simple reflection on the world around us, both man-made and otherwise.The Walking Man follows a nameless protagonist as he takes casual strolls around his city, simply taking in the wonder that is found in every mundane thing. There is no single narrative arc to follow unless one considers the glorification of the contemplative life through a series of vignettes to constitute an arc. The walking man is healthy, intelligent, careful, attentive, and the social member of a loving relationship. One cannot be certain where he finds the time or by what method he carves it from his schedule because Taniguchi doesn't allow the work to even broach the matter. The Walking Man is only concerned with the Walking Man and just how much he walks.In its way Taniguchi's sparsely worded compilation of small journeys is as profound as Barbery's wordy relishment of language and philosophy is.

It was so much better than I expected, a thoroughly designed young adult fantasy that builds its strength on the problem of growing up.It's a little known fact that I find most fantasy novels to be less engaging than their real-world counterparts. Authors of fantasy, then, really have to present something special or endearing in order to get a) to finish their works and b) to be happy I did. Despite being perfectly at home with the idea of fantasy fiction (what with having grown up with X-Men and Thor and Dungeons & Dragons), I can count on one hand the number of fantasy adventure literatures that I would admit to liking:1) Harry Potter2) Lord of the Rings3) Watership Down4) The works of Neil Gaiman (e.g., Stardust and Anansi Boys)and, I guess I can add:5) Voyage of the Dawn Treader.Well folks, colour me stupefied and help me replace my hook with a more digitally inclined prosthetic because I'm gonna need a second hand.* Miyuki Miyabe's Brave Story is that good. So far as young adult fantasy goes, Miyabe's novel is far more interesting than what we're commonly given to expect. While Brave Story follows a number of familiar narrative arcs (e.g. beginning the fantasy hero in the real world before depositing him in a strange land, having him grow in strength before he has to meet the final challenge, a climax in which the entire world hangs in the balance), this book distinguishes itself on two fronts: propelling the protagonist into viable introspection and weighing moral choices in a world that is anything but black and white.The story concerns Wataru, a fifth grader who is likable enough that most people are friendly to him, but is also a bit shy around the ladies. The first quarter of the book centers on Wataru's day-to-day, his life in school, with friends, and with family. Things are changing in his life and not for the better. Concurrently, he discovers the gateway to another land, one beyond the wakeful eye, and discovers that the solution to all his problems might lie in that other place.Pretty typical story conceits, but nothing is as plain as all that. Wataru spends the rest of the book discovering both the meaning of anguish and, more, what it means to take part in the human nature. More than any external foe, Wataru must confront himself and his own struggle against what he is and will become. That a book aimed at younger readers would tackle the concepts and issues Miyabe does is just fantastic. Wataru's solutions (and in some sense therefore, Miyabe's) aren't the solutions I would find, but that he's even considered things enough to arrive at his solution makes him 258% more thoughtful than any other young fantasy hero out there.Was there anything less than lustrous about Brave Story? Certainly. One grave problem looming over the entire fantasy genre is setting. Because readers aren't familiar with the ins-and-outs of whatever land an author has crafted in a bout of world-building, authors must take special pains in describing these worlds so that readers can gain a sense of place. And the more imaginative the world-setting, the more time must be spent describing the quality of the air, the density of the trees, the geological formations, the political boundaries, the fashions, the customs, etc. All fine and good when divorced from story, but as soon as an author begins describing the world or phenomena, the story is paused. No character interactions, no story development, no ruminations on meaning or purpose or philosophy. Instead, we get saddled with the flatness of what a particular wall looks like or the way in which the half-man, half-parrot thing stands in order to keep his balance on the motorcycle geese. Or we get a description of the rules of Quidditch. Not at all fun and really just a terrible albatross to hang around the throat of an entire genre.So yeah, there's that. And though Miyabe of course has to engage in these kinds of shenanigans, she does so for a not ungodly amount of time and the rest of her tale more than makes up for what amounts to a fault in genre. All told, Brave Story might be my favourite fantasy yarn after Watership Down. And hey, you can't beat that. Since... you can't beat bunnies. Or something like that.*note: I don't really have a hook for a hand, but I'd make a dashing vagrant if I did....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,not set,"Oct 28, 2010","Oct 28, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/123557.Brave_Story

Granted, she refeEarly in Barbery's novel, one of Hedgehog's two protagonists name-drops one of my favourite Japanese comic creators, Jiro Taniguchi. Granted, she referenced Summit of the Gods, which I haven't yet read because only one volume is available in America. But still, that I would share such a rare interest with a fictional twelve-year-old girl was enough to sell me a ticket on Barbery's 325-page experiment in meaning through cultural attachment.Barbery's novel is funny and thoughtful and scattered and arty and probably more than a little bit frustrating. For me particularly, it was frustrating to spend so much time with Renée. Who I didn't particularly appreciate. But I'm man enough to admit that I don't have to appreciate protagonists to find them useful. So I soldiered on and found myself enjoying the book despite hoping that Renée would get hit by a delivery van and beat a speedy exit. By the final pages though, I found myself softening toward Renée (which was never necessary for my enjoyment of the book) and felt that was a pretty bold move on Barbery's part: to make me like the unlikable. Fortunately, Paloma was for me a joy to read. I never believed that such a child couldn't exist and I never believed that I wouldn't want to date her if I were myself thirteen or fourteen years old.* So props to Barbery for making me feel nostalgic and skeevy all at once.Also, one should note that the novel is propelled largely in the first-person present tense. In writing that is not pulp fiction, there is really only one reason to choose this method of narration and I was not disappointed to find that Barbery had used it for that exact one reason. But no (!), I fear I have said too much already.In the end, I suppose one would be forced, Central-Park-mugging-style, to describe my relationship to Barbery's exploration here as satisfied rather than adulant and interested rather than enthusiastic. For me, it mostly felt this way because a) I really only enjoyed the younger of the two protagonists and b) I couldn't be sure that Hedgehog wasn't just a great big put-on and that the characters eruditions and soliloquies weren't every bit as fake as the other inhabitants of 7 rue de Grenelle. By book's end, I wasn't certain that so many of the novel's explanations of art and artifice weren't just a collection of unconnected mini-essays that happened to fit the mood of Barbery in the instant she penned any particular chapter.Still, I found Paloma utterly fascinating and a good tool for personal self-exploration in her own right. I would gladly read a book that featured her alone, a cynical heroine investigating the mysteries of the mundane.** As well, Kakuro was a worthwhile interruption despite my early fears that he would occupy little more than the role of the mysterious-but-wise Asian figure through whom Westerners come to see the beauty and truth of the world. I mean, sure, that was his role but at least he was a little bit funny and conspiratorial about it and probably had little idea that he was saving Paloma as well as Renée.________________________*note: I wouldn't have dated her when I was thirteen or fourteen years old because I was far too shy to talk to girls (even girls I'd admire as much as I would Paloma) with anything beyond caveman grunts or spastic bleatings. I was, at that age, what is known as incurably shy. Don't worry, I got better in a dramatic sort of physician heal thyself manner.**note: Kakuro could tag along in order to help spoil the local flavour and pay for expenses accrued....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,not set,"Oct 18, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2967752-the-elegance-of-the-hedgehog

There were moments I wanted to abandon humanity in a wastebin behind an abortion clinic and others when I sat there dumbfounded, thinking Wow, humanity, you're like the most interesting people on earth. Love to hate to love to hate. Again and again.That's what books about patent insanities do to me.Underground chronicles the psychological aftermath of Aum Shinrikyo's 1995 deposit of Sarin nerve gas across several of the mass-transit trains that service the city of Tokyo. It does so primarily by way of interview with victims of the attack (and at times, family members of victims), followed both by an extended essay by Murakami himself and a post-published epilogue of interviews with members and former members of the Aum cult (none of whom were involved in or even aware of the attacks until much later).Honestly, I found myself pretty well enthralled by each discreet portion of the book despite the fact they may as well have been their own separate books. There's little thematic crossover between the three parts beyond the obvious shared subject matter, so the reader must change gears as each section bears down to become the new asphalt of the road Murakami presents.In the first section, we feel anger and fury and pain and anguish and maybe even a little terror as we read firsthand accounts of train passengers who gradually succumbed to the Sarin's effects. Murakami keeps each of his interviews in roughly identical form beginning with a healthy bit of background on the interviewee, so that we can get to know our protagonists before we watch them fall to the real-life effects of religious madness. Then subjects generally recall the day before the attack and follow up with the morning's events as they unfolded to their own particular perspective. Finally, each individual speaks about any lingering effects from the attack, whether physical or psychological, and Murakami caps the interview by asking after the victim's emotional response to Aum, to the government, to Japan. While the descriptions of the attack itself are certainly harrowing, I found the emotional response to Aum the most intriguing. Some individuals are furious (some of these going so far as to say that they would participate in the execution of Shoko Asahara if the opportunity presented itself). Some are beyond anger and strike the reader as just dynamically confused by the whole event. Others are far more detached, saying things like how they do not approve of Aum's actions but they don't understand how anger can solve anything now.In the second section, Murakami takes us from knee-deep involvement to an almost wholly detached treatment, a kind of autopsy of both Aum's actions and Japan's inability to react to it in any helpful way. This section was well-proposed but would have been better received in the original work, functioning as a bit of epilogue to the whole endeavor. As it is, Murakami's words are sandwiched between the tragedy of the victims and the eerie logic of the cultists and so is kind of overwhelmed and, so, muffled.The final section features The Other Side. Mostly. Almost to a person, the interviews in this section denounce outright the use of Sarin against the civilian population, so we don't get to hear from any of those who actually carried out Asahara's orders. Still, this final third of the book offers some powerful insights into the minds of those who would join an apocalyptic Buddhist splinter-group that would move from yoga-like practices and asceticism to hosting a militaristic, hunted paradigm. Murakami's questioning of these cult members is valuable because it demonstrates how adherence to any system of belief, whether fringe cultic, mainstream religion, or simply secular ideology can lead individuals into difficult and dangerous places.[note: I should also express my disappointment upon discovering that a good two-thirds of the victim interviews were cut for the American release. Disappointing and anger-making. As if someone consciously decided that those victims' pain was not great enough to be valuable to an American audience.]...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,not set,"Oct 18, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/229173.Underground

And, having picked it up in a casual conversation at a Thanksgiving party more than a decade ago, I may not even have that right.The idea is 1) that each person has created a complex web of beliefs that fit together in such a way as to support their perception of the world and 2) as new pieces of information are assimilated, they are woven into the web in such a way that the worldview is supported still more strongly. Recalcitrant experiences, however, are those pieces of new information that cannot be assimilated into the web and, because of this, shatter a portion of the web of belief to such a degree that it must be rewoven—a task that alters sometimes greatly the shape and pattern of that web (and therefore the worldview it supports). The end of the matter is that the worldview shifts in previously unexpected ways.Reading the work of Joe Sacco was, for me, a recalcitrant experience.Let’s go back a decade or two to my formative Christian education. I grew up in California’s premiere non-denominational denomination. Calvary Chapel, an outgrowth of (and reaction to) the Four-Square tradition, is what one might call: very dispensational. As a teenager, it was not uncommon to see intricate charts illustrating all the maddening complexities of the eschatological framework that despotically governed our motivations; much of what we did was in mind of the imminent rapture of the church and its concordant seven years of tribulation (with a capital T). And above all things in our late-twentieth-century world, there was one idea that was of the utmost importance: to bless Israel was to curry favour with God and to curse Israel was to invite wrath and judgment. And even thinking a negative thought about the nation skirted cursing Israel so closely as to be indistinguishable from it.In point of fact, the Israeli nation could do no wrong.Israel occupies a special place in the dispensational understanding of things. As opposed to covenantal perspectives, dispensationalism holds Israel and her children in such high esteem that Messianic Jews are often seen as some glorious chimera who, being Jews, likely hold the keys to interpreting all the particularly knotty issues the Scriptures hold. Maps in textbooks of the region called Palestine are edited with Sharpies to become maps of Israel. There is within dispensational circles some variety of opinion as to just how deeply those descended from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob should be revered, but in common to the last man, American dispensationalists seem to be deeply fearful of the president who finally gives in to the powers of the world and decides to stop supporting Israel.Such an action would surely lead to the ruin of the American nation. We would be cursed of God. We would flee in seven ways from before our enemies. The skies would be as bronze. There would be molds. Plural.So then, what did Joe Sacco do? The first thing and the one that affected me recalcitrantly was craft a comic called Palestine.  [image]Palestine and the Shifting Sands of ParadigmsSacco is a special kind of journalist. Over the last fifteen years, he’s produced book after book giving readers an up-close perspective of areas of the world torn by the kind of traumas that Americans will likely never have to face. At least not in our generation. Maybe in the next if they are especially unlucky.1999's Palestine was a sprawling, 288-page non-fictional comic book that chronicles Sacco’s experience in Palestine at the tail end of the First Intifada (that is, the uprising of the Palestinian people against what they considered to be the oppressive Israeli regime—this lasted from 1987 through 1993). Sacco peppers his narrative with interview after interview, speaking to both Palestinians and Israelis, though spending more time on the Palestinian side of the equation. At one point he responds to a skeptical Israeli woman who wonders why he isn’t more interested in interviewing Israelis, telling the reader that he’s heard Israel’s side of things his entire life.I could relate.  [image]Ever since I was old enough to know that there was still a nation called Israel and old enough to know that there was a PLO and Arabs and a Palestinian people, I knew that Israel was the good guy and all those nations around them were the enemy who wanted Israel dead, who wanted God’s chosen people dead. There was no way I was able to process information that might portray Israel in a negative light save to either spin it positively or simply reject it as the, quote-unquote, Bias of the Liberal Media.What? Israel attacked Palestine and a bunch of citizens were killed? Well, the Palestinians know that Israel’s policy is to return an attack with a force greater than that with which they were attacked. They should just stop attacking! What? Israel’s taking land from the Palestinians in order to house new Jewish immigrants? Well, it is their land after all. God did promise it to them. The Palestinians are just lucky the Israelis don’t act like God commanded them to in the Old Testament. What? Israel’s torturing and killing innocent people? In cold blood? Liberal lies.It’s very easy to maintain a belief system when one is immune to new information. Of course, Sacco’s Palestine hit me in a way I was totally unprepared for. Instead of railing against Israel, instead of merely exposing some of their more dubious methods of controlling the Palestinian people, it took a far more direct route. It did something I could never have expected or defended against.It humanized the people of Palestine.It did the same for the Israelis, sure, but in my mind they were already quite human. It was the Palestinians who were essentially kobolds or orcs, fantastic creatures whose whole existence was devoted to the hope of Israel’s destruction. Yet Sacco unveils a people rich in culture, grievously wronged by world powers generations earlier, and presently stuck in circumstances with no ready solution. Their populace is as varied in its opinions, beliefs, and desires as is our own. Some want peace at all costs. Some want a fair and equitable resolution to the conflict. Some want reparations. And some want war so badly that it hurts. These were people with dreams and nightmares. People governed by hope and by hopelessness.These were, whether I liked it or not, people.And so, Joe Sacco, with a single book, turned my ability to (mis)understand Israel’s place in the Middle East on its ear. Suddenly I was able to hear things I had been previously deaf to. I was able at last to empathize with the plights of my brothers and sisters who happen to be Palestinian. More, I became able to empathize with people in a vast array of cultures that had previously been marginalized by my theological framework. By the time I had read Palestine, I had abandoned dispensationalism a couple years earlier but had still retained my warm-hearted sentiment toward the Israeli nation. I can’t imagine how chaotic this shift in thinking would have been had I still held doggedly to the dispensational system.Footnotes in Gaza: A New OpportunityStill, that was years ago. And really, not much has changed in the Palestinian/Israeli relationship. Palestinians still feel oppressed (and rightly so) and lob bombs into Israel destroying the lives of random people with mothers and children and lovers; and Israelis still feel attacked (and rightly so) and shoot missiles into Palestine destroying the lives of random people with mothers and children and lovers. The tragic circle of self-perpetuated war and terror continues and my anger at both groups swells like the tides under a full moon. So why bring this up now?The thing is: Joe Sacco has a new book and I got it for Christmas. (And devoured it before New Year's.)After several excellent journalistic comics featuring the Bosnian war and its aftermath, Sacco returns once more to the Palestinian conflict. And this time he has a far more specific goal in mind. Footnotes in Gaza, at 432 lushly illustrated pages, offers a new avenue for Americans who support Israel unreservedly to experience a paradigm shift and the opportunity to experience the conflict from the eyes of those who hold a perspective unique from anything we could ever muster on our own.[image]In Footnotes, Sacco splits time between present-day Gaza (that is, 2003—these things take a long time to draw) and Gaza in 1956 where he hopes to unveil the truth behind two massacres the Israelis purportedly carried out against Palestinian civilians at the end of the Suez Crisis. In the present day, Sacco moves from contact to contact with his guide and advisor, Abed, as they seek out anyone who lived through the terrible events. Along the way, Sacco treats subjects as various as the mindset of insurgents, the demolition of Palestinian homes at the edge of the refugee camps, the sheer mass of poverty these people experience, Palestinian reaction to American interventionism, and (briefly) the death of Rachel Corrie.  [image]As he slowly unveils what happened and what may have happened (Sacco is at all times circumspect about the fact that his interviewees are all very old and that their stories oftentimes conflict), we’re given a sense of just how desperate the situation is—not for the region but for the people. What is so often lost in the news reports we hear from Gaza is that these terrible circumstances are not just part of a larger political struggle and the ways of nations, but that these horrors are the fabric from which individual human lives are cut. If not for the hand of a fate that we can neither predict nor understand, that could be my mother whose leg was blown off in the most recent shelling. That could be my daughter who was killed in a Palestinian incursion. That could be my home being demolished suddenly for no better reason than that it provides decent cover for potential insurrectionists.  [image]In Footnotes, Sacco proves that he is becoming better and better at what he does. Prior books Palestine and Safe Area: Gorazde are both fantastic treatments of their unique subjects, but with his present work, Sacco shows a lot of narrative growth. The book is hard and unrelenting and funny and insightful—and the way Sacco threads the whole thing together speaks to the fact that he is becoming a master at the craft.  [image]There have been criticisms that Sacco is too biased toward the plight of the Palestinians and that Footnotes is clearly a work of propaganda. These arguments however show that either the critics failed to actually read the work or they were so ready to assign the author blame that they missed the nuance that carries Sacco through his endeavor. The author continually remarks at how little verifiable information they have on these massacres. He notes baldly his skepticism toward a number of interviewers. He records with faithfulness the distasteful rhetoric of some of his contacts (e.g. those who wish for more suicide bombings and those who wish for the destruction of America). He records the Israeli perspective of how and why certain things happened. Or even if they happened.  [image]Joe Sacco, like everyone, has his sympathies, but they certainly should not get in the way of this beautifully rendered, thoughtful remark upon a situation that is even now tearing at the seams of the world and baffling world leaders who want to see it end but can puzzle out no easy solution.I try not to read Sacco’s books too often because they tear at my soul. My first reaction is rage and fury, but then I recall that this entire situation is built on the stuff. Rage and fury never solved these kinds of conflict. And so, instead I am overcome by grief and a sadness that I am completely powerless to protect these people, to offer them any kind of real support (beyond educating myself and those within my circles). I try not to read Sacco’s books too often, but I do read them because they are important and essential. They work to keep me human and they work to remind me that others are too. I think of the Palestinians (our brothers and sisters) who live under constant threat simply for the fact that they were born in the wrong place. I think: we can do better than this. We don’t have to be so cruel and hateful and angry and greedy and terrifying. And then, I remember history and how if history teaches us anything, it’s that there will be no end to this kind of horror save for the grave.[ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,1,64,1,not set,"Dec 29, 2009","Sep 08, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6796708-footnotes-in-gaza

Bolaño's apocalyptic pericopae within a singular pericope reminds me of Ishiguro's The Unconsoled in its happy willingness to throttle time and narrative senseless for the sake of its own greater mysteries. Only, at least, Bolaño makes his readers well-aware of this through his heroine's nagging reminders.Auxilio, whose name is a plea for salvation—for assistance, for redemption, for a crutch, for help— is the figurative mother of Mexican poets. And therefore grandmother to Mexican poetry. She bears lengthy witness to the soul sickness that has swallowed the Latin American spirit, that hearkens the doom of the Mexican verse. From the bathroom of a deserted university, purged under the bootheel of martial conquer, she peers into the past and future and cries harbinger to fey tidings, a Cassandra of ignoble heritage.Amulet is a grim recountment of the inefficacy of the Mexican poetry, that for all its strength and beauty and honesty and reality, it is despite all belief: utterly powerless. Auxilio's explication of nightmare is of course a call for help, a demand that things not be as they are and that they would be something else, something perhaps grand. Or worthwhile at any rate.The Mexican poetry for her, and one may presume for Bolaño, stands as ""the echo of nothingness."" And yet, she notes that echo is forged of songs of war and love and courage and honour and pleasure and desire. And though she sees naught but abyssal terror as the poet's end, she remains hopeful that such songs of war and love might eventually end in victory rather than centuries and millennia of loss.But not that hopeful.Amulet is a cynical and realistic work. As Auxilio begins, ""a story of murder, detection and horror""—though in a decidedly unconventional manner. By blending madness, love, sickness, and culture, Bolaño crafts an interesting and, perhaps,* provocative reading of the landscape of the poetic. And if Bolaño's critique of Mexican poetry stands, the reader is left to ask whether it might not be the case for the international and universal varieties, as well.

Which is not a bad thing.I expected a well-crafted, pulpy detective fiction, perhaps borrowing liberally from Hammett, Chandler, and maybe Leonard. And it was to be fraught with New York-ish details and ambiance. I expected it to more or less follow the expectable twists, turns, and general direction of the genre I believed it to take part in.What I got was something different. Not entirely so, of course. But different enough for me to not quite realize what I had in hand until it was all quite finished.The surprising ride Paul Auster delivered covers a range of literary and critical topics. He is never didactic in his treatments, always leaving things unspelled, with prepositions, thoughts, and motivations all dangling with great liberty. And in some cases, he is subtle enough that one doesn't even recognize what has been done until later, under reflection.There were times when I thought I was going to love City of Glass (especially in the introduction of his quadpartite character and in his exploration of the most famous ziggurat of all history). There were times when my love was diminished (especially in his conversation with his Peter the Younger). And then there was the rest of the time, when I was less concerned with what was going on narratively and more concerned with what Auster was trying to do on a literary level.Generally, I'd say being taken out of the story in order to consider the work of the story a flaw. In Auster's case here, I think it works well with what he's doing and arises naturally out of the questions he asks of his reader through the narrative chase. At the end of his experiment, I feel a mixture: I am both whelmed and overwhelmed. And perhaps in some smallish ways, even underwhelmed. I'm not entirely certain that Auster succeeds wholly in his goal, but that just may be because I'm expecting greatness and am only convinced I have been delivered goodness.But hey, goodness ain't half bad. It's probably not even a fifth.________________________[huh. my memory must be going.

I wanted time to digest it and see if I could do a better job piecing it all together, but honestly, I just haven't taken the time. I've read two novels and a pile of graphic novels since then, so first impression is going to have to do for this one.The short answer: I liked it.The longer answer: I liked it, but have some reservations, but also think there's more to it than my reservations necessarily allow. Auster eschews the conventions of the genre and offers something up that is quite different from what one might expect from detective fiction. Or at least what I expected. I suppose that in a way built of abstraction and faery tales, Auster's novel here bears some comparison to Eco's The Name of the Rose, subjecting genre to literary and (in Auster's case) metafictional concerns.From the start, Auster's protagonist takes the reader into unexpected (though entirely welcome) narrative territory as he introduces his four overlapping identities. Then the case appears and is mostly interesting due its colossal improbability. Then a tangential (though entirely relevant) excursion into historical theology, blending the established mythos with Austerian. For my money, the chapters dealing with the earthly paradise and the ziggurat of tongues (also big features in Eco's work) are the most luscious and exciting chapters of the book—and certainly the most surprising to be found in a work of the detective genre.At the end of the day, I don't know what to make of City of Glass. I certainly enjoyed it. I thought it had some awesome stuff going on in it. I found the finale intriguing and unexpected. I also couldn't quite grasp how the parts fit with the whole. With more time to consider and the possibility of subsequent readings, I'm sure much of the dissonance would be ironed out like the wrinkles in one's brain.

In fact, the book, so far as I recall can only be called a novel in a very loose sense of the term. Loose like basset hound jowls. If at all. More, it functions as a bound collection of interrelated (sometimes only tangentially so) discreet narratives that weave about the event of Petit's walk between the not-even-quite-complete 1974 version of the World Trade Center towers.I took awhile to think about it just now and I remembered that the first of these stories that didn't involve Petit was the one that I found the most worthwhile. It involved this guy Corrigan who is a conflicted monk and ministers to the local prostitute corps through donut feedings and the use of his bathroom. It's told through the narrative of his brother, named Ciaren or Cieron or something similar, and deals with some interesting applied theology, balancing the question of heavenly needs and earthly ones. I remembered thinking it was interesting at the time.There was another chapter about a kid photographer that I thought was pretty cool too. Though I couldn't tell you why.In all, my remnant impression is that Let It All Spin, Joe was competently written, occasionally engaging, a bit scattered, and ultimately hollow. Just to be fair, I glanced through the notes I typed into my Kindle and found this: ""This book is absolutely steeped in its sense of place and time.""

And with that, my .Really, my problem in ing Strout's collection of short stories is that I didn't hate it or love it. I didn't even like it or dislike it. I'm not in any sense ambivalent toward it. Save for the fact that I'm baffled by its Pulitzer status (and the other fact that I wasted countless minutes actually reading the thing), I'd say that I couldn't be bothered to care about Olive Kitteridge one way or another.So I'm having a hard time mustering emotion enough to make you care about the book one way or other. Instead, I'll just talk about some things I know.I know that Olive Kitteridge is not well-written. It's not awful stuff and is mostly competent, but it's certainly not good. Strout falls into familiar patterns of withholding information in enough of her stories that one comes to expect it. The kind of thing where she'll open with ""After Event X, nothing was ever the same again"" and then keep the reader in the dark over what the event actually was, only revealing the nature of the event pages past the point at which anyone could continue to care. She deposits point-blank iterations of Chekov's gun in stories—in one case, it's actually a gun too—telegraphing story intention with painful clarity. She does that thing that's common in comic books where a character in the midst of some unbelievably implausible circumstance remarks (with a figurative nudge-and-wink) that the circumstance is unbelievably implausible and were it not really happening, people would be certain it was the product of bad fiction. (Only she's not writing a comic book. And it's cliched and unfunny even in comics.) And she reintroduces Olive and her circumstance with tedious frequency. I realize that several of these stories were written years ago, but some editing for flow would have been awesome.On the other hand, I know that Olive Kitteridge develops its characters generally pretty well. Especially its secondary characters, the ones who inhabit the book for only the space of a chapter or less. Those are the ones to whom Strout breathes life. Suicidal Kevin, jilted Julie, infidelitous Harmon. These are the people I wished the book would have continued with. Strout builds them into characters of interest and one wonders how they might recover from their stories.I also know that if the state of Maine has the means and opportunity, they should ban Strout from entry or residency. Strout paints a picture of Maine that makes it perhaps the least likely target for any of my future vacationing plans. And I certainly wouldn't ever choose to live there if the author's portrait is in anyway accurate. Essentially, if Olive Kitteridge is to be believed, the state is built out of a) crazy and b) infidelity. I think perhaps it was only the final chapter that was free of the stuff. It got to the point where I'd begin a new chapter and sigh audibly a couple pages in and then explain to my wife that I was reading another chapter about another person whose quietly (or even not so quietly) insane.I know that I did appreciate Strout's empathy for the aged. She brings to mind several of the difficulties and problematic philosophies of life that those of advanced age may surely feel if they are a) crazy or b) miserable. Reading Olive Kitteridge brought me forcefully to the conclusion that should I grow old, I honestly will beg with my mind to be forged of neither of these two (apparently common in Maine) characteristics. This is also a book that will be popular Christmas gifts from elderly parents to their grown-and-moved children, because nothing says Christmas Spirit like 270 pages of paperback guilt trip. I also know that had this book not been assigned reading, I would have put it down after maybe the fourth chapter and probably never gotten around to finishing it. It wasn't so much that it was bad as it was just plain not that compelling a read. I never cared for the story of the title character and knowing that the side characters wouldn't be returning left me nowhere to hang my hat. And there isn't really anything going on in the book beyond the surface elements of the very-disjointed story, so Strout really needed to make Olive's character and story sing.And it just didn't.And this brings me to the final thing I know and that I've already kind of given away from the start. I know that I feel like Elizabeth Strout is an Alice Munro cover band. She's probably alright if you're a fan of the real deal but for some reason can't get the real deal. Like you wanted to hear the Scorpions play ""Rock Me Like a Hurricane"" but you're on a party boat and all you've got is Scrantonicity II to play Scorpions hits. It might scratch your itch or it might not. Of course, for those who were never big fans of the Scorpions, you'll probably be up on deck for the entire set.That's me.

And one that, when finished, fails to satisfy in aGenerally speaking, Moshin Hamid's slight novel is a brisk, enjoyable, and largely compelling read. And one that, when finished, fails to satisfy in any deeply meaningful way.And that's fine. The same could be said about The Lord of the Rings.Hamid's Reluctant Fundamentalist presents a surreal, impossible, and rather-one-sided conversation in a Lahore marketplace between a Pakistani man named for Ghengis Khan and an unnamed American. In the course of Gengis Khan's almost-monologue, he reveals that he (now bearded and a stereotypical Pakistani's Pakistani) had once and very recently been deeply engaged by the American allure. And having graduated from Princeton and been picked up by a highly exclusive and exquisitely capitalistic corporate appraisal company, he was once all about what America, presumably, is about. By conversation's end, having stretched from midday to midnight, Ghengis Khan reveals exactly how his allegiances turned, stimulated by the dual catalysts of the World Trade Center attack and the dissolution of a hopeful romance.Well before the tale's end, we discover that Ghengis Khan's story of love and disappointment is probably more allegory than history. All for the benefit of his American audience (both fictional and metafictional). Characters are named conveniently to represent ideas. There's a John the Baptist (Juan-Bautista), essentially, cleansing Ghengis Khan and preparing him for the new world he'll be joining. There's Erica, who pretty clearly represents the joys and favours and mystery and disillusionment to be found in America. There's a Chris, who represents the lost joys that the Christian West might have offered those it blessed, only now sought after through the desperation of nostalgia. Our storyteller works for Underwood Samson a stand-in both for the U.S. and for everything that American capitalistic exceptionalism stands for. As for the storyteller himself, his name is Changez (Urdu for Ghengis) and his is a story about changes.It's all very well-put-together and cute in its way, but this story tends to trample the thriller-aspect that Hamid is trying to build. In a certain manner this is not an entirely bad thing as when one rounds the final bend of the story, it is discovered that the book is less about being a thriller and more about being a pedagogical device. Hamid wants the reader to confront his or her own presuppositions and biases leaving the conclusion ambiguous, recognizing that many people's demand for story-closure will have them attempting to brute-force a finale onto the book even though no plausible ending is demanded or even hinted at.In some ways the book succeeds in unveiling the fears and beliefs of readers—if my experience discussing the book with others is any indication. However, there are a couple major faults that prevent the book from truly allowing this to take place: 1) the lamentable choice of cover art (on several of the editions) plays into Islamic fundamentalism where the ideology finds no place in the Changez's story; and 2) those wishing the American to be some sort of secret agent or assassin must be confronted with the fact that no agent or assassin would act with the naive ineptitude that Changez's potentially-furtive conversational partner displays. In all, I enjoyed The Reluctant Fundamentalist for the taut example of storytelling displayed but ultimately found it could have been better conceived, especially so far as Hamid's pedagogical, reflective angle is concerned....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,Mar 2010,"Aug 11, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/88815.The_Reluctant_Fundamentalist

For example, Foucault's Pendulum is like The Da Vinci Code for adults. The allure of this kind of comparison is at least threefold: 1) it offers a simple way to draw people in, by playing on their affection for another work; 2) it leverages against the desire to take in a more mature version of something they already like; and 3) it derides the value of the other, presumably-enjoyed work. People love to dismiss especially popular works as being childish or inane. (One would think we would overcome that need in junior high, but generally speaking, we do not.)In any case, I like many others am tempted to describe Lev Grossman's The Magicians as Harry Potter for adults. Yet do so without the condescension. In many ways the comparison really is apt. For one, there's plenty of magic and plenty of gratuitous nudity. There's a school for witchcraft and wizardry, but its a college. The students lounge around in their free time doing off-handed magics and getting colossally drunk. So, Harry Potter but for adults?Sort of, I guess. But Grossman's novel is really quite a bit more.Through a thoroughly secular treatment of the Narnian-style of fantasy worlds, Grossman unveils a story that's less about fantasy and wonder and exploring the hidden worlds that hide beneath our noses and more about the growth of human character and the obstacles that threaten to halt that growth entirely. The Magicians is, essentially, an amusingly framed bildungsroman, exploring the life and maturation of Quentin Coldwater, a young man who has just discovered that magic is as real as DNA and has been enrolled in a private college devoted to its study. For Quentin, this is an especially notable discovery, as he had always suspected magic was indeed real. As a child, he had read and absorbed the Fillory novels, Grossman's fictional answer to Lewis' Narnia. In The Magicians, the Fillory novels were a series of five books written in the twenties that charted the exploratory paths of the Chatwin children, as they flit between our world and Fillory in similar fashion to how Lewis has the Pevensies occasionally visit Narnia. Yet for Quentin, they set a seed in his mind and even at age seventeen and considering which Ivy League school to attend, he's still checking the backs of cabinets for passages into lands beyond reason.As one may presume when confronted by a character who desperately seeks a world of fantasy, Quentin is thoroughly unhappy. Though set with a future that by all conventional wisdom should be regarded as stellar, Quentin is discouraged by how desaturated the world is to his eyes. There is no joy in his accomplishments, in his talents, or in his future at Yale or Harvard or whichever school of excellence he's destined to attend. There are only two things he wants: a romance with his friend Julie and Fillory. Both are fantasies (Julie is currently with his best friend James and Fillory is the invention of a children's adventure novel) and so we get a taste immediately for Quentin's brand of dissatisfaction. At heart, The Magicians is a reflection on how we deal with depression. And the way we, as a culture (an American culture at any rate), deal with depression is to indulge in the fantasy that depression is not the correct way to understand the world. Grossman grants this and embraces it by having Quentin give up depression for Fantasy (for so long as it holds). The book struggles admirably with the reasonableness of being bored or disgusted by the world.In that sense, yes, The Magicians really is kind of like Harry Potter for adults—if only because children rarely have the context by which to understand Quentin's struggles....more",Notes are private!,0,58,1,not set,Apr 2010,"Jul 27, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6101718-the-magicians

Surprised and a little bit saddened. I'm rather surprised that The Astonishing Life of Octavian Nothing should be marketed to a young adult audience. Surprised and a little bit saddened. Saddened because I think the book deserves better and surprised for similar reasons.Octavian Nothing deserves an audience built of those who are thoughtful, empathetic human beings. And this is not the typical and immediate description by which one would first describe teenagers. Certainly there are exceptions, but those are young adults whom we would consider to be: exceptional. Definitionally speaking at the least. No, these two books deserve an audience of careful readers. Of those who are not looking for titillation or something pop or hip. These are books for those who enjoy to ferret out truth in its varied forms. For those who would value a considered approach to the historically one-sided consideration of the American Revolution and what that meant to those living in America when its outcome was still uncertain. For those concerned with the nature and history of man. These are books for readers, for those who take joy in the promise of the written page. For that reason, to market these two wonderful books to a particular age-caged demographic is a minor tragedy. Tragic for the adult who will never chance to read it for fear of wasting time on some children's trifle and tragic for the young readers who will pick it up expecting the juvenile pleasures of Harry Potter or Twilight and then put it down again in disgust, only to retain the lifelong memory that Octavian Nothing was terribly dull simply because they did not yet apprehend the means by which one could ever actually appreciate Anderson's work here.Whether Octavian Nothing is for you is a good question. I can't pretend to know you or your tastes. But I can talk about the person I think would appreciate Octavian's journey and the telling of it.This person is concerned with the state of the human creature and has at least a rudimentary care for the lives and stories of people in circumstance wholly different from anything the reader has personally experienced. This person enjoys verisimilitude in narrative voice and sees the merit in an 18th century scholar writing as would an 18th century scholar and a similarly situated soldier speaking as would such a soldier. This person enjoys rediscovering well-worn events from the fresh perspective of a vantage rarely before considered. This person enjoys unveiling grand historical ironies and is all the same troubled by the hypocrisies that such ironies must make known. This person likes to be challenged by their reading material.This is, I imagine, the person who would enjoy both volumes of the telling of Octavian Nothing's young life story. This is, in fact, the kind of person that both my wife and I are, for we enjoyed Anderson's two volumes immensely.Octavian is a young black man, a slave, recounting his youth and the years leading up to the American Revolution. He is, however, no slave of average experience. He is the subject of scientific experimentation and lives a life of relative, though strange, privilege. Still even as the Colonies are being haunted by questions of liberty and property, so too is Octavian likewise haunted—though his concern is understandably much more visceral—and approaches the well-worn concepts with a mournful grace that none of my American forefathers spent too great a time considering.Anderson's writing here is impressive. He captures the voice of the era without flaw so far as I can tell; his style is impeccable. He uses journal entries, letters, and advertisements to convey his tale and this brings a sense of immediacy to his actors' character and frame. We come to know especially Octavian and his unique perspective on the world. And as Anderson writes in the spirit of the times, his vocabulary is requisitely robust (I'm not certain I've ever been so often at a loss as to a term's meaning as I was during the course of devouring these two volumes).I can see the style becoming cumbersome for some readers, but I found it charming. There were moments in the second novel that my interest was less than stoked—as description of military engagement does little to rivet my attentions—but in all, I'd say this was a superb work. One that asks questions of philosophy and faith that merit consideration....more",Notes are private!,0,82,1,not set,not set,"Apr 12, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/169762.The_Pox_Party

Even if it wasn't, as advertised, a novel.An Artist of the Floating World is the fifth of Kazuo Ishiguro's works I've read. I've been gradually working my way through since last year. I only have A Pale View of the Hills and Remains of the Day Left. I'm saving Remains of the Day for last—as it's the one that bought him all the acclaim. I'm almost certain to be disappointed, I guess. I'd almost have to be.But that's neither here nor there because An Artist of the Floating World was a fantastic little read. Ishiguro continues what would seem to be his one trend and style: presenting a story through the perspective of an obviously unreliable narrator (so that one never thinks to wonder about that aspect of things) and one whose voice doesn't always ring true. Evey narrator I've encountered thus far in one of his books relates events in an almost dispassionate manner—such that even when excited, the teller can't help but be overwhelmed by their own natural banality. It's a rather charming storytelling conceit. In it's own way.I noted earlier that the book was not, in fact, a novel. Even if it appears to be one and even if everything else says that it is such a work. Instead An Artist of the Floating World functions much more like a lengthy short story. Instead of there being a definitive vector for plot and climax and denouement, the book functions as one of those character-study/slice-of-life kind of vignettes that make up so much of Alice Munro's territory. The protagonist doesn't complete very much of an arc, the central conflict (if there even is a central conflict) is resolved off-page, and Masuji Ono spends as much time relating the distant past as he does the recent past. An Artist of the Floating World is less even a story than it is an evaluation of a character, a judgment of a history.Masuji Ono was a great—or at least vaguely famous—artist, who made his reputation when he rejected the traditional extrapolations of his previous masters and helped spearhead the propaganda-in-the-arts movement that forged the level of nationalistic furor necessary for Japan's (in hindsight) foolhardy attempts at Chinese invasion and American provocation. Now, with the War having crept a couple years into mist of history, he finds himself (as was the case with many of the nation's heroes of the pre-war era) to be persona non grata, having a reputation tarnished by a) the fact that Japan (his Japan!) had failed in their goal and b) his countrymen's desire to please the Western powers and make an overt show of embracing democracy. He has no place in the New Japan and has retired.His retirement makes clear that he realizes his position, but his narration confuses the issue, pointing to a man who refuses to take the prevailing attitude as seriously as the New Japanese might wish him to do. He is almost constantly representing things in a far more rosy frame than one might expect. The question of his ability to understand his new world and live in such a place pervades the entire narrative. Through his nearly endless digressions into the past and to conversations that he half remembers or half forgets, one finds the meat of this Ishiguro's purpose here. It's a complexly structured and delicate work and I can only imagine it would suffer under the weight of expectation.So I suppose it's good that this came out three years before the book that apparently ruined the rest of his work for a great many of his readers....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Nov 27, 2009","Nov 30, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/742138.An_Artist_of_the_Floating_World

Despite its unwieldy title (one that prevents me from being able to recommend it in verbal conversation), Town of Evening Calm, Country of Cherry Blossoms stunned me well and good. In under a hundred pages, Fumiyo Kouno may have authored the best book I’ll read this year. (I’m torn in four ways between this, Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go, and two works by Bolaño, 2666 and The Savage Detectives; not unpleasant company for a work that certainly doesn’t have the press or print run of these other books—at least, not in America.)If there is one way by which to properly describe this book, it’s human.[image]Kouno crafts a story that is at once full of so many of the facets of our nature that it can be breathtaking to see how flawlessly they’re brought to life in such a short span of pages. Greed, fear, guilt, shame, anger, regret, sorrow, love, laughter, hope, song, and joy. All of these features of the human frame are present in Kouno’s two-part story. Still more, we see the insidious hand of history and the buoyant touch of nostalgia at work throughout the book’s narrative.Kouno’s book is divided into two related stories: “Town of Evening Calm” and “Country of Cherry Blossoms.” Hence the terrible title for the book as a whole. Each explores the lives of members of a single family who live as survivors of the Hiroshima bombing and struggle to find their place, being caught between a society that quietly fears them and the weight of survivor’s guilt. Alternately heart-warming and gut-wrenching, this brief exploration of the civilian impact of modern warfare is as good as anything I’ve encountered on the subject. Kouno is neither gratuitous nor melodramatic and her simple stories are powerful reminders of both the heroic and villainous ends of the human spectrum.[image]While Kouno hones her storytelling lens on the individual—a young woman (in the first part) who struggles to accept the possibility of love in the wake of her unfair escape of Hiroshima’s destruction and (in the second part) her brother and his children’s firsthand experience of the unspoken apprehension felt by a society that would not or could not allow themselves to empathize with hibakusha (surviving victims of the Bomb)—her purpose spans much wider territory. She, in fact, aims to confront the human being in its peculiar existence as seat to both horror and beauty. And even while condemning the race, she hints at the wonder of humanity and the good that it can accomplish when it doesn’t allow its nature to get in the way.As I said earlier, Town of Evening Calm, Country of Cherry Blossoms had upon me a stunning kind of impact. There came a point that I dropped the book to my feet and wept in silence for the space of a minute. All sense of composure was evaporated and I fell apart. I never suspected such words as “Got another one,” could have such a full-bodied effect on my conscience. [image]There was nothing gruesome or exploitative or contrived about Kouno’s telling. The book was just that good. And of course, I recovered from my disablement and was able to continue taking in her joyous, mournful, hopeful, thought-provoking work of quiet genius.

The problem is simply this: most anthologies are made uneven in tone and quality by their disparate parts.Fortunately, Talking to Strangers, like the other two mentioned works acquits itself well despite a few missteps. The book's strengths actually lie in its varied nature. Each story is unique in the kind of story it tells as well as the style with which it is executed. Where one story is chilling, another might be celebratory. Where one functions as fable, another runs toward parable. The author shows range and invention and with one exception the collection is an easy and fun read, by turns thrilling and sweet and tragic.Said is joined by a number of collaborators who contribute the art for the volume. While I definitely missed Shari Chankhamma (Said's previous collaborator on The Clarence Principle) and her gorgeous work, the artists in this volume generally succeed with the material. Some, spectacularly well. Faye Yong's work on the fifth story in the anthology is an absolute joy. There are some hiccoughs though and this is perhaps the principal area in which the book could have been better.My favourite stories were the second and fifth (""Static"" and ""Flowers,"" respectively). It may not be coincidental that both remind me of other creative works of which I'm fond, Steven Martin's The Pleasure of My Company and Weezer's delicate song on Pinkerton, ""Butterfly."" It helps that, again, the art in ""Flowers"" is a joy to take in; Yong's lines are crisp and confident here, and her sense of visual storytelling is entirely effective. The first story, ""Box,"" is imaginative and from the perspective and direction of the story's own world, both compelling and frightening.There was really only one story I didn't appreciate well enough. ""Hero."" The fourth story is conceptually interesting and is the kind of thing one might find in the pages of Neil Gaiman's Sandman (only substituting Said's more verbally sparse style of writing). It's hard to find any weaknesses in Said's work on this story because they are drowned out almost entirely by Sonia Leong's ineffectual art. I'm not certain what happened here because her work in other examples I've seen is competent enough, but in ""Hero"" the art is muddy and unfortunately rather boring. At times there is difficulty discerning what is being seen (e.g., it wasn't until pages later that I came to recognize a certain object as a belt). Without seeing the script, it's hard to know where to pin blame for the ultimately mediocre realization of this particular story. Regardless, ""Hero"" is the book's one real weakness.Other issues, such as the kind-of-creepy bushy eyelashes on the protagonist of the first story and a simple error of one too many locks drawn on the outside of a door in the second story do little damage the overall quality of the collection and the better stories (which are fantastic) serve to elevate the work as a whole.[ copy provided by publisher:]...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Nov 19, 2009","Nov 21, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7160074-talking-to-strangers

HWith The Angel's Game, Zafón does more than just return to the Barcelona he created for Shadow of the Wind (albeit some couple decades earlier). He returns to so many of the themes of the previous book that one wonders if he isn't trying to tell the reader something of the nature of stories. Perhaps that under their skin (the superficialities of characters, dialogue, setting, and turns of plot), they're all telling us the same things, repackaged in such ways that we might discover the truth of story over and again.Or maybe I'm making excuses for why The Angel's Game and The Shadow of the Wind are so very similar.In many ways, this latest release by the Spanish author is a revisitation of his prior work. Again we see a writer whose father cannot understand him and whose benefactor delivers him into a livelihood that will haunt his future. Again we see a protagonist wroth with an impossible love. Again we see a game of cat and mouse with Barcelona's not-unblemished police force. Again the history of peculiar houses plays an indelible role in the plot's twisting development. Again the burning of books. Again the madness and corruption of the city is painted around the civil communal aspects of neighbourhoods. Again the theme of readers, writers, and the soul of books. And again, our protagonist is pursued by a mysterious devil-figure whose motives, ends, and identity are by no means certain throughout the tale's circuitous path. There is even another gift pen!And yet, for all that, The Angel's Game is indeed a different kind of story. For all the melodrama, thrills, and snappy dialogue that now seems to be the mark of Zafón's oeuvre, the release takes much more care to consider the method of authorship and the power of story.There is much made in several conversations of the nature of the well-conceived narrative—as well, of the envy such narratives provoke in less skilled tale-tellers. Further, Zafón explores the nature of a Spain that would soon become the nightmare from which The Shadow of the Wind served as epilogue.All told, The Angel's Game is a worthwhile read and once the dialogues over literary philosophy and concept history peter out, the book becomes an almost straightforward thriller in which the reader is racing toward the finish line to see how this horrible mess will unravel itself. Zafón is more than capable to the game he plays and while there were moments in which the story flagged for me (the dream sequences and, unfortunately, some of more theoretical conversations between Martín and Correli), on the whole, The Angel's Game delivers a solid tale of the sordid—what Zafón's readers will come to expect from him.So in the end, while I don't know whether I'm making excuses for why The Angel's Game and The Shadow of the Wind are so very similar, I do know that The Angel's game was good enough that I'm happy to believe Zafón's operating accordig to some master plan. For the time being. His next book in the cycle will better drive my opinion in one direction or another.As to which of his two novels are better? The Angel's Game did not have some of the soap-operatic revelations that made me wince in shadow of the Wind and definitely has more grist for serious discussion after the last page is turned.

Of course, I had already bought and been riding my LX150 for years by the time I read Chynna Clugston's ode to love, revenge, cheap morals, and the scooter nation. So I presume that the joy her slender volume of six sequentially illustrated chapters gave me somehow crossed the boundaries of time and arrived to me in the past before I had bought my own beloved Vespa. The book is that much fun. And while it's never really the point (love is), the book can't help but convey this unaffected adoration of scooters and some mythical lifestyle attached to scootering.At least I presume it's mythical. I've never been part of a club or been to a meet-up or rally. I don't know any mods. I don't even know anyone else who rides. Maybe Scooter Girl is an insider's look at a rogue sub-culture or maybe it's pure fantasy for scooter fetishists. I may never know for sure. I just use mine to get to work and ride down to the beach with my wife when the mood strikes us.In any case, Clugston's work here is rollicking and fun and depraved (in it's way). Her artwork, as usual has it's own peculiar and wonderful sensibility to it. Her characters speak with a crass sort of honesty that I find refreshing. They're horny and lazy and stylish and self-centered. But not in a way that capitalizes on those qualities for the simple purpose of marketing the book to a target like Kevin Smith or Quentin Tarantino do. Nah, these characters are simply like this because that's the kind of characters they are.Clugston's story here is almost inconsequential to the fun of watching these characters interact/hate each other, but for all that she still manages to pull together something fun. Ashton Archer may be cursed. Well, not at first because at first he is the king of his world. Top grades, top clubs, top athlete, and top of the Bay Area's scooter scene. And he's knotted knickers with pretty much every girl in his school, whether they were single or not. As is typical (in stereo even) of this kind of story set-up, the arrival of new student Margaret Sheldon and her brother Drake brings everything to a crashing halt. Ashton's personal grata turns immediately to Status Non. And here all he wants is to get into Margaret's pants. And maybe kill her.But see the amazing thing is that this crappy premise for a story is completely engaging when it plays out in Scooter Girl. Clugston owns this thing and it shows on every page.

It would be one thing if stories in a given collection were monolithic in terms of tone and qI never know how to  collections of short stories. It would be one thing if stories in a given collection were monolithic in terms of tone and quality. This, of course, is never the case. And is, by extension, not the case with Kazuo Ishiguro's collection of five stories, Nocturne. Three of these shorts I loved, one I liked a lot, and the other is of the variety where I'd be tempted to say, Let's just be friends, and then gradually distance myself until we were more acquaintances than anything. And that last one maybe not even so much because of its quality (but then again, maybe so), but more due to the fact that it just doesn't fit well within the edifice that Ishiguro has constructed.All of the stories (save for the second) explore the boundaries of their narratives through the musician's field of vision. All of the stories dancing about the interruption or breakdown of human relationship to some extent or another. And all of the stories theme toward unfulfilled potential and, sometimes, toward the potential fulfillment of it. And all of the stories are more or less believable despite their sometimes queer narrative direction.Save for the second.The first story, ""Crooner,"" posits a delicate and heartfelt meditation on the nature of love and business and love as business. Using the backdrop of Venice, Ishiguro ably uses the scene to host a story in which an older musician is able to convey his tragic sort of wisdom to a younger musician. I loved this one and even felt that it would make an able single chapter in a Haruki Murakami novel. (Oddly enough, though their styles are very different, I find a lot of similarity between Ishiguro and Murakami's treatment of the world and its strange vectors.)In Ishiguro's third story here, ""Malvern Hills,"" a young guitarist (who is apparently very talented—at least by his own estimation as the narrator) retreats to his sister's countryside cafe in the village of his youth to work on his music and to make sense of his world. In his interaction with touristing patrons, he finds new questions to ask of himself. Ishiguro acquitted himself ably in this one and though it wasn't among my favourites, I did like it very much.The fourth installment, ""Nocturne,"" was at once the most humourous and blue note of the series. A beautifully talented saxophonist reluctantly agrees to plastic surgery to tear down the perceived obstacle to his success: the stark absence of beauty in his features. While tearing himself up over questions of self-worth and his shame for having sold out in such a way, he makes the acquaintance of someone familiar to the reader. Hi-jinks and mopiness ensue. One of my favourites of the book.The final story, ""Cellists,"" I found to be thoroughly inventive. A common musician in a Venetian piazza sees a familiar face in the audience and begins a reminiscence of the (seven years earlier) young Hungarian cellist and the virtuoso woman would would give him a glimpse of the talent that he could unlock if given the right keys. Another of my favourites.Ishiguro's talent for mixing heartbreak and joy, disappointment and hope, and choice and destiny has always drawn me to his work. His reputation as being one of the most talented living authors in the English language is well-deserved, and despite the hiccough early in this collection, he proves himself to be equally at home in the short or long forms....Oh yeah, the second story. ""Come Rain or Come Shine."" I don't know what happened here. This story just didn't fit this collection at all. While his other four all follow a similar theme and present their vignettes in believable fashion, ""Come Rain or Come Shine"" seems to adopt some of the awkward unbelievability of The Unconsoled, only without the purpose behind it. Characters say and do ridiculous things without any narrative justification and just as when The Unconsoled's Ryder would say or do things and either nobody would pay any attention or they would horribly misconstrue his words and intent, so to do the three characters in this story seem nearly entirely oblivious to each other, each living in completely fabricated worlds of their own. I had at first toyed with the idea that Ishiguro was again playing with the unreliable narrator who believed his actions entirely rational while the world around him marveled at his apparent madness, but the dialogue of the other two characters doesn't really support this. Or else they're crazy too. In some ways, the story was fine. Perhaps it was experimental and values multiple readings, only fully revealing itself as one dwells on the problems it presents. It would have been at home in a different anthology perhaps, but in Nocturnes it sticks out like a tiger in a Volkswagen. Other than this complaint, though, Nocturnes was a wholly enjoyable, if brief, jaunt into the literary world of the music that dominates Ishiguro's work....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Nov 07, 2009","Nov 12, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6100514-nocturnes

In I Kill GiIt's good to pick a book with vaulted expectations, set the book down finished an hour and a half later, and have those expectations met. In I Kill Giants' earliest chapters, I was not at all sure this would be the case. The pace felt abrupt, the characterizations suffered some adjacency to verisimilitude, and the ground seemed well-worn and overly familiar as it hadn't been long since I had the pleasure of reading Nate Powell's Swallow Me Whole. Of course, by book's end, all that had been well-enough justified by Kelly and Niimura's wonderful story-telling.I Kill Giants exploits expectations in order to tell a story that, while common, is made special by its telling. The creative team breathes a crisp newness into Barbara Thorson's imaginative life that many such tales lack—and in their lack become shallow caricatures that never come to life for the reader. Traveling with Barbara through the travails of her fifth grader's existence, we are given a unique vantage into the lives and motivations of much of her supporting cast. There are still clichés that never entirely extricate themselves from the narrative weight crushing any spark of life from their shell of an existence(for instance the bully, Taylor, who is just like every other storybook bully you've ever encountered), but for the most part, Kelly's script is a relief.Accordingly, Niimura's visual work shows its excellence by nature of considering just how easy it would have been to really screw up the story by producing the wrong kind of art. When Niimura draws giants, they are impressive. When Niimura draws Barbara the giant slayer, she is awkwardly confident. When Niimura draws the intersection of worlds, we find ourselves charmed or horrified according to how Niimura wants us to feel. The only curiosity that took me out of the story and forced me to wonder at his visual choices was his depiction of Taylor, the bully (yes, her again); despite the character's solidly established age (she's a fifth grader), Niimura draws her as being well-enough into puberty that she's granted heftily developed breasts. While it's not outside the realm of possibility for such a girl to exist (apparently puberty is hitting girls earlier and earlier), it's far enough outside the norm that it may give readers (such as myself) pause.In any case, I Kill Giants is the story of Barbara Thorson. Who kills giants. Or so she tells just about everyone.Barbara is, sigh, precocious and outspoken. She's a bit geek (loves D&D and baseball history) and has a difficult homelife. Her interaction with her teachers (and school psychologist as a result of her interaction with teachers) is less than worthy of emulation. She seems to almost purposely make enemies with those around her. And yet, despite the difficulties she presents for herself and the reader who wants to sympathize, she cuts figure as an able protagonist. She's far from perfect and, for this story at least, we prefer her for it.Amidst portents of the arrival of a grave doom, the heralding of a coming giant, Barbara has to negotiate a society with which she will have nothing to do. Against her wishes, the society around her makes many overtures of peace and goodwill. Some make ground while others break it. And all the while, the unseen world becomes increasingly active as the prophesied doom grows ever nearer. In the end, it's in Barbara's interactions with both worlds and their inevitable clash that I Kill Giants' story takes shape.And it was wonderful to take in.As a final note, it is a happy circumstance that I Kill Giants is as short as it is—for the book certainly bears a second reading (as many things previously hidden are unveiled only with knowledge gained in the book's climax)....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,Oct 2009,"Nov 10, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6435893-i-kill-giants

As the series is yet to be completed, it's hard to judge how well the series-as-whole will hold up—but if Petersen continues to show the kind of storytelling attention and illustrator's care that we see in the first two volumes, the final result will be worthwhile indeed.With Fall 1152, Petersen introduces a world within (presumably) our world and goes beyond the realistic animal-fantasy honed in Richard Adams' Watership Down. Instead, this is a world in which mice have fostered a civilization, have made strides in both industry and academia. These mice boast metallurgy, pharmacy, architecture, libraries, cartography, and that hallmark of all the greatest civilizations, intrigue. There are castles and dungeons and cities hidden within trees. Wars and rumours of wars.(It is as yet unclear which other animals possess such social evolutions but at the least, we know that the weasels also use armour and weaponry.)Petersen spends much of the first volume introducing us to both his world and his characters (primarily, a trio of mice warriors, members of the vaunted mouseguard, whose purpose is to protect the commoner keeping the roads safe and keep peace between the very different (and fairly isolated) towns. Because so much of the volume is taken up with story-setting and world-building, it takes a little while for the main story to really get rolling. Once it does, however, Petersen's attention to his characters and their motivations and abilities is pushed even farther to the fore.Fall 1152 is a good introduction to what I hope will be a fantastic journey. The art and characterization is top-notch and the volume's only deficit is that its story does not seem quite full enough.

But that doesn't mean it can't be engaging, revealing, and rewarding.Frayling's biography of Sergio Leone is absolutely fascinating History is a lie. But that doesn't mean it can't be engaging, revealing, and rewarding.Frayling's biography of Sergio Leone is absolutely fascinating for the way it draws out the impossibility of there existing something called True History. Oh, certainly in the abstract sense, there could exist some ultimate record of event free from the colouring of memory, vanity, or nostalgia, but that would require an impartial, omniscient observer. And biographers, even if they had access to such an impossible (barring the metanatural) source, probably wouldn't wish to make use of it for fear of losing some of the more outrageous possibilities in the unveiling of their respective subjects.As Frayling pulls the curtain back on the Italian director's life and work, we find that coming to any solid understanding of what really happened and what he was really about is a task for fables rather than for mortals. In relating any given event, Frayling gives us the Leone version (which we are given to take rarely as the whole truth—or sometimes even as half-truth) and then the usually conflicting versions of his actors, friends, relatives, scriptwriters, cinematographers, and producers. And even the actors, friends, relatives, scriptwriters, cinematographers, and producers cannot come up with stories that corroborate each other.The life and work of Sergio Leone were myth well before he was even dead. And if interview with first hand participants in his life in a book published a mere decade after his death cannot come to anything resembling a stable view of who Sergio Leone was and what he was about, imagine then the impossibility of relying on any century-old historical record of accurately capturing the lives and events of that record's subjects.Frayling's book is a fantastic look at humans in both nature and perspective. And along the way, it happens to given a wonderful account of one of the most influential directors of the twentieth century.The biography is sensibly organized around Leone's major works, with room enough at beginning and end to see how the man arrived and departed. Frayling offers an enormous collection of insights into the director's sense of self, others' sense of the director's sense of self, and the director's indisputable passion for cinema. The author includes the words of numerous participants in Leone's movies and life, from Eastwood and Fonda to Bertolucci and Donati to De Niro and Wallach. Friends and the bitter disenchanted alike give testimony to the life of Sergio Leone.We are given to see his gradual rise through the ranks of the Italian film industry, the blatant theft of a Kurosawa film that would rocket him to fame, and the continual second-guessing and overreaching that would both plague him and endear him to thousands. Frayling details the production of his five major films (as well as some of his lesser lights), taking time to discuss Leone's demand for detail, for authenticity in the midst of hallucinatory mythicism, his sometimes volatile relationships with his actors, his always volatile relationship with his scriptwriters, his method for shooting and framing, his collaboration with Ennio Morricone (probably the most widely recognized aspect of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly), and his critical reception for each film.Something to Do with Death is everything I could want in a biography and for all but the most entrenched and knowledgeable Leone fan, it should hold more than enough details and revelations to keep the reader interested.

There is not a single thing wrong with this book. Ishiguro is a master craftsman and it shows here.The novel's characterizations are pitch perfect. Its narrative flow reveals things in exactly the right order. Mystery is preserved until it no longer matters and then, under the light of revelation, we discover the mystery was never the thing that mattered. Ishiguro plays with the reader as he unfolds his exploration of what it means to live—but never does so unfairly or at the expense of his characters' right to dignity and reality (a right that he very much does grant his characters).Never Let Me Go is narrated from nearly a decade before its publication. As Kathy quietly reminisces from her vantage in the late 1990s, she gradually comes to explore a life fraught with meaning and purpose—and fraught simultaneously with that kind of superlative meaninglessness that Ecclesiastes bemoans in all of its somber weariness. Kathy is a caregiver to recuperating donors and relates her special pleasure in the few instances in which she had been able to offer care to those who had been students at the exclusive (and, as it turns out, much envied) Hailsham, where she herself grew up. Memories of Hailsham water a fertile delta of memories through which we gradually come to understand both Kathy and the world she has inherited—a world filled both with much light and much darkness.In other words, a world much like mine or yours. Still, Kathy's story is unique and it is in her own tale's peculiarities that our own is better revealed. Better explored.Some may be tempted to see Never Let Me Go as ethical question and admonishment to this generation of readers and to the one that follows us. Certainly, that is there, but only as mise-en-scène to the larger panorama of a woman's quest to discern her past, present, and future from a glut of memories (some of which are only mostly trustworthy or even trusted) and how that journey sheds light on questions more important than mere ethical concerns. In Never Let Me Go, Ishiguro continues to play as he has in past works with memory and perception and how memory is so often the primary defense against perspicacity, yet as his narrator is acutely aware of her own remolding of history through nostalgia and forgetfulness, we are assured that perspicuity is not his target here.No. I believe Never Let Me Go is much more a perfectly plotted meditation (and its style is itself quite meditative) on the human condition, the place of our own hands in shaping our destinies, and what it means to live. These could all be clichéd topics but Ishiguro approaches with such a vaguely detached sublimity that he breathes (through Kathy his narrator) a certain verdant spirit into these things. They are never treated as anything more than mundane, but it is precisely by that treatment that he gives his purpose such power and impact....more",Notes are private!,0,318,1,not set,"Oct 02, 2009","Oct 13, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/331679.Never_Let_Me_Go

Why this is tragedy is because while the book is very good and Mitchell's ability to leap from character to character and style to style with little reservation and less hesitation shows a remarkable gift, there will be readers whose primary interest (or lack of such) will revolve about what we may consider Mitchell's gimmick.Here's the thing about gimmicks (and we'll get this out of the way as quickly as possible so that we can get to the meat of the matter, Mitchell's novel): everything about a book—every book—is a gimmick. Its plot, its structure, its choice of characters, its vocabulary and style and prose and use of device. All of it. It's all just a gimmick to get you, the reader, to forget your self-consciousness for long enough to consider an author's creative product. It's all just the means an author will use to trick you into engaging in his purpose for the duration of the book's page count.And when we describe a book as gimmicky, all we're saying is this: I didn't like the book.And part of that may be due to an author's inability to sustain whatever gimmicks, whatever bag of tricks the author has chosen to employ. Or part of it may just be that some people don't like to be aware of the fact that there is a structural foundation, an erector set's worth of girders, an abandoned wharf's collection of pilings, a ramshackle assortment of concrete and rebar and wood and wires, glass, ducts, canals, service elevators, and furniture—all lurking just off-camera. Or in Cloud Atlas' case, not so far off camera.So was Cloud Atlas gimmicky?Well, because I very much enjoyed the book: no, it was not gimmicky in the least. An exercise in formalism and experimentation to be sure, but no, not gimmicky. Mitchell uses in Cloud Atlas a chiastic structure to develop themes of liberty and determinism, savagery and civility, and a critique of the Ecclesiatical cliché that there is nothing new under the sun. Using six thinly connected stories told through six different mediums in six different time periods spanning hundreds of years, Mitchell explores the seemingly innate savagery of humanity (and especially of civilized humanity). In the end, Mitchell provides few clues as to how one might conquer this orientation—though he does suggest in a testimony from a dystopian future that any orientation may be overcome (prompting suggestions of education and standing on the shoulders of those who have come before). In any case, his topics are worthy, his characters indelible, his method of conveyance sound, and his ability to handle a pen unquestionable. Some stories will be better received than others and each reader will find those that ring most true in the inner ear of their own conscience. Regardless, Cloud Atlas is an ambitious work whose form and experiment, though potentially distracting to the distractable reader, is entirely necessary (I believe) to the story he tells. Without his particular ordo apocalypsis, Mitchell's novel would lose the strength of its ability to convict as well as its ability to offer what hope it can (however slim). An excellent work and one worth any reader's time and attention.___________________________________________Note on Kindle edition.Filled with hundreds of typos. Hundreds. Perhaps over a thousand.

It is only now, after a month or so has passed since my reading, that I realize that No, The Shadow of the Wind was not a great book.But it was freaking fun.Seriously. Despite the pretty good writing, the largely stereotyped characters, the cliched plot development, and the soap-operatic twists and revelations, The Shadow of the Wind was a very fun ride. Despite the fact that there exists little real substance in the novel beyond some interesting discussion of the nature of reading and writing, The Shadow of the Wind kept me excited and always intrigued. Despite the fact that none of it could be as good as its opening chapter, The Shadow of the Wind had me jumping for opportunities to read more of it. Despite the fact that even now many of the plot points are fading from memory, The Shadow of the Wind never flagged in interest. (Okay, it did once. for about six pages.)The Shadow of the Wind may not be a great book, but it is certainly a good book. And really, who doesn't want to read good books?Zafón's interest in mid-twentieth century Spain paints a picture of a world I'll never get to experience through any means other than novels. It reminds me of Cinema Paradiso (both in its love affair with a medium and its portrayal of European life a couple generations past). As well, like Cinema Paradiso, Zafón's book is thoroughly romantic (in its multiple senses). He trysts with love in ways that the formulizers of Hollywood romances should distill and bottle—for the betterment of their own product. But where Zafón really excels here is in producing a fun read. It's his twists and turns of plot and device that do it. The characters help (especially Fermin), but The Shadow of the Wind is really all and entirely about What Will Happen Next. It's possibly the book that most summer reading aspires to be. It's fun and light without being stupid. The Shadow of the Wind doesn't leave the reader feeling as if she has just overdosed on a far-too-sweet dessert. There's enough substance to fill one up and leave one off with a feeling of satisfaction and of time well spent.And who doesn't want a feeling like that after having a grand time pursuing mysteries in 1950s' Spain?

One cannot browse pages looking for that one line of dialogue, that single narrative flourish, that lone twist of phrase with which to properly set off ones . Borrowed books present a problem of weight and heft for those who would  such books. And The Savage Detectives was certainly a borrowed book, lent from the library for three weeks (and returned in thirteen pieces). So since I'm denied a juicy quotation for my hook, let's begin with this: whether one understands it or not, The Savage Detectives is a Great Book.In the Winnie the Pooh sense, using Important Capitals and all that.Bolaño's 1998 novel is, like many things, many things. Its tentacular themes squirrel and writhe all over a canvas that we never get to see directly. The book is one those that is, frankly, hard to pin down, difficult to categorize. The facility with which one describes the story of The Savage Detectives may actually be a mark of how little one has understood the work. But here goes.So far as I can gather, one might best summarize Bolaño's novel here as describing the life and death of a movement of literary desperation. He uses this tacit resemblance to a plot as a device by which he can criticize desperation in its various forms as being wholly the province of either the immature or the lifelong imbecile. In many ways, The Savage Detectives is about the futility of the written word. And so, the novel stands as withering self-criticism.In 2666, Bolaño criticizes not only those that believe they've been a part of some great historic moment, but even those who believe such moments can be apprehended (even if they do exist, of which he remains skeptical):""I get the idea perfectly, Mickey,"" said Archimboldi, thinking all the while that this man was not only irritating but ridiculous, with the particular ridiculousness of self-dramatizers and poor fools convinced they've been present at a decisive moment in history, when it's common knowledge, thought Archimboldi, that history, which is a simple whore, has no decisive moments but is a proliferation of instants, brief interludes that vie with one another in monstrousness.In The Savage Detectives, he criticizes the value of the literary though he himself cannot give it up. The writer is that poor kind of fool who is convinced that his words have value and in whose meaning there is power and purpose, when it's common knowledge (as Bolaño teaches us) that literature is a whore and is naught but the proliferation of disparate voices, desperate to be heard and vying with one another in monstrousness. Bolaño's perspective on the human animal (as revealed in this and 2666 is not particularly cheery. Through his characters, we can see that despite its occasional burst of beauty and vitality, humanity is base and vulgar and arrogant and deceitful and cruel and selfish and wholly ignorant of its place in the world. Humanity, in his novels, wanders around, inflicting loneliness upon itself, searching for a lost roadmap to purpose and meaning and revolution. His characters never find their maps, never discover anything about the world other than its transcendancy, and only ever end their stories in the grasp of indefatigable futility.Bolaño proves himself, like many poets, to harbour interest in giving (or obscuring) meaning through structure. The framework through which he unfolds The Savage Detectives is novel and while confusing the storytelling, ties well to his purpose. The first and third sections of the novel, are written in a simple enough fashion, following several months of journal entries from seventeen year-old Garcia Madero. While Madero is not the protagonist, his narrative introduces them and bids them farewell. Halfway through Madero's journaling through the months comprising the tail of 1975 and head of 1976, the author inserts his second section, abandoning entirely Garcia Madero and telling through a series of (perhaps imaginary) interviews more stories related to his two protagonists. These interviews begin in January 1976 and extend twenty years into their future, giving the reader some kind of consensually confused understanding of the two protagonists. Bolaño then returns to Garcia Madero's journals to give shape and colour to the events that will follow whatever it is he reveals.The author's structure plays further into his argument for futility, for with his fifty-or-so narrators, it becomes easy to see that however we view the characters, it is our own perceptions that govern our vision of them and their worths. Bolaño has sold us a work that lies to us knowingly and with pedagogical purpose. If we recognize the lies that our own perceptions craft while we read, it is only a small step to recognize that Bolaño himself must be lying to us as well—especially when he thinks he's being truthful and despite his desperation to make himself heard. Because anything he can tell us about the world is wholly based upon his fallible perception of that world, a perception based upon preconceived notions and a world built upon the more insidious lie of history.The Savage Detectives, regardless of its average length, is a massive work—one that bears multiple readings. I hope to reread it again soon in order to discover whether I understood it or not, to discover whether I believe that Bolaño's words are as futile as he seems to want me to believe.

Or maybe not so much the reading, which can be accomplished easily enough, but the being able to speak sensibly about it afterward. I feel kind of like how I did after finishing 2666, only not quite so out of my depth. Like Bolaño, Mazzucchelli's work here displays a breadth and depth that overtly requires multiple readings in order find ground solid enough to speak with any authority about the book. But since I've only read the book once, you'll have to be satisfied with my initial thoughts. Asterios Polyp is, in the simplest terms, a coming-of-age story—one in which the fifty-year-old lead, celebrated architect Asterios Polyp, begins a quest to put away the childish things of his past and embarks on journey of both self-discovery and exploration of the world as it is rather than how he has intended to see it for so long. In this aspect, Asterios reminded me of Mr. Ryder from Ishiguro's The Unconsoled, a man at the top of his rarefied field who still must learn to grow up. And like Ryder, Asterios suffers from an inability to see the world as it is and is (really, like us all) victim to his own perceptions.Reality, perception, and memory play a huge role in Mazzucchelli's work here even as they do in everything I've yet read by Ishiguro.On top of this is layered the framework of Greek tragedy and specific allusion to the myth of Orpheus (this is pointed out through fistfuls of overt clues, not the least of which is a dream in which Asterios takes the role of Orpheus and his ex-wife Hana embodies Eurydice). We get narrative explanations from a meta-source in the Greek choral tradition. Comparisons to Dionysus and Apollo lead to an evaluation of dualistic systems (and perhaps systems generally) as Asterios gradually must free himself from systemic shackles in order to finally grow up. Of course we suspect if Asterios abandons one aspect he will be destroyed even as Orpheus was for abandoning Dionysus. As well, there are plenty of references to The Odyssey and this cross-pollination of mythologies only serves to enrich our experience of Asterios' journey.The subject matter, by its summary, sounds simple enough but Mazzucchelli throws so much into this piece and exercises such deft control over the page that one can easily drown in the details. The art is very particular. Much is made of Mazzucchelli's use of colour through the book and, well, with good reason. The colouring itself offers storytelling that is available through no other means. In fact, so occasionally powerful is his use of colour that I worry for colourblind readers, that they might miss out on some of the book's more sublime moments.On top of Mazzucchelli's tight reign over his colour spectrum, there is ample evidence that he maintains the same level of control over his linework and design. Asterios Polyp is a thoroughly designed experience, with every element from script to story to illustration to panel design to colouration to control of whitespace adding voice to the chorus of this performance. The battle between geometric and organic shapes gives the reader (who may not be familiar with all the names and ideas Asterios or his ghostly narrator reference) a hook on which to hang the interpreter's hat. One's experience of Asterios Polyp will no doubt be more enriched by a working knowledge of architectural history, familiarity with Greek mythology and Homeric tradition, and a smackerel of understanding of postmodern sculpture—but Mazzucchelli's conveyance of story through his visual sense means that even those with Asterios-sized gaps in their education can still get in there and have some deeper sense of what's going on.As of this writing, I have only read Asterios Polyp once. Of course I still have questions. Of course I do. I think I understand the ending, but I'd like to reread and think on it again. I think I understand why he physically takes on the identity of his true last name in the book's final act (Polyp is only half his original surname, as the immigration official chopped in half the family name when his father immigrated to America). I sometimes understand what Mazzuchelli intends with his character names and sometimes not. I have the barest kernel of an idea why Mazzuchelli, in a mature work that depicts nudity and violence, insists on representing verbal obscenity with cartoony symbolic representation (e.g. ""We made up a $#@*load of these""). I don't yet fully grasp Asterios' Ignazio dreams. I am certain, however, that many of these things will become more clear on subsequent readings.As I said, I have only read Asterios Polyp once.

Generally the quality and value of the work is so varied that it's hard to come up with any kind of monolithic opinion to summarize the work. While single-author collections can be a bit easier, they still aren't wholly immune to this kind of trouble.Kevin Huizenga's Curses is, for me, no exception to this rule.While some of the stories are great and perfect examples of viable ways to use the comic medium to tell stories, others are merely good. Certainly, there are no bad stories found in this collection, but not everything is awestriking. Easily the best story in terms of sociological interest and storytelling chops is ""Jeepers Jacobs,"" in which a golf acquaintance of protagonist Glenn Ganges ponders his responsibility for the state of Glenn's soul while penning an article on the doctrine of hell for a conservative evangelical journal of theology. I found myself very interested in Huizenga's ability to portray with sympathy both Jeepers' view of hell and his Christian responsibility and that of his colleagues with whom he sometimes strongly disagreed.One of the more interesting stories visually was one of the least interesting in narrative terms. ""Case 0003128-24"" follows the expansion over about a hundred irregular panels of a sometimes impossible landscape, mimicking in pen-and-ink form the artistic style of Chinese brush paintings. In almost every case (there are a couple interesting divergences) the panels can be aligned to bring forth a single scene. And over this artistic expression, a narrative quoted directly from adoption paper plays out in captions. The effect is interesting and I'd love to explore it in more detail, but it wasn't the most invigorating read.""Lost Boys"" employs some narrative genius and makes the valuable use of the tools of the medium. Both subject matters treated are fascinating but I only partially think I understand Glenn's reaction (or punchline) at the tale's conclusion. ""Green Tea"" was an interesting exploration of a (fictional) historical incident. I didn't particularly care for ""28th St,"" though it was an inventive enough retelling of another story and ""Not Sleeping Together"" was actually sometimes a chore to get through, though in the end it turned out to be worth the effort. ""The Curse"" may be the central story and its exploration of the Evil of the starling was fascinating and well rendered.Like many of these kinds of books, there are several overarching themes that tie together (to one degree or another) the book's stories. I've only read through the book once now and suspect (due to the author's evident talent) that I'm likely not going to be able to pull the whole thing together in a single read. I'd like to spend more time in it, but it's due back at the library soon. I may have to purchase the book in order to best understand it (and that wouldn't be a bad use of money). Though currently, I'd rate some of the stories 5 stars most of the others 4 stars and maybe one of them 3 stars, I'll allow that the books complexity and the requirement of subsequent readings puts this at least solidly in 4 star territory....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Jun 21, 2009","Jun 25, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/154237.Curses

The art is simplistic but fulfills its function with a rather spare kind of beauty, propelling this small book's small story. And while the art did its job, mostly what I liked was Sievert's evocation of that unique flavour and weight that air only exhibits in close proximity to the ocean. I passed by my old beachfront home last Father's Day as we drove home south along PCH. Through a flood of memories, the thing that stood out most—the thing I most missed—was waking up each morning in that recumbent salt air. The sounds of waves breaking was a close second, but that salty air will always be cherished by me above all other aspects of beach living.[image]The unfolding of That Salty Air's tale of man versus nature, of earthly suffering versus ultimate justice versus mercy, demonstrates a certain affection for the sea on author Tim Sievert's part. It would be hyperbolic to say that the book proves his love for the sea and its life because part of being a great storyteller is the crafting of believable fiction. Still, I'd like to think that affection exists because it was so well realized.[image]Earlier, when I said, ""I liked That Salty Air—I did,"" the overt implication would be that maybe I mightn't have or shouldn't have. And there's something to that. The protagonist, Hugh, is a little bit hard to get behind. He appears at first to be something of a simpleton. He acts with the grace and intent of someone suffering a slight mental disorder. And while such protagonists can engender the support or interest of readers, Hugh does not. Partially because he is not given time enough before his transformation.[image]Through catastrophe, Hugh moves abruptly from one-dimensional simpleton (though we later realize that he really isn't suffering this kind of handicap) to one-dimensional personification of unswerving rage. The reader can detect motive, sure, but a little early character building could have made his transformation more powerful and more immediately essential to the story's progress.

ABC was well-crafted enough that it prompted me to seek out this more recent book. I wasn't sure exactly what to expect with The Eternal Smile, but I expected something worth my time. And The Eternal Smile delivered on that expectation—though perhaps not as powerfully as I would have hoped. That was my feeling the first time I read the book. I think I may have been expecting too much. Just tonight, I finished reading it for a second time, with perhaps two years intervening between reads and it was a much more enjoyable experience. This time I was well-armed with the knowledge that while The Eternal Smile wasn't as ambitious a story as American Born Chinese, it wasn't trying to be. While it wasn't as straightforward and socially dilapidated as Same Difference, it wasn't trying to be. The Eternal Smile was its own thing and it was happy to be what it was.Broken into three short, ostensibly unrelated stories (though there is a panel tying Story I and Story II together, this may just be a cute cameo), The Eternal Smile focuses on the theme of personal identity—not so much ethnic identity, as in American Born Chinese—and what it takes to recognize who one truly is. Yang and Kim explore the idea of how one might find happiness in the skin of someone who until recently may have been a complete stranger. These three tales explore the substance of a person's inner self and motivations. Who one is and who one is attempting to become. [image]The art is wonderful across the board but finds best expression in the first and final stories. Besides drawing well and pacing his stories gracefully, Kim has one talent that just blows me away. The manner by which he renders expressions is possibly without peer. This is on full display in the first story, where Kim draws his characters to more accurately represent the human form. The third story, while employing more cartoonish character designs, still conveys a strong sense of emotional content through Kim's use of eyes and mouths. It's only the second story where the art loses its ability to express through any great range; homaging the style of Scrooge McDuck comics, Kim necessarily loses one of his greatest tools as a comics creator. (In this sense, I wish his homage wasn't quite so accomplished.)The writing of these stories themselves stands out less. Each involves interesting twists, but doesn't really make superb use of the short story form. Only the final story is truly excellent. The ideas driving each (beyond just the worthwhile exploration of the theme) are inventive and seem well-planned, but again, it's the final story that shines. Concerning a girl working low-rung in an ISP who falls for a Nigerian banking scam and the separation and bridge between fact and fantasy, this is easily the most heartfelt of the stories and the art here sings. Kim's pacing and positioning of panels is inspiring and watching some of the intricacies of her correspondence take form is a reward for the careful reader.[image]The Eternal Smile is a good book but not a great book. It's worth your time for 1) the experience of Kim's art (which is almost always* worth your time) and 2) the well-forged final tale (one that stuck with me throughout the two years since I first experienced it). Oh. And I can't figure out the reason why The Eternal Smile got the name it did. Sure, that eternal smile did take on a central role in the second story, but it did so as an element of fraud. I suppose that it is through the mistaken purpose of the smile that one character goes on an unwilling journey of self-discovery, but I'm not sure that's what the authors are telling us through this titling.Note:*I will admit to being a bit disappointed in his contribution to Kazu Kibuishi's Flight anthology.[Review courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,not set,"Jun 06, 2009","Jun 18, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4437831-the-eternal-smile

The book is just too goodIt's almost cliche at this point to praise Nate Powell's Swallow Me Whole, but it's not like there's any honest alternative. The book is just too good for anything else. Talented illustrator? Check. Talented storyteller? Check. Imaginative? Funny? Insightful? Worthwhile? All systems are go. Powell's art reminds me of some delicate hybrid between Craig Thompson and David Lapham—and amusingly, Swallow Me Whole is like some strange cross-pollination between Blankets and Silverfish.Okay, well not really. But kinda.By the evidence of prior works (Epileptic and It's a Bird come to mind), the comics medium seems uniquely suitable to the exploration of mental deviation-slash-illness. Swallow Me Whole, far from dispelling this sense of things, works to cement the place of comics as a vessel through which the well might come to better understand the unwell. My experience with those suffering under the fist of schizophrenia is limited to a relative I'll never know, so I can't speak very well to the accuracies of Powell's depiction but to say that it isn't so far from the stories I've been told by my relatives who survived the terror and oppression this one errant family member brought into the family by her delusions.Often these illnesses are portrayed from the outside, from the viewpoint of a quote-unquote neutral observer. Powell gets to the heart of things by giving us two protagonists, Ruth and Perry (one medicated and one not), who labour under the grip of delusions they recognize to be delusions but have no recourse but to answer to their illusions. What's better is that we are allowed to experience their hallucinations somewhat as they experience them. Ruth's delusions are more intrusive and she embraces them with less hesitation, but Perry's can be no less intrusive and no less compulsive. Where Swallow Me Whole's real strength lies is in the fact that Ruth and Perry talk openly between themselves about the trials of their own branded delusions. Powell goes to pains to give breadth of soul to other family members despite offering them strictly limited screentime but the real focus is Ruth and Perry. Even though neither has any more experience of each other's hallucinations (Ruth's feature ambassador's from the insect kingdom and require a shrine of physical corpses while Perry's involve a diminutive wizard who resides primarily on the end of his pencil and forces him on drawing missions), they speak to each other with love and understanding. Even as the difficulties of their lives threaten to destroy them and their family, the have each other to hold onto and it seems only by their bond that they've survived as long as they have. These are two deeply involving and sympathetic characters who carry the book on the shoulders of their interactions with each other.The book's conclusion is going to be the sticking point for most readers, either confusing them into distrusting the book or elevating it to a work of grand accomplishment. I fall into the latter of the two artificially-constructed catchall bins. There are, I think two valid interpretations for the finale—both of which are powerful and amazing. I'm not sure which reading I prefer—each has its merits—but in the final analysis, each shows the horrible power of this kind of disease and how acts of coping on one's part can destroy the lives of others. The climax is amazing and, whether taken literally or figuratively, demonstrates well Powell's grasp of the material.

I’m a big fan of a single person working hard to bring their narrative dreams to paper reality. It takes a lot of work on the part of the creator and so I dearly want all such efforts to succeed.You may have already guessed by my tone that House doesn’t succeed.[image]The storytelling conceit of a wordless story conveyed through simple art is cool enough, but though Simmons’ art is generally competent enough, its cartoony style doesn’t allow for some of the nuance he seems to be trying to convey. There are panels in which one cannot be certain whether the characters are talking or arguing or messing around or perhaps something else entirely. This makes the storytelling difficult to piece out. As much as I’m loathe to diminish Simmons’ experiment here, I was often frustrated by the narrative inadequacies created by the book’s use of silence. I desperately wished on several occasions that there had been some sort of narration or dialog present so I could understand what story I was reading. Readers can easily ascertain the overt storyline of kids exploring an abandoned—and perhaps haunted—mansion and the inevitable trouble such investigations must incur, but anything more that this is partially (and sometimes entirely) obstructed by the book’s deficits.[image]Still, while the book ultimately does not succeed, there are some things that it essays spectacularly. The revelation of the lake and the sunken parapets and chains was great. The finale with its increasing tightening and dramatic build worked very well for me, and while I couldn’t always make out the expressions on our three protagonists’ faces, the darkness enveloping them more than made up for what couldn’t be seen. And perhaps the best choice of all was the use of the front and back covers to bookend the story and give a strong metanarrative clue as to what’s going on.While in the end I didn’t think much of House, I found the concept worth the investigation and hope to read future works by the creator as, with most things, diligence and practice will likely hone his craft.[image][ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,"Jun 17, 2009","Jun 18, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1090885.House

Additionally, the p blurb on the book's back cover evoked the image of an adventurous thrill ride. Thankfully, both presumptions were mistaken. The mononymous author, Jason, crafts instead a work with both subtlety and dialogue (and often it's in the dialogue that we find the subtlety). He explores themes of love and life and second chances (not disimilarly to how Jonathan Blow would later meditate on similar themes through his popular videogame Braid.

Martin: he writes a story that's as compulsively readable as Twilight. Really the only differences between the two are: 1) Martin's writing is better than an eighth grader's (unlike Stephenie Meyer's) and 2) Meyer knows how to end a book (unlike George R.R. Martin). Oh, well, that and the plot of course.Martin's writing is crisp and serves his plot well. He doesn't kick around overly long with lush descriptions of the terrain and while he does spend some time playing around in his characters dreams (a staple of the genre, it seems), such episodes rarely threatened to cause me to skip ahead—as is often the case during such sillinesses. Martin's work is wholly plot-driven. His characters are engaging, but only so that they will make the plot worth sussing out. Everyone has their histories and these intertwine and snake to make best use of the thrilling intrigue. A Game of Thrones sets up shop in a medieval-style fantasy world (one in which the fantasy elements only very gradually creep into the tale). Fraught with political intrigue, Thrones is often more about the conflicts between families and clans who ought to be allied under the banner of their king but aren't than it is about the quiet, simmering dangers that threaten the realm from the outside. Throughout, the principal realm seems likely devour itself well before the grave enemies that threaten have any opportunity to do harm.Of course, by the time the book ends, not much of anything has been resolved. The final chapter didn't even have to be the final chapter for the amount of resolution that has occurred. Martin could have easily ended the book on any of the last fifteen chapters and the reader would have felt as much closure. I suppose this wouldn't be such a problem if the entirety of the series were available currently, but as I understand there are still a couple more volumes waiting to be published. Now this isn't the worst thing that could happen, but it certainly did not lead to any reader's satisfaction when I turned the final page.Beyond the fact that numerous major and minor threads are left unresolved, the only other real complaint I have is how quickly Martin hits the reader with a barrage of fabricated terms related to the history, geography, politics, culture, and religions of his new-made world. While it's understandable that a whole new world would have certain things different from our own and would need new words to describe such things, a kinder author would find a more gentle means of introducing his reader than Martin does in the third chapter of A Game of Thrones. That chapter is, well, nearly impenetrable (though becomes understandable upon reflection after reading later chapters). Randall Munroe posits a tongue-in-cheek graph charting the probability that a book will be good in contrast to the depth of its made-up vocabulary.At the end of the day, apart from my two complaints, Martin does a stellar job accomplishing a thoroughly guilty read. I plowed through his novel in a couple days. It was, in fact, difficult for me to stop reading and I've even reluctantly begun the second novel in the series, desperate to know What Happens. Reading A Game of Thrones did nothing to affect my understanding of the world around me and did not contribute in any measurable way to my sense of my own literacy. But it was certainly fun.

I liked it, that much is certain.The story is expansive and the characters indelible. The insight into the development of Chinese culture over the last four decades was enlightening. The episodes related were heartfelt, both funny and tragic. And sometimes even both simultaneously. I was involved for the book's entirety (which was not insubstantial).The problem, I guess, is twofold: 1) I can't tell if the writing was simplistic and somewhat stilted by design or by translation; and 2) the extremism of Yu's emotional roller coaster reminds one of the formulaic approach of self-important tear-jerkers that mob the cineplex every Fall. So far as the writing goes, it was more a curiosity than a bother. If the style was due to translator inadequacy, then I suppose I should feel a little ripped off (not getting anything close to the full expression of the author's intended work), but if the style was the author's choice and the translators indeed faithfully transmitted Yu's text into the book I read, then I find the choice fascinating. If the text was truly intended to be as simplistic as it was, then perhaps the semantic and grammatical choices fit the story. Liu Town, where the principal action occurs is certainly provincial and a place in which education is of the smallest of concerns. It then makes a kind of sense that the narrative should echo the voice of the story's inhabitants.Emotionally, Brothers may be one of the saddest funny books I've ever read. I laughed a lot—mostly due to the ridiculousness of the town's many inhabitants and most especially because of the proclamations of the principal brother, Baldy Li. Still, the story carries more than its share of tragedies. And these aren't just garden-variety tragedies either. Brothers can be brutal as it destroys lives without tact or conscience. Perhaps this too is a reflection of the world in which our the brothers dwell, an echo of the terror—both loud and quiet—that the last half-century of China's history and culture have wrought in the lives of its citizens. In any case, I don't know if I've ever felt more mournful while reading a novel. Which of course makes me suspect it.Brothers develops alongside the lives of two step-brothers (or more properly, brothers) from about 1960 onward. These brothers weather the terrible years of the Cultural Revolution and the mortal fear Chairman Mao's movement instilled in the nation. They struggle through the years following and look for opportunities in the more capitalistic China that would grow out of the revolutionary era. Their differing temperaments and philosophies of life offer breadth to the tale, allowing readers to more completely apprehend China and its culture. Yu focuses much of his effort exploring the depths of human folly and the sewer stain of humanity's soul, only occasionally revealing the purity of true love and camaraderie throughout. And of course those moments shine all the more brightly due their depraved surroundings. I don't know exactly what Yu thinks of the human being, but I suspect that he doesn't think much of it—though he seems willing to be surprised by its moments of joy and beauty....more",Notes are private!,0,32,1,not set,May 2009,"May 21, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3920295-brothers

Both of A Fraction of the Whole's protagonists, Martin and Jasper, throw off a continuous stream of ideas and summations of the human experience that my friends are probably pretty tired of hearing spouted from my own mouth. From their ranting about loyalty to dirt to the motivation for humans to be invested in sports outcomes, from the human desire to witness the fall of others to pinning motivations on God, from the flimsy veneer of most philosophical arguments to the fate of the rebels' children, from the hypocrisy in ""I don't want to take up any more of your time"" to the impossibility that democracy should succeed.Essentially Toltz' characters here are rabid cynics and I suspect that Toltz may be as well for him to be able to write so adeptly the perspective. Because really, apart from the sanity issues, it felt like Toltz was writing me—and I have pride enough to imagine that the mere neophyte cynic couldn't begin to do justice to the mindset.A Fraction of the Whole is the improbably probable story of Jasper and Martin Dean. As told by Jasper (son). And on occasion by Martin (father). Posthumously, in Martin's case. And using Jasper as proxy. It's kind of one of those How I Got Here stories, beginning with Martin dead and Jasper in a riot-prone detention center. And I never knew where it was going to go next.The tale is fraught with heartache and tragedy but as told from the unique vantage of the entrenched cynic, even misery and woe is made comic. Someone would die horribly and one sentence later I would be chuckling. A favourite character's dreams would be shattered for all time and even in the midst of their evident grief, I would catch myself grinning like an idiot. It stands testament to Toltz' powers as a writer that he can so ironically manipulate the emotions of the reader. Quite opposite of the typically sappy Hollywood-brand of contrivances, A Fraction of the Whole might rather be considered a tear-stauncher, leaving the jerkers for lesser fare.In any case, I very much enjoyed my time in his work and would likely read future efforts as well.

And specifically the Absolute printing.]]At one point in his sprawling (how's that for an overused adjective) work 2666, Roberto Bolaño compares the short stories of the world's great authors with their longer, feature-lengthed efforts. Bolaño's narrator of the moment is reflecting on a literate pharmacist's preference for terse works (e.g. Kafka's The Metamorphosis or Melville's Bartleby):What a sad paradox, thought Amalfitano. Now even bookish pharmacists are afraid to take on the great, imperfect, torrential works, books that blaze paths into the unknown. They choose the perfect exercises of the great masters. Or what amounts to the same thing: they want to watch the great masters spar, but they have no interest in real combat, when the great masters struggle against that something, that something that terrifies us all, that something that cows us and spurs us on, amid blood and mortal wounds and stench.Reading Neil Gaiman's (sprawling) work, Sandman, the one that bought him fame in the beginning, reading that from beginning to end, I was struck by what may be a weakness on my own part. Gaiman, I believe, is at his resolute best with the shorter narrative. The sparring match, the experiment. Sandman is a curious work because it is itself a grand, arcing story that is made up of numerous smaller arcs that develop the narrative direction as well as individual self-contained singular episodes that work more to add flavour to the entire literary meal. And it is in the space of these singular episodes—which never last longer than a chapter's breadth—that Gaiman proves his genius. And it is in the longer, more ambitious pieces of Gaiman's wonderful tale that his mastery seems to falter.To be plain, when it comes to Sandman, I prefer Gaiman's sparring to his real combat. And this may reflect more on me than on Gaiman's text here.In any case, while Sandman contains some of the most sublime, interesting, and humourous acts of narrative whimsy I've encountered, the whole suffers by the comparison. It's not bad by any stretch; the work is still engaging and well-conceived. It just lacks the beauty of some of its contained stories.* Some of the longer arcs, even, are wonderfully told. But as a whole I don't believe that Sandman is quite as good as some of its parts.The series lurches to an awkward beginning that may cause some readers to give up early. The art is largely unpalatable and only adequately suits its narrative content a minority of its time; there are chapters in which the art succeeds and is equal to the more literary aspect of the page, but this does not happen often. Apart from these trifles, things move rather well for the story after five or so chapters (and definitely by chapter six, ""24 Hours,"" which was the first moment I knew Gaiman was an author to be well-considered).Sandman explores the question of what might happen when one of the eternal forces that govern our world begins to change. The Lord Dream, Morpheus, one of the seven Endless, and brother to Death, Despair, and Destiny (among others), is our protagonist and Gaiman begins the journey with his capture at the hands of some errant human mystics. This seems to be the event that sets everything along its paces, but Gaiman is more circumspect than to toy with such obviousness and like in most things, final outcomes (as well as those in between) are come by innumerable influences, the vast majority of which seem mere inconsequentialities. That Gaiman can pull so many of these disparate threads together pays homage to his stature as an author.Again, to speak doubly redundantly, I must here reiterate: despite enjoying certain portions of the series so much more than others, it cannot be said that Gaiman's work here is anything other than tremendous. Sandman receives nothing less than a strong recommendation. It is not Gaiman's best work, but it is still good enough that it is better than so much else of what is available and well-regarded. If one lives to life's end and chooses not to experience Sandman, I can say with confidence that they have chosen to actively impoverish their life.______________________Something should here be said for the Absolute editions. The printing and presentation is gorgeous. These books are huge and heavy and their imposing size lends to the feeling that something important is being consumed. Unfortunately, one of my greatest problems with the series is that I rarely think much of the book's collective artistry. The illustrators chosen for the book are never great and are sometimes not even good. The exquisite printing standard offered here in some ways seems like a waste to be taken up by such lackluster art. But it is what it is. Each of the four volumes contains around a hundred pages of extra material, from sketches to scripts to merchandising histories to colleague tributes to additional stories (the extra episode painted by John Bolton is a joy). While paying through the nose for these deluxe volumes may not be worth it for most readers (I paid $240 for the series whereas retail price hits about $400), the story is great and worth the time spent reading.If you've never read Sandman, I'd probably stay away from the Absolute volumes and simply check out the ten paperback editions from your local library.______________________*note: for those who've read the series, the short episodes to which I refer to as being so wonderful include the following: ""The Sound of Her Wings,"" ""Men of Good Fortune,"" ""A Dream of a Thousand Cats,"" "" A Midsummer Night's Dream,""The Hunt,"" ""Three Septembers and a January,"" ""The Parliament of Rooks,"" ""Ramadan,"" and the tales told in the Inn, World's End....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,Jan 2009,"Feb 27, 2009",,Slipcased Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23753.The_Absolute_Sandman_Volume_1

I might be wrong there, but I might not be too far off track either. In any case, I'll boast in my humility and say up front that I do not know if 2666 is greatness or if it merely suffers from having greatness thrust upon, into, and through it.I sense that there is something great there and that I may have just read one of the greatest books ever written. Only I feel myself inadequate to the task of discerning the book as I'd like. More, I feel completely inadequate to the composition of this . After all, suppose Bolaño is the master? What right have I to approach his work, to sit in judgment over it. Even in, or especially in, favourable judgment.I loved the book in an understated way that I don't know if I've previously experienced. It was amazing and awestriking and I'm sure I've only understood a fraction of what I was seeing. It's too big to see all at once and Bolaño's purpose is too slippery. I've read both Ishiguro's The Unconsoled and Murakami's Wind-up Bird Chronicle without ever feeling out of my depth, but this was just too grand. I'll need and want to read it again. And maybe once more after.I get the feeling too, that the length and breadth of the work are absolutely meant to exhaust the reader. Those occasional dearths of final punctuation, that leave the reader no place to pause, to breath, to sabbath, are all likewise meant to weary the reader. I get the feeling that not only was Bolaño intending to convey a story and its ideas, but that he was also working a grand psychological experiment on his readers in order to draw them ever more fully into the central experiences of the book. In fatiguing his readers so, he works to inure them to the grotesqueness of the world, to the horrible reality that we gloss with statistics and news headlines and class distinction et cetera.I have not read Bolaño's other works, but now I want to do so. I want to unearth more of this world he sees, more of this world he tells.2666 is not by any means one of Bolaño's perfect exercises. Instead, Bolaño battles and strives amidst vomit and gore and blood and the rape of both his characters and our sanctity as readers, no longer made safe by the hermetic seal of the book's page. Bolaño spills out blood and rage and misanthropy and maybe even love. In 2666 is found Bolaño and his ""struggle against that something, that something that terrifies us all, that something that cows us and spurs us on, amid blood and mortal wounds and stench.""Bolaño's book is somehow about the connection between literature and its critics and the rape and murder of women because they are women and it strikes me that in writing this  I am in some way participating in Bolaño's extended metaphor. This may or may not be the case, but consider it a tribute to the work that I am even here wondering if this isn't the case....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,"Mar 24, 2009","Feb 03, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7494437-2666

Let's be clear. In real life, I have no interest in late-19th-century Britain's class disparity or in maids. Yet due to Mori's work here, I was absolutely engaged for the whole seven volumes, finishing them over the course of a day. If she decides to write something furhter on the matter, I'm certain to be drawn in again.Mori's storytelling is impressive. The line of her art perfectly suits her subject matter; it's crisp and confident. She includes any number of silent scenes that allow the reader to pause and take in the full scope of what is occurring within the more introspective parts of her characters. Keeping the reader involved, Mori uses a number of visual devises, requiring one to pay attention to camera angles and character details. The storytelling occurs as much through visual relief as it does through verbal narrative and dialogue.Emma is chiefly the story of Emma and William. This is a romance and we see them meet-cute, fall for each other in that stereotypically understated Victorian way, encounter difficulties due their class distinctions, and finally resolve their relationship. It's a lovely little story. As mentioned, Emma is the story of Emma and William. And as such, Mori leaves every other story untold. It's easy to see how one could be frustrated with as many loose ends as Mori leaves untied for her supporting characters' part, but for me that just added to the wonder of the story. Because of Mori's reluctance to end all stories with the conclusion of Emma and William's story, she keeps Emma from being yet one more example of a horribly contrived romance.

I had neitherI had the vaguely unique opportunity to approach MacGuire's most famous work without any immediate familiarity with his source material. I had neither read L. Baum's original work nor seen the Judy Garland vehicle. Certainly, some of the Oz mythos has filtered down into society at large over the years and I am broadly aware of some of the stories more famous bits.I knew of the yellow brick road—upon which I presumed the entire tale took place. I knew of the ruby slippers, though little more than that such shoes were extant. I knew that Dorothy arrived in a house that crushed a witch and have in mind the image of two spindly legs clothed in candy-cane-striped socks emerged from beneath its deadly weight. I knew of a quest for a heart, a brain, and some other thing. Perhaps a spleen. I knew that the villain melted and suspected it was due to some sort of molecular aquaphobia. And I knew that one ought pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.Oh. And that flying monkeys apparently played some role.With that in mind, I can say that MacGuire crafts a tale that takes a path down a road that with few exceptions is easy enough for even an Oz Neophyte to follow without getting lost. I did occasionally wonder what happened to seemingly significant characters with whom the narrative seemed to grow weary and decided to abandon outright, never to be seen again. Case file: the Scarecrow and the Woodsman. Both seem to carry some narrative force and even feature prominently in the prologue. But Macguire leaves them apart and away from Dorothy and Elphaba near the climax and never returns to them or their presumed plight. I was not quite sure of their function in the story then save perhaps because lore required their presence.But other wise, yes. Wicked carves a narrative path that is simple enough for even a newcomer to follow. Unfortunately, the path—which began in earnest and promised great sights and breathtaking vistas—becomes dull and plodding and any number of things that a desirable trek would hope to avoid. Plainly then? Wicked loses steam in its first third and never regains its spirit. It becomes, in a word, boring.I was engaged-if-perplexed in the first section, in which we are introduced to the infant Elphaba and her deleteriously bankrupt family. I was excited throughout her college years as she first learns to relate (or attempts to do so) with classmates and experiences tastes of the wider world of ideas and ideals. This second section of MacGuire's journey is easily his strongest work here and he creates a likable, mischievous cast with which Elphaba might parry and riposte. He hints at great things to come and struggles for which Elphaba and her friends have only just begun to take up arms. Unfortunately, it all falls apart immediately upon Elphaba's abandonment of her education.Not only does Elphie cease to develop in constructive ways, but her story becomes a shambles, never gaining the traction required to make the reader care. Oh, there are moments that hint of the things that could have been—the elephant queen, Liir's involvement with the great fish, Nor's experience of flight. Alas, these all remain as undeveloped and unevolved as the philosophical content at which the novel toys (the level of thoughtfulness is comparable to what one might find in a dormroom in which five college sophomores launch into outspoken dissertations on the nature of our reality fueled only by second-rate marijuana and a subconscious desire to feel important).MacGuire's Wicked is, in the final reckoning, deeply unsatisfying.

The author, Stephanie Meyer, while not at all a great writer is definitely a talented storyteller. Her plot is engaging and her characters, while infantile and pretty obnoxious, are worthwhile enough to maintain interest. The fact that I was compelled to finish the book in a couple days by nothing more than desire to see how everything all turned out is testament enough that Meyer is a good storyteller.As mentioned, Meyer isn't a great writer. While plotting and character development come easy to her, the more technical aspect of putting pen to paper in a manner that both engages the language and clearly conveys meaning is a gift simply absent from her talent-basket. This absence was made all the more obvious by my having read Holes immediately after finishing Twilight; while Louis Sachar is not the most amazing writer, his work came off as if it were penned by the mythological lord of the written word. Too bad for Meyer.On the whole, Twilight was an innocuous diversion with little staying power, whose level of engagement flags dramatically during the climactic ""chase"" scene (ironically enough). It stands as a testament to reader's deep yearning for something resembling romance that the story of Edward and Bella should be such an indelible touchstone for the current generation of youthful readers. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,Jan 2009,"Jan 19, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41865.Twilight

Sure it's easy to point to dull and repetitive dialogue. Or continual narrative use by several characters of stock phrases that nobody uses very often. Or the uninspired characters. But somewhere beyond all that, Palahniuk just kind of, I dunno, fails to deliver a worthwhile story. And it didn't help that the ending was a confused jumble of narrative vomit—unless there were some hints to a different chronology that I had missed in my hurry to finish it up.So anyway, here's what's what. Cassie Wright is this aging porn queen and she's setting out to break records by accomplishing sex acts with 600 men in a single go. Most of the book occurs in the green room, where the gradually diminishing group of 600 men mill about eating snacks and trying to keep themselves ready for action. The book is narrated by four of the characters, three individuals from the assembled male-strom (Numbers 72, 137, and 600) and Ms. Wright's manager, Sheila.You would think that with four narrators, we would get four distinct voices, but despite the fact that Mr. 600 describes everyone as a ""dude"" and Sheila takes every opportunity in her narrative stream to refer to men by a string of euphemisms for masturbation (e.g. ""pud-puller,"" ""willy-wankers,"" ""palm pilots""—yeah, I know, ho-hum...)—despite the fact that a couple of these narrators have obnoxious verbal tics, each of the four are quite obviously Palahniuk thinly veiled. Each of the narrators does this little shtick where they'll enlighten the reader to some odd piece of knowledge about one subject or another (usually movie star trivia) and then they'll punctuate by saying: ""True fact."" I've never run into anyone who talks like this ever, so to run into four or five in the course of a day seems a little tough to swallow. Also, I may have heard a person at some point in my life refer to the pointing index finger as a quote-unquote gun finger, but again, four people in a day? Anyway, the story moves along at a nice clip and I finished it in good time, but I wouldn't call myself satisfied. Maybe Palahniuk spoiled me with Survivor, but a lot of this just had a kind of been-there/done-that feel to it. This felt like an author phoning it in.

Which is, I'll state up front, not the best way to approach a text unbiased. I picked the book up expecting greatness and found only good-ness. I delved in hoping for something that would transcend its genre and discovered a novel mired in its genre.Not that it's all bad. And neither is it at all bad. Auralia's Colors does make generous use of what for lack of a better term can be called faults.First the bad.The novel, like most of its kind, labours heavily under the burden of its forefathers. The stereotyped tropes of the genre are a cruel taskmaster under whose fell thumb Auralia and her colours never threaten to emerge. The themes are tired and overworn and I felt like I was reading any number of the fantasy books I grew up with as a kid. Many of the characters are mere caricatures and you know from the first page of their introduction exactly who they will turn out to be (I had hoped while reading that he would be turning these stereotypes on the reader, playing with and then dashing expectations, but alas...). The prose is overheated, wrought over and again in the forge of Overstreet's imagination. (I read the first couple pages to The Monk while she prepared herself a lunch and her response: ""Hm, I think he's trying to hard."")Randall Munroe (of XKCD) recently posited a helpful rule of thumb regarding these types of novels.Auralia and her colours do suffer on this point—though not as much as they might. While Overstreet is not quite as imaginative world-builder as Phillip Pullman and doesn't have the master's grasp on the language as does Tolkien, he does tell a well-paced story. This is something at which Pullman, for all his imagination, utterly fails. Overstreet's characters who are less like the cardboard standees that populated the Suncoast Videos of yesteryear are engaging enough and I really did want to find out what would happen in the end. The climax to this first book was satisfying enough that I went to the library to see if they had the first sequel Cyndere's Midnight, but they didn't. And I'm not quite sold enough to actually purchase it.As far as Fantasy goes, I'd put Overstreet far below Tolkien (but who isn't when it comes to fantasy), a bit below Feist and Rowling, far above Pullman (though my butt is also far above Pullman), and probably on a par with McCaffrey and nearly on a level with Lewis (though in fair disclosure, I'm not the biggest fan of Lewis).

Second acts generally fend off some of the energy and presence of the first in order to properly explode into the final act. While maintaining his virtuosity over the form, Lutes does calm things down a bit after the May Day massacre that concluded the first act.City of Smoke largely explores two themes: the robust nightlife that ruled Berlin's hidden quarters and the growing political strife between factions of the citizenry. And the two societies seem largely oblivious to each other. The night society drowns reality in celebration and excess, while the workaday masses are drowned by concerns for a faulty government, a crashing market, and the evidence of a revolution at hand.As in the first, journalist Kurt Severing is our guide and it is largely from his perspective that we are probably meant to absorb the story (though not entirely—as his appalling disdain for sweet, sweet jazz marks him as unreliable). It is through Severing, who supports Marxist ideology but refuses to participate in anything more demonstrative than the occasional article, that we first discovered the city in the first book, City of Stones; and it is again Severing who provides teetering balance to the ruckus between the night and the day societies.Lutes, in addition to his mastery of the comic medium, proves himself an excellent student of the human state, capturing intricately the poison that infects us all. Of course he depicts flawlessly the poor, huddled masses as they struggle to stave off starvation and fight for a political hope that will surely disappoint (as political hopes are wont to do), but further, he delivers too the poison that inflames even human joy and celebration. We are given witness to ecstasy and abandon, but realistically, we also are allowed to see the darkness that threatens from the horizon, that in some sense has already leapt into the lives of the happy.And Lutes does this in such a way that he doesn't come off as depressing so much as he does real. There is a veracity to his work that the reader cannot help but admire. As far as story direction, I didn't like some of his choices for some of his characters. But they were always real choices. And I respect the story for it. And they set up well the story to come.As a minor complaint, there were small moments when I felt the usual creator's care diminish. A page here with shaky art. A panel there with a name plainly omitted from the text balloon. On the whole these things did not harm the book for me.

EverEvery now and again, a comic comes out that assures me that the medium can tell certain kinds of stories in a way that no other medium can touch. Every now and again, a comic comes out that despite its natural humility asserts itself as a model to which the medium should aspire. Every now and again, a comic comes out that just flat-out knocks me off my feet and makes me think that everything is going to be alright after all.That comic this time round is Jason Lutes' Berlin: City of Stones.It's not that Berlin presents such a rosie vista of the panoply of human history. It doesn't. It's not that Berlin offers a solution to the din of political strife that will always wrack the tired bones of human society. It doesn't. And it's not even that Berlin allows true love to conquer even the dankest moments of our human despair. It can't.What Lutes' book does, however, is demonstrate that creative geniuses still stalk the earth. The great classical composers are dead and gone. The sculptors who decorated the world with marble and jade are survived only by their stones. The giants of the jazz era have passed into mere memory. Bach. Beethoven. Mozart. Michelangelo. Bernini. Rodin. Satch. Bird. Trane. And Jason Lutes.Among the geniuses of the comic form (Ware, Smith, Eisner, Hernandez, etc.), Lutes is in the top tier. His work is careful, planned, and makes use of so many narrative tricks that they cease to be tricks and exist merely as natural part of his extensive visual vocabulary. Recently having taught an introduction to comics creation, I had a hard time not using Lutes' work in every example I had prepared to illustrate technique. There is so much story built into every page that his works are the kinds that continue unfolding upon subsequent readings.With the recent release of the second book of the trilogy, Berlin: City of Smoke, I thought it'd be best to reread City of Stones so I could jump right into its sequel. This was my third complete read of the book and fresh narrative details continued to make themselves known. With the story and plot developments more or less solid in mind, I was able to pay closer attention to some of the methodology behind Lutes' work here, taking special care to follow his panel transitions and the way he allows the story to flit from character to character. This is all the product of a special kind of genius.For those unaware, Berlin follows numerous characters through the end of the Twenties and the start of the Thirties in Wiemar's Germany. The economy is a disaster. The government is breaking the terms of armistice. Political turmoil grips the city as communists and fascists fight to save their country from its fate. And of course, there are the Jews, living under the quiet threat of a future none could predict. Yet despite it all, Berlin is still trying to be a Great City. There is still wealth and privilege (even while the workers begin falling to poverty and starvation) and the veiled acceptance of the libertines. And the press is still free. Somewhat.Berlin follows a Marxist journalist, a country-mouse art student, a nightclub singer, a family divided over politics, a Jewish tramp, the boy with whom he trades goods, a lesbian, a socialite, a policeman, and a handful of political radicals (both communist and fascist). Its weavings can chart a difficult path to traverse, but the work pays well and is worth every moment of inspection.My only complaint is now that I have finished Volume II, I've got a good half-decade's wait to see Lutes' conclusion....more",Notes are private!,0,22,3,not setnot setnot set,"Sep 14, 2008not setnot set","Sep 17, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/438068.Berlin_Vol_1

(Would an eighth grader say ""teh best""?) And now we return you to our regularly scheduled .I'm not a huge fan of non-fiction. Scratch that. I'm a huge fan of non-fiction, but not so huge a fan of reading non-fiction. While I appreciate learning and broadening my understanding of the world around and as it once was, I find myself pretty quickly distracted from whatever non-fictional work I pick up. The fact is: most writers of non-fiction are more experts in their field of study than they are expert authors. They deliver the goods well, but aren't quite as adept at prettying them up for consumption.Erik Larson, however, is a genius. Or something. I could not put this book down. (In the figurative sense—it actually took me about two weeks to read.) The entire length of my time in this book was marked with moments of in which I would stop reading, interrupt my wife from the depths of her studies, and remark again how good this book was. (I'm sure that she would have been happier had Larson just been your average purveyor of non-fictionalizations.)In The Devil in the White City, Larson chronicles chiefly a tale of two city-dwellers. Architect, Daniel Burnham and pharmacist, Henry Holmes. One would helm the creation of a wonderland of awe-striking beauty and refinement. The other would become one of America's earliest and most diabolical serial killers. All this against the backdrop of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition (a.k.a. the Chicago World's Fair).Daniel Burnham, the self-made architect, who designed the Rookery in Chicago would design the Flatiron Building in New York, assembled a team of the best American architects of the day for the task of crafting a World's Fair in Chicago that would be even more exquisite than the one held in Paris years earlier. The Paris Exposition had also unveiled Gustave Eiffel's incredible tower, so Burnham put a call out to American engineering: something grander would have to be proposed and built. National reputation was at stake as well as civic pride. Larson explores in exciting detail the glories and the tragedies of this great endeavor.In contrast to this paean to human ingenuity and spirit, Larson focuses the other half of his narrative on a man as diligent in his chosen task as Burnham was in his. H.H. Holmes, the self-style pharmacist, who killed upwards of twenty-seven (mostly young women, fresh to the city), built for himself a hideous parody of the grand buildings that the world would soon celebrate. Bit by bit, he crafted what would later be known as his murder castle, a hotel whose ground floor hosted several businesses and whose other floors would boast far more sinister use. The second and third floors contained numerous rooms and hallways and secret compartments and switches. Airtight rooms with gas outlets. Walk-in vaults purpose not for keeping out but for keeping in. And a slicked chute to the basement where a kiln, acid, and limepits awaited. Holmes was handsome and charming in a way that made him irresistible to women. He was also a psychopath who would turn the American attention far too late.Larson, as a chronicler, is top notch. He entertains even as he educates. And he leaves just enough narrative tension to compel the reader along his path. Larson knows how to keep enough information back to avoid rendering the latter half of his book naught but excruciating anti-climax. The Devil in the White City is certainly an accomplishment and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone.If forced to, I will admit* two quibbles with the book: 1) I was thirsty for more pictures and wanted desperately to see these buildings that Burnham and company were so busied upon; and 2) on the whole Larson keeps his voice clean of any emotive spots not merited by the characters themselves, but there were two moments when I was sure I was hearing Larson's voice beam through (it could have been worse—at least those two moments were funny).*note: see what I did there?

And whatever the specifics of tMarvit's Sparks received an award from Friends of Lulu in 2000 for, I imagine, its portrayal of a quality female role. And whatever the specifics of the award, I'm sure Sparks merited it.  It never ceases to amaze me how little recognized the book is. The so-called urban faery-tale remains among that elite and fabled coalition of five-star comics—despite the fact that no one's ever heard of it. I've been singing its praises for seven years now and every last person who's read it on my recommendation has loved it. In that kind of tragic way it demands.  Sparks is heart-rending, all at once tragic and joyous and freeing and responsible. Lawrence Marvit's captivating and all-too-believable-except-for-the-robot-coming-to-life-bit tale of love, death, life, and astronomy is bound to make any who don't have the shell of a cockroach growing over his heart feel deeply for its characters.   Set in a once-upon-a-time kingdom resembling New York/Chicago/etc., Marvit develops a likable princess (with whom anyone who's ever felt lost can relate) with occasionally wicked parents and a knight of true nobility to attend her needs. Next to Jimmy Corrigan and Mister Blank, Sparks inhabits an Olympus of only the elite of comicdom. As gods among men, books like these are either those to which all the others aspire or else villainous reminders of how far from adequate the rest of comicdom truly is.  Josephine, the book's protagonist/damsel in distress, is utterly human. She's sad and tragic and naive and wobegotten. And entirely likable. Every time she is snubbed, mocked, ignored, or abused, I am almost compelled to reach for the nearest Sharpie (always good to keep many at hand at all times) and either draw devil horns and mustachio upon the offender or scratch their countenance from the book altogether. Sanity always draws me back with the recognition that without those other human faces, Josephine's story will not ring as true the next time I pick it up.Josephine is one of those characters that you get to watch grow. She begins as timid wallflower and ultimate geek-girl (she's an auto-hound) and slowly musters courage at the prompting of some dubious friendships. But courage needs to be earned and her initial attempts at freedom from her fears are only as successful as any halfhearted endeavor can be. And so, she needs to grow through the experience of pain and love and rejection and abandonment and love and death and terror and love. And love. And it's wonderful and I rejoice in her character and its victories.Of course, not everyone is going to adore Marvit's work. In looking for other s of the work awhile back, I ran across a  by someone who must be a bitter old sea hag (like the one from Popeye). Either that or someone with her own opinion. But I prefer to believe her the former—as I don't see how anyone operating anywhere on the legal-to-drive side of her seventh bottle of gin could reasonably come to like conclusions as she.______________________Oh, now that I remember it.

I think I mostly enjoyed it as much as I did because I hadn't known what to expect. Let me now ruin that ability for you.The novel mines very much a similar vein to Gaiman's American Gods. Only without any of the gods. Still, there's magic and shamanism and small towns and boonies. And the narrative is peppered with humourous notes. Really though, the thing that makes this novel work best is its shifting narrative plane. Chapter by chapter, Disch leaps from one character's perspective to another. He does so sensibly and this effort helps the reader empathize with characters who had previously been shown in an unfavourable light.The story is well-paced and kept me interested throughout. The unraveling of mysteries and the up-tying of ends loosed within the story all worked well for me; and Disch's writing was competent enough to engage even a sense of joy while reading. I picked up The Sub as a distraction from Dave Eggers' What Is the What and Disch's authorship was a revelation in comparison with Eggers' lifeless words in the latter book. In any case, The Sub was a fun, quick read. Great travel reading.ASIDE:I had read some complaints of misogyny on the part of the author. These are wholly unfounded.

And isn't that the way it should be?In any case, Salinger's Franny and Zooey is the most recent in what I hope will be a continuing tradition of engaging, well-written stories. I have to admit I approached the work with some skepticism, having been wholly uninterested in Catcher in the Rye when it was forced upon me in high school (and now, I am looking forward to going back and reading Catcher).It's really in the dialogue that Franny and Zooey shines. I found their discussions completely absorbing and their subject-matter intriguing. Even the correspondences represented in the work are fun and filled with the kind of silly banter that reminds me of my own letters to my wife before she was my wife.As far as story goes, it really is pretty slight and primarily relies on four distinct conversations over the course of a few days in which Franny has a sort of spiritual nervous breakdown. I found the whole thing—the breakdown, the conversations, the conclusions—all to be uncomfortably believable in that I could easily imagine such a set of things occurring somewhere in real life.To conclude, Franny and Zooey is a short book that can be swallowed at breakneck speeds.

Norwegian Wood, by all accounts, was the work that made his later triumphs possible. Still, I approached the work guardedly, recognizing that popularity and quality rarely go with hands clasped in loving security.In short, my fears were deftly allayed.Norwegian Wood, while boasting none of that surreality that drew me so strongly to Murakami's later works, is still on all counts an excellent novel. It foreshadows the art that he would later hone in more incredible works but is not overwhelmed by its place as Prototype and stands stubbornly under its own worthy powers. The book is emotionally satisfying, wryly humourous, and carries enough of the psychological burden of true romance that I couldn't help but enjoy the journey.As far as the story is concerned, Murakami pits a young, collegiate protagonist (Toru Watanabe) against a world made crazy by ill-founded idealism and the fascism that idealism nurtures. The world around him feeds on dreams and the need for rebellion—not worthy rebellion but only that typical rebellion that the young feel is necessary to young lives. Even in the midst of his cynicism toward the mindless abandon of his classmates, Watanabe finds himself abandoned to his desperate love for Naoko, the psychologically wounded girlfriend of his now-deceased best friend from high school. Even as he labours to support Naoko through her lengthy convalescence, writing her letters and occasionally visiting her remote community, Watanabe takes the edge off his pining by participating in two oddly similar friendships, both with fellow students of his particular university. These work to show him both who he wants to be and who he does not want to be.I'm not certain if Norwegian Wood should be classified as romantic fiction, bildungsroman, or as something else. Certainly their are elements of the two well-mined genres, but I can't help feeling that the novel is perhaps something more worthwhile than either of the two classifications. In any case, I liked it well enough and it's normal enough to appeal to even those who aren't ready for Murakami's more curious work....more",Notes are private!,0,35,1,not set,Jul 2008,"Jul 29, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11297.Norwegian_Wood

Dominic), What Is the What ended up being not half bad. I suppose it was only a third bad. Or maybe not actually bad. Maybe just one-third Not Great. Which is okay. We can't all be great.""What is the what?"" is a question that Valentino had been asking himself for a long time. Ever since he was Achak. Back before being reintroduced to his Christian name. The story goes: God approached the ancient Dinka, a people pregnant with hope and dignity, and offered them mastery of cattle, the source of life and greatness. That or the What. God never adequately explained the What to the Dinka and the Dinka, having seen UHF and knowing that there was nothing in the box and that box-pickers are so stupid, chose the safe bet. Cattle. And therefore, life and that abundantly. The other people got the What. Which is why apparently they took out their aggressions on the Dinka.Okay, so that was a very loose paraphrase.In any case, Valentino is busy wondering what the What could be when some of his Dinka brethren decide to begin a civil war against the northern half of Sudan (which is largely Muslim and Arab). The North is not a fan of this idea and so does its best to extinguish the Dinka (whether they own cattle or not). This started in 1983 or so and went on a good twenty years before stopping only to maybe start up again in the near future. In the end it really only has anything to do with the What if the What happens to be a thirst for money (and preexistent religious incompatibility). But Valentino doesn't know that. He's only six.Or he is at first. He grows up over the course of the story. While a lot of his companions die, are killed, are kidnapped, or are lost.Speaking frankly, Sudan has been an unmitigated disaster of country-running pretty much since it gained indepedence from its colonial British overlords. Since the war began in 1983, well over 2 million Dinka were genocidally put to pasture. What little infrastructure the Southern half of the country had thirty years ago is long since evaporated. There is hope for the country, but it's a slender hope. And a tenuous one. By the way, in case you missed it: 2 million.To be certain, the subject matter of What Is the What is important for a largely ignorant American audience. We react easily, as a nation, to massacres like Columbine or the World Trade Center destruction, but compared to Sudan, these are mere stubbed toes while Sudan features sheared limbs and exposed organs. We should react easily and emotionally to the Columbines and the World Trade Centers, but we should react as well to the other terrors humanity perpetrates upon itself. Since 1999 I've been part of an organization that has worked with and in Southern Sudan (and Uganda and Kenya). I've met Rebecca Garang (wife of John Garang, the guy who essentially started the civil war by rebelling against an oppressive government). I've seen pictures, heard stories, and met those affected immediately by the situation. The story Eggers presents has more than the ring of truth to it. So far as things go, it is true—in that it represents with unflinching veracity the reality of the Sudanese problem.I only wish it had been better written.Eggers does not merely tell his story. He offers a framing device. One that does not adequately capture the life of Valentino and occasionally draws one so far out of story that it becomes difficult to reign back in. (I actually put the book down twice in order to read other books, despite having a limited time to complete What Is the What.) The book opens with Valentino being robbed and assaulted and he takes the opportunity over the next day and a half to think his story at his assailants and other non-Sudanese who come into his path. He's a good man and I feel for him, but the narrative trick just didn't work.On top of this, Eggers' style here is rather lifeless. He's trying to write in the authentic voice of the very real Valentino Achak Deng, but the work suffers for it. The story content is fascinating but its delivery robs it of much of its fire and zest. It's not incompetent writing. It's just not enjoyable. Or interesting.And that's just a shame....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Aug 23, 2008","Jul 25, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4952.What_Is_the_What

We follow its mopey hero (loosest sense applies) as he, well, butches up—emigrating from the country of the pissed-upon and hopelessly downtrodden to the utopian society of the Real Men and the hopelessly hedonistic. Wesley is a real downer of a character. Spineless, misanthropic, and racist. A veritable cocktail of a social disease. Throw in a soul-sucking job and a relationship with a serial adulteress (is it still adultery if you're not married?) and you don't get a character that you quite feel sorry for, but maybe one who you just hope you never meet in real life. (Is loser contagious?)Then, one day, everything turns around for him. The dad he never knew dies and he inherits billions. And a legacy that will prove far more interesting to him than money. His dad was the Killer, the most dangerous super-villain in a world run-and-ruled by super-villains. And dad's abilities, apparently, are passed genetically. Wesley takes up dad's mantle and joins one of the five syndicates that rule the world from the shadows. While Wesley remains misanthropic and racist, he does stop being spineless.And then things go to crap.Many of the ideas have been visited before but Millar manages to craft an entertaining tale. The action is well-paced. As is the revelation of what the villains have done to the world. The dialogue mostly works—though the level of filth the reader must wade through reminds me of juniour high (ah, those were the days...). Perhaps Millar's only serious misstep occurs in the last couples pages (and most particularly on the final page), as Wesley gives the reader a big ol' eff ewe, and does so awkwardly. It was as if Millar really wanted to have fun sticking it to the reader, but couldn't figure out how to really get that to flow from the story. I didn't mind hearing what a loser I was from Wesley.

Ishiguro has crafted what is a pretty thoroughly boring, deeply rewarding novel. What at first appears to be a simple series of encounters between a renowned pianist—Mr. Ryder to you—and the inhabitants of a European city turns out to be anything but. Ryder is ostensibly meant to play part in the concert performance that will bring the city back from the realm of the culturally inconsequential and into the forefront of important society's good graces, but time, space, people, and his own memory constantly threaten to prevent his preparation for the event.And not in any normal fashion.Very quickly it becomes apparent that the tale is not meant to be interpreted with any of that base linearity that we typical confront in reading novels. Here time is quite fluid, slowing or accelerating or simply bending as Ishiguro requires it. Locations and distances also seem to wax and wane at will, turning the cityscape into a literary expression of some of Escher's more impossible settings. Conversations that must take place out of earshot are recorded faithfully by Mr. Ryder's narration. People who should be strangers happen to be Mr. Ryder's close friends, acquaintances, and relations. Or perhaps closer.The Unconsoled is a relentless and wearying task, but for me the experience of Ishiguro's intricate work here was well worth the frustration. I may have wished the novel was a hundred pages more terse, but I can't really fault Ishiguro for the lengths to which he took me for it was only in those last hundred pages that my understanding of what may truly be going with Mr. Ryder began to crystallize.

As the narration continues, one wonders just how ephemerally Christopher Banks, the narrator, holds his grasp on reality. Quite clearly his recollections of the distant past are modified to fit his circumstances and the man he's become—and paradoxically, the man he's become is a debt owed to these remembered (sometimes falsely so) experiences—but it may be more than that. It may be that the strength of his memories are so robust that they exert force upon even his more immediate experiences, colouring them to match the pallette of the world he's inherited from memoir.Christopher Banks is (or becomes over the span of years from which he narrates) one of Britain's brightest and most celebrated detectives, solving murder after murder with apparently little trouble. The man is quite plainly a rational genius. He does, however, have a great single ambition that propels him through his life—one that even drove him to his successful occupation. Banks hopes to one day tackle the most daunting crime of his life. The kidnapping of his parents.When Banks was a youth, living in the British Settlement in Shanghai just post the turn of the twentieth century, his parents were taken from him. As an adult, Banks intends to return to Shanghai, solves the disappearance, and even perhaps have his parents restored to him.As an abstract exploration of the nature of both history and memory, When We Were Orphans is an entirely worthwhile investigation, but my favourite conceit of Ishiguro's here was something far less integral (perhaps) to the story's primary goal. Banks throughout the telling speaks of this case and that, a series of murders and mysteries in which he is engaged to solve. Each one is solved to the adulation of British society and to the forwarding of Banks' reputation as one who understand intrinsically the criminal mind. And yet. Not once are we treated to any explanation of the details of such crimes or their solutions. While Ishiguro keeps us at arm's length from such unseemly designs (for they are not among his purposes in this tale), he takes special care to continuously draw our attention to the fact of such crimes and cases, perhaps foreshadowing the fact that it is the effect of the circumstance rather than the solution that truly matters in the end. Perhaps finding solutions to tragedies do nothing in the end to soften the brute fact of the tragedy?...more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,not set,Apr 2008,"Jul 14, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/406626.When_We_Were_Orphans

As I write this I'm also in the opening throes of his Norwegian Wood. In any case, After the Quake did nothing to halt my appreciation for his work. Despite the fact that many of his themes are here regurgitated. It's true, the flow of love for Haruki Murakami continues unabated.That's not to say that there aren't high and low points in the collection of short stories. In fact a couple of the stories are merely Good.In any case, in the wake of the Kobe Earthquake and Sarin gas attacks in 1995 and drafting on the slipstream of the amazing Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, Murakami penned each of the shorts in the volume as some sort of response to the titular disaster. Each story is written in the third person (an uncommon POV for Murakami) and deals with the lives and souls of characters in the days and months succeeding the destruction of the city.The book's opener ""UFO in Kushiro"" offers up a vignette that belongs thematically right next to works like Wind-Up Bird and Sputnik Sweetheart. An empty man, a shell since before his wife left him, runs an errand that takes him to far away Hokkaido, where he may or may not just happen to run into his soul. Being familiar with Murakami by this point, the story felt comfortable and lived-in, but I have to imagine that it would be rather abrupt for first-time Murakami readers.The second piece, ""Landscape with Flatiron,"" presents another level of tension (as the first story leaves the reader perhaps slightly on edge) and continues to draw the reader into the hollow lives of people who seem to see just beyond the world we inhabit. ""All God's Children Can Dance"" was my least favourite of of the tales and features a a man deeply unsure of his place in the world, struggling with his own genetic fallacy, having been told that he was the Son of God from his youth and having a tremendous penis as his only evidence of this supposition. ""Thailand"" was enjoyable and follows a woman vacationing in Thailand around as she finds answers to spiritual questions she did not know she had.Unquestionably my favourites in the collection are the final two offerings: ""Super Frog Saves Tokyo"" and ""Honey Pie."" The former opens with a bank employee coming home to find a man-sized frog waiting to speak with him about important matters—the prevention of imminent doom to the city of Tokyo. This was absolutely a joy to read. The latter is utterly pleasant and, in a way, in so doing defies expectations. Murakami is many things and his genius is sometimes unpredictable, but I was shocked by how... pleasant... this tale was.When all is done, said, and forgotten, Murakami's book will still be about men and women in this cold world who are shaken from their stupor and confronted with the opportunity to fill their hollowed-out lives with that undetected mass that had been missing from them the entire time. The Kobe earthquake acts as a catalyst for each of them, forcing self-evaluation, even when it comes in forms that cannot be recognized as self-evaluation.Awesome little book....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,Apr 2008,"Jun 11, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45313.After_the_Quake

I find his storytelling fascinating, both in device and in style. His use of the extraordinary-as-mundane is a tasty joy for me to indulge. Sputnik Sweetheart, while not as wonderful an experience as the two aforementioned works, was quite a bit of quick fun.Thematically not dissimilar from Wind-up Bird, this short novel revels in questions of identity, conscious vs. subconscious, the real vs. hidden world, and the nature of sexuality. The book is lean and packed with Murakami-style mystery—that is, both mystery in the detective sense and mystery in something closer to a Pauline sense, a revelation that is baffling to those who don't get it and uncanny to those who do.Sputnik Sweetheart revolves around three characters: 1) the largely passive narrator, K, a thirty-year-old elementary school teacher and passionate reader who is madly in love with 2) Sumire, a former classmate of K's who dropped out of school to become a writer and who has fallen madly in love with 3) Miu (whom Sumire calls her ""Sputnik Sweetheart""), a married woman who imports wine, has a hidden past, and holds no ability to care sexually for her husband, Sumire, or really any other creature. All three are tortured by their own lives and despite the plot involving Sumire's abrupt disappearance off a secluded Greek island (a la L'Avventura), the story is less about the disappearance and K's subsequent investigation, and more a discussion of who people are and what is it that both separates and binds humanity from and to itself.Sputnik Sweetheart is not the best I've read from Haruki Murakami, but it was certainly worthwhile and a book I hope to revisit in a few years....more",Notes are private!,0,102,1,not set,Apr 2008,"May 26, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45316.Sputnik_Sweetheart

Granted, many of the novels I've read over the last two years have not been spectacular. There was The Lovely Bones. And then The Ass and the Angel. And then His Dark Materials. And others, none of which I would recommend spending any time with.Wind-Up Bird on the other hand was worth every moment spent burning through its 610 pages. It was mysterious, absorbing, and informative. Murakami writes in a form and style that makes the act of reading as simple as consuming a volume of Harry Potter. His prose is neither dense nor confusing. It's not his words that propose depth but his ideas.On top of engaging philosophies of death and identity and epistemology, Murakami couches his world here in a system of reality far more encompassing than our own. His is both reality and meta-reality and the boundary between both permeable and malleable. Things from the realm of mystery make themselves known in the realm of the normal. And contrawise. A wound taken in a dreamworld manifests itself in the waking world and a weapon carried in the waking is available in the dream.So then is there really any difference? And if so, then does such a difference matter.At heart, The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle seems to be an exploration of fate, of destinies unbidden and prophecies unalterable. Murakami's flaccid protagonist, Toru Okada, moves from passivity to activity as he struggles either to engage his destiny or bend fate to his own need (which one, which one?). There are so many aspects to the story that move characters around outside of their own willpower that Fate clearly has the upper hand, but still, it's fun to watch the struggle.The story begins when Okada's cat goes missing and his wife Kumiko asks him to find it. Or maybe it begins earlier, when Kumiko gets pregnant. Or maybe it begins still earlier when Kumiko's sister dies. Or earlier still, during the years leading up to WWII. Whatever the case, everything is connected through gossamer tendrils of fate and pain and anguish and collective identity.And then there's the wind-up bird, the unseen bird whose cry sounds like a spring being wound—the bird who winds up the world, a stand-in for fate who propels things and people to and fro, loosing and staunching the flow of life and the stream of reality.This was the second book of Murakami's I have indulged—the first was [book:Kafka on the Shore, a number of years ago—and I can't wait to read it again. Wind-Up Bird is actually far more easily understood that Kafka and despite the same presence of such a magical reality, the story elements more easily combine to paint a sensible landscape. Still, Wind-Up Bird leaves plenty robed in mystery and will give readers a feast of afterthoughts (I spent my lunch break scouring the internet for critique—to little avail, alas!). The dialogue is crisp and occasionally crackles, especially where the Kasahara character is at play.I have only one thing to say in criticism of the book. In a climactic chapter, the protagonist explains everything (to some extent) to the reader and another character. I felt ripped off by this, as if the author couldn't trust me to be engaged enough to piece things out on my own, though my conclusion had been identical. (Though from reading some of the Amazon s from people who still didn't get it, I suppose it was necessary after all.) Unless we're not meant to trust Okada's interpretation... Okada certainly has his own doubts, but it didn't seem to me that Murakami was trying to capitalize on the whole untrustworthy narrator bit—he seems more interested in more interesting matters.In any case, awesome book.

While a mere presentation of the jacket designs themselves would be a worthwhile scheme for a design collection such as this, the work is elevated by helpful descriptions both of product and process by the creator himself as well as reactions penned by authors/victims of his creative process. Kidd's text shows both a joy in his work and a look into what goes into the crafting of a book jacket that enlarges upon the work it contains—and does so with humour and more apparent humility than I would have expected.I found the book so interesting that I blew through the entire thing in two days. Doubtlessly, I'll return to it time and again over the coming months and years. In any case, I highly recommend it to those interested in thoughtful design, a pairing of words too rare in our day.note: a big bone of contention is not the visual design of the volume's cover but its physical properties. While its dimensions are perfectly suitable for an art collection/coffee table read, the unique composition of its cover can be difficult to negotiate. The hardback cover only extends (front and back) to the point of the spine of the book photographed on the cover. Inside the hardback cover is a paperback cover that extends to house the rest of the book. It is awkward, certainly, and took a bit of getting used to, but once I became accustomed to the book, holding it comfortably ceased to be a difficulty.

Unfinished books can be interesting to read to view the storytelling process in the midst of its evolution, but are rarely satisfying as stories in their own right. Némirovsky's work here is perhaps more polished than a simple draft, but even her notes suggest that the finished chapters and two volumes that *were* published are not likely how they would appear in her final product.So then, what about what we are given?It's, well, pretty good. It's not riveting by any means. There is no climax to her first act (""Storm in June"") and her second act plays out pretty softly (appropriately enough for a section entitled ""Dolce""). While each segment picks up interest in later chapters, both start off at such a slowburn that many readers won't make it past a hundred pages. Character-wise, Némirovsky doesn't provide the reader with many sympathetic characters either. Not only are almost all the inhabitants of her story arrogant hypocrites, but they are almost universally uninteresting as well.The first book is a pile of vignettes describing the circumstances of several families and individuals as they flee Paris on the eve of its fall into German hands on 14 June 1940. The narrative is as disorganized and haphazard, perhaps, as was the exodus it chronicles. There are flourishes of course and moments of interest (notably a chapter written from the perspective of a cat in heat), but on the whole it functions better as documentary than as story. The second book is easily superior, but much slower paced. There are more sympathetic characters and much more time for introspection. In a way, book two (""Dolce"") could function as some sort of Jane Austen work, only with Nazis and crap.Back to characters. Reading, Suite Française, I first thought that Némirovsky was an out-and-out misanthrope, despising all humanity, no matter its form or station. Gradually, I came to see that there is a certain class of person whom Némirovsky bears little ill will and seems to believe at least capable of being both genuine and rational. Those people seem to fit in the lower middle class and be young enough to still see beauty in the world (the Michaud couple are only in their early forties or so, and are an exception to the youthfulness qualification). Her sympathetic characters are the Michauds, Jean-Marie Michaud, Lucile, the young engaged couple fleeing from Paris on their wedding day, Bruno (the German soldier staying with Lucille's family), Madeleine (to some extent), and Hubert (after he rejects the hypocrisy and privilege of his class).I should note I really did appreciate Némirovsky's ability to describe the hypocrisies of her characters through the various perspectives of her other characters. This actually makes it a little more difficult to pin down the author's own feelings toward others.I'd be curious to read Némirovsky's other works to see how she paints the classes as a general rule, but if they're not more interesting books than Suite Française, I think I'll skip....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,not set,"Feb 28, 2008","Feb 29, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43944.Suite_Fran_aise

He presents stories in a workmanlike fashion, neither embracing literary elegance or dwelling overlong on that which does not forward the story itself, and yet he offers a rollicking good time. His characters are all interesting and his narrative twists retain reader interest. He is not a great author, but he is certainly a good author. And sometimes, good is just what the doctor ordered.Both halves of Magician (Apprentice and Master) are incredibly entertaining. The whole story spans about a decade and the changes in character design are sometimes remarkable (certainly this is the case as we see the two principles develop from teenagers into adults who only vaguely resemble their former selves). The book features the typical inhabitants of fantasy kingdoms: elves, dwarves, goblins, kobolds, and dragons all dwell within fighting distance of their more mundane human neighbours. Magic plays a role as well. But things quickly turn to something more than your average sword-and-sorcery epic. Portals to whole other planets are opened and wars begin for military as well as cultural dominance. Apart from the more overt aspects of these clashes, Feist excels at portraying the fascinating internecine struggles that plague the human kingdom above and beyond the obvious conflict delivered to their gates via these strange portals.If you are looking for a light read that might cater to compulsive reading in either bed or bathroom, Magician: Apprentice and Magician: Master may just fit the bill (I figured since I had already opened the floodgates of clichés, a couple more wouldn't kill us anymore than the first had)....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,not set,"Feb 05, 2008","Feb 08, 2008",,School & Library Binding,view (with text),/book/show/43913.Magician

Mike Mignola has create a gruff-but-lovable character and a lovably gruff cast. There are currently nine graphic collections (Hellboy found initial publication in serially released chapters in comic book form) exploring his world and investigations into myth, folklore, and the paranormal. Mignola's art perfects Hellboy's mood and the flow of action and thought throughout each story.The books are another matter. The fact is: Hellboy just does not properly translate into other media, whether prose or cinema or animation. In fact, he doesn't even translate into his own native medium when presented by creators other than Mignola. So it's no surprise that The Bones of Giants might not be the best thing I've read this year.Author Christopher Golden crafts a story that is a little bit fun and adventurous. He's got some of the mythic and horror elements that make Mignola's series such a joy. He even ties into some of the obscure shorter stories that Mignola wrote in the mid-'90s (notably the Norwegian incident featuring King Vold). Yet, something is missing. It was like reading a report of what happened to Hellboy without actually living through it like one does with the comic format. Golden's style is straightforward and hits all the right story points, yet despite the presence of Mignola's art illuminating the text, it's just not a Hellboy book. The Bones of Giants, put simply, is missing its heart.There's also an obnoxious section in which a vision is recounted for a couple pages in italics. That is exactly the point where I put the book down when I tried to read it a few years ago.

And I would have too - if it weren't for that sheer enormity of suckiness that was the third book in the series (The Amber Spyglass). *sigh* But then, life doesn't actually work out perfectly for us as often as we'd like. Sometimes there are earthquakes that level cities in Turkey. Sometimes Spinach is found to test positive for Salmonella. Sometimes a country introduces democracy to another. And sometimes, just sometimes, Philip Pullman writes a book.Now I don't want it to sound like the series is the worst ever written. It's not. It's not even the worst I've ever read. Not entirely anyway. The fact is there are three books and they should be treated separately before we get to the series as a whole. So then, to the ! (times three.)Oh yeah. And there'll be some spoilers in there. Not that it matters. Seriously.________________The Golden CompassA third of the way into Pullman's first installment of His Dark Materials, I was excited. While Pullman wasn't the most eloquent of writers and his characters had yet to really develop at all, it was clear he had an exciting imagination and was as good at world-building as nearly any fantasy author. He had developed an alternate history for our world that while completely foreign was largely analogous to our own that it didn't seem like a different world entirely. They have science and electricity and particle physics and everything - they just call it by a different name.The real joy and conceit of the series though is Pullman's use of daemons, animal expressions of every character's soul. These familiars are constant companions of every human, expressing through their animal nature the nature and quality of their human companion. And the daemons of children have yet to find a stabilized form and so flit forth and back and over and again through a host of forms - from owl to ermine to tabby to dolphin to moth to monkey. Et cetera.Throughout the first book's clumsy storytelling, there is still something that approaches near to wonder. Enough to satisfy some readers. The first four-fifths of the narrative are brisk and enjoyable, and the book only begins to falter when Lyra (the heroine) leaves the bear kingdom to meet her first-act climax. Pullman stumbles through an expository patch here and a finale that comes off as slightly less than readable. The book, much like The Fellowship of the Ring ends without an ending, leaving the conclusion for future installments.________________The Subtle KnifeTypically, the middle chapter in a trilogy is its weak point, so the greater turn toward mediocrity wasn't so worrisome and I didn't quite see in it the grave portent that I ought to have (hindsight, eh?). The second installment introduces a hero into the mix. Will, who is on the cusp of his teen years just like Lyra, actually hails from our world. And through happy accident or fate or dull contrivance both finds himself in league with Lyra and the chosen wielder of a knife that can cut through the fabric between worlds. The two team up and have a number of relatively dull adventures as we learn more about the great war brewing between heaven and earth and about the prophecy that Lyra is to be the new Eve and that she is to perpetrate a great betrayal and the freedom of all the worlds is at stake. Also introduced is an ex-nun-now-particle-physicist named Mary Malone who is prophesied to be the serpent/tempter to Lyra's Eve.An interesting set-up for the final book despite being introduced by three-hundred pages of boredom punctuated by moments of ingenuity and interest.________________The Amber SpyglassBook three was just a mess. It's almost nonsensical as it strives against reason and its own narrative to bring the story to some kind of resolution. The great betrayal prophesied? Not really a betrayal at all. Lyra being tempted? Never happens. Mary playing the role of the serpent? Nope. She just kind of stands around. Oh, and the big plan to take war to heaven and kill God? Has nothing to do with anything in the story really. Though they do end up killing the Enoch from some world. The last 250 pages are baffling. There is no climax. The plot contrivances are painful. I'm not even sure what the point of the story was. Things happen because in Pullman's mind they need to, not because it would make any sense for something to happen a certain way.It's hard to believe it but this book was worse actually than The Da Vinci Code. At least that was merely stupid. This was stupid, senseless, and (perhaps worst of all) boring. It's what I imagine Eragon would have been if I would have made it past page one hundred.________________So then, as a whole? His Dark Materials is bad news for readers. From a moderately strong start it quickly turns into a preachy, meandering production of less than an infinite number of monkeys typing for slightly less than eternity. This is probably what half those monkeys would hit upon after about a year and a half. Pullman sets in motion things in volume one that never bear fruit. He never satisfactorily explains the things that one would expect that he should have explained. He provides no climax. His narrative is a shambles. He creates a character (Father Gomez), sends him on a mission to kill Lyra, follows him around for an inordinate amount of time, and then kills him without there ever being a confrontation between himself and his prospective victim. And then there are the mulefa. Don't get me started.Additionally, his characters are cardboard cutouts who express whichever motive Pullman decides is necessary - no matter the fact that there is no reasonable expectation that these characters should behave so. The aeronaut decides really out of the blue that he loves Lyra (a girl he doesn't even really know) like a daughter and will do anything to protect her. The principle witch meets Mary Malone, talks with her for a few minutes, and then declares them sisters for life. It's all just baffling. Recently, having criticized those who expressed how well-written the series is, I was put to notice that His Dark Materials has won a number of awards. I find this a chilling revelation and it wasn't 'til I recalled that Left Behind was a phenomenal bestseller that I was comforted that this was just business as usual for a civilization that is so steeped in mediocrity that it awards the title of Greatness to that which dare not even approach the servant quarters of Greatness for fear of overstepping its bounds. I think people want so badly to think highly of something, to think it the next whatever-recently-great-thing-comes-to-mind, that they abandon all sense of what is in order to do so.Shame on Philip Pullman and shame on our society for encouraging such dreck.

If not autobiographical, American Born Chinese is the kind of story that might very well be.Examining the difficulty with which a child born in one country from parents of another country, the author explores the kind of dissatisfaction common to many in similar circumstances. The desire to blend in, the need to eliminate traces of heritage. I've never felt these things in my life, but through Yang's story, I could begin to understand in a manner other than pure academic assent.Yang weaves three narratives together in a masterful way and each sings of a different life's lesson. There is the story of the Monkey King (the classic Chinese figure), the story of Jin and his difficulty fitting into a school in which he is the only student of Chinese descent, and the story of Danny, who is plagued by his ridiculous cousin Chin-Kee (who is appears as a stereotyped caricature complete with affected speech - Ls for Rs and vice versa). Strangely, the Chin-Kee episodes actually carry a laugh track.It should be notable that the only bad thing I have to say about the book was that I didn't find it as good as its hype. Yang's book picked up a fistful of worthy awards last year. Not just Best Graphic Novel awards but several Best Book Awards.* As good as it was, I'd read better and while I would recommend it to anyone, I can't see myself reading it more than a couple more times if I live to seventy.*note: Best Book Awards from Publisher's Weekly, School Library Journal, and San Francisco Chronicle.

Wednesday was important because it was new comics day, but there was a more important reason. My local would make an effort to get interesting works by indie publishers, little known pieces of particular wonder and delight. But not a big effort. It would typically get one of each of these books. So I would get there at lunch on Wednesday so that I would be the one to scoop up all the cool books.That was where I encountered Troy Little's Chiaroscuro. And loved it.The only problem was that either it stopped being produced or I wasn't getting there early enough. In any case, I had the first seven issues (save for #2 - which I was evidently too late to get). Still, even after six years or so, the memory of the book lingered and I would very occasionally check Amazon on the off chance that somehow the series survived and would be collected for me to purchase. And lo, the fruit of my diligence has paid off at last.Last night, I blew through the 234-page hardcover in a single sitting (it was easier maybe because I had already read half the book in its periodical form). It was worth it, but now I want more and hope I don't have to wait another six years.Chiaroscuro tells of a young man haunted. By ghosts, by mystery, by his inability to fill a canvas. Steve is a painter. Or so he says. He never actually does much to his canvas save stare at it in that understated horror that unlimited potential barters and trades in on a natural and daily basis. Along the way he hangs out with friends, gets drunk a lot, meets a girl, gets the crap kicked out of him, and mocks the artistry elite for their pretentious sanctimony.It's better than it sounds. A lot better. And the art is gorgeous. Little's lines are confident and well-placed. I know this  cannot be wholly unbiased as I approached the work with that kind of sentimental taste in my mouth that presents the kind of experience in which Little would have to suck pretty bad for me to give him a negative  here. Still, I hope to think that I really did enjoy this book as much as I enjoyed it.I only had one quibble: the story is not complete. At least I presume it isn't. It says ""Book I"" on the cover, which leads me to believe that this is merely Act I in a great story. Otherwise, I would have to reevaluate the story as some kind of experimental narrative. It would probably still succeed, but not as greatly. In any case, I can't wait for Book 2....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,Nov 2007,"Nov 21, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1612587.Chiaroscuro

From my to-read pile I pulled the recently purchased Houdini: The Handcuff King. I was excited because I love Jason Lutes’ work (as previously seen in Jar of Fools and Berlin). And really, this book did not disappoint. There were, however, two surprises for me.[image]Surprise #1: While Jason Lutes penned the story that comprises the book’s narrative, he did not contribute to its art. Really this should not have been a surprise as the cover plainly says Nick Bertozzi immediately beneath Lutes’ own name and the art on the cover is plainly not the work of Lutes’ established style. At first, this surprise was a disappointment to me—like when you think your glass has Pepsi in it but your first sip reveals apple juice instead. But after my initial shock, I came to appreciate Bertozzi’s line and recognized that he really was a good choice for the book.Bertozzi does do some fantastic work in the book, managing crowd scene after crowd scene with enough visual grace that the reader never suspects just how terribly dull it must have been to compose these pages. And even in the midst of these ink-saturated pages, it is never difficult to see where the action is. Bertozzi does a stand-up job of directing the reader’s eye and conveying the tension of the moments—moments that could easily have been lost had the artist been too detailed or too simplistic in his execution. [image]Surprise #2: I had brought a book to busy me during the ninety-minute drive, but finished it within forty-five minutes. Houdini is not a long book. There is plenty to look at but little text per page, which makes it a fairly quick read. Wholly apart from disappointing, the brisk pace of the story was refreshing. I closed the back cover satisfied with a mid-morning snack of graphic reading.When initially approaching the book, I did not know what to expect. With the blue note set by Lutes’ prior works, I thought this might be an exploration of Houdini’s last days and unforeseen death. Instead the narrative picks up on a morning nearly a full decade before his mortality asserted itself and climaxes later that same day, presenting a slice of Houdini’s life, a splash of what made him great. And a snapshot of the people Houdini relied upon to feed that greatness. [image]Houdini: The Handcuff King is really a charming little story and I would pleasantly recommend it to anyone with an hour to kill.[ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,Nov 2007,"Nov 15, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/487581.Houdini

Death Note is a seat-edged battle of wOver the past three weeks I've been burning through one of the most exciting reads I've come across in a while. Death Note is a seat-edged battle of wits that left me exhausted by the end. Heck, I was exhausted by the halfway mark.Let me start over. Death Note is a Japanese comic that tells it's story over the course of twelve volumes (on display now at your local Borders). If what I'm about to say sounds good but you don't feel like spending the eight dollars per volume, head to your local library - they almost certainly carry the books in the Young Adults section. In any case, it's worth your time. Here's why.The story begins when Ryuk, a death god (known in the story's mythology as shinigami), drops a death note into the human world in order to alleviate the boredom that oppresses his everlasting life. A death note is a special notebook possessed by shinigami that allow them to take the lives of humans whose names they write into the notebook. Ryuk's dropped notebook ""happens"" to fall into the path of Japan's top high school student, son of the chief of police, and all around genius, Light Yagami.After a couple tests of the book's authenticity and the boundaries of some of its rules (e.g., one must visualize the face of the person whose name he is writing for that person to die), Light decides that he will forge a new world, a utopia in which all criminals (those would would take advantage of the weakness of others) simply die. Rather quickly, the police around the world begin taking notice of the staggering number of criminals who have suddenly dropped dead of heart attacks. Suspecting foul play, they want to find the perpetrator because law-and-order and vigilantism have never been the best bed-fellows. And it doesn't help that Light has gained a popular following amongst the masses who dub him Kira (which sounds remarkably similar to the Japanese pronunciation of the English word, ""killer""). So the authorities enlist the assistance of the world's greatest detective (an anonymous man known only as L) and he quickly narrows the range of suspects dramatically, instigating a pulse-pounding game of of cat-and-mouse between the figures - L vs. Kira.Initially, as exciting as the first couple volumes were, I had a hard time seeing how the story could sustain itself across twelve volumes. The key to Death Note's happy success is the absence of anything really resembling a status quo. The story and its elements are continually in flux. If things remained simple, I could see the book resolving in four or five volumes but everything is constantly moving, constantly changing. It was a fantastic read.And smart. The fact that you're reading about these very intelligent characters who think things through to incredible lengths only adds to the excitement. There were moments of revelation and counter-revelation that simply blew my mind. And then there are moments when you think the jig is up for one or more of the characters and then a flashback will reveal the would-be victims plan from the start and you get to see tables turn and over turn as these characters fight for their lives.And even after that, the moral question that is explored by the book's author and artist really goes to lengths to get the reader thinking about means and ends and it's not at all clear who one should root for. It helps that Light, despite having an ego that won't quit, is entirely unselfish in his motivation. Death Note is almost a distillation of an important moral question.In short, I highly recommend this series to just about anyone....more",Notes are private!,0,76,1,not set,Oct 2007,"Nov 01, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13615.Death_Note_Vol_1

The book veers from scene to scene with little reliance upon typical story contrivances such as physics or biology or narrative flow. And frankly, Street Angel is probably the better for it, trusting instead upon the reader's ability to absorb the book's abstract sense and promotion of humour. Some of my favourite moments include Jesse's usurpation of a police megaphone, the tale of conquistadors (pirates) vs. ninjas, and the retrospective of black hero, Afrodisiac.In the end, it's a perfectly enjoyable book that will likely have a short shelf-life for most readers.Here's an eight-page p courtesy of SLG....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,Oct 2007,"Oct 18, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/893511.Street_Angel

That said, for most of its running time, Ludlum's 1980 novel is better than the movie. The premise is so much more intriguing and Bourne's turmoil better perceived. Instead of an enemy as doughy and effeminate as cloak and dagger U.S. senators and secret servicemen, the novel pits Bourne against the unbeatable assassin, Carlos the Jackal (though Ludlum refrains from the colourful animamorphism), and his vast array of human resources. The book is action-packed, one of those thrillaminnut rides that refuses, for the most part, to let up. I don't read cheap thrillers often, but The Bourne Identity was worth my time.And I like to think that my time is valuable.This is not to say that Ludlum's thriller is not without fault. The book's requisite romance is rushed and artificial. We know that Bourne and his interest are in love solely because Ludlum tells us that this is the case, not because we see any evidence that this should be the case. And, actually, there is a far greater problem. The climax is poorly wrought and much more difficult to follow than anything previous encountered in the book.

I received the last two hardcover volumes of the collection (vol. 7 and 8) for my birthday at the end of July and began reading from start to finish in mid-August. It's true that one could possibly read the entire collection - and a handsome collection it is - in a day (at perhaps two hours per volume), but I didn't feel compelled to rush things.In Buddha, Tezuka presents a curious blend of themes and styles. This project, ten years in production (1974-1984), presents the life of Siddartha Gautama, the Buddha, from birth to death, capitalizing on famous episodes and creating fictional ones as well. Tezuka includes a robust cast of characters both fictional and historical that waxes and wanes over the near-century that the story narrates.Not being a Buddhist, I have no idea how well Tezuka's tale reflects either the historical man or the religious conception of him (though genuine Buddhist's seem to like the book - and I don't know if Tezuka was Buddhist or not, though it seems likely or plausible). But one thing is for certain, I cannot see a similar book being crafted about the life of Christ and being well-received. And a similar version of the life of Mohammed would end in bombs, death threats, and ambassadors demanding apologies.Because the thing is: Tezuka's tale is as irreverent as it is reverrent.He clearly thinks highly of Buddha and his teachings. And yet, the books is filled with jokes and antics and all kinds of nuttiness. Pokes and jabs at Buddha himself are rare (though present), but there are a constant stream of silly asides, even in the midst of what would otherwise be a sober scene, fraught with drama. A horse will gallop in on a messenger to deliver dire news to the king. A character will be confronted by his haunted conscience, seeing a vision of Buddha speaking to him - only to have Buddha bite him on the face and we realize he's been talking to his horse. Characters from Tezuka's other works show up not infrequently and even Tezuka himself will appear in cameos, taking the place of a character for a single panel.The story is also filled with anachronisms as well. Both visual and verbal. At one point, a poor peasant family wishes to send their son with Siddartha as he follows the path of monkhood, claiming that their son should be able to become a monk ""in this day when even actors can become president."" There are further references to Paris and New York and Spielberg. And E.T. and Yoda even make appearances, and at one point a royal councilor asks if Buddha actually is E.T. (as Buddha has just healed someone with the touch of a finger).It took me a while to get a handle on exactly how to approach the book. The fact of the sheer silliness of moments. The fact of the gorgeous and highly detailed landscapes intruded upon by Disney-esque cartoon characters. The fact of main characters who die 300 pages in to the 3000-page epic. The fact that every woman in the book is topless. The fact of mixing faith and fantasy so seamlessly in a book that I believe is trying to promote the teachings of Buddha. And the fact that Buddha isn't even born until the end of the first volume. It was a weird mix, but after not too long, I found myself quite at home with his unique style and let the story wash over me.All in all, I found it both interesting and fun. And surprising. Characters you expect to be redeemed end tragically and characters you expect to turn their back on Buddha turn out to be some of his biggest boosters. Add to the religious story the sheer scope of the political story and you've got an action-packed tale of religious enlightenment.I still couldn't really tell you what Buddhism's about though....more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,not set,Sep 2007,"Sep 19, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/315617.Buddha_Vol_1

I understand that he previously wrote something of an autobiography but I cannot vouch for that work. It is Empty Horses that has earned my love and adoration.Niven, above all things, is a storyteller; and his recountment of the Hollywood heyday (essentially the '30s through the 50's) is magical exploration of an era that was at once special and something impossible to mimic. Never again will a particular zeitgeist carry the particular bouquet that lilted through the rarified air of the Tinseltown of those glamour years. It's an era impossible to imagine. Yet Niven was there.And because he was there, we are there as well.Niven's recollection bounces from larger-than-life personality to other of the like. Errol Flynn. Clark Gable and Carole Lombard. Cary Grant. Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons. Bogart and Bacall. Marlene Dietrich. Selznick and Mayer. Judy Garland. And some guy who went by Mike Romanoff, opened a popular restaurant, and pretended to be a nephew-prince of Tsar Nicholas II. Niven really does collect a panoply of stories and, in effect, writes a biography of Hollywood itself.I cannot recommend Bring on the Empty Horses highly enough.

But nothing particularly mind-blowing.This was my third read and probably the first time I was ever able to approach the book without expectations. And this time? I enjoyed the book much more.Moore really is smart about the way he lays things out and despite his occasionally stilted story and dialogue (by design I presume), he really does present a twisting and mysterious story speculating how a more realistic world might react to superheroes and masked adventurers. Some caveats: the books colouring job is pretty awful (I hear the Absolute Edition resolves this issue) and despite the fact that the Tales of the Black Freighter is engaging if one can pay attention to it, I still find its use as a metaphor a bit heavy-handed.Anyway, I'd say Watchmen is worth a read, both for its historical context and for its visual/textual intricacies....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,Aug 2007,"Aug 10, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/472331.Watchmen

But thatI thought of several different ways in which to begin this  - several witty comparisons that would surely catch the reader's attention. But that was a month and a half ago. See, I started reading Blue Like Jazz on the 20th of July and it is now the 4th of October. I have four pages left and I'm not sure I have the strength to continue.For you see: Donald Miller is wearying. Endlessly self-amused and self-absorbed, he seems to want nothing so much as to be hip, cool, edgy (despite his own protests that hip, edgy, and cool are vanities and wastes of time and energy). And if four years of highschool taught me anything, it is that everyone with a heart is thoroughly and deeply embarrassed when the Very Not Cool Guy walks in and tries to be cool. Think: The Offspring's ""Pretty Fly for a White Guy.""The thing is: Christianity cannot be cool. There is no reason non-believers should see Christianity as anything even on the same plane as Cool. Christianity says and believes terrifying things about the non-believer. Forget the homosexuals a minute - Christianity says that the friendly, tax-paying, socially-active, community-leading paragon of virtue who doesn't bow the knee to Christ is horribly sinful and an actual enemy of God. No matter how kind and cool they are. For Christianity to become cool, it has to stop having anything to do with Christ and his message. Maybe Donald Miller wants that. It kinda seems like it, but who can say - since he's not that great at expressing anything beyond his own meandering and fleeting feelings on matters.About two-thirds into the book, a friend (who won't receive and identity via nickname, such as Tony the Beat Poet or Andrew the Protester) ask me what kind of a book it was. I had a hard time describing it at first. Then I realized: OMG!! I'm reading a blog on paper! LOLZ!! KBAI! Really, Miller's book is nothing more than a glorified blog in its meandering promise to get to a point that never comes. In reality, Miller would make a much better blogger than he does a writer. Unfortunately, even as a blogger, he would only be so good - because despite moments of value and bits that come close to insight, his style is heavy-handed and obvious for too much of the book's 240 pages (I know, only 240 pages and it's taken me almost two-and-a-half months!). I think his would probably sit in the Occasional Reads section of my blogroll, checked only so often for fodder for my own blog postings—and only out of some sense of duty because he linked to me first.One good-but-obvious point Miller makes throughout the book is that the human expression of Christianity in the contemporary American church is lacking at best, gravely flawed at worst, but most likely, somewhere in between. This is clearly true. But also clearly known to probably most of us. And the real problems are not often the ones that Miller is pointing out - he seems frequently upset at how little the church fits in with a world filled with lovely sinners. Yet still, there is value in his critique.But not much. Again Miller shows himself to be like too many bloggers; and like too many bloggers, he has much criticism and too few answers. If he were a blogger, this might be acceptable; after all, the only cost associated with reading a blog is time (and perhaps mental health). A book, however, is paid in currency. There is real loss if a book does not measure up to its published value - and Blue Like Jazz does not. I hate to say that because there are a few amusing stories and I get the feeling the book wants to be useful - but it just isn't....more",Notes are private!,0,188,1,not set,Jul 2005,"Jul 10, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7214.Blue_Like_Jazz

IfMy experience of Neil Gaiman and his estimable oeuvre is, in large part, a recent acquirement, having come into being over the last year and a bit. If you don’t count an earlier, regrettable experience with Sandman—an experience than by no means offered justice either to Gaiman or his grainy little fellow. Or indeed to myself as a reader. I feel fortunate that Anansi Boys came along and changed everything.Because otherwise, I might not have given Eternals its due shot. And that would have been sad.When I was a wee Danish (jelly-filled), I had the good fortune to inherit a veritable mess of comics that included some real finds among which were the entire original series of Silver Surfer, several giant-sized Hulk books, and ancient and collected reprints of some of the greatest Kirby-era Fantastic Four. And an entire run of another Kirby invention, The Eternals.I’ll be honest here. Either I was not a very discriminating fifth grader or the Great Jack Kirby wasn’t exactly on his game when he came up with this super group, based, I hear, on ruminations inspired by Chariot of the Gods. I suppose that the truth of the matter lies in all likelihood betwixt these two precarious compass points. In any case, I didn’t really catch the fire for the series and abandoned it both to my crappy-comic box and to that sector of my memory that is now and likely forever unreachable.And so, I am approaching the work, for all intents and porpoises, as a reader entirely unaware of the personalities and history intimate to the characters going by the nomenclature, Eternals. In essence, as you yourself would approach the work—presuming that you were intimately familiar with the visual vocabulary upon which works of comic storytelling are founded. I will assume this knowledge and allow you to debate my assumption wholly within the realm of your internal monologue in which you engage your mind, your heart, and your moral self.So then, Gaiman crafts a tale in which no prior knowledge of the Eternals is necessary for events have conspired to leave the Eternals themselves with no knowledge of either their longevity or their grand destiny. Gaiman allows the reader to be introduced to their fantastic world with all the shock, surprise, and inevitable confusion that the Eternals themselves experience. It is an indubitably strange experience. The story is wild and inventive and all those fantastic adjectives that book ers indiscriminately slather all over the backs of a a thousand books that grace the new release tables at Borders and Barnes & Noble across the span of any given year.I cannot be certain that Gaiman’s story will be memorable (at least I still remember now, but it’s only been a week and a half...), but I’m sure I wouldn’t mind reading it again some day. And that’s worth something. I do remember thinking both Woah and Huh on several occasions as Gaiman proceeded to blow my mind. That also must be worth something in whatever currency you call native. I was not initially certain that John Romita Jr.’s artwork would work for the story that Gaiman was telling. I love JRJR’s work on other, more mundane projects, but was concerned how it would serve this particular yarn. I needn’t have worried. While there are probably artists who might better capture both the grandiose and the pedestrian more capably, it did not mind their exclusion from this particular work. At the last, I will give Eternals my recommendation. Understand that this is not an unqualified recommendation—as there are a vast number of books that are more worthy. Still, there are a much vaster number of worse books out there and while this is no Anansi Boys, I can certainly claim to have enjoyed myself....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,Jul 2007,"Jul 07, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1021486.Eternals

EragoWhile not the worst book I've every had the displeasure of reading*, Nick Cave's work here may be the worst that I've both read and finished. Eragon? Gave up with extreme prejudice. Da Vinci Code? Accidentally left it in an airport bathroom in Denver with eleven pages left and did not care enough to visit the library to see how it ended. The Lovely Bones? Granted, I did finish it and it was bad, but it was a shiny, gold-plated sliver of heaven compared to And the Ass Saw the Angel, which I was unfortunately compelled to finish.Ah, the joy of being in a book club.The first thing one will notice in Cave's book is that the principal narrator is dense with a lugubrious sort of prose made up in striking part by words that won't be found in any dictionary (as they are made up). So dense, in fact, is the narration that it stifles to the point of petrification. The author himself describes the language as, ""kind of a hyper-poetic thought-speak, not meant to be spoken - a mongrel language that was part-Biblical, part-Deep South dialect, part-gutter slang, at times obscenely reverent and at others reverently obscene."" Cave forces the reader to invest a lot of work into deciphering a story that is far too slight to merit the effort. And I hate him for that.Well, not really. But maybe.In any case, with the exception of the first and last chapters, the entire tale is told in flashback by a single narrator, named Eucrid, using two different voices (one fantastical and the other only slightly more grounded in reality). Eucrid Euchrow, dying from the start, tells the tales of the divine vengeance he wreaked upon the odd religious community in his isolated Southern town and how he now dies with his glorious work complete. What is not at all clear until the last third is whether we should believe any of it. Euchrid, a mute from birth, is the product of mentally disabled man and a woman whose only nourishment is the moonshine she stills in their yard. He is, to be plain, quite insane.If Cave would have either held personal restraint or kept an editor worth more than the cost of a community college education, And the Ass Saw the Angel would have clocked in at novella-length of slightly more than a hundred pages - and would, by that measure, have made a terse, quirky, intriguing look at madness. Instead, Cave shows no wisdom of this kind and remorselessly fills over three hundred pages with a sprawling, cacophonous garble of madness. We cannot even say that he explores Euchrid's madness for there is neither consideration nor reflection. Only revelry.There were moments when I thought I might have a good (if offbeat) book in my hands. Moments of interpretive joy when it could be realized that things might not be as they seem. Pieces of prose that made me think that Cave really did know what he was doing, such as his description of a particular woman as a ""xylocephalic ogress."" But such rays of warm and happy light were always and inevitably to be short-lived, as Cave would draw the reader, nails scrabbling for some hold on light and sanity and good reading, inexorably back into his drearilous swampfief of monotonating garballations.Not, by any means, recommended. I read somewhere that Cave himself doesn't even think the book is any good.

But lo, this reading was in the bold and exciting Beowulf: a New Verse Translation by Seamus Heaney! And what a difference a day makes - Heaney is unstoppable! Rather, he makes Beowulf unstoppable. Unstoppable in his ability to pound you in the face with his manliness and leave you bleeding-but-strangely-desiring-more.As I said, I've read the epic Anglo-Saxon poem several times now, but usually, I'm trudging through to get to the ""good parts"" (i.e., Beowulf's three notable feats), but this time, I was taken aback! The whole durned thing was the good parts! What luck! I read it over the space of three days and boy is my voice tired (I have a distinct inability when it comes to facing these sorts of tales - I have to read aloud. And with an accent. And with bluster).One of the coolest things spicing up this reading (besides Heaney's great translation) was the juxtaposition of the Old English to the translation. As you may know, the only surviving copy of anything close to an original Beowulf is written in Old English (or Anglo-Saxon) from 'tween AD 700 and 1000. Now Old English isn't just archaic some King James English with lotsa thees, thous, and forsooths, as many people seem to think. It's the illegitimate birth father of Middle English (which I believe came about sometime after AD 1066) which in turn spawned Modern English. Modern English includes the English used in both Shakespeare and the King James Bible as well as the haphazard trash we sprechen today. In truth, Old English is nearly indecipherable. Below, I've included the first three lines of Beowulf, which are not only a great example of what I'm talking about, but strangely fitting for who I am: Hwæt wê Gâr-dena in geâr-dagum Þêod-cyninga Þrym gefrûnon, hû ðâ æÞelingas ellen fremedon.

Hoorah for Gâr-dena (and doesn't that sound like a wonderful name for a city?).In any case, it was fun to look over at the Anglo-Saxon to see if I could decipher any of it.

Now, growing into their own personalities and dreams and goals and tastes, they find that nothing lasts forever.It doesn't even last very long when everyone is petty, self-absorbed, and governed entirely by the convictions of others.

Apart from Blankets, he has only released one other major work of fiction. (His third, Habibi, will be released this Fall.) [image][The cutest of meet-cutes.]There are any number of reasons that Thompson's work should be lauded. His art is gorgeous and his brushline expressive. He treats personal topics with a sense of both whimsy and honesty. He writes true experiences, even when they're fictional. And as great as all those things are, there is one idea that stands out in his work that I've yet to see another creator tackle (let alone master) as Thompson has done.His sense of the sacred and his ability to convey it in ink is breathtaking. He offers his readers these holy moments, these frozen, fluid, organic treasures. These sacramentals. Whether he intends to lead the reader into a religious experience or not, his work really is very spiritual. As spiritual as an atheistic holy experience can actually be at any rate. There may be moments in Miyazaki that approach the wonder of the sanctuaries that Thompson builds in Blankets. It's for this reason (among others) that Thompson's second book remains one of my favourites, even years after having first encountered it.The sweetly disturbing sentimental journey that was seeded years earlier in Thompson's Goodbye Chunky Rice finds pregnant fruit in his nearly-600-page opus, Blankets. Semi-autobiographically chronicling (via chrono-thematic structuring) his early life—from his establishment in faith and his discovery of love to his abandonment of that love and his subsequent abandonment of faith—Thompson plays honestly at all times with his story elements, thereby lending his tale an uncanny credibility. And while flashbacks and tangents proliferate, the overarching chiastic structure verifies the reader's intuition that Thompson knows well where he is headed and is going to take you there whether you like it or not.[image][Kinda want to punch this lady right in the breadbox.]Thompson's illustrated avatar acts, at all times, with striking realism and the chaos of his thoughts is entirely believable—if not exactly illustrative of the average meditative development. The Thompson that frets and plays in Blankets—we'll call him Craig— is highly introspective and acts often in the heat of his youthful emotional turmoil, rather than from a simple, sensible motivation. And though one may often wish to chastise him for such sillinesses, his youthful passion and pendular over-reactions will more than likely endear Craig to readers as they recognize more than a little of themselves in him.This book is a masterpiece of form, symbol, and structure. Tokens bend and writhe and carry narrative significance throughout. Thompson's art here is fluid and is of that less-polished variety found also in Goodbye Chunky Rice and serves well to establish the variety of moods described in his several vignettes.[image]From the perspective of one who grew up both in a faith-community that was friendlier to the arts and in a home whose high standards weren't as strictly enforced, I found his story particularly compelling and tragic. Surrounded by hypocrisy and a weak-kneed, moralistic fundamentalism, the source of his disillusionment is not difficult to see. Perhaps Blankets' greatest quality is the empathy it exerts from the reader. I pitied and cared for Craig. I felt the same for his brother, his parents. I mourned for Raina, Craig's love interest in the book. I grew despondent for her family. More than anything, I wanted to hug each of these characters and make it all right and sensible again. [image][Man, how brutal to be Thompson's parents, years later to read this panel and think: ""Oh crap. I did that to a child? I wanted to surprise him and all he could think about was whether he had sinned? And not even whether he was in trouble but whether he had sinned?""]And the whole while, my anger kindled toward an institutionalization of faith whose expression was not compassion, not mercy, not love. That Craig lived in a locale whose cutural acumen was bent toward a fear and persecution of that which skewed from the status quo is a horror that can be understood (while still remaining a horror). That his subculture should behave identically, built on a foundation of fear when it ought to be built on joy, peace, and love is terrifying. Thompson's work engaged in me a fury for a people and place with which I have no experience. They may not even exist as he portrayed them, but at the least, it is a challenge for me to not hate these characters who actively tear down Craig's life even from a young age. And as someone who actively tries not to hate anyone, consider this a testament to the veracity with which Thompson draws out Craig's life and circumstance.Blankets is an evocative work that should not be missed by any who would appreciate a serious, heartfelt, and magical telling of the tragedy and wonder of what it means to come of age.[image][ courtesy of Good Ok Bad]...more",Notes are private!,0,253,1,not set,Jan 2003,"Jun 28, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25179.Blankets

(The book only advertises one.) Yuck.The book in question is Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones. I'm not giving anything away by saying it's a book about a girl (the narrator) who was murdered. That's revealed in the book's second sentence. It's also not a big deal to let you know she was raped and murdered by a neighbour, George Harvey. That all is related pretty early on. What isn't revealed until maybe the last fifty pages is that the girl herself, Susie Salmon, becomes a rapist.Ideologically, I'm not certain which one is worse. I could be persuaded.But the way the book presents the two incidents is markedly different. One is revealed in low lights and has a horror edge to it. It's seen unilaterally as an evil, wicked deed. The other is the book's highlight, the moment at which the author breathes a sigh of relief and says that everything else made right. I suppose it makes sense; the narrator probably wouldn't see her actions for what they were. But in the end, both George and Susie deal with their childhood victimizations in that manner typical to the criminal genre these days.Both George and Susie had horrible things happen in their formative years that leave long-lasting scars. The only difference is that George Harvey lived and Susie Salmon died. Not that it makes much difference. Susie is as alive a character as George for the purposes of the story. They both want what they want and care little for the well-being of the women who get in their way. The difference is that George Harvey is portrayed as the villain he is, while little Susie Salmon is treated as a hero.Those who have read the book may not have even noticed Susie's complete abandonment of moral sense or care for the woman she violates. After all, she doesn't exactly couch things in those terms. So here it is, laid out for you.When Susie was alive, there was a boy who liked her, Ray. In the years after her death, Ray grows up to be, in the narrator's view, an attractive young man. She watches him and loves him. Somehow, events conspire to allow Susie to possess the body of Ruth, a friend of Ray's. Susie uses the opportunity to seduce Ray and they make love several times in the course of a few hours. And then Susie has to go back to heaven. Leaving Ruth, a victim of Susie's power over her body.Imagine that you're Ruth. You wake up. Naked. Probably a little tender. Used. In the back of some bike shop. With a man in the shower. That's what I call horror. Not only was she not conscious or aware for any of the immediately preceding events, but the guy who's been really her only friend in the world is now naked and telling her that he screwed her brains out while she was unconscious. And even if he doesn't tell her that, there's a very short rail of evidence and it all points to that conclusion. And now. She could be pregnant. She could be diseased.Yep. The crowning act of love on the part of the tale's heroine is little more than a petty, rapacious act of power over the helpless woman who got in her way. Good job Susie Salmon. You and George Harvey should get along nicely.p.s. even though I called it a spoiler, I think that Alice Sebold spoiled the book.

Johnny Mad Dog is the tale of two teenagers participating in one of the seemingly perennial genocidal civil wars in Central Africa: one as aggressor and one as victim. The chapters alternate narrators between Johnny, the gun-toting kid who imagines himself an intellectual yet kills freely and without remorse and sees enemies everywhere, and Laokole, a girl caught in the midst of horror, fleeing with her legless mother and younger brother amongst the throng of terrified refugees. Johnny has a second-grade education and believes that true power comes from the barrel of a gun. Laokole is a week away from graduating at the top of her class in highschool with dreams of studying to become an engineer. The story plays out as the narrators live out concurrent events from wildly differing perspectives.The storytelling conceit is clever, but I'm not sure if it is just a poor translation, but there's rarely any life to the writing. The events themselves power the story, so I suppose that excellence in writing is unnecessary; but it would have been nice. Additionally, the book may have been more interesting had it sought to portray a more sympathetic individual as a member of the genocidal militia. With the sheer number involved in these killings, I'm skeptical that the entire aggressive force is constituted of morons (historically we see time and again people from everyday walks of life get caught up in national madness). The perspective of Johnny seems too easily dismissible, as if Dongala believes education to truly be the solution - which seems a little naive to me.At the end of the day, it was a worthwhile read.
