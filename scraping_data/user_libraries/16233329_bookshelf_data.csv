I didn’t understand the technique until Part 3 (this the reason I went looking for a summary). It’s told in 4 parts with a different voice in each part. Once I made it past the first 2 parts, I enjoyed Part 3 and 4. Part 1 is a fictional novel about a wealthy NY financier couple. Part 2 is an autobiography by the real NY financier (also fictional) in response to the novel. Part 3 is the ghost writer’s story of the time writing the autobiography. Part 4 is 50 years later as the ghost writer revisits the journals of the wife and uncovers the “real” story. I almost quit in Part 2 but it helps to know it’s only part of a larger story. PS.
