The Big Apple Having lived some years in New York, I felt and enjoyed the vibe of various city neighborhoods that the author describes with artistry. The Big Apple is one of the many characters of the book who are as diverse as the city itself. I found there was a parallel between the balance of the man walking a tightrope between the twin towers and the city trying to find an equilibrium and merge its different elements into a whole. At the beginning, we read different stories but there is a connection among the characters which is surprising and moving at the same time. Some descriptions were lengthy but colorful at the same time. Finally, despite the sadness and heartbreaking events, there is something promising about the eternal forward movement of the world. And it is about the essence of human relationships. It’s not only about truth but about honesty as well. McCann removes the masks from the faces of his characters. We see them at their worst and at their best. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"May 26, 2023","Jul 23, 2023","May 26, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5941033-let-the-great-world-spin

I am female, a little older than her but I come from another country, I am not Black and I can't begin to describe how different my experiences have been. Yet, this recount touched me deeply. First, I loved the title. We are all in the process of becoming. Michelle Obama sees becoming 'as a forward motion, a means of evolving, a way to reach continuously towards a better self.' This is something that resonated with me, that inspired me and that is consistently shown though the narrative. There is something very personable in the way she describes the cataclysmic changes in her life. There was honesty, dignity and optimism in her outlook on life and its challenges; there was compassion, love and care which lifted my spirits. She talks about how education helps boost self-confidence and the importance of having supportive parents. I can relate to that but I could see how she tries to instil hope in people who may have to work harder to overcome the lack of support and the invisibility. I liked that she showed how hard-work and perseverance produce results when you have the right people around you. She gave credit to everyone who helped her become who she is today. She mentions names. She talks about balance. I took pleasure in seeing that she too can be disheartened and vulnerable but there are always little window of opportunity and glimmers of hope. Finally, what I also enjoyed was that I gained an insight into the American politics and the White House etiquette and daily life. I learned a lot and this is important for me. Definitely a book worth reading. I hope that it inspired a lot of young women in the world. That said, I am wondering if she wrote it all by herself and what has been left unsaid but even so she was convincing in what she chose to say, for me at least. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"May 29, 2021","Oct 26, 2021","May 29, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38746485-becoming

I don’t know. Barnes talks about love and loss: it’s nearly impossible to describe it and it depends on the vantage point. What seems true and valid in your twenties and thirties is not so in your fifties. The main character who narrates his story remembers and reflects on memory: he is wondering if he is biased towards optimism or pessimism. Does it matter? Memory is there to serve you. I thought he described addiction accurately, the slow yet sure descent into destruction and oblivion. The inability of the lover to help his loved one. The cynicism of the person who has loved and lost, like Joan, the fear of giving it all again. I loved how he changes the point of view: in the first part it is the first person: the very young and assertive man who is in love and who feels he is special and cool. In the second part he talks some distance and it is the second person. It’s as if he is observing himself and is now able to judge him. The third part is in the third person. The distance has increased. One of my favorite lines: “As for the wider question of age, and mortality; no, he didn’t think he felt a panic at the shutting of the doors. But maybe he hadn’t yet heard their hinges creak loudly enough.”I doubt that this book would touch young readers. They are busy doing and experiencing not reminiscing and reflecting.“And when I see pairs of young lovers, ... the main feeling it arouses in me is a kind of protectiveness. No, not pity: protectiveness. Not that they would want my protection. And yet- and this is curious- the more bravado they show in their behavior, the stronger my response. I want to protect them from what the world is probably going to do to them, and from they will probably do to one another.”On could claim that this book leaves a sad taste in your mouth. Yet it is life affirming in many ways. Life moves on; circumstances change. People learn to adjust, to protect themselves and ‘pass the time’. And there is value in that. It sounds flat and dull but it sometimes means finding peace with yourself. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Dec 12, 2019","Dec 29, 2019","Dec 12, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40390207-the-only-story
