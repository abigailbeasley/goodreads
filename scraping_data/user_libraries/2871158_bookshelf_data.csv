We meet colorful, credible characters who navigate the high seas of life and love, dependence and independence, war and peace, truth and consequence and despite forays into ostensibly dark places, The Fiddler’s Gun carries a steady pulse that is beautiful, lyrical, and redemptive.”—Curt McLey, The Phantom Tollbooth“Peterson is a natural-born storyteller, and The Fiddler’s Gun is a sly, funny, soulful, instant classic.” —Allan Heinberg, Executive Producer, Grey’s Anatomy“Redcoats, pirates, orphans—and Fin Button, a passionate and savvy young woman who is a treasure all by herself. Here is high adventure that feels like truth. Three huzzahs for A.S. Peterson: The Fiddler’s Gun is an achievement.”—Jonathan Rogers, author of The Wilderking Trilogy“A.S. Peterson’s The Fiddler’s Gun is an exciting, rollicking adventure - it will touch the depths of your heart as its characters wrestle with human frailty, failure, love, and the quest for redemption. You will love this book, and you’ll read it over and over.”—Travis Prinzi, author of Harry Potter & Imagination“Like a vivacious child, it grabs your attention and runs away laughing, urging you to give chase. Don’t start this book when you have something important – like sleeping – to do; I guarantee, it won’t get done.”—Paula K.
