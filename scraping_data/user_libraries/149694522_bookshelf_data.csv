It emphasized the importance of self-worth, perseverance, personal growth and the significance of family – the one you are born into and the family you choose. If you are patient with it, readers will find the story heart-warming. Perhaps even a redemption story of sorts.

Sometimes getting someone to smile isn’t as easy as we would like anyone to believe especially a baby. And in this case as we look at baby Emmie we can see that she is different than the faces of her relatives. So, what will it take for her to finally smile, to recognize that all the faces that now surround her, love her and accept her, just as she is. Although the word adoption is never mentioned in the book, you get a sense that Emmie is different – but acceptance is clearly the message conveyed throughout the pages.

And for many, with these kind of triggers, it may make it difficult to read. Still, as harrowing as the subject matter may be, as readers we may be more inclined to say, “well, this is perfect as a book discussion selection because it has all the elements necessary to address issues not easily talked openly about amongst families.” So, let me just lay the “trigger” issues out upfront. Because even if they may be considered spoilers, (which I don’t like revealing), if I didn’t share them in this , I would feel irresponsible. Triggers: rape, suicide, homicide, promiscuous sexual games by 14-year-olds, infidelity by mothers, assault by fathers, and dead childhood friends.Okay, I said it. Heavy, right?Now the story deals with childhood/adolescent struggles of growing up, broken families, disappointments with father figures. And obviously some horrific other issues, as I mentioned above. But Picoult typically is a sensitive writer. And she did her research with her location writing and attention to detail about the Alaskan Yup’ik tribe. And, there is an interesting element with comic book superheroes in which Picoult uses a comic strip at the end of each of her chapters (fictionally drawn by the father, as a way to tell a story, too). As complicated as everything sounds, the story finds its way to a somewhat satisfactory ending. Not easily. Still, it is clearly, a Jodi Picoult story. But to be honest, it wasn’t an easy one to read the first time, and definitely not an easy one to re-visit in order to write this . Also, in a final note from the author, she shares that the letters embedded in the comic book drawings spell out a quotation that expresses the theme of the book when they are put together. I’ve included the quote below. Maybe that too, can be addressed in a book group discussion, as well. Certainly, the book discussion questions provided by the author/publisher might help with this story?But…when a book is this hard to read, maybe it is better just not to read it.

I need some books before they close, especially since I will be taking you in for your procedure on Tuesday and will be in the waiting room for hours.” Well, it was obvious what we needed to do! So off to the local library we went. I had 45 minutes before closing to find some books. I was thrilled to find two of Allison Brennan’s books. I hadn’t read one of hers since her book, “The Third to Die” Review here: https://www.goodreads.com//show.... I was excited to find this book.And of course, finding this one with such an ominous title, made it even more appealing. Let alone the setting of Friday Harbor, Washington. I knew I was in for a special read. Have you been to Friday Harbor, Washington ever? This was one of our favorite places to travel. Friday Harbor is located midway along the eastern shore of San Juan Island, on the northernmost stretch of Puget Sound and situated between Canada’s Vancouver Island and the Washington State mainland, closest to Seattle. It is a beautiful marina with day hiking and biking and easy walking. The town is about one mile wide and two miles long on an island of about 55 square miles. Why mention this? Because this book is as scenic as its story. And it will be important to feel the location and size as much as it will be to get a sense of the characters and setting. This is actually the 3rd in the series. The first in the series is the one I mentioned above. “Tell No Lies” is the 2nd in the series. To be honest, it had been so long since I read the first book, when I began reading this one, I thought I was reading a stand-alone. I had completely forgotten about the first book, until I was half way through this one. So, there is something to be said about how an author can bring us a long making us believe we know the characters so well, we are feeling comfortable with them.*But, my note at the end will be important to the overall . I’ll just save it for the end. As I mentioned this is the 3rd in the series about LAPD detective Kara Quinn now working with the FBI, alongside, FBI agent Matt Costa, her boss. This will be a complicated relationship. Which may or may not frustrate readers.There are protestors on the dock as several people are seen boarding a charter boat: Rich people. A retired FBI agent who happens to work this charter boat part-time. Employees on this boat. People employed by a company.Some employees are not supposed to be on this cruise, and trade places – thus they may have been expected to work that shift but something came up. Or some persons may have been expected to be on the boat, but opted not to for whatever reason. So, when the boat blows up, and there are nine victims, there are several suspects as to who could have been responsible. Thus, the case is complex with many layers. Could it be tied to the protestors who were just outside the dock prior to the explosion? Or the retired FBI agent that was on board? Or the rich young widow whose husband was killed in the explosion? Or the people who were part of the company? Or could this explosion have been tied to a cold case?And then there are more bombings. Another murder. And a kidnapping. What is going on and why? The local police and the FBI are involved and there are many twists and turns that are taken to get to the truth. But just when you think you know who could have done it something else occurs that leads readers in a new direction. The police procedurals and forensic evidence gathering made this an interesting read. And if you enjoy thrillers, with flawed yet hard-working characters in a twisty plotted story that will make sense by the end, this may be considered a somewhat imperfect mystery. *Still, as I have come to learn with any series, it is probably best to read all series in order. As I said, it took me getting through half the book, to realize I was in the series, and had actually read book 1, but missed book 2. I have now ordered book 2, so I can see what I missed. It may be best not to read this one without reading 1 and 2 first.

And of course, what typically happens, is that sometimes a letter arrives that puts them onto a case. As long as you aren’t looking for Sherlock Holmes brilliance, readers won’t be disappointed. The dialogue is rather quirky, the characters are flat, but easily likable. The plot and ending were predictable and anti-climatic. And the setting was fine.Still, this story is written with charm, in a cozy cute and predictable sort of way that made the story more entertaining than mystery-worthy. So, what is next for this reader? I think this is it for me.

And so, if you find this book, it may be one that once you get it, you may be like me. You may choose not to let it go. Listen closely to his opening words…“It is strange to be here. The mystery never leaves you alone. Behind your image, below your words, above your thought, the silence of another world exists. A world lives within you. No one else can bring you news of this inner world.” If I were to even begin to attempt to interpret his thoughts, I would consider that he is asking us to go within. To recognize what is in each of us. To see the true artist within each of us. How can we not be mesmerized by what he sees within each of us? Or what he is asking each of us to see that exists within us?This book taps into the richness of Celtic spirituality, poetry and stories. He explores friendship, awareness, and intimacy. Our senses. Our soul. He asks us to recognize the aging process as living in rhythm with our soul and our life. Even looking at life all the way through to his last chapter as we affirm death and see it as an invitation to freedom. There is so much to appreciate about his words. He is truly stirring our soul and stoking the fires of our imagination. He reminds us of the precious gift of present moment living.Most the time my books are read and ed and released to my Little Free Library Shed. But this one evokes a different and deeper meaning for me. And so, it stays with me. Where I can read it again and again. As I need it, when I want it.The words continue to resonate with me and remind me of the preciousness of life. The gift of what we have been given. And what comes back each time for me is a feeling of immense gratitude.

It is a dark, snowy morning when Gamache comes upon an old broken-down farmhouse in an isolated area in the village of Three Pines. The scene is so well-written, it is as if we need to put on a warm jacket, knowing that within moments we are going to feel the approaching blizzard, and we too need to get warm. Apparently, Gamache and 2 others have been purposely summoned to this place because they are the designated executors of the will of the recently deceased person who once lived there.

We are also dealing with some loose ends from what occurred in “Glass Houses.” So, if readers did not read Penny’s previous book in the series, don’t even begin this book without having read that book, first.

In this story, we find our characters navigating their way through a complicated world. She creates situations with emotional depth, and for any reader who has patience, the love can be contagious. Although sometimes finding the patience can be difficult for some. This is a character driven story with a couple of storylines to follow and several twists.

Her chosen topic is her fictional protagonist, Nina Dean, a witty, British, food columnist cookbook author who owns a charming apartment in Archway who is ready for a meet-cute. The reason for the title, Ghosts, is because this is a story about dating, and being ghosted after signing up on a dating app looking for love. Instead of love she gets 27 conversations with 27 different suitors. And when she thinks she finds the “one” with Max, “poof” he disappears. Thus, the universal “I’ve been ghosted” moves occur. So, what does that mean exactly? Is he alive? ✔Is he posting on social media? ✔Can she come to terms with it and move on? ✔But what happens when Max chooses to return? Alderton does a good job of showing what single life looks like for a woman of 30+ against a married woman with babies comfortably tucked away in the suburbs. The message of ghosting is more than a dating metaphor. It also plays into the story of an aging parent as they are losing their mind and becoming a ghost. What happens with the father character is probably the saddest ‘ghosting’ that occurs in this story. Alderton tells her story with humor and grace. She gives us the highs and lows and pitfalls of online dating. Singles vs marrieds. The difficulties of caregiving. The sadness of loss of mind and the impact on families.

And possibly even remind the reader that sometimes right versus wrong is often more complicated than a simple answer. And even though this was written at a time when abortion was legal (Roe v Wade - US), or even presuming that a family wants a child no matter what the intended disability, there is still much to consider here. So, what happens when it is revealed that a prenatal diagnosis is osteogenesis imperfacta, i.e.,“brittle bone disease,” a very rare severe genetic disorder that primarily affects bone development and strength. Which means that the child with this condition will suffer fractures from mild or even no trauma. Not only is this a physical and emotional burden on the child, the disability will affect everyone – emotionally and financially. The question becomes…Should this child be born?In this circumstance, Charlotte has her child, Willow. She says…“I had a beautiful baby girl, who was as fragile as a soap bubble. As your mother, I was supposed to protect you. But what if I tried and only wound up doing harm?” And this is the struggle we read throughout these pages – an emotional tug-of-war for Charlotte’s character who fiercely loves Willow. As readers, we can see poor Willow’s pain and suffering, with multiple broken bones. She can’t play like regular kids. She can only be an observer of life. Will Willow ever be able to achieve independence? And even if she does, at what cost?Charlotte’s role – protector – carer. And who will suffer because all of her attention is going to just this child? Her other older adopted child? Her husband?And when Willow’s broken bones are thought to be caused by child abuse, and the family wants to sue, an attorney suggests instead to sue for wrongful birth. Will this allow the family to give Willow a better life?While all these issues percolate for readers, Picoult challenges readers with questions about moral beliefs. What would have been the best decisions for Charlotte to have made? This story is told through multiple points of views, which questions medical ethics, personal choice, and the emotional complications on the family.There was much to unravel here, and sometimes it felt soap opera-ish. But there were some important talk-able issues that would make this story book discussion relevant. And…It truly seems like there is much to be felt here. What will it be for each reader?

And, it just so happens that this one is going to be a discussion book for the Mobile Public Library in August which I have been invited to attend via Zoom. So, I am looking forward to the discussion. It was nice to re-visit this book again and catch up with all the characters. Of course, this is not the typical Grisham. I love Grisham for his courtroom dramas. But he has been known to write other stories that have tugged at the heartstrings, and garnering readers attention. So, if this isn’t courtroom drama, or a legal thriller, what is it? Well. It is one of Grisham’s favorite pastimes, baseball. And even though baseball may not be a favorite type of story for me to read, it was something I enjoyed watching as a spectator in my younger days living in Southern California. (I was a Dodgers and Angels fan.) And, this turned out to be quite a compelling and heart-felt story. So, I am grateful to have let myself be open to a different kind of reading experience. This is a sweet, simple story. A story with a moral. Most importantly, a story about the importance of forgiveness. “It’s known as the restorative powers of forgiveness.”  Joe Castle is a 21-year-old rather talented rookie first baseman for the Chicago Cubs. His nickname is the name of the book, Calico Joe. His nickname comes from his hometown of Calico Rock, Arkansas. His talent is all those homeruns he seems to hit every time he comes to bat! Unfortunately, there is a pitcher, Warren Tracey who doesn’t play fair, and his intentions are to challenge batters which sometimes include throwing balls directly at batter’s heads. Will he do this to Joe? And then there is the pitcher’s son, Paul, the narrator of the story, who knows that ball is coming but, stands silent as he watches the pitch. What is going to happen next will leave readers spellbound. But it doesn’t happen right away. Grisham builds to that moment. And when it finally does…many lives will be changed, including Paul’s.And that is what keeps readers turning pages in this captivating, easy-to-read, beautifully written story. What will happen years later is what brings this story to its amazing climax. Including the emotions of its readers. Is redemption possible? Perhaps Kleenex might be welcome in this moment. But that isn’t the only moment. There is more. Keep reading to its very satisfying end.

It is 2001. A dark case calls for the return of profiler, Terry McCaleb, first seen in Blood Work, who has created a new life for himself. We will also see LA Homicide Detective Harry Bosch. McCaleb and Bosch have been good friends for about 12 years. This case is complicated and intriguing to McCaleb, and in many ways, it appears to implicate Bosch. Especially since the victim and Bosch had an antagonistic past relationship. Could Bosch have been responsible for his death? In the meantime, Bosch, is currently involved in a high-profile murder trial. He is a principal witness under attack. When he realizes that he is being suspected of murder by McCaleb, in the case he has been working, Bosch challenges him with the statement, “you missed something.” But what? Does someone have something against Bosch? And why? “Bosch didn’t smile. He didn’t blink. He didn’t do anything but hold the stare.” In true fashion it typically comes down to the Bosch stare. Connelly provides an excellent police procedural and courtroom drama that keeps pages turning at a classic thrilling pace. Reminding readers not only of early Bosch but of earlier characters we have come to appreciate, too. ...more",Notes are private!,4,27,1,not set,Apr 2024,"Apr 01, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58963.A_Darkness_More_Than_Night

Because I messed up so badly, by reading this series out of order, I am back again with this one. For anyone following me, I read the 6th book first – Obsession. And in that , I mentioned I would go ahead and read the first book. So, here I am. Doing what I promised to do. The question is, was the experience worth it?Well, this book answered the back story on Teddy Fay. And for anyone interested in following any series, in which this person is the star of the series, this is always important to know who that person truly is. Always read the first book first.And, in Woods/Parnell Hall typical fashion, the story moved at a quick, fast pace with short chapters and action-packed suspense. But it didn’t take long for me to be stopped in my tracks when the reason that Teddy Fay was brought on scene was the same reason in the book, Obsession. A kidnapping. What? You couldn’t come up with something more creative? Now granted this was the first book. And this was a different co-author than the one who wrote Obsession. So now having read both, who was at fault here? I would say that Mr. Battles the author for Book 6 wasn’t paying attention. Now, in all fairness, if I hadn’t read this book out-of-order, would this have been an issue for me? Let’s pack this thought away for a moment and move on. The difference I am feeling about this book is the political intrigue. And this is where this first novel shines and sparkles. Published in 2016 when civility was once the central language of Washington DC and bipartisanship was a goal, the question for readers might be about the central theme of a kidnapping plot. Why did it happen to an important government figure’s family member? Did the kidnappers believe it would spark government officials to be reminded that this was what was needed to make government work effectively, especially on behalf of veterans? And why this veteran’s aid bill specifically? And, who was behind this kidnapping? Will this be easy for readers to figure out? So many questions. So many twists. And even if readers are getting a glimpse of who might be doing this – is the why they are doing it, really all that obvious?

We’ll help you.” And that seems to be what follows Aubry Tourvel throughout her endless travels. There are so many who are willing to help her. Because her fate has been to keep moving since she was 9 years old in 1885 when a puzzle ball found its way to her. The problem is, now she is sick with a “disease.” And, the only way to get ahead of the “disease” is to keep moving. And because she keeps moving, she belongs to no one. And supposedly the constant movement to various unknown places is what keeps her alive. And as readers we are baffled by this, just as those who are within her “world” struggle and strive to help or “cure” her or worse, so that perhaps she can stop moving and stay for once. And as Aubry tells her story to the many who are willing to sit captivated and listen, as readers we wait patiently (and sometimes impatiently) to understand what this story truly is. Is the disease a curse or is there a simpler answer? Is it curable? Can she stop moving? And possibly live in one place?

Valerie is beginning her job as a Park Law Enforcement Ranger in Oklahoma. On her first day at the Ranger Station one of the tribal officers says to her…“They tell you about the bones yet?”“Bones?”“Figures,” he grumbles, and then he’s gone.We soon learn that bones are buried in the caves and there is a story here. But there is also someone trying to keep the Rangers out. Why? Does it have to do with the past? Or is there something going on now in the forest that needs protecting?What is the story of the bones? What happened? This is a complex story. Painful at times because it involved the rights and lives of children. And the corruption. Especially to the Natives, their land and their children. And…what the people of the past did and why. Readers will want to unravel the mystery along with Valerie. To bring peace to the bones. To those who were left behind. But there is also a mystery happening now – what is it and why?So, Valerie working alongside Curtis, head of the Chocktaw Tribal Police, also have a job to protect and bring justice to the land from those who would want to take from it.

She said, “this is her first in the series, you’ll love it.” Well, of course, I loved knowing it was the first in the series. I have already learned my lesson reading books out of order! So, I was happy to read this Emmy Award Winning Journalist’s first in the series book. The author, Tamron Hall has experience being in the limelight as a journalist. She knows what it is like when there are stories that make the news. A white woman goes missing and it is all over the 24-hour news cycle. But what happens when Black girls go missing? This story brings a vulnerability and systemic neglect to the victims of that violent crime into the forefront. Also, how quick are people ready to accuse the Black boys as the perpetrators? How does the media react? And how does the public respond? So, is this really just a case of a potential runaway when a 15-year-old Black girl who is the pride of her family vanishes in Chicago? Local TV Reporter, Jordan Manning, the star of this series, is upset that nobody seems to be all that concerned, other than the family. This story is told through the eyes of a reporter, where her probing is done deeper than the police, who don’t seem to be taking this disappearance as seriously as Jordan feels it needs to be. Unfortunately, Jordan’s musings sometimes slow the action, and Hall’s story and pacing can feel somewhat drawn out. But her intentions are good. If you read any interviews with this author, you will find that the novel draws upon Hall’s own time as a reporter in Texas and Chicago about cases that have haunted her for years. Certainly these type of cases are going to have large ramifications involving many agencies – police – politicians – family – lawyers – spokespersons – community activists and justice advocates. And Hall includes them all within these pages.

Which makes this the perfect day for a fire in the fireplace and a book in my hands. I decided to settle in with another cozy with the “Secrets of the Castleton Manor Library” series, Book 2. (Will this series be my in-between books?)For background on this series, check out my  on “A Novel Murder” by Elizabeth Penney here: https://www.goodreads.com//show... You will notice that this one has a different author. Place and characters remain the same. This time I did not read the dust jacket to give me background on this story. I just covered myself in a warm comforter in front of the fire, opened the book and began to read. But before I share my , I thought I would have a little discussion on the book cover. Let us take a look at the cover art. Are these clues to the mystery within the story?There is a table. On the table are the following items… A cookbook. A cube of butter. A bowl of sugar. A towel. A bowl of chocolate with a floating liquid foam shaped like a skull and a ladle inside the bowl of chocolate. Flowers in a vase. 3 chocolate truffles. And one chocolate truffle is on the floor being sniffed by Faith’s cat, Watson. (Faith is our main protagonist who is the Librarian/archivist for the Castleton Manor Library - place.) There is meaning here in this cover art. The key will be to keep all of this in mind as the story unfolds. The Castleton Manor is hosting celebrity pastry chef, Sugar Worthington, who writes cookbooks, and also hosts a television cooking show, and will be providing a book signing and talk for her fans. Clues 1, 2 and 3 have just been provided from the cover art. Pastry chef. Her name is Sugar. Writes cookbooks. Shall we move on?She has brought with her an entourage along with her television crew that will use this event for an upcoming episode of her cooking show, ‘Sweet & Sassy.’ But it appears not everybody is a fan, as someone is making attempts on her life. Could one of the guests actually be one of her enemies? Or could it be someone closer to her than she realizes? And, if that is the case, why? Clue 3. Floating liquid foam shaped like a skull. Are we having fun yet with these clues?And, Clue 4. The first attempt on her life was saved by Watson. And interestingly enough, the next attempt on her life…Watson has his ways… (no more clue solving from me…)Well, I won’t say how he saved her. And I won’t reveal any more clues. I think you get the point. And why as the investigation begins, and the Police Chief is involved, is Sugar discounting these attempts on her life as nothing to be concerned about? Even the Chief says…“You need to take these attempts seriously, this could have ended far worse than it did.”This is another cute cozy. And I think that really is the point of this series. But this one had more twists and turns and red herrings. So, it is not always clear as to why these attempts on Sugar’s life are occurring. Can you guess the culprit before the end?The story is easy-to-read. With likable characters for the most part. It is a beautiful scenic setting. And of course, there is Watson, a very smart, witty cat. And a perpetual hero. We even have a couple of perky dogs. And, some delectable enough pastries that are almost good enough you can taste them. What better way to spend a rainy day, right?But I do have some concerns.I just hope this series doesn’t turn into another “Murder She Wrote” with Jessica Fletcher, where you wonder if there will be anybody left in Cabot Cove, Maine who doesn’t feel like every corner you turn there is an attempt on your life, or someone is getting murdered. For anyone who has read, any of the “Murder She Wrote” books, you know what a wonderful seaside village it is…but, so much mayhem! So, here we are at this beautiful, Castleton Manor Library by the ocean.

(How many jobs get this sweet benefit with an ocean view?)Now Faith wasn’t the first one hired for this prestigious job. Doris Lincoln was, but apparently, after six months, she “supposedly” decided she didn’t like it and left to travel the world.

He even jokes about the coincidences of his fictional character Kathi Kannon appearing like his former boss. Especially giving her a starring role as Priestess Talara in the film “Nova Quest.” Seriously? How fun is that?! (Think Princess Leia/Star Wars) Still, there is no denying the characters he has created in Kathi, a 56-year-old actress, or her Personal Assistant Charlie Besson, a 29-year-old. Kathi is captivating, and a little maddening. And Charlie has his issues, too. But it is almost like a love story, too – only it isn’t your typical Hollywood romance – they are truly two misfits forming a wacky working relationship. Interestingly enough, one scene shows Charlie as a boy being given by his mother a Priestess Talara action figure. But his abusive, homophobic father, took it away. Obviously, his father terrorized him for being gay. So, getting to work with Kathi is a Wonderland, of sorts. This is an adventurous, quirky, working, foggy friendship, that is not your typical 9-5 setting. With not your typical job duties. Or lifestyle demands. And, it will be taxing for readers to wade through. There is Kathi’s bipolar disorder that Charlie is managing. And moments in which Kathi is like a mother figure for Charlie. Yet, the boredom mentioned in the title is the weariness and yearning to be distracted from the pain of life. Charlie had a traumatic upbringing. Kathi had her struggles. It is a lot to take in. For them. And for readers to read. I couldn’t help but feel a sense of relief when Charlie chose to move on from Kathi. Maybe that was what was also needed for the author and Ms. Fisher. Still, I couldn’t help but feel a deep sense of grief at Carrie Fisher’s passing two years later. No matter what she had been through, there was still an immense talent lost. And in many ways, Byron Lane was witness to it. Maybe this fiction story gave us a tiny glimpse into it. 3.5 stars rounded up....more",Notes are private!,12,36,1,"Mar 21, 2024","Mar 25, 2024","Mar 21, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51182622-a-star-is-bored

And then it occurred to me that this book was one of the stories that was used in “The Lincoln Lawyer” Netflix series. So, that is why I thought I had “read” it before. But, the book and series, still have their differences, so I read on. We find Mickey Haller (the Lincoln Lawyer) at a low point, where he truly is dispensing law (foreclosure cases) directly out of his armor-plated Lincoln. Then while finishing up with a new client, he gets a call about one of his first foreclosure clients, a pain in his ‘side,’ named Lisa Trammel, who has been arrested for murder of the banker who was trying to foreclose on her home. Where Connelly shows off his skillful writing, is in his courtroom scenes. And that is where half the novel takes readers. And, my favorite reading adventures typically are police procedurals and/or courtroom drama, so I was truly enjoying this part of the book. The courtroom suspense and drama and plot’s energy, was compelling. And Haller loves to game the system in the best way possible, which shows a moral dimension that is presented lightly, but can’t be ignored. As always, be prepared for the twists. Even if Haller defends criminals, or those who are presumed innocent, and we as readers may not like the character(s), it does not always mean Mickey Haller doesn’t win in the end. (Which means, we as readers, will most likely be satisfied, too.)Also…one thing about a Connelly story, you have to be ready to know that once you pick it up, it is hard to put down again.

It includes two rows of trees that appear to embrace each other and create this beautiful tree canopy. It is almost like once the trees grew to mature size adjacent to each other they conjoined and formed this amazing long covered walkway from one end to another (.30 miles). We sometimes imagine that the trees are looking out for every level of life that passes through or chooses to live amongst them. That truly is one of our favorite walks – to be amongst those trees. We feel so protected – and loved. And if a branch falls from a harsh windstorm or rainfall, we feel sad that the tree has lost one of its limbs. Because we know, once a branch falls, it will not grow back. There is something to be said about the beauty, and loss and power of trees.So, when I learned of another book by this author, where the star of the story was a talking tree named Red, I had to read it. The beauty of stories like this, is the moment you open the book, it is so engrossing, it is unputdownable. And before you know it, it is done. Even if it appears to be a normal size novel (hardbound 211 pages), with its larger size font and illustrations, it moves along quickly for readers. Having just finished a talking dog story, how could I not fall in love with a talking tree story. I’m finding myself open to about anything now. Especially if the author has imagination. After all, I am a fan of magical realism. Still, this is a kid’s story, so anything is possible in the realm of children’s books. Right? This is a strong message book. Handled with sensitivity and humor. This is a story about trees, the protection of, and importance and appreciation of trees. It is also a story about diversity and differences and friendship.There will be lots of learning moments too about trees and animals.There will be moments where friends will disagree, and even through disagreement, people can find ways to like each other.And, there will be teaching moments of how diversity within the community can bring people together and eventually work through those differences.

His wife rewards him with a vintage typewriter – a classic Underwood so he can write that novel he always wanted to write. What better subject – than Kenneth!

There is much to appreciate about the emotional connection and intellectual attachment between the boy’s feelings and thoughts about how he sees his life and what his dog meant to him.

They are sadly messed up. Why? Well, in a nutshell, this novel is about the effects that alcohol has on the body and soul. Binges. Disconnected from reality…especially from the beauty of the landscape, the beautiful California coast line…Big Sur that lays before the central character. Could a redemption be forthcoming? Is the author unknowingly telling a biographical story of himself?If nothing else, this book was an important biographical touchstone of a life of an artist possessed. It showed his sensitivity, insecurities, recklessness, low self-esteem, need for solitude, even a hatred for solitude (obvious complexities), deep depression caused by chemical indulgences. This is the books story, but clearly, we can also see it as the story of the author, too.It appears that art converged into life, and then sadly life left him. This book was published in 1962.

Last note…I almost gave up on finishing this book originally, because I don’t like reading books about characters that self-destruct.

But this isn’t about that short story. Although the cover of the book, gives you the same “out-there” feelings. As if someone is walking around in a space age suit, when it really is just a deep sea diver walking on dry land in your neighborhood. Still, even that may be odd trying to look rather normal. Keeping that picture of the deep sea diver in mind as an example of just one story, this is a collection of short stories set in the Australian suburbs, about how the most outlandish things can appear normal or commonplace. But this is more than a collection of stories.The author’s greatest asset is his artwork. His images remind us of Japanese woodcut prints or Renaissance frescoes or sepia photographs. Whatever the vision being presented, they are stunningly beautiful. One story has children following a map to the end of the world. Literally. They sit with their feet hanging over the edge. Who does that in storytelling? What an extraordinary image. The author allows our own imagination to take us beyond the words and visual image as the reader. Is the world really flat?

As you can imagine the city was packed with traffic and people looking for the best bargains. Lucky for me my Little Free Library Shed attracted a crowd of visitors providing an abundance of donations which included this one. At first, I wasn’t sure I wanted to read it because it was the second one in the series. But by the fifth page, the characters in the story gave away every little clue of what happened in the first book. Thus, I felt fairly comfortable I could continue on with this story knowing what had most likely occurred with the main protagonist, Julia Bird in that debut book. At least, it appeared, through this gossipy format, that hints would continue to be dropped as I read on. And, I wasn’t wrong.The question was, would I like this story as I got further in to it?Well, my first clue that I knew I was in deep trouble was when I had to start a list of characters, to keep track of who was who! Oy! Thus, I have a feeling, this is going to give anyone reading this  a strong hint of how things were going for me as I meandered along through the pages of this “seemingly” cozy little village.Now, let me just say this…in all fairness, this book headlined a library. Which typically is my favorite kind of book setting. And…it featured a dog. Another favorite for me. Because anyone looking at my personal page, will know, I obviously love dogs. So, I was trying really hard to keep an open mind about this story. Especially when they had the scene with an author coming to do a Q & A at the library. He was also making himself available to sign his books afterwards. Which, for anyone who has ever attended an event like this, it is always fun for the community. As an aside, I created multiple programs like this for my local library. And I loved seeing the interaction between the author and participants. Back to the . So….let us consider the title of this book – murder in the library. As readers we know instinctively that something terrible is going to happen to someone at this library! Will it be the author? (Well, even the book blurb back cover description tells you it is him. Oh well.)Cue the music! The murder occurs. Why? And who?So, now, Julia has inserted herself into the investigation. And, as a reader, I am following her around, trying to keep track of all these people in the town wondering… who-dunnit. Let me just say this, Jake (the dog) is one of my favorite characters in the book. Everyone else was…well, forgettable. But Jake, he was easy to enjoy, and definitely provided the necessary comic relief. On the positive side, this is a cute, cozy little mystery by a dual author South African writing team named Kate Sidley and Gail Schimmel. And as I mentioned earlier, this is their second book in the mystery genre. On the not so positive side, this will probably be, my first and last read in the Julia Bird mystery series. Even though I enjoyed Jake immensely.

I like to just tell it like it is, and face conflict head on, as difficult as it may be. But I get it sometimes. It isn’t always easy, and in this story, especially with pandemic post-lockdown as a backdrop, it certainly sets the stage for a “return to normal” that is anything but. There was so much family drama – characters’ internal dialogues with complicated storylines – including infidelity, questions of identity – past choices that threatened existing relationships – examining life choices – options and pasts interfering with the present. And then the ultimate question to answer, what truly is the right thing to do? Weiner made her characters question and evaluate their lives and wrestle with decisions and navigate emotions that were sometimes impossible to understand. And as readers we could feel those feelings, even if at times, we were exhausted by all the drama. Again, for me, I wasn’t always a fan of soap operas.Still, it was a quick, if at times deep read. While the book does not address the pandemic directly, there is the feeling of change in environment, and a reminder of when we spent time cramped in our homes with our loved ones while remaining separated from others. I am sure those memories are still fresh for a lot of us. And that may be a trigger for some.

He tells of how he was writing and researching this book with his technical adviser, retired NCIS veteran Leon Carroll, Jr. Because of his experience on the show, he wanted to go back and find out more about how the NCIS (Naval Criminal Investigative Service) came to be. He didn’t realize then, how this was to become a passion project and that it would take him through piles of research back to WWII.Which truly is the beginning. Because that beginning becomes a true story of a big crime – the Japanese attack that ignited World War II, and how these early days of what use to be known as the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) would eventually birth itself into what is now known as NCIS.And with any story, there is a hero. And this hero is ONI spy, Douglas Wada, Hawaiian born, to Japanese immigrant parents. He was recruited specifically to sleuth out Japan’s spies in Honolulu. Unbeknownst to Wada, he actually did see the smoke on that fateful day of December 7, 1941, but it was the person working at the lighthouse that announced to him that the attack had actually happened. Still Wada was the first Japanese American ever to work in intelligence in American government, and he now had a job to do.

Their dueling stories anchor the gripping depiction of the outbreak and upheaval of the beginnings of WWII stateside.

On the cover of the book, the title implies, ‘tales of murder, madness, and obsession.’ What could that possibly mean?There is something about these stories that are unexpectedly tied to the famous fictional detective and/or author Conan Doyle that make them so readable that Grann felt compelled to create this collection that he believed was important for readers to explore. And that is what makes these stories so fascinating. As an example, Grann shares the story of Richard Green who became one of the world’s foremost experts on Sherlock Holmes, and who also happened to die suspiciously. But prior to his death, his interest was to write the first biography of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Interestingly, during his lifetime, he amassed one of the most amazing book collections that was valued at over a million dollars. The British Library became the benefactor of that collection upon his unexplained death. His death, and what leads up to it, is tantalizing mystery suspense at its best! Grann beckons readers with similar stories of cons and chameleons, and disturbing individuals doing unsettling things. He also has readers questioning whether in one story they have “indited” the right person for a horrible life event that occurred. Like the story about Cameron Willingham who woke up in his house, ran outside, because his house was on fire, but in his rush to save himself, he left his 3 young daughters inside. So, what really happened? Did they adequately investigate that case? Or was an innocent man convicted and executed?Grann originally wrote all these stories for The New Yorker, The Atlantic, the New York Times magazines, and The New Republic, but updated and revised them for publication in this book format. I have to believe that everyone will find at least one favorite story here, especially if you are a David Grann fan. He is already popular for his “Killers of the Flower Moon and “The Wager – A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny and Murder.” One that has already been put on screen, and the other already commissioned for the screen. Whether you delve into nonfiction sporadically or read it regularly, one thing I love about this author, is that he has a way of putting a face and a voice to some amazing stories that allows readers to become readily engaged with real-life characters.

I chose not to list it on Goodreads as something I was currently reading, because I wasn’t sure how I felt about it. But I was reading it. Very, very slowly. To be clear, this was another big book. And I am not a fan of big books. This was the paperback version. There are 5 parts to it. An Author’s note and acknowledgement, notes, bibliography and an index. 591 pages for the story. From the author’s notes – onward, 721 pages. That is an investment of time. And, this book was the inspiration for the major motion picture “Oppenheimer,” which just won the Academy Award this past Sunday. Also, this book, was the winner of the Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 2006. And you already heard my rant about Pulitzer’s when I discussed the book, “Trust” in that . Thankfully, I liked that book. So, how did I feel about this one?Well, it is obviously voluminous. And it is truly a multifaceted portrait of a complicated person that gets to his essential nature. Brilliant. Innovative. Competitive. Inscrutable leader. A mixture of charisma and cruelty. Readers will see him in the midst of Communism in the 1930’s, politics (think the McCarthy era), and ethics questionability. This book is a thorough examination of all things, overwhelming in its detail. Its title comes from a quiet little Santa Fe office that served as a gateway to the hidden research colony at Los Alamos. And then there is Hiroshima. Were they really back slapping and showing triumph for that bomb? And then the fallout from it. How Oppenheimer feels about what he contributed to, well, that is for readers to contemplate.

Obviously, what is happening presently in Gaza and Israel, means that this is a conflict that still resonates with people. Since the book was recently donated, it gave me an opportunity to re-visit the book again and bring my  to Goodreads. Premise: In 1967, nearly 20 years after his family was forced to leave their home, Palestinian Bahsir al-Khairi was able to finally return. Thus began his friendship with an Israeli woman named Dalia Eshkenazi. This is their true story, which was first told in a 1998 radio documentary on NPR’s Fresh Air. Now, through extensive research, the author gives readers the experience of the house, the lemon tree in the title, the families, and the complex history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. What is particularly interesting is the symbol of the lemon tree, which I won’t spoil here – that is an experience for readers to explore on their own. The story is rich in detail and research and beautifully portrayed. And considering we are still in conflict all these years later, the word that comes to mind over and over in this readers mind is…Hope. For an end to conflict. To live in peace with security and dignity. ...more",Notes are private!,12,27,1,not set,"Mar 13, 2024","Mar 13, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25812896-the-lemon-tree

There was a moment when a villager was ready to criticize one of the characters for his creative puzzlers and said…“What on earth is wrong with that boy?”The father of the boy retorts…“What on earth is wrong with your imagination?”This book, an endearing fable, shines the light on empathy. Cherishing living things, no matter how small or insignificant or un-pretty they may be are worthy of care and dignity.

Needless to say, when this obscure one was assigned to us, I felt I was once again venturing out of my comfort zone. Still, isn’t that the role of English instructors – to challenge their students to read beyond rom-coms and mystery thrillers? Once again, this one was another donation to my Little Free Library Shed, tantalizing me to move from my Grisham reading pile to write this long-awaited . So here I am. For those who don’t know it, this actually was Orwell’s debut novel, first published in 1934. It is set in the fictional Kyauktada in the 1920’s during the British Empire. In many respects it is a story of the author’s own experience while living in British-ruled India where he was born. This is a story of Orwell’s protagonist, John Flory, a white timber-merchant who defies convention by befriending a native, making him somewhat an anti-hero. The story it-self doesn’t evoke any feelings of compassion for any characters, other than Dr. Veraswami. Most the others were a contemptible bunch of bullies who were unprincipled. But, this is how Orwell felt about what he truly saw and experienced with British colonialism.“I dare say it’s unfair in some ways and inaccurate in some details, but much of it is simply reporting what I have seen.” Mostly this is a provocative tale. A tale of identity, loneliness, ignorance, racism and greed. One that can be considered perfect for discussion. With some amazing quotes to also consider great discussion topics. I can see why our English instructor selected it for his students....more",Notes are private!,12,40,1,not set,"Mar 12, 2024","Mar 12, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/509199.Burmese_Days

No. Thank goodness.But this time I am not being graded, so I can look at the book with a fresh perspective, and consider it from a more mature point of view. I am not in competition with my classmates to be heard. I am just one reader looking at some unforgettable characters, and interweaving story-lines that quite frankly, this time around left me awestruck. It is a world of treachery, revenge, romance, adventure and mystery.And if we pay close attention, this story is deceivingly witty and charismatic in a weird way. This is the story of Edmond Dantes, and the lives of his lover, best friend, family and the partners from his shipping company. We have treacherous plots, did I say revenge, heartache, mystery, pirates, love, and family drama. Originally, this story was serialized, which shows in its many subplots and verbose speeches and many pages. The version I am reading now is an abridged version. I remember the original one is about a 1,000 pages. Still, my experience reading this one, was that I found it an epic tale, fun, not elegant, but an appreciation for why our English teachers in college felt this was a good one to read.Sometimes it is good to go back and  the books that were expected of us to read.

Myriam Gurba is coming in person to my home college Cuesta next month to discuss her book, “Creep.” So, because she is coming here, and I worked at Cuesta for over 17 years as an Instructor and Director, I was interested in finding out more about her. So, I checked out her first book, “Mean” from my local library. This one. I wasn’t sure I wanted to read this book. Her subject matter is her life. Which is dark, gritty, and obviously personal. But we can’t underestimate this memoir. She is a survivor of a sexual assault. By a man who not only raped her, but killed another woman. And, not only is she a self-professed survivor, she is a proudly queer, mixed-race Chicana, and willing to share her story of fear, PTSD, mental illness, and her childhood traumas. But, even as all of this sounds so unimaginable, she tells her story with humor, tact and grace which makes it unbelievably readable. And as we read, we begin to understand intuitively that she struggles to know how she survived when the other woman, Sophia didn’t…“Guilt is a ghost.” Or maybe it is just her opportunity to make the most of her life by writing about it. Or maybe this book is a bit of a field guide for how to exist in a hetero patriarchy. Or an understanding of what being mean is when someone is challenged by such cruelty. She also defines mean as a way to survive hardness, oppression and violence in her neighborhood. As readers we try to understand her life. And it isn’t easy. We are bombarded by the ugliness around her. There is a phrase in the story, “somewhere on this planet, a man is touching a woman to death,” which is particularly brutal to read. There is no subtlety to that statement. What is she really trying to tell us? I think she is wanting us to understand the stark realities about victimization and trauma. So, is her book title saying she is mean, or is she wanting to gain her power back? I’d like to believe by writing this memoir she is wanting to gain power back for all women who have been victimized.

And I haven’t been very good about reading this series in order, but I am good about enjoying it when I can.

So, when the book starts off with a murder, and it is supposedly committed by an Amish man towards his wife, this seems particularly dark and unfathomable. Now, this same Amish man has escaped prison, and is holding Kate and his children hostage and telling Kate that he did not kill his wife. If this is the case, who did? And why? What complicates this intricate story, is that Kate knew Joseph when she was a kid. And she crushed on him then. Can she keep her senses about her and prove that Joseph is not a killer?

Apparently, someone else has confessed to the murder and he is going to be executed within days, unless this true killer can come forward to stop this conviction. Can this Minister get this true murderer to save this innocent man? In true Grisham style, he takes on a cause. And this particular cause is the death penalty. And in true Texas style, they are very proud of their convictions and their way of getting rid of their criminals quickly. But, in their rush to conviction, did they really do what they needed to do to make sure they had the right man, or did they push the person too hard to admit to a confession because of a harsh interrogation and not a lot of evidence? These are the type of issues that Grisham likes to explore. And as readers we are interested, as well, as we watch this do-gooder Minister risk everything to do the right thing.Between police paperwork and court filings, and the politics of it all, readers get the inside scoop on what it looks like behind the scenes of an individual’s case.Will the Minister make it in time?

Since he loves reading dog-love books. Well, I was shocked he hadn’t read it yet, so, Steve, this one is for you! This is my first opportunity to read a book, with her co-author, Gennifer Choldenko. They both boast of living in California with loyal husbands and naughty dogs. And since I do, as well, I felt I have something in common with both of them. Although this is a cute YA novel with lovely black and white illustrations by Wallace West throughout, I was entranced at my age! And let’s just say I am a senior adult! But I need to be honest about one thing. There is a reason I never volunteered in an animal shelter. It saddens me to know there are so many homeless animals. I would want to adopt them all, and that would not be possible! So needless to say, entering this story, I began it with a box of Kleenex. Our narrator is Chance, a 3-legged dog who lives at Dogtown, a shelter for homeless dogs including robot dogs. And how he became 3-legged will become clear at some point, just as Chance was once loved by Jessie and Professor Besser first will become clear. But for now, Dogtown is our setting. (Hence: the title of the book.)And as Chance shares his story and the story of the other dogs in Dogtown, my heart aches. In particular there is this one moment that Chance writes in kibble…“I nid to b petd.”Or…And trying to explain missing home to his Metal Head robot dog friend, Chance says… “How do you explain kindness to a machine with a hunk of metal where his heart should’ve been?” The life of a dog is interestingly portrayed in the shelter. The friendships, the shenanigans, the reading days with the human children. But there is also the heartache, too. Because there are those difficult decisions that have to be made for the elder dogs that don’t get adopted. And those dogs usually fall on the dreaded List. And we hate when that happens. And it is interesting how the other dogs do what they can to find ways to get the humans to fall in love with the dogs that are fated for The List, by getting humans to want to adopt them. Pass the Kleenex please. And then there is the story of Metal Head, the Robot dog who wants to go home to the boy who originally owned him. And when he does? Pass the Kleenex please. And then there is the story of Jessie and Professor Besser who unwisely leave Chance with a negligent live-in dog sitter. Pass the Kleenex please, again. Still, even if I blubbered through the majority of the story, which I finished in one sitting, it was truly a heart-felt story with a strong message of courage, perseverance, friendship, and empathy. Please know, even though I cried, not all my tears were sad tears. I am just not going to tell you what kind of tears I cried, when I cried them. That would spoil the story. The author also provided practical information in the appendix about what kids can do to help shelter dogs to stay happy and heathy while they are waiting for their forever homes.

So, what is a backyard year?For Renkl it is a way to bring the seasons alive in 52 chapters – a seasonal round – for the animals and plants – in her yard – in nearby parks – where she lives in Tennessee. She is living her despair of the human-caused crises that the natural world faces. She says…“The very least I owe my wild neighbors is a willingness to witness their struggle, to compensate for their losses in every way I can, and to speak on their behalf about all the ways I can’t.” Her intentions are to save animals that need mending, or insects, or birds that need food, or provide support for the monarch butterflies, or a haven for tree frogs, whatever it takes to make their living more naturally friendly. She talks of human-caused global warming that is altering our environment and harming other species. Her awareness of the changes in the natural environment made me aware of the changes that I have noted in our ocean environment, as well, where I live in Morro Bay, CA. We use to see starfish all the time, and over the last few years, so few have been seen, that when we do see one, we seem to cheer when one is spotted. How sad is that?And Renkl points these changes in our natural environment out readily. Especially noting that fewer birds and animals have come out as well.Her ecological grief is real. Many of us require fuel to restore our spirits. Renkl’s chapters like…Praise Song for the Dog’s Marvelous Nose…The Bobcat Next Door…Praise Song for the First Red Leaf of the Gum Tree…Loving the Unloved AnimalsAre perfect to read to help restore that fuel. There were other chapters that brought so much joy to my heart. I found her chapters short and quick reads that definitely gave peace, joy and a sense of hope.

His  is here: https://www.goodreads.com//show...I have been on a healthy eating journey for quite some time, especially as I have been addressing how easily it is to become addicted to sugar. So, when I read Liong’s , I thought this book would be another teaching tool for me in my fight against sugar addiction. And yes, the first thing to do, was to acknowledge that it was a battle to overcome.For any one of us who struggle with sugar addictions, this book was enlightening. The author shares in his introduction…“…over the past 150 years food has become…not food. It’s not food. It’s an industrially produced edible substance.”We have become a society in a hurry, some on restricted budgets, and thus, prone to eat ultra-processed foods (UPF). It is marketed to us as healthy, without additive chemicals, and yet, that is exactly what it is not. The author states…“UPF is a collection of substances through which these deeper societal problems harm the body.” And once we understand this, we may find our way to solving our own specific interest in foods not good for us. To a point, that we may even become disgusted (as the author did) with the reality of what they are and how they don’t serve our body. The author makes us contemplate whether this will be enough to convince us to choose to not eat them at all. According to the author, we need to understand UPF and its impact, and what to look for.Which sometimes can be as simple as reading the nutritional labels on the processed foods that we purchase. And, attempting to look up what those ingredients are. I know, it sounds like a lot of extra work and time, for which we may be limited in having. But, isn’t this our body we are trying to protect?Let me explain why this has become so important to me. (And I hope you will forgive me this long .)A few years ago, I learned that I had nightshades. For those not familiar, nightshades create an allergic reaction to certain plants and vegetables that are typically toxic because they contain glycoalkaloids (a chemical compound found in a family of plants that creates health concerns for those showing sensitivity to those plants). Once I knew which plants and vegetables were in the nightshades family, I eliminated them from my diet. But I soon learned that sometimes they might be hidden in other products. As an example, after applying mustard to my hamburger bun a few months back, I didn’t understand why several hours later I was itching and breaking out in a rash. As it turns out, this particular mustard had paprika in it. And paprika is in the nightshade family. I have found that reading labels gives me better insight into what is contained in any food item that is being produced and packaged. Why mention this, besides my own issue sharing of nightshades?Because the author reminds us that it is sometimes easier to be oblivious to those ingredients. We want to believe that what is manufactured and/or marketed is truly meant for our well-being. And, unfortunately, this isn’t always the case. As an example, I learned long ago that anything that has high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) in it was not healthy. In fact, if you eat something with this ingredient, you will still think you are hungry, because HFCS is sweet. And this sweet manufactured sugar has a way of affecting our body chemistry, to think that we still are hungry, even after eating a full meal with dessert. So, the author guides us to read the labels and become vigilant in recognizing the ultra-processed ingredients that could affect us. And a lot of what the author shares, in Part I specifically, is about artificial sweeteners. Something manufacturers have included in their processed products, because it sells.As an example, the author has us consider the following….How many of us grew up on Coco Pops? Who doesn’t love chocolate in the morning? “Coco Pops meets the definition of UPF because of the glucose syrup, the cocoa mass and the flavorings. They are a spectacular triumph of engineering.”Bottom line, the author is warning us that modified foods are affecting us. It has already been shown to contribute to heart disease, diabetes, obesity, fatty liver disease and an abnormal level of cholesterol and other fats in the blood.So, what can we do with this knowledge?The author, a doctor, scientist and a journalist, has trustworthy credentials. Thus, for me, his book is a wake-up call, a warning to humans about how UPF is sickening us. He believes they are unnatural for our bodies to handle. He shows us how UPF translate as junk food: packaged snacks, soda, sugary cereals, energy drinks and/or candy bars. With UPF, manufacturers gain profits. For people who eat them, we gain weight and unhealthy dis-ease of our body. In fact, the author truly believes that the rapid increase in obesity since the 1980’s is “the correspondingly rapid increase in production and consumption of UPF food and drink products.” He concludes that obesity is not caused by the usual suspects – sugar, salt, fat or lack of exercise – but by the synthetics, chemicals and stabilizers in UPF. The question then becomes…Do we eat more when food is cheap, or do we eat more cheap food because the processing tricks us into eating more? (Remember what I shared about the addictive nature of HFCS?) Which leads any reader of this book to be scared straight. And perhaps that is what is needed in order for us to appreciate what it will take for us to re-evaluate what we choose to put in our bodies....more",Notes are private!,12,32,1,Mar 2024,"Mar 05, 2024","Mar 01, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62586003-ultra-processed-people

I have typically found his books to be pleasantly frivolous escapism. But not something that would make me feel like this is absolutely the book I must read! Still, when this one came out, I thought, why not try reading him again, and immediately ordered it from my local library. Premise: Our main character Justine works for a Los Angeles security firm that usually provides protection and security for the ultra-rich and celebrities. When Justine foils a robbery of one of their clients, by killing 2 of the robbers and having the 3 remaining caught by the police, she suddenly becomes an unwanted “hero” in the media. This immediately puts her in the crosshairs of the local mobster who had employed the robbers. And his reaction is to put a hit on her. Thus, the story becomes a chase between the hit man Leo Sealy, and Justine who is running and hiding for her life from him. To tell more would give away the overall plot and ending. Just know this…In typical Perry fashion, readers experience an intense, page-turning, thrill ride suspense thriller, that sets us up wondering if she will be able to out-run and, possibly turn the tables on this killer and the mobster that hired him.The Burglar Review here: https://www.goodreads.com//show...

As voters, we have a tremendous responsibility to pay attention and make sure these people are no longer attached or a part of our government offices, school boards, library boards, city councils and boards of supervisors, courts, and any other decision-making body that can take away our rights as citizens of this world. In fact, reading this book, brings to mind a quote by Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani female education activist and the 2014, world’s youngest Nobel Peace Prize laureate. She received the award at age 17. She said…“We realize the importance of our voice when we are silenced.” Hopefully, we will realize the importance of our voice much sooner than that! We can’t afford to have history repeating itself.And that is why books like this, are important. They show the ugly truth of a way of life that impacts those that are underheard. Still, even if Egan resists making parallels to the present in this book, they still lurk below the surface in this thoughtfully written story.This is the story of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) at the height of power. We knew the KKK mostly for their white hoods and robes and their banners insisting that “America is for Americans.” Egan’s focus. in his book, is on D.C. Stephenson, an amoral drifter with an entrepreneurial streak. He becomes the central figure in the Klan’s expansion across the American Midwest of the 1920’s, when they believed they needed to defend white women against Black people, Catholics and Jews. Egan presents the KKK quite graphically showcasing them as if we were watching a crime horror show, as opposed to reading a non-fiction story. As readers we are witness to torture, beatings and horrific lynchings. The author continues to share that the KKK saw themselves as racial purists, who stoked the fears of white persons against those that were “different” than them. He tells readers that in those days, it was okay to be outwardly Klan. Police and politicians were bribed, corruption was rampant; and, businesses owned by Jews, Catholics or Blacks were actively disrupted. He also lets us know that Stephenson was a monster and a sadistic sexual predator. But people placed their trust and admiration in this self-evidently horrible man and his fellow terrorists. We can also surmise that anyone with these beliefs were monsters. But, because the Klan was powerful, at that time, they were untouchable. Egan notes how Stephenson manipulated the public:“He discovered that if he said something often enough, no matter how untrue, people would believe it.”It was as if his horrific personality made him more popular. Why does this sound familiar?Because we are witnessing moral transgressions with a movement that begins with the unbalanced habitual liars who successfully blur truth and fabrication through endless repetition of falsehoods.So how do we stop this movement? This person? If we look at the title of the book it implies that it was one woman who stopped the KKK back then. But did she really? Apparently, Stephenson abducted, raped and murdered a woman named Madge Oberholtzer. Before she died, she shared a “dying declaration” of who her murderer was, in the hopes that she would get justice. But did she really stop the KKK?In some ways yes – with his trial. But most likely there were other mitigating factors. What readers get mostly is what the author gives us…His skilled storytelling. There are villains and heroes alike. High stakes drama. Courtroom action. Mostly, there is opportunity for readers to consider how this past plays out in present time. The unfortunate bigotry – antisemitism – racism – hatred that still exists. Can we stop this movement again? Is there a lesson to be learned…If this looks distressingly familiar – it probably is. Unfortunately, extremism still exists. And, because it does, we cannot afford to let this hatred walk the halls of government ever again.Please also read my Goodreads friend, Liz's  here: https://www.goodreads.com//show......more",Notes are private!,26,68,1,Mar 2024,"Mar 06, 2024","Mar 01, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61423989-a-fever-in-the-heartland

I sometimes wonder, whatever possessed the committee to pick them. A lot of times, the book is long (like this one), and/or over written and drawn out or not very well thought through. Or written in a way that doesn’t appeal to the average reader. And typically, the Pulitzer Prize is given for its contribution to culture and humanity – not necessarily literary merits. So, when this book, this winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 2023, was provided as a donation to my Little Free Library Shed, I was a bit skeptical about whether or not I would enjoy it. Thus, when I opened the book to begin my reading of it, I found myself pleasantly surprised when I had to force myself to put it down, so I could get some sleep that first night.What happened?This book’s author’s writing happened. It is an unusually-told story about interesting people. And it is a book spun from 4 narratives – a novel wrought from the tale of one man, his attempt to write his own story, his secretary’s memoir and a journal left by his deceased wife. It is also a story, very much about wealth, family, and power set in 1930s New York. And there is something to be said about a story about money. The value we place on it. That money can buy what we need and maybe what we want and eventually what we may dream about. But, at the same time, it makes us question, what really is money?The author shared…“The book is to an enormous extent about this man who's trying to control a narrative. And this is something that I found about wealth in general and wealth in America in particular. Great fortunes have the ability to distort and warp the reality around themselves. Furthermore, they have the power to align, to bend reality according to their own designs. I think, in fact, the greatest luxury good today out there is not, you know, mansions or yachts. It is reality itself.”And the telling of this story, was done in such a way, that intrigued me as a reader. With…Lyrical prose. Complex but fascinating characters. Expert plotting. But mostly, it was exquisite in its storytelling. So, to say the least, I was happy to find that this Pulitzer Prize book was a worthy reading experience. For me. I recommend it wholeheartedly. Interestingly enough, like most Pulitzer Prize winning books, there are mixed s. I am not surprised. 4.5 stars rounded up....more",Notes are private!,46,77,1,Mar 2024,"Mar 07, 2024","Mar 01, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/123018721-trust

I rearranged my question from ‘was I ready to give up on Michaelides yet’ to, should I even bother to read this one?Well, I decided to read it, especially when a friend donated the book to my Little Free Library Shed. What was I in for?The narrator, Elliot Chase, lets readers know right away that “this is a tale of murder.” But he is also clear in his telling of this story, that he is an unreliable narrator. So, there are lots of moments in which readers are left to wonder, did this really happen as he is describing?Still, so much of the plot seemed like a movie I had already seen or a book I have already read. How many times have we been told this story? And unfortunately, how could readers become invested in it with such a floppy plot, and unbelievable, one-dimensional characters?It didn’t take long for me to stop wondering who was going to be murdered or why.

I am now bringing both s to Goodreads.This book takes place a year later than “Girl Waits with Gun.” And because it is a sequel, it is recommended that you read the first book before this one. It is 1915 and a prisoner has escaped from the local hospital where he was being treated. And the local sheriff’s deputy is ordered to recapture him. Well, there is nothing routine about this assignment, in that, the deputy is none other than Constance Kopp. One of our ladies that we first met in “Girl Waits with Gun.” And the author has created her character, based on the real-life version of the person of the same name. Besides, who doesn’t love a cop named Kopp?Fortunately for Constance Kopp, New Jersey has passed a law that has allowed her to serve in this capacity. And she does so with pure satisfaction, believing herself to be the classic Sam Spade detective – after all, she is 6 feet tall, strong, matter-of-fact, unemotional and unflappable to a fault. The concept is a good one, but this book doesn’t come off as interesting as her first book. Because the author is relying heavily on a true story as the basis for her thriller, which makes it kind of fall flat in its fictionalized version. Still, there are some good moments. The author tries to show the challenges faced for women trying to be a steady wage earner, along with the nightmare images of female dependency. In this way, the author puts the attention on the importance of meaningful work to women’s identities and survival. And, the author’s vivid images of turn-of-the-century New Jersey towns and Manhattan landmarks help to provide an interesting diversion. Which allow readers, at times, to appreciate what it must have been like to be a woman in a man’s world during that century.

Perhaps even joy.Through this journey, this hotel, she re-learns how to put the pieces of her life together. Thought-provoking. Thoughtful. Beautifully written. Emotional. It may not be an easy journey, but it is one – with a subtle feeling of magical realism.  The author chose to write from a point of view of a woman – not to unlike herself – who experiences a Latin/indigenous culture as a foreigner. An experience she had lived for over 20 years. And thus, this story came to fruition. Maynard in her life, is an author, who became a part-time innkeeper, when during the pandemic, hired locals in a Guatemalan village to turn her writing retreat into a guesthouse. A special place for writing. For hosting writing retreats. A place to finish this novel. And, a hotel she learned to run.

Told in verse, this is a story about a middle school girl named Selah, learning a lot about herself, by coming to self-discovery about being on the autism spectrum. “I use to think my rules could save me, make me happy, but all I see now are the ways they make me feel like I’m not enough.”The author discloses in her ‘Author’s Note’ that she is also on the spectrum. She chose to write this book so that people could see through her prose and resources in the back, ways in which neurodivergent kids could advocate for themselves.

I want to say. I’m not just like any other kid.”As well as…How freeing it is to accept oneself and communicate one’s truth…“…Two different people who like different things…and for once I realize there’s nothing wrong with that.”And…Recognize the courage being displayed when one chooses this path of self-acceptance. “I am autistic.

There are so many different words that can describe this story, but those above came to mind automatically. How can we not be mesmerized by a person’s dedication to such a beautiful animal? Especially when so many are in danger. The author reminds us that elephants have a great spirit, and as a conservationist, she knows how important it is for us to save them. The author’s dedication to creating a rescue center in the wilds of Africa, for injured elephants, orphaned rhinos and hippos tugs at our heartstrings. We want to know that they will be safe and never harmed again. “My Thula Thula journey had been driven by love. First, I fell in love with my husband (who has since passed away), then the land, and then the elephants. Somehow, the elephants got into my soul.”The author shares the many challenges of running such a center. But she also gives readers an inside glimpse into the various personalities of the animals that grace the pages. Which adds to her own experience of why she feels compelled to do so. She also takes us through Covid – looting – poaching – loss of tourism to help pay the extensive bills, as well as the various permits expected in running a game preserve. This story was educational as much as it was inspiring. For anyone interested in conservation of our wildlife, nature and environment, this book opens the doors to understanding. The author shares...“I hope that my story and the story of the elephants…has made you fall just a little in love with them too, and understand the need to protect them. To educate people about conservation and to bring awareness about the vanishing wilderness with the urgent necessity to create more space for all our precious wildlife here in Africa, and in the rest of the world. To take better care of our planet and all of its inhabitants. We must all take on this task with passion and determination, so that future generations will be able to share one of the most profound and beautiful experiences imaginable – to see an elephant, a rhino, a cheetah or a lion roaming free in their natural habitat.” And yes, as readers, I believe we feel the love, too.

He is an author, playwright and screenwriter. His debut novel, “A Star is Bored” is apparently about an uptight celebrity assistant struggling to manage his eccentric movie star boss.And…That book was inspired in part by his time as an assistant to late actress Carrie Fisher. I have ordered this one from my library, so I am looking forward to reading it. He is also a two-time Emmy award winner from his time as a TV news journalist. And…One last fun fact, if you didn’t know, Lane is married to fellow author, Stephen Rowley who wrote “The Guncle” which I also read and ed this month. Review here: https://www.goodreads.com//show... On to this story…“I’m engaged.”“Engaged in what?”“Engaged to be married to a great guy.”So…Farmer Mom are you going to be happy for the couple? Your only son and the love of his life?She had expectations that he was coming home to help her on the farm. But…We readers had expectations for a Big Gay Wedding. Of course, we did, because that is what the title of this book is, right? What is the problem?Well…Farmer Mom hasn’t exactly been accepting and/or supportive of her son being gay. And…That gives a sense of why each chapter begins with:Countdown to Damnation: this many days/hours/minutes. So…What will it take to get her to change her thinking?There is a lot of spirit and a charming narrative voice…With…Animals to love (with Kleenex moments) and people to care about, and quirky family members and expectations to overcome. And…We would all like to believe that our loved ones are going to accept us just as we are, because we offer unconditional love to them automatically, right? But…Understanding, doesn’t always come easily, especially when we have different ideals and expectations for our loved ones. This is the gift that Lane conveys in his writing. There may be a path to growth, but it doesn’t necessarily mean it will be an easy one to follow. And…There will be sensitively written moments in which the author has readers face some difficult subjects (including homophobia and hate crimes). And…He does it in a way that has characters empowered to stand up for themselves and their loved ones. These are worthy reading moments.Will Farmer Mom find herself moving towards acceptance of her son?Do readers get to experience the big gay wedding?As readers…We are definitely invited. Humorous. Tender. Thoughtful. Thought-provoking. Uplifting. This is…A celebration of love of all kinds – a parent and child, animal and human connections and two souls choosing each other.I also recommend checking out my Goodreads friend Mai's : https://www.goodreads.com//show....

But…When it was donated to my Little Free Library Shed a few days ago, I decided to re-visit it. I am not a religious person, but I am a *spiritual being having a human experience. So…This book affected me deeply with its discussion about religion and politics and whether they are separate or inextricably tangled, and what happens when that occurs. There were so many things that were being said that I just needed to stop and pause and think about what I just read, like…“I don’t think religions are based on lies, but I don’t think they’re based on truths, either. I think they come about because of what people need at the time that they need them.”Plus…“Somewhere along the line, organized religion stopped being about faith, and started being about who had the power to keep the faith. You said that the purpose of religion was to bring people together. But does it, really? Or does it – knowingly, purposefully, and intentionally – break them apart?” Or…“Religion’s the reason the world’s falling apart…That’s what religion does. It points a finger. It causes wars. It breaks apart countries. It’s a petri dish for stereotypes to grow in. Religion’s not about being holy…Just holier-than-thou.” Now…I am not knocking organized religion. I love that each of us can believe in the God of our understanding. I am only pointing out the various questions and thoughts and concerns that were brought out in this book. Which I believe had some merit, considering how divided our country is right now. Actually…Not just here in the United States. Look at what is happening worldwide! And…How much of the conflict has to do with religious differences?So much of what was being stated in this book, brought to the forefront all that feels wrong about today’s world.Even though…Interestingly, this book was published in 2008.My concern of what I see too much of is…An expectation that we are all supposed to believe and think the same way, as opposed to working together across the aisle and appreciating our differences. And…Learning, and being open to, and growing from those differences. Instead…Our intolerant societies/countries have chosen to cause wars and hate and guns on our streets that kill innocent civilians as we sit back helplessly playing witness to politicians putting our democracy at risk with their indecision and blatant indifference. For what purpose?To please their base?“Religion was supposed to be a blanket drawn up to your chin to keep you warm, a promise that when it came to the end, you wouldn’t die alone – but it could just as easily leave you shivering out in the cold, if WHAT you believed became more important than the fact THAT you believed.”Yet…“This is precisely why the founders of the new nation of the United States decided to put an end to religious intolerance by making religious freedom (separation of church and state) a cornerstone of this country.”With this story…A crime happens and a person is convicted and committed to a death row prison. And…He wants to die, but he wants his heart donated to the sister of his victim. The state does injections with their state sponsored deaths, but to do that, would not allow him to donate his organs…“Don’t pay back in kind, pay back in kindness. If someone does wrong to you, do right by them.” So…An ACLU attorney and a spiritual advisor (Catholic Priest) with his own past, come to his defense. “Speak from your heart, so that she knows it’s worth taking.” This isn’t an ordinary death row inmate. There is something special about him. “There’s a principle in Jewish mysticism called tikkun olam. It means, literally, world repair. The idea is that God created the world by containing divine light in vessels, some of which shattered and got scattered all over. It’s the job of humanity to help God by finding and releasing those shards of light – through good deeds and acts. Every time we do, God becomes more perfect – and we become a little more like God.” And…As readers we will come to wonder more about what really happened to put this inmate in his current situation. But…Mostly, we will be fascinated by his gift, and the people that surround him in their willingness to work on his behalf. Will his attorney win the case that will enable the girl to get his heart?Will the mother of the daughter who needs a heart, who has endured so much heartache of her own be willing to accept the heart from the man she believed murdered her daughter and husband?Will readers learn the truth – whatever that truth is? (To say more is to giveaway spoilers.)Heart-felt. Heart-wrenching. Provocative. Thought-provoking. Complex, interesting characters.

While we are inside the young Tilly’s life, the story is painful, drawn out, and filled with fights between her parents, and the after-rage that Tilly takes out on her mother. But…At the same time, we as readers are reading Tilly in her child narrative voice. And by doing so, we can feel things from the child’s perspective.Still…We have adult Tilda.Tilda is back to the town where she and her mother lived after her parents separated, reading over her mother’s journals. Learning more about who she was, how she felt, and what life was really like for her. She also seeks comfort from one of her mother’s old friends. Does this help to move the story forward?In some ways, it softens Tilda. But…It’s really the dog Eli that makes the story worth the read. I’m not going to share much here, but know that this kinship between Eli and Tilda is not a typical one. Bottom line…This is meant to be…A feel-good story looking for a happy ending. And…It is…Optimistic and quirky.

He shared…“I had always been a brown man with a Muslim name. But I had been white enough — as a relatively well-paid, university-educated inhabitant of cosmopolitan cities — to partake in many of the benefits of whiteness.

And the other part of the reason was because of the size of the book. But what my original  focused on was a rant on the size of the book. So, this is my update to that  to explain how I really feel.I have read many classics and worthy books over the years that have been over 500+ pages that have absolutely captivated me. I have also felt sad when I closed the last page, feeling I could have stayed with this story with EVEN more pages it was that good to me. Do you remember Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follett? What an epic story that was. Even the Harry Potter stories topped 700 pages sometimes. Did I complain? Not once. I was so in to the magic. And even Les Miserables by Victor Hugo at 1462 pages! As frightening as that was for me, which I re-visited recently. I still was fascinated by the story.And East of Eden by Steinbeck. 608 pages. So yes. I have read and ed them all. And loved them all. So, I do feel, that there are points when stories come my way, that aren’t that great, and are rather long in pages, that I do have a right to groan and complain about them being too long. And wonder why an author feels the need to be so verbose!Now on to this book… I was devastated when my husband brought this book home to me from the library. What? How many pages is this book? 643 pages! I just went through this with “Age of Vice’ by Deepti Kapoor! And…“Past Lying” by Val McDermid! Why do these authors have to write these books with so many pages? “It is for love. You are doing this for love.” Nope. I won’t do it for love. I don’t care how beloved this book is. Stop it authors. Stop writing books with so many pages. You can tell your stories thoughtfully in shorter versions that will keep your readers engaged and interested. I will admit, I wanted to start you. Like “A Covenant of Water” by Abraham Verghese I wanted to give you a chance hoping you might give me the same feels. But…Back to the library you go.

However…He is one of my most popular author check-outs from my Little Free Library Shed. And…He is also one of the most donated authors, as well.So…Whether I am weary of his formulaic plots or not, I do appreciate that Patterson was one of the first authors to co-write books with up-and-coming talented authors…Thus…Giving them the name recognition they deserve for their writing capabilities. So…When this title came up with two of my favorite characters, Sherlock Holmes and Miss Marple, I needed to read it. The question becoming…What was Mr. Patterson, and his co-author, Brian Sitts, a go-to writer with Patterson on several other novels, as well as a television writer, going to deliver? And…Within a moment, just opening the first couple of pages, it is clear. This isn’t Sherlock Holmes, or Miss Jane Marple, or even Edgar Allan Poe. It is in fact, 3 characters with their last names and the infamous characters mannerisms in present day. So…What were the mannerisms that mimicked our famous trio?First…For Sherlock Holmes, we can always count on his detection and sharp observation skills and an ability to eliminate the impossible.Brendan Holmes…“Maybe, like the original Holmes, he considered himself the last and highest court of appeal in detection. Maybe he was self-destructive. Or maybe he just craved the drama.”And an…“Unnaturally acute sense of smell. A genetic fluke.”Second…For Miss Marple, mostly dressed in tweed, with a sharp logical mind and an understanding of human nature and their weaknesses.“…seemed quiet and thoughtful.” As well as…“Don’t mind me, I’m just the little old lady in the corner with a book. No life at all.”Third…For the famous poet, Edgar Allan Poe, not always agreeable or conscientious, and typically argumentative and untrusting. “…kind of brooding and rakish at the same time.”So…How do these 3 modern versions work? And…Most importantly, how do I feel now, knowing they aren’t the original Sherlock, Miss Marple and Poe?For me…As a reader I found myself following flawed characters with similar issues to the original characters. And…It left me annoyed and frustrated at times.But…They did their job and worked well with NYPD detective lieutenant Helene Grey. (And she with Poe, maybe, just a little too well? No spoilers from me.)Still…Was it really necessary to namedrop?“…which is why guests spotted Alicia Keys at the piano and Adrien Brody behind the bar.” And…What about those cases they take on?Predictable. So…Why keep turning pages?Short chapters...And...I was simply curious if anything would change. Or liven up. Or be unique or twisty with a surprising reveal. And…Could there possibly be more to these 3 characters who just happened to have these names and enough money to transform a building into a showpiece that housed their business and their private apartments?Was the true mystery these 3?So…I kept reading. And…One thing you can count on with Patterson…He won’t let one detail go unaddressed. Thus…All was solved. In this page-turning, predictable, easy-to-read story.

Sometimes…Even now, years later, although I am no longer facilitating, I will find myself doing the same. So…Did you know that…Connelly had auctioned off the rights to his character, Bosch in the early 1990s to Paramount for $50,000 as his first deal. And…When Paramount couldn’t bring Bosch to fruition, Connelly sensed that it could be a successful series on a streaming platform. Thus…He ended up having to sue Paramount, who wanted $7 million to return the rights, and settled for about 75 percent less. Thankfully…It paid off, and there have been seven successful seasons of Bosch on Prime Video, and 2 seasons of Bosch: Legacy, of which he is an executive producer. And…Two seasons of Lincoln Lawyer on Netflix, with a third already renewed and in production.Also…Connelly was able to infuse jazz music into the Bosch series, as a nod to his father…And…It turns out that Lance Reddick, who starred as Police Chief Irvin Irving (before his untimely death), actually played original piano music. Titus Welliver, who plays Harry Bosch, is also a jazz lover.

So…What is ‘Resurrection Walk?’The term resurrection walk “is that moment in which an innocent person leaves incarceration and returns to his or her deserved, happy life. In this case, that is a woman who pled *nolo contendere to the killing of her husband.” *Nolo contendere is a plea by which a defendant in a criminal prosecution accepts conviction as though a guilty plea had been entered, but does not admit guilt.Which…For Haller, is that feeling of knowing his expertise to “resurrect” a wrongly convicted person “from the dead” will bring him the “fulfillment” he has never known in the “practice of law or in life.” So…Is she really innocent in the killing of her dead cop ex-husband?And…If she is, who really did it and why? Michael Connelly once again has written a winning novel packed with intrigue and courtroom drama that had me turning pages so fast…I needed to know the answers, as much as the characters were searching for them. With…A very different theme of having a defendant guilty until proven innocent with the judge making the ruling. If…You are a Bosch fan, you know his popular saying, “Everybody counts, or nobody counts,” which Connelly feels is an excellent mantra in uniting the world.

And…When this new book came out from this author, I was interested. But…This isn’t Rizzoli & Isles. It is a new series referring itself as the Martini Club. Now…At first, I thought, what are they doing here with a group of older citizens in Purity, Maine who come together as their own “book club?” Are they trying to mimic “The Thursday Murder Club?” And…For those who haven’t followed the series, “The Thursday Murder Club”…It is about some senior citizens who come together to solve cold cases, but typically end up in the middle of murder investigations. Well…The Martini Club is not The Thursday Murder Club. In fact…The title of this book, fits the premise, when we find Purity, Maine a perfect setting for a few retired spies, who want to live peacefully, quietly and anonymously on the Maine coast. The problem is when a murdered woman ends up on the driveway of one of them, it opens doors to the past that need to be closed quickly…In order to regain their quiet life. Or…Will they ever get it back again? This book takes us back in forth in time, as we learn more about the characters past, and what message is being sent with this body. As well as…Gives readers the opportunity to follow the investigation with the acting police chief…Who is a woman, eager and motivated to prove to her male colleagues she is capable, as she dives in to work this murder case. The question becomes, is the acting police chief character effective at it when she is being placed against these spies – even though she doesn’t know who these people are/were?Could the author have done a better job to flesh her character out?Now…The idea for the story, came from the author’s note at the end when she revealed that her doctor husband started seeing patients in their small community, and discovered many of her neighbors were retired CIA agents. So…Did the author make this “real” life experience into a plausible, believable story?Well…An older cast of spies can make for an interesting, unique thriller.

I forgot to catch the ball, he ambitiously threw to me during a front yard baseball game with mWhen I was younger, my dad accidentally broke my nose. I forgot to catch the ball, he ambitiously threw to me during a front yard baseball game with my brother and I. It caused an enormous bump on top of what was already a prominent nose. This only added to my self-consciousness about my looks. But when I started to be compared to looking like Barbra, I didn’t feel so badly. I always thought she was gorgeous. Besides…Look at the cover of this book!To put things in context about my fan-girl status about Barbra…I had already been pouncing around the house singing all her songs, every time one would come out. If only I could carry a tune. As a 15th birthday present, my parents took me to the Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood for the screening of her film, “Funny Girl.” I felt like royalty, all dressed up seeing my favorite actress/singer. To this day…I am still a fan. So…When her memoir came out, I needed to listen to it. The question is…Will this be a fair and honest ?In her prologue, Streisand immediately shares her purpose for writing this vast 900+ page epic story…“Once you become famous you become public property. I like facts. I’m tired of people making up things about me. After all these years. That is why this story is being written.” She sees herself as a real person, and this book can share that, and her work and the process behind her work. And…Off we go to explore the vastness of Streisand’s world. Learning early on mostly that it begins with loss. The loss of her father, early. And…A cold, uncommunicative mother. A loving, giving grandfather. Religion. Order. Independence. For her. Because she had to count on herself when she couldn’t count on adults or others to be there for her.Many childhood experiences taught her to not lower herself to men. The first demonstrated by her unfeeling, unkind, condescending step-father. Nor to go against her word, because her mother didn’t follow through on her promises, and; thus, disappointed her. As she moves on to share her childhood memories, I wondered why she felt it necessary to share so many small details about her life. From what she ate, to dentist appointments, to lipstick, and so on. As much as it made her more real to readers, it also sounded a bit tedious, and only reminded us that this was a 992-page novel and/or a 48 hours and 14 minutes audiobook. Would it get more interesting over time?No doubt, all these details provide readers with a sense of how Barbra comes into her own independence and towards recognizing her own talents that would lead her to finding herself and her adoring audience.Still…Through her details we learn about her resilience and her willingness to work hard to learn whatever she could to become the actress she wanted to become. Because that is what she wanted for herself. Not always realizing the singing voice that stirred within her. She seriously pursued acting classes, and worked. She talks of her life living simply, and cheaply. Envious of others who had fathers. There is no doubt this powerful woman has broken down barriers. Between Broadway, Hollywood, the recording industry, and even Washington D.C. She is a woman everyone knows. You don’t even have to say her last name. Needless to say…It is interesting to listen to her New Yorkish, 81-year-old-self talk about her past, her insecurities, about growing up deprived, both economically and emotionally. When we her fans, know her for much, much more. Yet…This is who she wants us to know. And…Even as she drops names of the people she knew, Warren Beatty, or Joan Rivers, or Dustin Hoffman, it doesn’t really matter. Because we know…Her destiny. But still…Some of these old details seem unimportant. Maybe, she needed to get it out, because it humanizes her, and that is what she wants us to know of her. To know how important her educated father was, even though she didn’t get him long enough. To know that her step-father, named Kind, who was anything but, were all apart of molding who she would become. How tinnitus affected her.How she appreciated mentors. But…It was her singing that made the big difference. And her resistance to be the same as everyone else. (They wanted her to bob her nose – thank goodness she chose to keep it! And, to wear nice new clothes when she preferred thrift.) And how…She still chooses not to be put in a corner. She will always stand out. And then there were the men…Some resented her. Walter Matthau insulted her feeling he had more talent than she did (I won’t repeat his insulting comment to her on the set of “Hello Dolly”). Mike Wallace called her “totally self-absorbed” causing her to break into tears on “60 Minutes.” Still…There were some men who adored her and would even rewrite music for her. I would love to see the actual book – not to go through all 992 pages, but to glance the pictures. So… What did I really think of this book…Especially listening to the 48 hours and 14 minutes?Barbra will always be to me…The singer, actress, director, producer, philanthropist, activist, lover, mother, wife, friend, now author. So very accomplished. This may have been very, very long…But…I am so very grateful that she gave us this additional gift of her.

All and all…This was truly a slow journey toward self-knowledge that gives readers satisfaction as we wonder…What will become of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy? In the introduction of this book I received, Vivien Jones shared in June 1995…“This plot formula seems to give women, and the values they represent, a lot of power and responsibility. But it is power of a carefully circumscribed kind. The social order has been modified, not radically altered.”So…The power to motivate and reward change, which includes personal and social, truly lies with the woman, in this story.How can we not appreciate Jane Austen in her vision of women, beyond her own time?In the end…With the outcome never in doubt, it was wonderful to savor the journey. Austen, was deeply satisfying…More so, this time, because it was my choice to read it. Thank you, Steve.

When they meet online, however, they begin an intense and anonymous Internet romance, oblivious of each other's true identity.

When…Entering the home unbathed in ill-fitting clothes, we become aware of the poverty that existed for this girl. We learn she is coming from a household with several sisters and a pregnant Mom, along with a Dad who gambles away important assets. And…When her new caregivers provide her with a bath, and clothes and respect, we sense a feeling of need in them that carries over to the girl. “The sun, at a slant now, throws a rippled version of how we look back at us.

And…Since I am intrigued with historical figures, I thought why not read it. It just took me a while to get through it. And I forgot about mentioning I had it on my to read list. So…What happened with this book and me?Astor. If you look at early history, John Jacob Astor’s name will come up because of his fortune, and all that he initially did with his investments in real estate in or around New York City. He was a capitalist, business leader and philanthropist. And…Even if he held the title of philanthropist, it doesn’t mean he was entirely a good person.So…What is Anderson Cooper’s interest in the rise and fall of this American fortune of Astor?We know Anderson Cooper primarily as a CNN journalist…But…We have also been privy to his personal life, being the son of the late Gloria Vanderbilt, a celebrated socialite, heiress, designer and artist. Cooper and his co-author, Katherine Howe also wrote “Vanderbilt,” a chronicle of his own family history. So…In answer to that question…It probably helped that he had met Mrs. Brooke Astor in 1981 when he and his brother Carter were having lunch with their mother in New York. And…Later while researching his own family history for the book Vanderbilt, it just seemed appropriate to continue his research into the Astor legacy. Also…In an interview, Cooper shared that he was interested “in the pathology of how the fortune is made, the psychology of the person who was so invested in amassing money that they created this fortune.”So…The story begins with John Jacob Astor, and how he made his fortune. And…The book wanted to talk about the fortune’s destiny – how subsequent generations either built on or frittered it away. But…At times, the narrative drifted. Was it about the fortune, or was it about the time in which each generation was living? How…The authors chose to tell the story, seemed a bit disjointed. Do readers really care about what happened when there was a riot at the Astor Opera House, or do we want to know about the Astor’s directly?To be honest…I am not sure I can answer that question adequately.This felt like an overview of a famous family…Where…Money was the ultimate power, more so than taste, and more so than education. But…The book only seemed to provide a broad view from John Jacob Astor to Brooke Astor.For a better representation of the Astor history…The extensive bibliography provided in the Author’s notes at the end, may provide readers with a better historical perspective on the dynasty of Astor. ...more",Notes are private!,2,11,1,not set,"Jan 19, 2024","Jan 19, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/112975117-astor

Her first words…“Clothes are like songs. Just as hearing certain music brings back particular memories, so it is with certain outfits.”And…Off we go. Turning pages and being mesmerized by her. (And speaking of turning pages…it was so readable, I couldn’t put it down!)“I just wanted to be different. I wanted to be seen.” Well…Look at her now. Different. Seen. Definitely not invisible! It is a bit memoir that isn’t typical storytelling because we are invited in to see her through the ages via pictures and words…And…You (the fan-reader or soon to become one) are learning everything you want to know about her. And…As we come to see, pictures can tell a story, just as much as words do.Which…Makes this book quite the journey. From mountain girl who desired to be noticed, to young woman, to icon who could sparkle as much as she wanted.And…As readers, hanging out in her closet, we are given the most intimate details of her life.So…Having travelled this visual journey, it isn’t difficult to say…Dolly Parton, is a true celebration of life. Many different outfits at a time. ...more",Notes are private!,39,64,1,"Jan 17, 2024","Jan 20, 2024","Jan 17, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/123892103-behind-the-seams

I had to take a second look at it, because typically Scottoline’s books are traditional female-centric legal thrillers dealing with issues of justice, family and honor. But…This one was obviously historical fiction. Still…It focused on similar issues…But…Through the lens of World War II. With…A historical setting, the author provides period detail full of relatable characters, especially women who will do anything to defeat Hitler’s regime. The setting is Rome where life seems ideal in May 1937. But…As readers we know what is coming. And…The author showcases it beautifully as a moral storm brewing. Through her characters, we can feel the nation coming to terms with fascism and antisemitism. We witness the heroism against the setting of Mussolini’s rise to power. Some characters show blind faith in Mussolini’s charisma…Who…Brings the country to the side of Hitler, as well as gaining control of Italy’s Jews under horrific race laws that deprive them of their livelihoods and citizenship. And to be honest…As I read this, knowing the history, I could also feel something else tugging at me and of great concern…What…We have been playing witness to in our own United States, especially as we enter another election season. And the question that arises…What makes people follow such a person so blindly? (See  for Democracy Awakening by Heather Cox Richardson. https://www.goodreads.com//show...) Within this story, Scottoline delivers suspense. A slow-build of hate and violence against Jews. She gives us an intimate view of life in Rome from Mussolini’s rise to his defeat. (Although his defeat wasn’t overtly portrayed in the book.)And…As a reader I was rooting for the secret resistance against Nazi invaders. Another character in the book…Rome. There is a strong sense of place between the pages. Local foods. Music. Architecture. Romance. “What war destroys, only love can heal.” Her characters are so masterfully fleshed out that we can’t help but feel like we are reading someone’s memoir. Scottoline shares in her “Author’s Note” at the end that although the families and characters created in this story were of her imagination, “much of what transpires in these pages is true to the past.” Because…She took historical true events and some “real people,” and weaved them into the story. And her basis for a lot of this information, comes from her own research. She has studied the Italian Holocaust for years, beginning when she was an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania. In many ways, as readers we could feel her need to learn the truth of that time played out in her fictional story.And…This was why this book was so well-written, provocative, and substantive.

Mister died, and Michael may have escaped the event unscathed; but, something changed in him. Thus…Opening the door for him to become an advocate “street lawyer” for the homeless. (Hence: the title of the book.)“The frightening part of homelessness is what you don’t see on the street. About half of all poor people spend seventy percent of their income trying to keep the housing they have. …There are tens of thousands of people in this city who are clinging to their roofs; one missed paycheck, one unexpected hospital visit, one unseen emergency and they lose their housing.” What Michael learns under the tutelage of street lawyer, Mordecai Green, helps him realize leaving the firm to work on behalf of the homeless is what he was needing in his life. And…Then there is that file that tells the full story as to why Mister was at his original law firm, in the first place. “The trend in urban America is to criminalize homelessness. …Can’t beg, can’t sleep on a bench, can’t camp under a bridge, can’t store personal items in a public park, can’t sit on a sidewalk, can’t eat in public. …The cities selectively enforce general laws, such as loitering, vagrancy, public drunkenness. They target the homeless. Sweeps are common. …shovel up all the homeless, dump them somewhere else.”This story was published in 1998, and yet, the circumstances of the homeless that are shared here, feels as if it were written today.

She is a brilliant scholar and historian who is a professor of 19th-century For over four years I have received this author’s newsletter in my email. She is a brilliant scholar and historian who is a professor of 19th-century history at Boston College. And…In her newsletter…She gave her factual accounting of the news of the day with a historical framework based on her own educational background. I found her…Enlightening, and refreshing, especially during the height of the pandemic. Politics was gruesome and difficult to handle during that time. And…I still read her daily newsletter. https://heathercoxrichardson.substack...So…When her book came out, I was interested, and ordered a copy from my library.And… When it came, my nose was immediately immersed in it.I have included some meaningful quotes below. One in particular struck me…“Democracies die more often through the ballot box than at gunpoint.” It is heart-wrenching to consider that anyone would want Trump, a self-professed narcissistic authoritarian dictator to take office again. One who has no respect for our country or our laws or people. She goes on to ask…“Why would voters give away their power to autocrats who inevitably destroy their livelihoods and sometimes execute their neighbors?” She was referring to what occurred in WWII. But…Her words were also referring to what is happening right now in 2024! We know what happened in Germany. Why would we want to repeat what Hitler did to his country and people?Bottom line…The key to the rise of authoritarians…“…is their use of language and false history.” Why do you think “they” are so keen on banning books! Trying to erase history? She goes on to share that… “Authoritarians rise when economic, social, political, or religious change makes members of a former powerful group feel as if they have been left behind.” They think they are activists reclaiming their country, but instead they are spreading propaganda of hate and lies, because it is central to the identity of the people who are feeding the lies. It becomes clear as we read more about authoritarianism, that the following conclusion can be easily drawn by readers…‘Trump is a blemish on our democracy, and so is the new Republican party. It continues to undermine democracy. For anyone to think differently, they are not living in any basis of reality.’ Richardson’s focus of her book starting in the 1930’s is done on purpose. It is a wake-up call for readers to see what happened, and how repeating history is something we should not do! After all…It was because of the New Deal offerings, that Americans were able to overcome what Republican businessmen did to them from the stock market crash of 1929. Richardson does an excellent job of showing the rise of Trump, including his anti-democratic and documented term in office. She mentions clearly the Russia probe revealing interference in the 2016 election. As well as…The first impeachment revealing the interference in the 2020 election. And…The second impeachment revealing efforts to overturn the 2020 election and inciting an insurrection. So…It is impossible to  all these attempts by a U.S. President and wonder why he just didn’t try governing. What is refreshing about Richardson is that she puts it out for readers to look at everything, through all the history she cites…As factual information. And see it for what it is…This is history. This is evidence. This is the story. “We are all Americans together, and we must not forget that the common good is our common interest and our individual responsibility.” – Jimmy Carter No matter what your politics, this is a book  of this book. And…Her research is extensive. In closing…Perhaps…Martin Gurri author of the book “The Revolt of the Public” and former CIA analyst said it best when it comes to how we might want to feel after reading this book or even my …“Our differences of opinion may seem profound, but all of us want what is best for our families, the neighborhoods we live in, and the country we love.

I recognize the challenges he experienced with a Republican Congress. He shares that America is not merely feared but also respected, which is proof that it has done something right even in its imperfectness. “Those who complained about America’s role in the world still relied on us to keep the system afloat.” What stands out in this book is his relationship with Michelle.

There was always something profound or hidden within the message of those quotes that would give us insight into what we could expect as readers. So…As I began to read this book, I couldn’t help but find myself in a similar place. Looking at the opening quotes. The author had shared 3 quotes, but two quotes stood out. The first was shared by Emily Dickinson in 1896, when she said…“I lost a World – the other day! Has Anybody found?” There are so many ways to interpret this quote, outside of the story, but it did give me opportunity to pause and reflect. How do we feel when the world feels too complicated? Do we feel a little lost or out of our element? Then…The second quote by Stephen Hawking, shared in his book “The Universe in a Nutshell” says…“It’s a crazy world out there. Be curious.” And… There you have it. Exactly what we need to do – whether the world (or us) feels lost or not…we can find the time to be curious.Still…There is the story. And… I have to believe these quotes meant something to Ms. Kim as she had us readers begin the story. It is the summer of 2020, and Adam Parson vanishes while hiking with his 14-year-old son, Eugene. Eugene returns home agitated and alone, blood is caked under his fingernails. But…Eugene can’t tell anyone what happened.Because…He has a dual diagnosis of autism and Angelman syndrome, a developmental disorder which makes him incapable of speaking. So…What happened?Our narrator is Mia, Parson’s 20-year-old daughter who has moved home from college during the Covid pandemic. Reading her is like listening to someone talking a mile a minute in which you can’t get a word in edgewise. It feels frenetic and somewhat exasperating. Can we get to the point, please, and figure out what happened to Dad?Many possibilities for his disappearance are presented throughout the story, including the inevitable thought that Eugene could be responsible for it. Which…Gives readers an opportunity to learn more about what it is like to be in Eugene’s skin with his disorder. And then…The book takes a confusing turn. A third-act twist that leaves this reader uncertain what to think. It feels like language and science are on trial in this novel, failing the characters, and frustrating the readers.

I also said that,Catching up…In “Hungry Ghost” I shared that “my sister and I lived this experience, too.” In reference to having an eating disorder. I also said that, “Even as I enter into a new decade, it doesn’t mean that I still don’t struggle with body image issues. Did you think this was just a teenage thing? Think again.” Through therapy, I have been able to talk about my shame and discomfort with these thoughts and beliefs about myself, and my struggles with disordered eating at even my ripe old age. And…This was one of the books that I read years ago, and had been reintroduced to by my therapist. So…With all the stress of my husband’s illness triggering issues for me, I felt it was time to revisit this book again. First of all…Let me just say I am not a religious person. I am spiritual. And…There is a difference. So…I was a bit concerned about how I felt about having God in the title of this, or God being responsible for anything here. I have always been one to take full responsibility for my life, which included recognizing that love starts from within.But…I was interested in learning more about my disordered eating (and obsession about it) and how I could demystify weight loss. In a healthy way. And if that meant believing in myself and my own inner strength, I was ready to address it.And…What she shares in her prologue touched me. “…our relationship to food is an exact microcosm of our relationship to life itself.”So…It was time again to dive deep into my disordered eating issues. (A preoccupation with food and its adverse effects on my mental well-being and physical health.)One of the first issues for me to overcome, was the issue of shame. That feeling that I am not good enough as I am – and if I weren’t thin, I would not be considered attractive/interesting/relevant. And…That at my stage of life, why should I still be concerned, as a happily married woman, about how I look or am to others? Or even to my husband, who loves me for me. On page 84, Roth shares…“You are not a mistake. You are not a problem to be solved. But you won’t discover this until you are willing to stop banging your head against the wall of shaming…yourself.” Which…Definitely resonated with me. I knew the pressure I was putting on myself to be a specific weight, and it was literally killing me. I wasn’t experiencing food in a nurturing way, or respecting how it made me a healthy person. Because…What I would do would measure how good I was based on what my weight scale told me that day. And…If I wasn’t happy with the number, I would find a way to deny myself further nourishment. This behavior was definitely leading me down a slippery slope. I needed to simply…Trust myself. Love myself. Respect myself. Regain control of myself. This book, or guide, or meaningful sharing of empowerment, for those of us who struggle with eating disorders or disordered eating, is thoughtful and kind. Something we need to learn to be for ourselves. And…Roth takes us to the places that define thoughtful and kind to ourselves by providing this book in 3 parts: 1 – principles, 2 – practices, and 3 – eating. With these 14 chapters readers will be guided and prodded to look at eating differently. She also shares an epilogue of last words, and an addendum which also includes an Inquiry Practice and ‘The Eating Guidelines.’ (Included below in the quotes.)There is so much here to take in and appreciate. And…Even if the title is misleading (since it could be a guide for men, too – and God isn’t really a character in this book), there were still some tidbits to be gained from her personal experiences. So, let me just leave it with this from the author herself…“In each moment of kindness you lavish upon your breaking heart or the size of your thighs, with each breath you take – God has been here. She is you.”Yes…She is you. The best possible version of ourselves. A beautiful work in progress.

And…Loved most of all that it was a short book. Only 141 pages! When my mother and in-laws passed away, we were left with their stuff to go through. My husband and I lost our garage to all their stuff. It took so much time and emotion to go through it all, and eventually clear it so that we could have our garage back. One of the things she mentions in her prologue is…“The idea is that we should not leave a moment of crap behind for our loved ones to clean up when we die.”I could definitely relate to this. It changed our perspective on having things and stuff, because we did not want to put our kids through the experience we just endured. Yes…There may be mementos to keep. But…A garage full? No thank you. The author was 86 when she wrote her book and signed her prologue in 2021. The book was published in 2022. So, she had quite some interesting life experiences to share. She does it in 14 chapters with creative titles like… “Eat chocolate,” “Wear stripes,” and the “World is always ending.” Of course, there are more, but these stood out! And…She includes an appendix on “Bonus thoughts and tips on death cleaning.” (She reiterates that our loved ones will thank us. And, I couldn’t agree more.)I believe her intention was for this book to be humorous, with appealing advice on embracing life and aging joyfully. In her chapter, “Eat chocolate” she shares how important chocolate was to her, to the point she needed to purchase a calorie counting book. But…As she has aged, she reminisces…“The hot chocolate and whipped cream of my childhood left their mark on me…more and more I long for it. And these days with no calorie counter, no visiting dietician, and no cucumber salad, my longing doesn’t last very long, I just give in to it, to my desire for that chocolate.”She may try to be funny, sometimes successfully, but she still does speak the truth about the challenges we face as we grow older, and how we can do some attitude adjustments to appreciate that we are not dead yet. And…Just allow ourselves the gift of growing old gracefully.She does this by sharing her private moments of what she has learned…Live within your means. Enjoy the moment. Don’t complain. Leave this place better than you found it. And, wear stripes. (Never!)And…Yes, we have been-here-before. Probably written better in another book.

Even Brooks proclaimed in an interview that she wanted this story to be about a racehorse, the real and extraordinary late-19th-century Kentucky bay stallion, Lexington.And so…Her research began on the history of thoroughbred racing in America. But then…She realized that it “could not merely be about a racehorse, it would also need to be about race.” So…In the end, the novel is clearly about race. Despite the book’s title, the horse, Lexington, becomes less of a major character, by her writer’s choice to move in this direction to capture the history of that time. And…Even as Brooks shares this story, through the lens of 3 different time periods, readers can appreciate that this novel provides them with extensive historical research and polished storytelling. She shares the true story of Lexington which opens the door to exploring the roots and legacy of enslavement. By…Shifting between these 3 different time periods with a strong sense of purpose. The story is centered on…The well-educated Black art historian Theo and Jess, a white woman restorer for the Smithsonian in 2019 and their inter-racial relationship; and, Jarret, a Black enslaved groom and horse trainer in 1850, along with a stop in New York City in the 1950’s. As readers we will feel the deep roots and painful persistence of racism. The author shares very openly in her afterward that the horserace industry…“…was built on the labor and skills of Black horsemen, many of whom were, or had been, enslaved. After Reconstruction, the racing industry became segregated and these Black horsemen were pushed aside. White jockeys conspired to put their Black competitors at grave risk during races.” And…She does an amazing job of integrating this history into the story. Jarret’s story shows his desire to better himself along with his tenacious devotion to Lexington – which in many ways is a private rebellion against the backdrop of slavery. Theo and Jess are also at the mercy of their time, and progress is a complicated proposition. Especially when you consider the timing for her desire to write this book, in the wake of George Floyd’s murder. She chose to create the character of Theo with a privileged background. But, she was very clear in her writing that she wanted readers to also see, that despite his privilege, he can never seem to relax because of his skin color. To be honest this book was difficult to read, on many levels. As readers…We bear witness to the cruelty placed on horses, and how easily they are discarded within the horseracing industry. And…The persistent question of what would happen with enslaved men during their time.Both subjects were heart-wrenching.Still…This isn’t a grim, melancholy, sad book. Even if I did get angry and/or tearful at times. Because…I was simply too engrossed in the story…Which is a testament to the brilliance of this author’s writing. She created characters readers could easily care about, and a story that needed to be read. She showcased the power and pain of words. Along with…A history that needs to be understood. Truly, historical fiction at its best.

To be a leftover woman is to be a woman who remains unmarried in their late twenties and beyond.

Yet…There are so many other opportunities for kids to fully engage in this workbook, that hopefully the idea of this journal being for just hockey players doesn’t move them away from recognizing its other benefits. Or…If a child doesn’t play hockey now, maybe this journal will encourage them to consider it, especially if it is a sport that is actively played in their hometowns. Also…I love that the journal introduces kids to vision boards, as well. This is such an appealing exercise in guiding and inspiring children to be on a life visioning path. Visioning is a transformative process for activating individual’s unique gifts and tapping into their highest potential. How great is this where a journal encourages visioning in our children?And…Each journal page offers an opportunity for kids to share how they feel, and sometimes offers them the opportunity to consider 3 goals for that day. Some days may offer a prompted question to answer, or workout suggestions, or a game to play, or even an opportunity to draw something. And…The black and white illustrations throughout the journal are positive and uplifting.

You are excelling in the subjects of math, English, history, foreign languages and astronomy. In this letter you are invited to meet one-on-one with senior professors.

Of course…War is raging in Europe, and as a female graduate you are being offered campus training in code breaking, and a promise of a government civilian job in Washington upon graduation. How should these women feel, but honored.Obviously, once Pearl Harbor was bombed and the United States entered World War II, such a patriotic summons feels urgent and appealing. And…This is how we get to meet the Code Girls. An excellent obviously well-researched book that tells the story of these women. As we have come to know…Women typically were not encouraged to have careers, even if they were well-educated. Nor… Were they ever supposed to compete with men, especially if they had technical skills. But…This was a different time, and with men fighting in the war, women were needed. And…As we have come to learn, through books like this, there were a lot of skilled women with math and science accomplishments. But…Most thrilling in this book, is when we get to witness the women cracking the codes, using mathematical expertise, memorization and sometimes, even, intuition. Their accomplishments help with enemy battle plans, thus allowing the American military to sink ships and shoot down enemy planes, and blunt attacks on American targets. The author uses oral histories, declassified documents and her exhaustive research in the archives to tell this story. But…The downside of the book involves a vast number of facts, and multiple characters throughout the story. Sometimes it is hard to keep track of them all. Still…Without her book, we wouldn’t have learned about these amazing women and the puzzle-solving complexities that they were able to tackle.

Was I supposed to smile?He sets up readers with 6 parts. Appearing: the superficial parts; perceiving: the feeling parts; eating: the sustaining parts; drinking: the hydrating parts; relating: the sex parts; and, enduring: the dying parts. Under each part are several questions that seem to address the various areas of our body, in hopes that if our bodies could talk, it would. (Hence: the title of the book.) As an example…Some questions explored include…But what about my chin? What is a deviated septum? What makes hair curl? When I shave or cut my hair, does it grow back faster? Why are nipples sexualized? Why do stomachs rumble? What is gluten? What happens to weight when it’s “lost”? why not just play it safe and avoid preservatives? How is laughter medicine? Why do ears ring? Does caffeine make me live longer? How does my heart know to beat? Is aging inevitable? And so on.

This debut novel feels assured, engaging and full of fascinating detail with richly realized characters. Premise: orphaned Nora Brady grows up in the unconventional home of London surgeon Dr. Horace Croft. Seeing her potential, and believing strongly in science, he ignores her gender and nurtures her skills. This of course, is unheard of for 1845 London, because it is illegal for a woman to practice medicine. When Daniel a surgeon comes to his clinic, it threatens Nora’s secret. Especially when Nora makes a groundbreaking scientific discovery. Does she let Daniel take the credit, or reveal her expertise, destroying her?It is obvious that this author has created a story that is well-researched, and beautifully vivid in texture, thought, and history. Her characters, Dr. Croft, Nora and Daniel are smart, complex, determined with their own quirks and strengths. Which…Makes this story a nicely plotted narrative, with readers anxious to know what will happen. And…There are two love stories here. A slow-sweet burning romance and Nora’s passion for medicine.

Los Angeles is just a few miles away, although it takes a “lifetime” to get there with the extensive traffic and endless highways between the two counties. But…There was always something fascinating about Los Angeles that made it worth the trip when I was younger. Like: the tall buildings, the arts and culture, the ambiance. So…When I saw this book, I thought why not order it from my local library. This is an interesting creative set-up for a book by the editor, Kipen, a journalist, writing teacher and Los Angeles native. He has chosen to organize his excerpts like a diary journal from January-December. It makes it a very moving way to organize history – i.e., major events (wars, public ceremonies, assassinations, elections) with private joys and intimate details by some unknown and well-known individuals who found their way to LA. As an example…On May 14, 1935 Eric Knight wrote to a friend…“I finally offered my resignation. In typical Hollywood fashion it was rejected. I was fired two days later.” On November 5, 1912, Robinson Jeffers wrote to Una Kuster…“I have an Ayrdale pup, who looks as much like Bernard Shaw as it is possible for a dog.”On the same date in 1926 on Ambassador Hotel stationery, H.L. Mencken wrote to his wife…“This place is a genuine horror. If I described it literally I’d be set down as the damnedest liar ever heard of. Architecturally it is inconceivable, and the people all seem to be imbeciles. The movie folk, by comparison, are enlightened and civilized.”The stories in this book, through these interesting diary entries, sometimes showcase parts of the Old West with the gold mines and roving bandits, and all sorts of mundane references to what happened in someone’s day. But…Not all entries are filled with love towards the town or its people. W.E.B. DuBois and Langston Hughes find it less than congenial to black people. There is anti-Semitic commentary from Ayn Rand and E.E. Cummings. And…There is so much to behold within these pages of interesting events for many names who may be familiar to us…Theodore Dreiser reports staging an orgy. Thomas Mann writes “Doctor Faustus” here. Jack Kerouac drank “jumbo beers” and Ross Macdonald tells Eudora Welty that he swims with seals. We will also see signs of social classism. Nature writing. There is…So much to tell and reveal about the richness, and beauty, and uncomfortableness of being within the city.

I found myself attracted to the cover of a cow sitting on the sofa. And questions began to form…Who is this author? What will appeal to me, about reading his poetry? His work, as described by him, is considered small poems, a way of including large content into tight spaces. Short messages that create an impactful reaction. A minimalist practice.When the book came from my library…I just began to read. And strangely different poetry walked through my life, like…The VisitThe wind blewOpen the front doorAnd sat downIn my father’s chair.Three for a quarterJust as you can tell the age of a treeBy the rings within it.You can tell the vintage of a country songBy the coin requiredTo play a tune on the jukebox. The poems are so short throughout, it took me less than an hour to read the entire book. There is something satirical about his words. Real. Thoughtful. In many respects, I felt odd after I read each one. What message was he trying to convey? There is such truth in his words. A different way of looking at the world around us. Seeing everyone for who they truly are. A relationship with the world, with each other, formed in just a couple of sentences. Is he asking us to question everything? Or see things as they truly are?The author is a former U.S. Poet Laureate (2001-2003). He served as New York State Poet from 2004-2006, and in 2016 he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters. This isn’t his first work.But…It definitely is creative. He dares us to look at the world creatively and with open eyes. See what we sometimes don’t notice. Be present in this moment. In this world.

Whenever I have found myself in an anxious state of mind, I put my hand over my heart ♥️and breathe. I keep my hand there as a way to steady myself, my pulse, and my mind. Focusing on my breath helps to calm me. This book seems to focus on how breath is about healing and preventative medicine. We just need to not take breathing for granted. The author’s focus is on helping the reader breathe. He provides many regimens, with the intention of guiding readers to learn what is best – i.e., inhaling-exhaling techniques. And…In so doing, accordingly, we can be cured of many maladies. The question is…Do we believe him – or is this another pseudoscience?To be honest…I was most attracted to the appendix where the author provided many different breathing methods.

But…It was a donation to my Little Free Library Shed a while ago, and the book was pretty beaten up when I received it. It was water-worn, and obviously well-read. I also noticed that it was well-travelled, having once been a part of the New York Public Library system. Long withdrawn. And…It was Herman Hesse. Famous for Siddhartha and Steppenwolf. I learned that the book was originally published in German in 1943, and took him about a decade to write. It was supposed to be homage to his old age. It also won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1946.The bulk of the novel is presented as a chronicle to the future, written by a historian in the year 2400, with the order to maintain those values considered worth preserving after the chaos of the 20th century wars. Yet…This future world is also a world of the past. We are in tiny provincial towns, and Benedictine monasteries. And…This is where we meet Hesse’s hero, Josef Knecht, an exalted exponent – the Magister Ludi, highest servant of the Glass Bead Game. (Hence: the title of the book.) The game is conceived as a ceremony both mystical and rational – almost like chess, but more intricate. And thus…This game illustrates how the most varied aspects of nature and human experience can become part of a universal harmony. (Such as: Music, mathematics, scientific law.)In opposition, the religious orders devote themselves to an active involvement in human time and suffering. This will no doubt affect our main character. And…Much will be gained from readers in watching his decisions. There is a lyrical quality to Hesse’s novel and stories. It is obvious that his stories ask readers to question accepted values, to rebel against the system, and to challenge conventional “reality” at a time in which he lived. So…Does this make us want to do this now, too? Probably so. Which makes his writing, possibly more relevant, even now. He appears to speak a simple language accenting the search for salvation, most likely what contributed to his success as a writer. Are we not in those times again, seeking salvation in some form?I once read someone describe Hesse in the following way…“His works usually explore an individual’s search for identity and a spiritual quest outside society. These aspects help enhance the reader’s perspective while reading his written pieces.” Theodore Ziolkowski who wrote the forward (September 1989) to this edition shared…“…(this book) offers the American reader the opportunity, …to dare to laugh. If parody alone can adequately render the reality of our times, only irony offers us the freedom and detachment that are the essential conditions of responsible analysis and action.”To be honest…This was not an easy read.

I know…I’m dating myself, telling you this story.But then…You need to know my motivation for reading Henry’s story, right?Back to Tuesday nights…I was like any swooning girl, when Henry Winkler’s Fonzie entered the screen. How could we not resist, the super-cool, loyal guy wearing the infamous leather jacket? (Now part of the Smithsonian Museum collection in Washington, D.C.) Besides…When the Fonz spoke, people listened. So…As a fan-girl, I watched the evolution of Henry Winkler as he moved beyond “Happy Days.” At first…All I could see was the Fonz…But…Eventually, he came into his own as he developed new stage presences with the characters he would create. One being the Dad in the hit television show, “Royal Pains.” Did you ever see that show? If not…I highly recommend it. Perhaps your local library might have it available. It was… A delightful, humorous, comedy-drama that was brilliantly acted and written. There are other shows and movies to his extensive resume, but “Happy Days” and “Royal Pains” resonated with me the most. And so… When his memoir came out, I was interested. Could I see beyond the screen persona, or the tabloid articles?I believe in factual evidence. And…The fact that he was writing his story, I was ready to read it. To be honest, I did not expect this. First…I was greeted with a short book. So far, every memoir or biography I have read recently on any actor/celebrity has been huge…(translated: so many pages.) This one is less than 250 pages! Second…I read an honest, gripping story which could have made anyone sad (especially reading about his childhood)…But…Instead, he told it with humor, and grace and a quickness that sometimes I found myself holding my breath. Because…He breezed through chapters in his life quickly and matter-of-factly, while not holding back, or dwelling on any one subject, either. I found myself, although spinning with details of his life, I couldn’t help but feel grateful he wasn’t wasting pages with minutia. In fact…He got right to the point.He knew he wanted to be an actor since he was a child. Early on in his story, he shared something that I could relate to, because of my own life experience. When I was younger, my mother was concerned that because I was too shy, I wasn’t making friends. She wanted to find a way for me to come out of my shell. So…In speaking with a counselor, they determined that I should take an acting class in my first year in high school. At first, I was terrified of being in front of so many people, but, when I was on stage, something magical happened to me. And…I believe Henry described it best…“When I was on a stage, playing someone else, I was transported to another world, one where pretending made you successful. What I was miserable at was being myself.”I know that person he is describing…that was me, too! And thus…A kinship was developed. I continued to read his story with interest. About…The quiet unassuming guy with no confidence in his abilities beyond his comedic talent as “the Fonz.” Of course…It doesn’t help when everyone (including this reader) only sees him as “the Fonz.” Can he break out of his popular stereotype and evolve as an actor…Or…Better yet, be accepted in differing roles? Through his self-consciousness, as readers, we come to know the real Henry Winkler. And…We are treated to a raw, honest and thoughtful portrayal of life in his lane. Which…Led me to love him even more. ...more",Notes are private!,46,86,1,Dec 2023,"Dec 06, 2023","Dec 01, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/65215014-being-henry

Did the Oscars become political – or were they always that way…And…I just didn’t realize it. Until I opened my eyes to the realities of popularity and marketing. Of the stars, and the movies. What were the Academy Awards anyway? This book attempts to answer that question. We readers can consider it a tradition celebrating great movies and actors and all those behind-the-scenes people that make it worthy for viewing. But…Look at all it has become, especially with the advent of social media. “They’re a fashion show. They’re a horse race. They’re an orgy of self-congratulation by rich and famous people who think too highly of themselves.”Still…This book wants us to see the Oscars as something more. With 11 distinctive chapters, it focuses on…The academy’s turbulent birth, the rebels, the plot against Citizen Kane (war time), the greatest star, screenwriters and the Hollywood blacklist, the counterculture, running the asylum, fiasco period, the Harveys, making history, and; #OscarsSoWhite.And…However, you want to interpret what that all means, it is a statement to what has become of Oscar.“In recent years, the Oscars have become a conflict zone for issues of race, gender, and representation, high-profile signifiers of whose stories get told and whose don’t.”This book is about 502 pages, with additional pages for Notes and a Bibliography and Index. It is not necessarily a book that you read cover-to-cover, but how you choose to delve into any one chapter that appears interesting for readers at the time. It definitely will not shine a pretty light on anyone who has ever been in the limelight. Someone like Harvey Weinstein comes to mind, in Chapter 9. The book is definitely well-researched. Pictures in black and white are at the beginning of each chapter, reflecting the direction that chapter is going to take. But…It is verbose. And there is a lot covered that may have been read before. Again…It depends on your mood as a reader, and which subject chapter appears most interesting to you. Schuman believes the key to understanding the awards comes down to power:“…who has it, who’s straining to keep it, who’s invading the golden citadel to snatch it.” So…In that sense the book showcases the power struggle. And…That is probably why I lost interest in watching the Oscars show. Or caring who won, and who did not. It just didn’t feel genuine any longer (to me).

So…Even though so much of it felt familiar, (probably because I have followed Bosch to the present, including watching the Amazon Prime series)...As I began to read this one, I knew I was in for an interesting ride.Connelly has a way of writing his stories, and characters, that no matter where you are in any of his novels, it feels fresh and compelling. He also has just the right touch of police procedurals to not make you feel lost because you didn’t read the novels in order. So…Yes, this can be read as a stand-alone. Of course...It is always best if you can follow any character-driven novel, such as Bosch, in order…But…This didn’t feel wrong to read Bosch in his past.

The novel chronicles the AIDS epidemic from its initial outbreak to the present – making it among the first, to convey the terrors and tragedies of the epidemic’s early years as well as its repercussions over the decades. And…This author puts this epidemic into historical perspective without sugar coating its horrors. Including recognizing that if one got AIDS in 1985, it was most likely a death sentence. Central to the story is Yish Tishman, a gentle and decent guy who lives with Charlie Keene, a not so nice guy who is the publisher of a gay newspaper. Yish works for Northwestern University to help establish a permanent collection for their campus art gallery. For them, as for many, questions about fidelity, and about secrets takes on a new urgency.The 2015 sections of the story, which in my opinion didn’t really add to the overall story, still had its own sense of mystery with Fiona trying to find her daughter. But for readers…How do these timelines connect?I can only say that with the plots and subplots, the question that seemed to challenge me most as a reader was, “what happens next?”With Yale’s story, we as readers can be fascinated by the work he does in the art gallery, and what happens when a trove of drawings by great artists of the early 20th century are provided to the University. Are they real or not?With Fiona’s story as she searches for her daughter, Claire, although compelling, was it necessary to the overall story?Without giving away anything, I can only talk about the feeling of it all.

The story is based during the suffragist movement in England in the post-WWI era. Supposedly this is going to play a major role in the story, but I’m not sure it fit well in how it was used.In some ways, Redfyre’s character feels like a combination of Lord Peter Wimsey and the TV version of Jack Robinson from Miss Fisher’s Murder Mysteries, if you are familiar with either of those series. Like Wimsey, he is a bit upper-crust. University educated, and an officer of the Great War, although unscathed. In his actions, he is more like Jack Robinson (the TV version). The police officer version. Methodical investigator. Above reproach. As well as…Rather handsome.Does all this matter? Not sure, but the points seemed to be important to the author.The case is rather dark with a young female trumpet player receiving deadly poison pen letters and an attempt on her life after a Christmas concert at the college. Redfyre actually witnesses the attempt, because he happened to attend the concert. As the investigation progresses, more bodies seem to fall. And… It is up to Redfyre to figure out the culprit.I am just not sure I liked the style of mystery drama that was laid out for readers.

Oh…And, let’s not forget the loyal, smart dog, Deadweight. Is this a comedy, or a mystery? Or something else?I was first taken in by the opening scene of the old woman, who is just 65 but being described as if she were in her 80’s. She is a passenger on the subway. But…Her presence isn’t really noticed. “People stare at their phones, headphones in their ears, shrinking from and swaying with the unending wave of humanity, quickly forgetting that an old person has entered their midst. They excise her from their consciousness as if she’s unimportant, recyclable. Or they never even saw her to begin with.” It is her job not to be noticed. But, in so many cases, it saddens me that humanity chooses to ignore the elderly. And, that scene affected me. Reminded me how easily the older generation has become “invisible” to most generations. Out of sight, out of mind? However…In this particular case, this elder person, was invisible on purpose to do her job, and that was to eliminate an individual who happened to be travelling on the subway, too. Job done efficiently. Without notice. Just like her. So…This story, isn’t as innocent as an old woman with a knife to cut vegetables, perhaps. She has a job. And she is a partner in this enterprise. That is serious about their jobs. And her name according to the narrator is…Hornclaw. And… She has a dog, named Deadweight. Who knows her place. But…Then, the other characters with odd names, are all part of this enterprise business. What specific role will they play?And…How will we feel as readers as Hornclaw’s story unfolds? Well…Soon, it became clear that this wasn’t a comedy. And that…There will be consequences for being in such a profession. And as we weave back and forth between past and present, we learn more. “Let’s not make anything we have to protect.”The question becomes…Does it make us care more about her or not? Because we know that is key to any story – whether or not we connect with the characters.So…what happens when the greatest amount of feeling as a reader goes to Deadweight, the dog?And yet…I still turned the pages.

So…When I was able to get this copy from my local library, I was all in. With this story, the author effectively combines a family drama with a captivating psychological mystery, while staying close to one of my favorite types of books... police procedurals. It is also unpredictable with a witty storyline. Which when you think of it, using the word “witty” to describe a plot, is not a usual description for a police procedural mystery series. But…I think that is what makes this story flow so nicely. Our continuing character, Cat Kinsella is a strong and feisty woman, who is also portrayed as an excellent detective. She has a sarcastic sense of humor which goes along with her flawed imperfections and shortcomings.

The story focuses on a young girl with an eating disorder. Because of him…This book is now in our local community library. Yes, ers, your words do make a difference. I was so entranced by what he said, that I knew this book would be meaningful to young readers. The issues this book addresses are critical, timely, and real. And…Sometimes it takes a colorful, beautifully graphic novel such as this book to showcase a message of this importance that can drive a point. And…When I read Steve’s , I knew this would be an important book for our community, so I made the request, and they accepted it and purchased it. And…Now, I had the opportunity to read it, too. Why, did this issue drive me so hard? So importantly? Because…My sister and I lived this experience, too. And…Even as I enter into a new decade, it doesn’t mean that I still don’t struggle with body image issues. Did you think this was just a teenage thing? Think again. Yet…If we can find a way to reach out to our young readers sooner than later, maybe we can help them before they become my age. So…That they aren’t having to be looking at themselves in the mirror with guilt while straddling a weight machine and punishing themselves if they gained a 100 grams for eating an apple the day before. Can we just be happy with ourselves, just as we are?In this book…The very first graphic bubble shows the words…“For as long as I can remember, my mother always watched what I ate.”That sentence hit me like a train running off the tracks. I could feel the impact as if the character were speaking directly to me. And…I knew immediately, this was the right book. The right decision for so many readers. I know my Mom never knew that her actions, or even her words, about what we eat, or how we look, could have such an impact on us (my sister and I)…But…How many really do? Because…Val’s thought bar says exactly what is so true for any of us who suffer from an eating disorder…“My mom acts like I don’t ever think about what I eat…but the truth is, I don’t think about much else.”The constant weighing in, the counting calories, the denying food intake if weight should exceed the desired number on the weight machine could be a relentless daily ritual. In the case of the character, Val, she purges her meals. Thankfully, this is something, I never did. I had other tricks I will keep to myself. Something I am not proud about – but, no longer do…gratefully.And…The constant scrutiny of her mother, and the stress of it, puts her over the edge to the point that she almost loses her friendship because she can’t admit that she has this problem. Not even to her mother. Especially after a devastating family tragedy. And…Can this unfortunate tragedy and friendship help Val come to terms with her eating disorder and find the help she needs?Val places some truly difficult questions before herself as she struggles to face what is happening…“Am I my body?” And…Directly to her mother…“Why does it matter so much? Who cares if I am fat?” “Why can’t I be enough? Why am I not okay as I am?”But…The greatest message of all from her Aunt Nikki…“Love yourself the way that you want her to love you.” In the end it always comes down to doing just that. Knowing that “I am enough.” Does Val find her peace with her mother? Most importantly, does she find her peace with herself? And…Even more so, will young readers find value in reading a story like this…especially if they are struggling? I’d like to believe that the answer will always be yes. But…I don’t give away spoilers.

One son moved with his family to Texas, and my other son moved with his family to Oregon. So…We manage to maintain relationships for the most part through technology. And…One of the things I look forward to is reading time with my grandsons. Every Tuesday during the school year, my grandsons will have a book that they read for a few minutes to me via FaceTime. We have been doing this for years now. We started with graphic novels like Sponge Bob, or Diary of a Wimpy Kid that were based on their age and interest. We have since graduated to books like…C.S. Lewis’s Chronicles of Narnia, Hunger Games, Erin Hunter’s Warriors (Cats) series, Harry Potter, and/or Grisham’s Kid Lawyer series. There have been many more, too many to count or even remember…But…I think you get the picture. Now, that one of my grandsons is in high school, we just spend our time chatting about what has been happening for him in school or that week. Still…I love that both have a love of books. And…What was particularly fun, (especially when we were reading Harry Potter) was when my son and daughter-in-law would reward my grandsons with being able to watch the movie after they completed each Harry Potter book. Of course… When I discussed which was better the book or the movie with my grandsons, what do you think their answer was?I love that as adults, parents, teachers, and/or grandparents, we have the opportunity to expose kids to all sorts of books to entertain, and teach. To set their imaginations adrift. Because…Quite honestly, we don’t know what this may awaken in each child. We can only hope that their interests will encourage them to grow their own self-confidence and skill-sets to strive to be something more for themselves.And…In this story (yes…I am finally getting to this book) we have a grandmother who starts her grandchildren on an adventure with a book. How could I not be intrigued by this premise? First of all…Did any of you watch the television show “Glee” ever? Well, if you did, I absolutely loved Chris Colfer. He played Kurt Hummel. Immensely talented award-winning actor/singer! Does this mean he has carried over this talent as an author?So…As I mentioned we have a grandmother who bequeaths on their 12th birthday, a family heirloom, an old storybook anthology whose cover turns out to be a dimensional gateway in the tradition of C.S. Lewis’s Narnia. This gift is given to Alex Bailey and her twin brother, Conner. She is energetic. He is a sarcastic jokester. But…They are also grieving the death of their father. So…This book, and this “door” might be just what they need. This land of stories gives readers a very different view of fairy tales. And…It isn’t quite how we would see Cinderella, or Sleeping Beauty, Goldilocks or Snow White. And…A bit of playfulness with our traditional fairy tales is what might be needed. The story is imaginative, captivating and a page-turner…But…Let me just say this…I do p books before I determine whether it would be a good read-along with my grandsons or not. And…This one, I decided might be better for a more “mature” mind. Not that I don’t consider my grandsons capable at their current ages. After all, they did read Harry Potter. And we all know that Harry Potter is filled with characters like “he who must not be named”…That…Even I had to hide my eyes for some of HP (which is hard to do as a reader)…But…In that instance, I allowed my kids to make that decision for my grandsons readiness for that series. In this case…This book has a different vibe. A fun sarcastic, silliness to it. That just didn’t seem to fit their stage of interest. However…When I looked up the age range for this book, it said 8-11 years old. By the way, this is the first in a series of six books. And…This one was #1 on the New York Times Bestseller list when it first came out in 2012.So…Some fairy tales fit for some kids, and some don’t fit for all kids. Even if they are re-imagined. Keep that in mind when considering this book/series. ...more",Notes are private!,4,24,1,not set,"Nov 19, 2023","Nov 19, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11607446-the-wishing-spell

I will always be grateful for that college emeritus course. This book of essays, which also includes a novella, titled “Genesis,” was published after his death. This book was meaningfully compiled by his son, Page. Interestingly, with a foreword by Mr. Stegner himself. One thing he shares about the West he so loved and immortalized in his writing, (even if he wrote it before he passed in 1993), it still rings true today…“And in spite of much human destruction, in spite of the huckstering of scenery and the commercializing of beauty and grandeur and awe, there is a lot of the West where both illimitable freedom and perfect sanctuary may be found.” These stories showcase his love of the American West, something that has always been a part of who he has been in all his writing. We can only hope that the land will continue to be protected, just as these stories should be treasured.This book includes 23 essays along with the novella I mentioned above (all written between 1948 and 1992). Many are little-known items that he had submitted to magazines and/or journals. Stegner is mostly known for being a conservationist. You feel his love of the land and his desire to preserve it throughout his writings. We can only hope that more will honor him in the same way through eternity. ...more",Notes are private!,2,14,1,not set,"Nov 10, 2023","Nov 10, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/176776.Marking_the_Sparrow_s_Fall

I was so entranced I couldn’t put the book down. So…I couldn’t wait to read her debut…this one. With this one…I have meandered through it. Savoring every moment. Getting to know Ella and Jamie and following them through their complicated non-“relationship.” For whatever reason, I couldn’t wait each evening to crack open the book and find myself back in Oxford wanting to know what was going to happen next. Why did I approach each book differently? After all…I loved them equally the same. I wish I could give you a compelling answer. Perhaps… There was something more mysterious to both Jamie and Ella that needed time to discover. And…It was okay for me to not rush that discovery. As I read, I would tell myself…I would enjoy watching them, and eventually find out their backstories as I did. Early on there is a tutorial session that Jamie is having with Ella. He is her Professor, after all. He describes the importance of poetry to her and says…“To truly experience a poem, you need to feel it. A poem is alive, it has a voice. It is a person. Who are they? Why are they? Hearing her words, as she speaks to you, you think and feel certain things. Just as, hearing my words now, you think and feel certain things. Reading poetry is a conversation of feeling between two people. It shouldn’t answer anything, it should only create more questions, like any good conversation. What did she make you feel? That’s what I wanted you to examine.”As readers, we know we are beginning the dance between these two. And it feels deliciously intimate. But then…We learn more about what is really going on for Jamie. And…We are drawn in, just as Ella is drawn in. And…We feel things. Strongly. How will this truth be reconciled? What really happened to Jamie’s brother, Oliver, and how has this history impacted Jamie’s relationship with his father William? And…We can’t forget Ella who from across the pond is working on a campaign for a woman running for President of the United States while attending Oxford. Who does that? Well. Ella does. And…That adds more depth to the story, too. The question then becomes…Where does Ella’s life belong once she is done with her term in Oxford?Even her dear friend Charlie argues with her when he says…“For someone who loves her country so much, you seem rather keen to change it. …I love you, I do, but you are a class-A idiot if you think that’s life. This…” He gestures between Jamie and me. “What you two have, that’s life.” And…The beauty of the decision made is what makes this story so readable. So much so, that when I woke up at o’dark thirty, I chose to take this book with me, and read until I finished it this morning. Because…I wanted you to know how much I loved it. And…How much I wanted you to love it, too. “To know and love one other human being is the root of all wisdom.” – Evelyn Waugh, Brideshead RevisitedBe sure to read Behind the Book Essay at the back of the book where the author gives some background as to how she came to write this story. ...more",Notes are private!,10,27,1,"Nov 03, 2023","Nov 09, 2023","Nov 03, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/39650737-my-oxford-year

When we leave him, he is cheerfully heading north... “because that is where you go if you don’t know where you are going.” Could it be possible that if you channel Stuart, you can gain courage and strength to leave the comfort of your home, family and friends to search alone for something or someone important?

There has also been a television series.

Still…When the summer ends, so does everything else.As mentioned, Duke is off to his successful Hollywood career.Lara on the other hand quits acting, marries her cherry farmer, Joe, and becomes a mother.Lara’s Emily grows convinced that Duke, was her actual father – so much so, that even readers are left in genuine suspense about whether it is possibly true, as well. But…The larger theme is that it may not matter…Children inherit the full range of our experience, as much as genetic traits.This novel is folksy, cozy, domestic contentment. When Nell laments the celebrity Lara could perhaps have been, she exclaims…“Look at this! Look at the three of you! You think my life would have been better spent making commercials for lobster rolls?”Each daughter is given their own personality. Emily – fiery; Maisie - sensible; and Nell - intuitive. Against the backdrop of the pandemic, and their mother’s backstory, this book becomes a wistful meditation – a story of mothers and daughters. An opportunity for closure for Lara. Maybe… Even an awakening of what is important to Lara – of what she is lucky to have – what any of us are lucky to have, in these circumstances. Is this a peaceful existence? Is Lara really happy? Or…Did she find a contentment, because that is what one settles for in life?I understand that the audio version has Meryl Streep as the voice narrating. That must have been a real treat for readers of this book....more",Notes are private!,30,94,1,"Oct 31, 2023","Nov 17, 2023","Oct 31, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/63241104-tom-lake

And…Then we come to Part III Embodiment, Living Natural Awareness. Formal and informal practices that readers can adopt.

Apparently…Russia’s army has put together a particularly lethal mercenary unit that has gone rogue. Its members are made up of prisoners, sexual deviants and men from the worst mental asylums in the country. And…They have been sent to the Ukraine. Harvath, in his typical fashion goes in without reinforcements or a fully planned-out mission. (BTW, for those who have not followed the Harvath series, this can be read as a stand-alone, but it is better to start from the beginning so you can know and understand the reoccurring characters.) So…How will Harvath handle these rogue enemies? And…What about the Russian soldiers who are looting the churches, museums and homes?And…What happened to Anna?Everything is personal to Harvath, and no matter what, this is a mission that he will accomplish. Or will he?Fast-paced. Brutal. Gruesome. Bloody. Page-turning. Thriller read.Consider…Trigger warnings: rape, intense violence, repeated use of foul language. So…In conclusion, I think I will retire myself from any future Scot Horvath stories. Even though this story had substance, because he chose to fictionalize the ongoing war in the Ukraine... Visually it was difficult to read, for all the descriptive reasons I shared above.

I asked myself, “Didn’t I read this strange book before?” Of course, I did. Eileen is scheduled to begin a limited theatrical release in the United States on December 1, 2023 before expanding wide a week later (December 8). The film premiered at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2023. In March 2023, Neon acquired North American distribution rights to the film for $15 million. The film stars Thomasin McKenzie and Anne Hathaway. Now on to the book (which I borrowed again from my local library). Review. It is 1964. Eileen is our narrator. She tells us in the first sentence…“I looked like a girl you’d expect to see on a city bus, reading some clothbound book from the library about plants or geography, perhaps wearing a net over my light brown hair.” We quickly learn that any assumptions we might make about her from her appearance would be terribly wrong. “I didn’t really read books about flowers or home economics,” she tells us a few pages later. “I liked books about awful things — murder, illness, death.”How does one describe Eileen? 24-year-old. Damaged. Odd. She takes care of her father by keeping him in an alcoholic haze, as he prefers. She refuses to clean, make meals or wash clothes. Dysfunctional, yes?Eileen works as a secretary at Moorehead, a prison for delinquent boys. She hates almost everything and is unhappy and angry almost always. There is a touch of tragedy about her. Eileen is fairly disconnected from her body. She has a complicated relationship with it, as well. She denies any type of pleasure – especially love, or sweetness, until Rebecca shows up in the story. Rebecca is painted as a gorgeous woman, by Eileen, so much so, it is obvious that she is smitten by her.Eileen describes it in this way… Their meeting “marked the beginning of the dark bond which now paves the way for the rest of my story.”But…Is the dark bond just with Rebecca?What really is the relationship with her father? There is something menacing about Rebecca. What are her motivations? And…What will become of Eileen? Will she find her strength and power in the end? After all, this is her story. Disturbing. Chilling. Dark. Haunting. Weirdly uncomfortable. Sweetly sinister. I wondered as I re-visited the pages of this book, “do I really want to see the movie?” And yet…As weird as it all was, I couldn’t help but keep rooting for Eileen to escape the prison of life with her father, and just flee. So… What really happens to Eileen? Readers will need to stay with her until the last page to find out. ...more",Notes are private!,10,30,1,not set,"Oct 25, 2023","Oct 25, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23453099-eileen

The author’s in-law, June Fenwick played a part as she had been a telegraphist during WWII. She shared with the author that the night the E-boats came, the US troops were practicing for D Day. She had been working with the Americans that night. She spoke of the horrific moment that the men on the boats stopped transmitting in code and started to use plain language in panic. That occurred on April 28, 1944, a day that would end in tragic loss of life. The author states that it was covered up for many reasons, one being that there was an upcoming D Day invasion planned. Thus…The setting for this novel will no doubt cause some tears. It brings to life the dark reality of war, and not just for those who fought on the frontline.

With…A woman named Mirella Kessler who has just learned that her estranged friend Vincent is dead. And…This section too, refers to a vision in a forest which features Gaspery Roberts. And then…We are in 2203. And once again there is another new character and a reference to a vision in a forest which features Gaspery Roberts. So…Within the first 100 pages of this novel, readers are introduced to a group of people, each wracked by loneliness or sadness or purposelessness, but all of whom have experienced this vision and Gaspery Roberts. And now…We seem to find out who Gaspery Roberts really is. Apparently… Gaspery Roberts grew up on the moon in the late 24th century. When the story turns towards him, we are entering the 25th century, and our mystery man is working as a house detective at the Grand Luna Hotel. He also works for a sinister organization called the Time Institute which allows him to travel back into the past to figure out why discrete incidents form different centuries are occurring.And to share more about what he is up to would be to reveal too much of the plot. Obviously, we are time traveling here.The question will become…Why exactly (after all – they are a sinister organization)? And…What is Gaspery Roberts intent when he steps into the past (He is a nice guy, after all)? This story is poignant and deeply absorbing. There are big questions here about the cruel inevitability of time passing, loss, the nature of what we consider reality and, in the end, what really matters.And…There is a pandemic – a virus that is quite catastrophic. (Okay, I will mention that part of the story.) How does it feel to realize the world has changed within a moment? And…Time travel books are a strange world for me. I always wonder what happens when someone decides to mess with time, by inserting themselves into it when they were not originally a part of it. What small change will they make that will impact a future that wasn’t meant to be – had they not entered into it in the first place?Which… Makes a book like this one a perfect discussion book, don’t you think? ...more",Notes are private!,14,54,1,"Oct 23, 2023","Oct 27, 2023","Oct 23, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58446227-sea-of-tranquility

After reading a series of serious political exposes and not-so-serious magical realism books, it was refreshing to read this smart, funny book.

And...I'm actually laughing so hard that my husband had to come in the room and check-in on me to make sure I was able to breathe!

Consider… Blade Runner, or The Man in the High Castle, or his short story, Minority Report that Stephen Spielberg made into a movie in 2002. Sadly…He died long before he could see the success of his writings. This story was written in 1959. His character Ragle Gumm is an ordinary man leading a fairly ordinary life. Except…He makes his living by entering a newspaper contest every day and wins it. Every day – for the last 3 years. Ragle also believes that the purpose of this universe – this world – is to keep him content. So…All he does is keep guessing…“Where will the little green man be next?”And…Where does that lead?Well…In many ways, PKD is playing with the readers mind, because he isn’t giving too much away, or offering any number of ideas on the nature of Ragle’s reality. The story is set in the oppressive, deeply paranoid world of 1950’s America, the beginnings of the cold war with the constant fear of a nuclear war and deep suspicions of infiltration of Russian spies. Slowly…Ragle begins to realize that his world is somehow artificial. He is beginning to uncover some curious items, hear some odd radio transmissions.What does this mean? Ragle is a strong character, often given to introspection. But…He is investigating. He isn’t sure of his reality. He is getting paranoid. Is he losing his sanity?

Words that you can feel in your soul.“She fell like a maple seed, pirouetting on an autumn breeze. The geese nodded at one another and rose together from the water in a wave of goose music. She felt the beat of their wings as they flew beneath to break her fall.” The words above…Were the beginning of the story of Skywoman. The storytelling of how sweetgrass came to be.

And…For everything that is different and unique to what we may not always know.

The author is quick to point out that some things have been done to hurt the environment, and justice is not always on the side of the “four-leggeds and the wingeds, whose habitats have been taken.” Justice is still being sought for the “whole of creation.” So…The author asks, “in the face of blind injustice, how do we continue? How do we live our responsibility for healing? How can we submit to despair while the land is saying “help”?”This…Is certainly an opportunity for us as readers to once again come to appreciate the importance of our Mother Earth – the belief in the restoration of land. The beauty of nature – what she gives to us – how she sustains us – what we can possibly do for her! Where we as…Humans can be the drivers to sustainability. We just have to believe in our potential to do so… And… This author drives this point throughout her pages. “If grief can be a doorway to love, then let us all weep for the world we are breaking apart so we can love it back to wholeness again.” Her last lines leave us with a sense of purpose and responsibility.“Whatever our gift, we are called to give it and to dance for the renewal of the world.

(Yes, I said this!)And…Perhaps graphic novels are one of the most creative ways of conveying this important message for young adults and children.Consider this one scene…Even when Mia was attempting to find out about her background, she went to the school library and checked out a book called “The Little Indian.” As it turns out it is a distorted and dangerous depiction of American Indians, and the author is being quite attentive when conveying this through her thought bubbles. (Apparently, based on a lightly disguised version of a 1925 book by Grace Moon’s “Chi-Wee: The Adventures of a Little Indian Girl.”)By acknowledging the dangers of the wrong sort of fiction, the author underscores the power of finding the right kinds of books as well as receiving support from adults that young adults deserve.

I am still trying to learn how to use Goodreads, and I still am uncertain how being in a group works. I read the rules…But…Still learning.Anyway, this was the book for October. So…I began to read.This is a story of the land. That belonged to the tribes. Of the oil on the land. The wealth in the ground. The oil companies leasing tribal land at Fort Berthhold from the tribes. The hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and drilling of the land. The tribe members forming companies to truck and dispose of fracking waste, and the tribe creating their business. So…It is a cycle of boom and bust. A rhythm to nature. A rhythm to wealth. And…As money began flowing at Fort Berthold, old traumas resurfaced and new ones were inflicted. And so, it began…That on this particular day, February 22, 2012, Kristopher Clarke, a young trucker who drove for Blackstone, a white-owned firm that operated out of the tribal chairman Tex Hall’s garage before moving off the reservation – disappeared after dropping off his company credit card at the Blackstone office. He is feared dead.Lissa Yellow Bird began to ask questions… What happened to Clarke?Did James Henrikson, the sterioid-jacked owner of Blackstone with his wife, Sarah Creveling, have anything to do with Clarke’s disappearance?Or…Did Tex Hall have something to do with this?Or…Was Clarke’s disappearance part of the dirty business on the reservation that was happening between the white people and some complicit tribe members?Yellow Bird is a very vivid character. Complicated. She has her own story.But…It doesn’t stop her from asking questions. And…Finding a way to gather evidence.There is a lot to appreciate in this book. Political and social sadness. Crisis in Indian country – finally coming to the attention of the national news media – of missing and murdered Indigenous women. But…So much attention is on Clarke’s murder and Yellow Bird’s determination to find an answer, the author misses the greater point of the reservations power in the modern world. Still…The book gives an intimate look into Clarke’s murder through Yellow Bird’s eyes which is a stunning and compelling view. There is…Hope. Desperation. Compassion. Cruelty. Money and lack of between these pages. And…Closure for Clarke’s family. And…Maybe even some change to Fort Berthold.

Review Here: https://www.goodreads.com//show...With this one...My understanding was that Coates intention was to write his version of the current era. To bring voice to young people who are struggling with myths that breed complacency, defeatism and inaction as it relates to race. The book starts…Dear Son. The boy is Coates 15-year-old son, who is trying to make sense of blatant racial injustice and come to grips with his place in a world that refuses to guarantee for him the freedoms that so many others take for granted. In his letter to his son…Coates continues to emphasize the apparent permanence…Over and over again…Of racial injustice in America. He insists in the foolishness of believing that one person can make a change, and the dangers of believing in the American Dream. Coates is telling his son that…“Historians conjured the Dream. Hollywood fortified the Dream. The Dream was gilded by novels and adventure stories; Dreamers are the ones who continue to believe the lie, at black people’s expense.”It is sad to see this statement, knowing that this is what America is becoming with its political landscape. Focusing his light clearly on the ugly side of modern-day America.Coates believes there is little hope offered for freedom or equality for black people in America. If his son were to feel any sense of hope, Coates certainly is quashing it in his letter to him. In this book. But…He urges his son to struggle. To struggle for the ancestors and for wisdom. “But do not struggle for the Dreamers. Hope for them.”Thought-provoking. Raw. Painful. Honest. Earnest. Sincere. Heart-wrenching.We still have so much to learn in our world. We need not erase history – but to learn from it so that we can never repeat it. And…In many ways, this is one of the lessons, that Coates was trying to share with his son. The other, is still unfinished.

She is a humanoid machine, an Artificial Friend (AF) – short dark hair; kind eyes; powerful observation skills. A companion to 14-year-old Josie. She has been waiting to be chosen by the right child. AF’s are not supposed to be tutors or babysitters or chaperones or servants. They are supposed to be friends, although not equal to human friends. Klara’s purpose is to help get Josie through the lonely and difficult years until college. Lonely because kids like Josie don’t go to school, but study at home. Apparently, Josie suffers from an unspecified illness, from which her mother carries guilt. The story takes place in a “near” future that almost feels “too” present. A.I. seems to be taking over human positions in many fields. Certainly, Josie’s father, a former engineer laments about it. Is there a sinister message being portrayed here?This story also lands in a pandemic world (hmmm…) in which vaccines hold the promise of salvation, as the reality of thousands of deaths a day persists, and a substantial portion of the American population deludes itself into thinking it isn’t happening. Sound familiar?Will Josie recover from her illness with Klara’s help? And…If Josie doesn’t recover, will her mother, with Klara’s help, survive the loss?

Reading it at that time offered a particularly eerie version of the experience of how time travel can feel with historical fiction.

Here is Rosh's : https://www.goodreads.com//show...Now…I am not saying I am a new fan of graphic novels. I will say that I do like the idea of experiencing storytelling with pictures. Obviously, I love children’s books. As an adult, I have found great wisdom between their pages. And…Sometimes, it doesn’t take a lot of words to tell a terrific story, especially if an illustration can show the reader more. So…I am intrigued by graphic novels for this reason.

This feels like…An “autobiography” via comic book.It is my understanding that this is a creative telling of a “memoir” and a history of Iran’s turbulent 20th century politics. One comic strip frame at a time. The author’s protagonist is Marji a sassy, Iranian girl, fighting her elder’s expectations of her. Shall we start with the veil? Or…Her birth. Her religion. Her family?She finds her own way in being an independent thinker. Which…For a female, isn’t really encouraged. So…How did I really feel about this book? This reading experience? This is how I saw it…There are 2 aspects of this graphic novel that defined it. First… It is a historical novel that depicted several important events in Iranian history, particularly in the 1980s. Second… It is a coming-of-age story of Marji, our primary character, protagonist. It is a personal and insightful journey. It is published in 2 parts – The story of a childhood and The story of return. The first part is of 10-year-old Marji and her views of the Islamic Revolution and the overthrow of the Shah and the rise of the Iranian regime, and her having to leave the country for Austria. It is candid. It is raw. She is unafraid of challenging the hypocrisies she witnessed. She highlights the horrors of living in a nation divided by war. And…The fundamentalists and religious fanatics who divided the country. Telling the story in this way shows how comic books can be powerful mediums in conveying important stories. The second part is her growing up story. This part of the story was interesting, insightful, humorous and serious. Definitely thought-provoking. The author has a distinctive voice.

He mentions how each traveler would carry in a small rawhide pouch various tokens of spiritual power--perhaps a feather, a bit of fur, a claw, a carved root, a pebble or a shell. These were not simply magical charms; they were reminders of the energies that sustain all of life. By gathering these talismans into their “medicine” pouch, the hunter, traveler, or visionary seeker was recollecting the sources of healing and bounty and beauty. I do know that if my medicine pouch were filled with a need for control and answers, I would easily be seized with fear… or panic, rage, despair or exasperation. Does this sound familiar?But what if? What if the ""tokens"" in that pouch are not a magic wand to undo life, but instead, the power and the freedom to embrace the life we have been given? Not the circumstances we are in…but this amazing Life? Even in the chaos of these months, past 4 years even, we were to give ourselves permission to see the beauty of this amazing Life?The gift of life is truly in this present moment.I love Blaise Pascal’s reminder that, “In difficult times carry something beautiful in your heart.”In recent days, I haven’t thought specifically about carrying a medicine pouch, but I do have determination, love, HOPE, faith, a will to live peacefully, joy, and the freedom to help activate healing and redemptive forces in the people who are around me.Okay.

Not only had I forgotten I had read it, I had forgotten that I had placed it in my reading collection. Is this what happens to prolific readers? I am embarrassed by this omission in memory. This story is a memoir. A dark story, too. A horror tale in many respects about what happened to the author, that should not happen to anyone. And even though this is an illustrated, graphic novel, it should not be for children. It is strictly an adult book. For those who don’t know David Small, he is an award-winning children’s book author and illustrator. With this story, he tells what happened to him as a child. His father was a radiologist. He thought the best thing he could do for his son’s sinus problems was to give him high-doses of x-ray treatments. Of course, this happened in the 1950’s. And because of his father’s relentless acts…When Small was 14, he woke from a routine operation and he could no longer speak. He had a cancerous vocal cord that had been removed with a scar stretching from behind his right ear to the top of his chest. This wasn’t the only horror that he had to endure. His mother harbored secrets and his grandmother had a history of mental illness. And as readers it will be hard to take all of this in.But…Even though Small uses some humor in his graphics, you can’t help but know that what he is experiencing is painful, sad and tragic. And yet…Despite it all…He built a beautiful artistic career, devoted to producing beautiful children’s books that are colorfully and creatively illustrated. Still…Interestingly, this book is in black and white. Symbolic of the darkness of his childhood, no doubt. Throughout this book, sometimes we see just pictures. No word bubbles. The storytelling sometimes comes through facial expressions or body language and page layouts. And perhaps in that way, it was Small’s way of rescuing himself from his childhood. Escaping into a cartoon world of his creation. Rejecting the fate thrust on him. The book provides insight into the human. And…Sometimes that is all that we need to know that he made it out of the abyss. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Sep 28, 2023","Sep 28, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6407014-stitches

Those type of treats are not good for dogs! A dog cannot process the sugary sweet ingredients in a donut. (Actually, they really aren’t good for humans, but I digress!) Donuts have certain ingredients which are unhealthy for dogs, and some have caffeine or chocolate which can actually kill dogs. In fact, too much sugar and fat can actually lead dogs to develop pancreatitis. And…Apple juice contains large amounts of added sugar and acid which could lead to stomach upset, weight gain and other health issues.But…This is a kid’s book, why am I spoiling it by talking about whether dogs can eat donuts or drink apple juice?I guess because that is exactly what happened in this book, and I didn’t want kids to go off and give their dog a donut or apple juice in their bowls.

I did, years ago.To me, this was the most amazing stage experience I have ever witnessed. It was powerful, spell-binding, and shared a critical and important and empowering message. The intention…Let us end violence against girls and women. Please. It is a testament to the complex and sometimes trivial experiences women have with their own body. Parts. This book isn’t a typical book. It is a strong message. It is a need to love ourselves. The organ we typically don’t even say the name out loud. In some countries where freedom isn’t even free. Parts of the story are sad. Sharing of first experiences. Not knowing how to understand first experiences. Or the feelings between heart and body. The names we give to our body part. You can see I am even being sensitive in this  and not even using the word(s). And yet…If we use the word, we give power to ourselves as women. This is Ensler’s focus. To empower women. Not to just bring pleasure to men. She chooses to use this book as a political forum – a deliberate statement: violence against women is rampant. She sees it as a pandemic in itself. Using the “V” word won’t end the war on women, but it will bring women back to life, she feels and states vehemently throughout. “We are here; we exist.” She wants women to reclaim their power – their bodies – because, she tells us, with each growing day, the number of rapes, genital mutilations, domestic violence, murders against women, honor killings, sex slavery, and rage towards women will continue to increase. So…As a play… It has humor, and it has a message…a powerful one.

This is a YA Novel.Marjorie Glatt is a very sad, but responsible 13-year-old girl. Her mother has passed away, her father sleeps away the days, and she is left to be responsible for their launderette business, dealing with demanding customers and never-ending laundry. As well as being responsible for her little brother, and keeping up with school. And then…There is Mr. Saubertuck who wants their family business (which is also their home) so he can turn it into a yoga spa resort. What is Marjorie going to do?One day, Wendell the Ghost jumps the train out of the ghost realm and shows up at the launderette. (Hence the title of the book: Sheets – looks like a ghost.)Can he be the friend she needs and the answer to Marjorie’s problems? Sheets addresses very sensitively, issues of grief, loss, and feelings of overwhelmingness, especially to a teenager. To do it in graphic form, is genius. The author does an amazing job using the sequential art narrative to showcase the expectations placed upon a girl this young, and how the responsibilities she is shouldering impact her daily life. As readers, it is hard to fathom what she is experiencing at such a young age. But…We could see it visually through each narration box.Wendell’s entrance to the story, and to Marjorie’s life brings humor and lightness to the darkness and gloom that took up the earlier pages showing Marjorie’s slice of life. Even as just a sheet, his expressions come through. Although the ending seemed quick, almost too abrupt, it still felt resolved in a way that left readers feeling a sense of hope for Marjorie and her family. Lessons gained through this book…Importance of friendship, kindness, it’s okay to apologize when you are in the wrong. Certainly, the harder topics…Grief and the effect death has on a family. “Patience is the thread of healing.”Concern…It would be nice if the father could engage more as a parent figure, and become better in his awareness with his grief and helping with his children, so that they all could find ways to cope with the loss together.

How powerful is that thought? Could this be so easy? Can we truly sweep aside our past – the negative parts of it? Ernest Holmes explained in an article posted in The Science of Mind magazine in 1971…“I believe that the past has only as much to do with the present and future as we permit, and that in any split second if the consciousness is right the past is wiped out.” Thoughts have power. (This is also a significant message of this book.)In other words, he is suggesting to us that we can approach life with a fresh start. A do-over. In other words…Tomorrow when I awaken, the slate will be clean and this new day will stretch before me to begin fresh before me.We can release any regrets or fears established from our past. We can let the past go in favor of a new lease on life. All we need to do is embrace the present moment and all that it has to offer. So, let us begin. Today is our fresh start. Our do-over day. A day for positive thoughts, confident actions and welcome outcomes. A wonderful new beginning. Thoughts indeed have power.

This will be more of what I gained most from this book...In Angeles Arrien’s book, the author teaches us that some shamanic traditions in parts of Africa and the Oceanic societies attend to health and well-being through what is called cradling work, a four-part practice in staying connected to the good, true, and beautiful aspects of one's nature. He shares that if you lie on your back and place both hands over your heart (in many cultures hands symbolize healing) you can silently acknowledge the character qualities that we appreciate about ourselves. In this way we can acknowledge our strengths, our contributions that we have made and continue to make (thinking positively), as well as the love given and the love received. He also suggests that many native cultures believe that the heart is the bridge between Father Sky and Mother Earth, and that for these traditions we can utilize the four-chambered heart method for sustaining emotional and spiritual health. When we think in this way, it allows us to feel full, open, clear and strong. To connect to our four-chambered heart all we need to do is ask ourselves these questions daily:Am I full-hearted?Am I open-hearted?Am I clear-hearted?Am I strong-hearted?So...Put your hand over your heart.

It was as if I stopped breathing because time stopped during that moment – in my mind. I think the whole theatre was in silence with me. At the time, I had two sons, one almost 5 and one barely turning 2 when the movie came out. Which brings me to this book.And this question. To what lengths would you go to ensure your child’s survival? What would you sacrifice in yourself to preserve their well-being? This may be a different scenario, but it almost had a similar reaction for me. Because parents are having to make difficult decisions. And…As I was reading at that pivotal moment, I felt as if I had stopped breathing again. This author penetrates the heart by exploring two interlinked stories of two couples. In 1953 Santa Cruz, CA, Jean-Luc and Charlotte Beauchamps are the proud parents of Sam, the all-American kid. They are adapting to their new country, speaking only English, and never revisiting the trauma they fled in Paris 9 years earlier. But then…Inspectors take Jean-Luc in for questioning, and his life begins to unravel. Back in 1944, Jean-Luc maintains tracks for the French national railway, now under German control. He’s nervous as he hears rumors of the deportation of Jews. But the evidence is mounting. He feels he must do something, but he does not know how. And then…A frantic young mother, Sarah Laffitte, thrusts her weeks-old son into his arms. (This was that pivotal moment for me, when my breathing stopped.)Druart keeps suspense moving throughout, even as readers’ slowly gain knowledge about some of the characters’ fates. As readers we can’t help but feel the weight of the Nazi occupation and its impact on Sarah, her husband David, even Jean-Luc and Charlotte, as well as a nurse that he meets at a German hospital. Even Sam’s physical and emotional reactions are convincing. There are no villains among the five main characters.

Living a nightmare. “And just like that, I am nobody.” Harding does an excellent job of showing life lived in the margins. Clinging to her standards, and not interested in turning to homeless shelters as an option, Lee parks her car in a seaside neighborhood. Next…She is awakened by the sound of sobbing. Enter Hazel, the drowning woman whom Lee rescues from a cold Puget Sound. Hazel shares a story of confinement by her sadist husband in their prisonlike home. She then returns home, appearing at Lee’s car door next morning with breakfast. The women form a bond. She also gives Lee something valuable from her husband’s collection and encourages Lee to sale it for cash. Eventually they become friends and hatch a plan. And a cute-guy-walks into Lee’s life in the diner. Suspicious minds may wonder about these happy coincidences (well at least this suspicious mind was at work!). After all, a wealthy new friend, a romantic guy suddenly appearing in Lee’s desolate life. Yet…This is where the author’s writing is both dramatic and subtle.

Grace would like more freedom, and she is getting a bit tired of how protective her family is being about her life, especially her mom. So being the 14-year-old that she is, she meets up with a boy much like Vince Fleming (the bad boy that hooked up with her mom in the first book, and who will make an appearance in this book), who decides to steal a Porsche and break into a house to get the keys.

This one has special meaning. Not just for what the book is about, but how this book came to be funded. I don’t know if you are aware, but there is an organization called the Dolly Parton Imagination Library. It began in 1996, by the singer. It mails a new, age-appropriate book into the homes of children every month from birth to age five. It is designed to inspire the love of reading and learning in children by spending time with family and friends sharing books together. Whenever an Imagination Library book is donated, I feel as if we received a pot of gold. The books are beautifully illustrated, and have amazing messages, and teaching tools available for the parents on the inside flap. I have always loved Dolly Parton. I love her even more for this amazing gift of reading she provides to families across the country. And this one is no different. Gorgeously illustrated by Stephanie Fizer Coleman, the reader is immediately drawn in by the colors, and the birds, and the outdoors displayed by her drawings. This book is also in both English and Spanish.Premise: This is a story about a male peacock named Mo who looks different than his male counterparts. Now, for anyone who is familiar with peacocks, it is the males who have all the colorful plumage. What happened to Mo?Well, he looks different. Because, he does not have any bright colored feathers. And so…He feels dejected.

This novel was actually written during the pandemic and is based on the real-life cold case of the author’s childhood best friend, Carol Kensinger, who was murdered in Pittsburg on December 10, 1948 at age 12. In an interview, Royce shared that “the whole book actually started with research.” The novel follows the interweaving lives of 2 women deeply scarred by generational trauma. The chapters are each narrated by The Wife or A Writer’s Thoughts. One woman, most likely the lonely writer – (a writer’s thoughts) – is obsessed with the unsolved murder of her mother’s best friend, decides to connect with the other woman (the wife) who has reported her husband and children missing, only to find he has taken them to his home country of Argentina during the Covid-19 lockdown. Also…Readers can’t forget that during the prologue a hand with a ring was discovered on a beach off Reef Road. Whose body did this hand belong to?It should be noted, that many of the facts about the fictitious murder that consumes the character (a writer’s thoughts) in the story are based on the real-life cold-case. This was also a pandemic book. And in many ways the pandemic was its own character. The pandemic also placed obstacles before the characters. As an example, when the wife’s husband disappears with her children, they are captured on security cameras at the airport boarding a plane to Argentina while wearing their face masks. As well as, travel was limited, because of the pandemic shutdown.

For those who don’t know what a Zibby Award is (I didn’t), it just so happened, that 2021 was the inaugural year in which they recognized “the often-overlooked parts of a book and the team(s) behind it.” The award is named after and spearheaded by Zibby Owens, a new Center for Fiction board member. Zibby Owens has become a well-known personality in the publishing world. In 2022, she published, “Bookends: A Memoir of Love, Loss and Literature.” I also won a copy of this author’s book, “Reef Road.” Review here: https://www.goodreads.com//show... For those who don’t know, this author is also a former actress. She is best known for her screen roles in ‘Just One of the Guys’ and the horror films ‘April Fools Day’ and ‘Remote Control.’ She was also in ‘Out on a Limb.’ But... For television fans, some may know her best as a soap opera actress where she played Silver Kane, the evil half-sister to Erica Kane in ‘All My Children.’ She also had roles in some prime-time television shows: 21 Jump Street, St. Elsewhere and 90210. Considering the author’s experience, it seems only fitting that lights, camera and action would take center stage in this haunting, psychological thriller. Soap opera star Ruby Eleanor Russell was abandoned by her father on an underground tour of Ruby Falls. He released her hand, and this 6-year-old was left alone amongst strangers. This childhood trauma has influenced every aspect of her present life which takes us to the late 1980s. She has decided to lose her name – forget that terrifying day – and adopt her middle name as her first so that she will now be known as Eleanor. Now…Eleanor is intent on beginning a fresh new life in a whirlwind marriage to British aristocrat Orlando Montague. She will also star in a gothic remake of Daphne Du Maurier’s Rebecca, and live in a cute cottage in the Hollywood Hills. She becomes friends with the psychic cat-lady neighbor, Dottie, and adopts one of her kittens, Bel. Howard, her agent, adores her, and Orlando opens a glamorous antique shop in L.A.But then…Reality and fantasy blur. Orlando who she had only met and married after knowing for weeks, suddenly becomes possessive and suspicious of her. He makes accusations of her past and her real name. She suspects him of an affair and stealing. She becomes paranoid. Is she living the part in her movie…Or…Is this her life playing out before her? (Did anybody see the 1944 movie Gaslight where the manipulative husband intentionally toys with his hysterical wife to make her believe she is crazy?)Could a form of Gaslight be happening to her?It is obvious that the author is incorporating her experience as an actress in daytime drama and prime time television to take readers backstage at the soap-opera studios and on the soundstages of Hollywood. Through her haunting references, she pays homage to Old Hollywood greats… Like Hitchcock, and even suave Cary Grant as Eleanor searches for answers about her past and present, while grappling to find a way through the tension. What is fact and what is fiction – in the midst of a fiction tale? Each suspenseful page is peeling away layers of Eleanor’s façade until everything is exposed. What will readers come to learn?And how will readers feel when they reach the final page?Clever. Twisty. Emotional. Fragile.

I think what compelled me to read it, even though its storyline was based in the past, is how eerily similar it is to today’s recent events. Why aren’t we learning from our past? Moving on? Embracing differences. The story takes place during the Jim Crow era in Mississippi and rural Georgia. President Lyndon Johnson has just signed the Civil Rights Act, but nothing has changed. The story centers around two Black sisters on the run. Violet is running because she has killed a white man who brutalized her and went unpunished. Consequently, she must flee Jackson, and her sister, in the hopes that she can outrun her past. But when Violet decides to leave, assuming a new name (Vera) she skips out with the wallet of a white man and some evidence of a crime (she is unaware of this) that nobody wants anyone to see. As readers, we can only imagine what danger will follow her!And then…There is Marigold (her sister).Why is she running?Even though she dreams of being a lawyer, she finds herself pregnant and in an abusive, loveless marriage. So, now she is running from that abusive husband. The narrative is told in two parts and alternates between the sisters’ perspectives. Then there are also Rose’s diary entries sprinkled throughout.

Premise: Tara Mondal, 17 at the time, has been a performer in a dance bar. A client asks her to carry out an odd fantasy in exchange for a huge sum of money which she agrees to do. She is asked to wear a blue-sequined dress when she meets him. Unfortunately, afterwards she disappears without a trace. What makes this case even more intriguing, is that Tara was also the lover of Inspector Arnav Singh Rajput. More than a decade later, he is still struggling with her loss. Arnav carries a lot of loss. Now involved with a journalist, he still carries the memory of when he was 13 and his sister Asha, a rape survivor, took her own life, because she was denied justice. His own parents died soon after. At the beginning of the novel, Arnav is grappling with a new case: decaying female bodies are being unearthed from various parts of the city’s suburbs. They all have tiny blue sequins on them. It appears there is a serial killer that has been on the loose for several years. Could Tara be one of the victims?But wait…Tara reappears. 14 years later when dance bars are re-opened she shows up with a 13-year-old daughter and a job as a lead dancer and choreographer at the Blue Bar. It appears that Tara and Arvav are destined to meet again. What happened to her all those years ago?And now that she is back, will she be a target of the serial killer?Told in shifting points of view from Tara and Arnav’s perspectives, readers watch as the various threads of the story come together to a stirring conclusion.

Oprah shares…“When you look at schools, health-care systems, the criminal justice system – really everywhere you look – there are people impacted by trauma who are still misunderstood, and sometimes retraumatized, by the very systems that should be helping them.” The question What happened to you? Then…really means…What brought this person to this point?And so…Instead of focusing on the problem in the moment (the behavior) the focus can be on understanding the pathway to the problem – because that is where the solution really resides.

And thus begins the story of not only finding out more about her family, the names on the postcard – Ephraim, Emma, Noemie, and Jacques, but who sent the postcard and why. The story may be long, but the explanation, simple. And, readers need to wait for it. It does eventually come.Part novel and part documentary (biography), this book, translated from French by Tina Kover, is an account of Anne’s attempt to solve the mystery of this postcard which is also in part a reflection of her own family history.The postcard may have been received, but it isn’t until Anne’s daughter has an an antisemitic encounter at school several years later, feels the violence of it, and the school’s indifference to it, that she remembers the postcard.

Lelia tells her daughter, “All our lives were spun from that impossibly slender thread of luck.” Myriam is Lelia’s mother, and Anne’s grandmother.Some of the translations were off, which made it difficult to read, at times. As an example, Kover translated Passover as Jewish Easter. In a book that is literally about the attempt to exterminate the Jews and their traditions, it is important to recognize the fullness of Jewish culture correctly. Still…This novel is engaging.

This is a completely different series – titled just: A mystery. Also… This doesn’t have Hugo Marston’s character in this series, because this book is based in 1940 France under German occupation. But...The premise sounded fascinating. Even though I wasn't particularly excited to take a ride into WWII again. I couldn't resist the idea of what this author planned. Consider this... Our main character is French police inspector Henri Lefort, who is doing everything he can to keep a low profile while pursuing unsolved robbery cases. This isn’t always easy considering German soldiers are roaming the streets shooting people randomly on impulse. And then…A German major summons Lefort and orders him to investigate the murder of a Nazi officer working in the Louvre. Hitler is planning to visit in six days, so Lefort has only 5 days to solve the case. On top of that, Lefort is unable to access the murder scene or the museum. The Nazis are currently cataloguing the art pieces, preparing to steal those that they fancy.Interesting right? As readers we are also connected to a second storyline, where we are shifted back in time to when Lefort was a young soldier in the Great War. It is believed that those earlier adventures led to his police inspector time in WWII. His sarcastic first-person narration easily pulls the reader along with him. He has a way of recognizing and remembering clues that may elude others, and he has a moral compass that makes him want to do the right thing, especially when he is surrounded by unrighteous acts. Pryor does a great job of showcasing the oppressive plight of locals during this time and era, as well as the tyrannical Occupation and the City of Lights shut down. The murder mystery takes interesting twists and turns, but has a sensible conclusion. And…Interesting characters (including Pablo Picasso). Yes, you heard me right.

She has recovered from an injury sustained from an on-the-job incident and is still trying to find her way to getting fully back out on to the streets in her job. In the mean time she receives a letter from a childhood friend, Cate that makes no sense, but she wants so much to make a reconnection with her. (They have been estranged for years.) When she finally sees her she is surprised to find her pregnant. And before she can understand what she means by Cate’s cryptic words of “they are trying to take my baby,” Cate is severely injured and her husband is killed in a car accident. Alisha recognizes someone at the accident, and before she can get more information about what is going on, the body count rises. Even though she is told not to investigate, she does and discovers a plot involving human traffickers, forced surrogacy and abuses of human rights. Robotham is not afraid to write an epic mystery filled with conflict, dysfunction, grit, and darkness. And…That Vincent Ruiz also returns was a bonus. Seeing him through yet another character’s eyes (other than Joe O’Loughlin’s) also enhanced his personable and admirable qualities. (For those who haven’t read the Joe O’Loughlin series, Vincent Ruiz plays an integral role.) There will be many twists and turns in this story, and an uncharacteristic ending shared in the epilogue.

This is an older Joe O’Loughlin and ex-cop Vincent Ruiz case. Yes, I appear to be reading them out-of-order. Not recommended. Can you read as stand-alones? Yes, but I believe you miss the essence of who the characters are from knowing their past history – as a team. So, don’t read them the way I have, go back to the beginning. Let me just say this…This is not the easiest story to read. We learn early, through the narration, told partly through Piper Hadley’s diary entries, that at age 15 she and her best friend Natasha (Tash) were kidnapped and held captive for the last 3 years in a cellar by their kidnapper, a sexual predator they call George. And…Piper doesn’t like to think too much about Tash’s visits to George, but when Tash comes back bloodied from their last encounter, she finds a way to escape, promising to return with help to rescue Piper. But then…Tash fails to return and Piper’s narrative takes on a tone of desperation.Joe O’Loughlin, a clinical psychologist and criminal profiler, and Robotham’s protagonist hero of the series, takes on the other part of the narrative to keep readers informed of what is going on above ground. There is a gruesome murder of a couple and a barefoot body of a young woman is found under the ice of a frozen lake. Are these deaths connected?And…Will they have anything to do with Piper or Nash?We also deal with his own relationship with his daughter. And…For whatever reason, relationships of fathers plays an overriding role in this story – good ones, bad ones, monstrous ones. Even daughters aren’t saints either, but we know there is love here between the pages for some. But…Most importantly…Will Piper be found in time? What happened to Nash?

Although it can be read as a stand-alone, for any one interested in following a series, it may be better to consider reading the first books, The Long Call ( here) https://www.goodreads.com//show... and The Heron’s Cry ( here) https://www.goodreads.com//show... to get a sense of the returning characters. This story is based in Greystone, an imaginary town on the Devon coast. Citizens are excited when Jem Rosco, a hometown hero returns, who is somewhat of a celebrity. Each night he stops by the pub, visits and jokes with the locals, and talks about waiting to meet with a mysterious person. This goes on for about 2 weeks.And then…One night he doesn’t show up. Greystone resident Mary Ford, the lead team member of the lifeboat crew is awakened early to investigate a body found in a floating dingy. Guess who?Yep…Enter Matthew Venn whose team is here to investigate Rosco’s death. This is difficult for Venn to return to this town, because this is where he grew up, and in adulthood, he left the Brethen (a confining cult-like religion which is quite popular here) and was disowned by his parents for doing so. “Since losing his faith, and marrying Jonathan, he hadn’t been back.” Of course, during this whole time that Venn arrives there is a…Raging storm! (Hence the book title!)The story plays out in interesting ways…The mystery of Rosco’s death and how his friendships and loves from decades earlier play out in the present; Matthew’s personal life – his comforting and dynamic relationship with his husband as well as his knowledge of a community deeply impacted by an unyielding religion; and, the setting, not just the sea, but the isolation of this seaside village that doesn’t attract tourists or work-from-home folks. Of course…There are many people not willing to help Venn get to the truth in the investigation which slows things up. And… It doesn’t help when Venn and one of his officers are put in danger. But…Eventually it all comes together, like an Agatha Christie outing where explanations are rendered towards the end.This is an easy-to-read, slow-moving mystery. Inspector Venn is a meticulous, unemotional, but thorough character in his approach. He cares about his team, and is not easily detoured from his mission. For those who like police procedurals, and cozy mysteries, this one will be a well-organized read. But...If I am being completely honest, this will probably be my last Venn book. I find myself not quite attracted to how Cleeves writes her character/story. Yes, I gave it 4 stars, but, it still didn't create a connection for me. For fans of Cleeves, Britbox has filmed The Long Call, but I have since learned that the series has been cancelled. Cleeves is also the author of the widely popular Shetland and Vera series, also on the television screens. I personally am more attracted to the television series than I am to her books.

I believe in his environmental mission. Because for the most part, this seems to be his quest. In “The Overstory” it was about trees. With this story it seems to be about the natural world. This is a tale of loss. Humans and the devastating toll of environmental catastrophes. But…Mostly the focus is on a father and a son. He will focus on endangered species – including humans, but you can tell with this author, that he is concerned about the future of our planet. This is a story about Theo and Robin Byrne, a grieving widowed father and his sensitive 9-year-old son. Theo is an astrobiologist who seeks signs of life in the universe, on a camping trip in the Smoky Mountains with his son. This is where he had honeymooned with his late wife, Alyssa, who died 2 years earlier in a car crash. This is also hopefully going to help Robin after an unfortunate incident that occurred in his 3rd grade classroom.What readers come to learn is that Robin has some anger issues, and he has been diagnosed with possible autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, and OCD. This is a tall dis-order for a 9-year-old. Theo doesn’t accept any of this, and has no interest in adding his child to the many who are on psychoactive drugs. He writes:“Oddly, there’s no name in the DSM for the compulsion to diagnose people.”What is the meaning behind the title of Bewilderment? As we get more into the story, it can only mean confusion and bafflement. And, to get away from it, is to escape into the wild. This is exactly his point for his characters. To find temporary solace. This was a gloriously short book, less than 300 pages, a little over 250 pages. In these pages the author captured nature with colorful words and vibrant colors. He wants us to appreciate the natural world. He wants us to see it in all its vibrancy. But…There are those moments when the author gets scientific with his characters – like when Theo wants to use experimental behavioral treatment on Robin to help alter his behaviors. A bit weird when that occurred.And…There is a political tone, where the author seems to paint a scathing, dystopic portrait of a country losing its way, an anti-science government. He writes…“Earth had two kinds of people: those who could do the math and follow the science, and those who were happier with their own truths. But in our hearts’ daily practice…we all lived as if tomorrow would be a clone of now.” Still…The author raises bold questions, but at the same time he gives us a dark ending.Bottom line… This will be a different kind of book, one that certainly will elicit much discussion....more",Notes are private!,6,37,1,"Sep 09, 2023","Sep 13, 2023","Sep 09, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56404444-bewilderment

But…As I watched the unfolding of that relationship and family, I came to recognize how the world worked at that time. How he honored his wife until she came of age, how the relationship grew in love, and then what the story was truly meant to be about – this “condition” feared and how it would rock the family in such a devastating way. And then…Another story emerged. About a fellow named Digby. A new timeline. What? Why confuse the reader? And then…Back in time to our original story of our young girl, now grown, widowed, managing.

I kept turning pages, and surprised at how quickly the pages were melting away.And yet…There were still so many more to read. Why 715 pages? Is it possible to still tell this story with less pages?The book may have begun in 1900, with that 12-year-old girl preparing for her unwanted arranged marriage. It ends in 1977, when that girl’s physician granddaughter arrives at a shocking discovery. The family are Indian Christians, descendants of those first converted by St. Thomas in the first century A.D. They have led tough but often joyful lives, and they did make it in the world, despite the challenges. To provide a plot synopsis would spoil the fun. Let’s just say that this family loves and suffers in a variety of ways. This book felt like reading a fairy tale – a good fable.

There were so many times I wanted to shout out to Colin, and say... “Colin, is Conrad, really you?” I am sure I am making him blush in this moment. If that is even possible! This story, even though the focus’ emphasis is on unraveling the mystery behind ‘A soldier’s quartet’ based on a letter written by a father to a son in the first great war, it is much more than that. This book is told in present time as well as going back in time, with the author’s imagination taking us back to what could have happened during the soldier’s time at war. But…We also learn so much about Conrad and his quest. And…The immenseness of Conrad's heart and compassion and his friendships. I love his meandering conversations with his neighbor Wally at the fence. Sometimes even talking away while Wally slips into sleep. How many friends do we have that we can talk through so many issues that we are going through as we navigate such a large life endeavor? Especially one that involves finding out about a hero soldier, and getting this letter back to a family who did not know of its existence because it was stolen off of a dead body during the war. And…How this one letter would lead to so much more for Conrad. So many opened doors. A fuller life. That he never knew could possibly exist, even though he already had quite the fulfilling retired life. So, what is a soldier’s quartet? And…What will this author create with his music, ah…yes, music…quartet…there is a significant connection with this word and the men lost on that battlefield – and that letter.

He is recently divorced from Rachel, a social-climbing talent agent. Toby seems a pretty decent person. Readers see him as a good dad, sweet, sometimes self-righteous about politics and work. Our narrator, is Toby’s friend Elizabeth, whom he met during a college semester in Israel. Two decades later, she’s a stay-at-home mom in New Jersey. She used to be a staff writer for a men’s magazine, but now she is longing to write again, and longing for a story to tell. When Toby rekindles their friendship, she dives gleefully in to writing his story. It appears that Toby and Elizabeth are talking, but he is too distracted by his dating apps to listen.

And…This case is personal for Joe. He gets a call from the hospital letting him know that his mother is already there with his father who had suffered a fall and is currently in a coma. When he arrives, he asks who is that woman next to my father? He is informed that she is the one who gave them the number to call him. And…She obviously isn’t his mother. So…Who is she? Well…The title of the book is “the other wife.” So…We have already guessed where this is headed. His father has some secrets from this family. But…How many secrets is the question? And…How many didn’t know - about her? And…Did he really fall down those stairs? Or was he pushed?So many questions. No immediate answers. But an action packed, page-turning, interesting, well-organized plot that will keep readers guessing as to what happened, and why it happened...And of course...Is she guilty, or isn’t she?All the way up to the revealing end.

When this book cover came I found this book when I was doing a library search for books with dogs as “central” characters – or at least in the story. When this book cover came up, I found myself interested. One of the cover ers said…“With an abundance of humor, vibrant characters, and a gentle approach to hard truths, this book strikes a perfect balance of fun and meaning. A remarkable achievement.” Hmmm…I was ready to read. It was a quirky tale of friendship and survival. But…Not exactly an easy-to-read story.This actually is a very in real time kind of story. And I will say it right up front, it is tragic, but, ultimately uplifting. It is a story about a 12-year-old facing regular middle school problems. And…Most importantly…He is the survivor of a notorious school shooting. His mother is a mortician, his father is a Catholic deacon and they have now moved to an internet free town where nobody knows their story. The intention is to live in peace, and heal. The story provides a sense of humor. Sometimes off humor, that can literally put readers off. But…Friendship, kindness and empathy are strong themes, as Simon’s new friends provide the bonds that he needs – while he heals.The trauma can’t be ignored, and that will come out, along with other issues that make growing up difficult. There is some educational value in the story line – prime numbers – the planets, raising animals. There are some strong positive messages of acceptance and empathy and willingness to make amends, and diverse representation throughout the book. Still…I cannot emphasize enough the violence and scariness that may come out in this book about Simon being the sole survivor of a school shooting while in the 5th grade. And even as I say that, I am reminded of the many school shootings that have happened in our own towns that we still read about in the news – unfortunately, almost daily. The flashbacks, conveying the horror and long-lasting trauma, this may be difficult to read, as much as it may put a light on the tragedies of gun violence. There will also be other things that occur in the book – assorted injuries and things happening to animals. The author will utilize humor when these things occur, but readers still can’t ignore the act that occurred. Because…These are real feeling circumstances that do happen, and it may not be easy-to-read. After all I have said, I don’t want to discourage readers from considering this book. It is a book that age 10+ can read. And it does deal with relevant every day issues that occur for kids growing up. And... Unfortunately, school shootings in classrooms, can’t be avoided. Isn’t that a sad commentary on our society. Perhaps that is the message of this author.

For many Binchy fans, this book was an emotional gift. Chicky grew up in Stoneybridge, West of Ireland. Her family was very upset when she decided to run off to America with a handsome young man (Walter Starr). Although she wrote about her time in New York, it was purely fiction, and each year she would return alone to Stoneybridge to take respite.Queenie Sheedy is the sole remaining sister. On one of Chicky’s return trips home, Queenie asks if she would consider buying the Stone House and turning it in to a hotel. At first taken aback, Chicky realizes this could be precisely what she needs to secure her return to Ireland. And that is exactly what she sets out to do so she can create a warm retreat for guests.Chicky also enlists the help of a few locals, and some family to refurbish and prepare Stone House for guests. Everyone involved also requires some healing of their own, and have attached themselves to Queenie, Chicky and Stoneybridge. Stone House can also be considered a character too, because it is a gathering place for all the characters. And all the care that goes into the renovations.And now…A “week in winter” at Stoneybridge is ready to welcome a diverse guest list, all with their own private reasons for needing a week away in a warm, quiet hotel to get their priorities in order and find the peace they seek in their lives. Each chapter is devoted to one character that finds themselves at Stone House. The story lines interweave and readers see other points of view – watching problems being resolved and relationships forming. Maeve Binchy at her best. Truly a gift read.

But…That is okay, Stepping into this novel, at first, I thought I was back in TV land, and by just mentioning this, I know I am going to date myself. But…That is okay, because this particular show was one of my favorites. For those who may remember, and for those who don’t, I refer to the successful television sitcom, one of the few I liked, “Family Ties” which made Canadian, Michael J. Fox a household name. Michael J. Fox was the tie-wearing ultra-conservative son, Alex P. Keaton. His parents, were hippies, played by talented actors, Michael Gross and Meredith Baxter. The intention of the show was to show the diverse opinion differences between these two factions. I bring this up, because Ann Hood’s novel, this one, is about 3 former flower children and their present-day family life, and how similar it seemed to play out to what I witnessed in that long-ago sitcom. Well…At least in my mind. For a moment. Premise: Suzanne, Elizabeth, and Claudia come of age in the late 60’s and early 70’s when the death threat of Vietnam hangs heavily over the heads of unprepared college students, threatening their plans and eliminating their joy. They are really into the scene of protest, smoking pot, and making love. The book opens with Suzanne’s 14-year-old daughter, Sparrow (1984), when she discovers a picture of her father who had refused to marry Suzanne. Suzanne’s story is to search for him, with her mother against the idea. She doesn’t want anything to do with her past, and is moving on so fast, that Sparrow is now becoming Susan in her mind, and the idea of whatever was, is gone. So how does Sparrow/Susan get through this roadblock?Next is Rebekah, who is the 15-year-old daughter of Elizabeth and Howard (1985). They are still hippies. Rebekah doesn’t like herself and her roadblock is her mother’s cancer. Henry is the 17-year-old son of Claudia who is in love with Rebekah. Henry is managing to get through the roadblock presented by his mother which is her madness, brought about by the drowning of his older brother years earlier when they lived a communal lifestyle. This was Hood’s debut novel. One that even though it seemed to be in touch with the delicacies of human behavior it’s focus tended more on…Suffering. Loss. Tragedy. Impulsive behaviors.

Review here: https://www.goodreads.com//show... I'm a keen Holmes fan and in addition to reading all the originals, I've read a number of Holmes novels which have been written by other people. I am also an Anthony Horowitz fan, so why not try Moriarty? The short version is that it's not as good as the previous one and suffers (I think too heavily) from an overly contrived attempt to shoehorn a completely non-Holmes novel into a Holmes series. After all we were warned with the words: Holmes is dead and darkness falls. The phrase above is written on the book’s cover. Not mine, but I saw it on an advertisement of the book. The book is named ‘Moriarty’. All the clues are there. Literally and figuratively right in front of my eyes. And yet, what did I do? Throughout the book, I waited for Sherlock to appear. I know, stupid, right? A Sherlock Holmes novel minus Sherlock Holmes himself. This book was just a big disappointment for me as a reader, to the point where I started skimming and hoping for it to pick up like it did at the end. Speaking of which…. the ~surprise plot twist~ just made me angry. I had been staying up in bed to try and finish this book when the twist hit. I didn't feel wonderfully tricked and surprised. No, I felt cheated and annoyed at what felt like a last-ditch effort to make this story interesting. But some of you may feel differently.

And…For anyone who has looked at my page, you will know that I have 4 corgi fur children who own me. They are not your typical dog, and the author is learning that with Typo. But…This isn’t a book about corgis. The sub-title is…How animal senses reveal the hidden realms around us. I was captivated by the title. I was captivated by the cover. And…The book was recommended in our local library’s monthly newsletter as a “staff pick.” Ed Yong, the author is also the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of “I Contain Multitudes.” Apparently in that book he discusses how bacteria benefit humans and give us a grander view of life. I have gotten a sense that Mr. Yong is a very curious and responsible person by nature, and continues to explore life in this book via the animal world. “An Immense World” is a multisensory exploration of the many ways in which animals perceive their environment. And… What we as humans can learn from this.He introduces us early to a word called Umwelt. (Or Unwelten) Umwelt simply refers to an animal’s surroundings – what they can sense and experience – its perceptual world. The Umwelt reminds us that… “There is light in darkness, noise in silence, richness in nothingness. It hints at flickers of the unfamiliar in the familiar, of the extraordinary in the everyday. When we pay attention to other animals, our own world expands and deepens.” So, this book is a journey through the sensory lives of animals, grounded in the biological overview of a wide range of species’ sensory systems and how these systems turn stimuli into information that each animal can then act on. Unwelten becomes a travelogue.The author tells his story through 13 chapters of exploration for readers – smells and tastes; light; color; pain; heat; contact and flow; surface vibrations; sound; echoes; electric fields; magnetic fields; uniting the senses; and threatened sense scapes. Each chapter is supported by extensive research and notes. There are also color photographs, acknowledgements, a bibliography, credits and an index.As readers, we feel like we are on an expedition field trip, walking along learning about the many animals/insects/sea life, observing, smelling, listening, exploring.What can we gain from this adventure? On page 346, the author declares…“The previous 12 chapters of this book represent centuries of hard-won knowledge about the sensory worlds of other species. But in the time, it took to accumulate that knowledge, we have radically remolded those worlds. We are closer than ever to understanding what it is like to be another animal but we have made it harder than ever for other animals to be.” He considers humans a liability. We know this to be true. Look at us. Do we truly align ourselves with nature? Or do we destroy it too readily? And…How well do we care about the animal world? What responsibilities will humans take to address the pollution we have created that affects nature, and the animal kingdom?The author feels that our influence is not inherently destructive but often homogenizing. Sometimes, he feels, we push our sensitive species out, and leave behind smaller and less diverse communities. Yong’s research is thorough. He has shone a light on the importance of all the senses of animals and how they work and how important they are. But…At the same time, he put the light back on us humans.“We have filled the night with light, the silence with noise, and the soil and water with unfamiliar chemicals.” He showed us ways in which other organisms see, taste, smell, touch, hear and otherwise sense the world.Learning this…We now know we have a responsibility, as self-anointed intelligent beings… to keep the world safe.Since we share this planet, we need to remember, we also need each other (animals/plants) in order for this planet to survive. ...more",Notes are private!,16,41,1,"Aug 31, 2023","Sep 06, 2023","Aug 31, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59575939-an-immense-world

The settiThis is an interesting mystery – in that it provides us with a likable, but unreliable narrator/protagonist in the character of Drew Danner. The setting is Los Angeles, 2007. Drew is a novelist who wakes convulsing over the body of his former fiancé. His hands are wet with blood from the handle of a boning knife buried deep in her chest. Four months later, he is released from the hospital holding a jar. Inside is his own brain tumor, which he owes a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity.Now, that should be enough, right?Wrong. In his heart, Drew doesn’t see himself as a killer. He has no memory of the night in question, but there are memory lapses which causes him to believe that he did not do this – nor does he believe himself to have it within him to do something like this to another person – especially his former fiancé. So, who is framing him? Because this is the only possible solution, right? The author provides quite the supporting cast as Drew plays amateur sleuth attempting to find out what really happened. Afterall, he is a crime writer character, too. And…The story moves along weaving quite the plot. There are conflicts. Red herrings. Twists. Difficulties for our main protagonist Drew to overcome. And…A strong climax. And…A resolution that is satisfying, yet not too easily predicted. In this way Hurwitz does a masterful job at writing quite a captivating story.

Last night I had the wonderful opportunity of attending the Classics and More Zoom Book Group. It was an invitation that was presented to me by GR friend, Christopher Cox who is a Librarian at the Mobile Public Library, and also leads this monthly group. Because I had ed A Painted House, https://www.goodreads.com//show... he thought I might enjoy attending the group, and he was right.

As it so happens, I read this long ago, and yesterday, the very day of the discussion for A Painted House, the unabridged copy of The Invisible Man was donated to My Little Free Library Shed. Serendipitous? Or just a nudge for me to post my  to Goodreads? Now for anyone who has been reading my s, you know I am not a fan of science fiction. It is not my genre. However…This is H.G. Wells. He was a classic, prolific writer. He was a fascinating man by nature. Consider the books he has written – The Time Machine, The Island of Doctor Moreau, The War of the Worlds. He has always been a man before his time. His perception of being able to see things before it happened made him a visionary per se. So, in that sense, I couldn’t help but be interested in his futuristic approach to writing. This novel was first published in 1897. It was considered one of the most famous scientific fantasies ever written. It was part of a series of pseudoscientific romances written by H.G. Wells early in his career, and it helped to establish him in the field of science fiction.Our character is Griffin. A scientist who has discovered the means to make himself invisible. At first his “invisible” adventures are comedic and fun in his small village but then they turn rather terrorizing and cumbersome.What will the villagers do?When you consider Wells approach to the science of invisibility, it was interesting – he based his idea on our world as an illusion of light. That is a fascinating way of looking at the world. So perhaps, in this way, we can find a way to appreciate where his character is going with the idea of being “invisible.” But…It soon became kind of sinister, and there were some darker messages. So, were we supposed to like our main character Griffin – feel sorry for him – find him an anti-hero? Do we care what happens to him in the end? And what is the true message of invisibility? Can we find good for it? Or is it something that can be used for evil? What did Wells say it was only good for – murder?Is there a moral message here?This was a slow-moving story. Probably has a lot to do with the writing, itself. Not that the story wasn’t compelling, but that the style of writing was written in a different era – and storytelling styles were told differently then. Still…It is a classic. And H.G. Wells had a way of telling a story, and even though I don’t think it was his best story, it still was a fascinating read....more",Notes are private!,4,21,1,not set,"Aug 29, 2023","Aug 29, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/176938.The_Invisible_Man

Sometimes there are special times for these books, and this is one of those times. This is a deeply moving story about New York Times bestselling author, Amy Bloom’s emotional journey with her husband Brian, who chooses to end his life after he has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. This is a heart-wrenching, yet heart-felt story that begins with one opening sentence by her husband in which he says, “Please write about this.” How many times have we sat around and watched our loved ones suffer? I took care of my mother for the last 4 years of her life. She eventually died of Dementia with Lewy Bodies, a form of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. It is horrible to watch a person who was once vibrant and capable and a talented oil painting artist, suddenly unable to care for herself – who lived with hallucinations and fear and uncertainty. Who became child-like and incapable of doing anything for herself. As her adult child, it broke my heart to watch her decline. All I could do was manage her care, as best I could and advocate for her, as best I could, under the conditions that were available to us. So, I get what Amy and Brian needed to do. The decisions that they chose to make. To make a choice to die in a way that is not painful, frightening, traumatic or illegal. We do it for our animals, and yet we don’t provide these same humane decisions for humans. The couple finally found Dignitas, “an organization in Switzerland that empowers a person to end their own life with dignity and peace.” Bloom shares the story in parts. Her husband’s disease. The closing chapters. As readers we know the end is coming. And even as it does, it still feels like a shock. Maybe because we spent so much time getting to know Brian and going through everything with him – telling the kids, his siblings, even his elderly mother and friends their intentions. The hardest part of this book – when you think about it – in the end – is the title of this book. It really is about being… In Love. The things we do for love. Because in the end – Amy was a widow. Is a widow. Without Brian. And even at the memorial, we are so aware that he is the only one missing – and not there, so to speak. But that is not how she ends this story. Again, it is all about the Love. And that really is how we should always remember a love story. What both Brian and Amy shared with each other. The decisions they made together. In Love.Thank you again, Mark. For this book recommendation.

Catching up with my s for Goodreads.The estate of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, I read this a while ago, but had an opportunity to re-fresh recently. Catching up with my s for Goodreads.The estate of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the keepers of the famous detective Sherlock Holmes, allowed this author, to write some stories featuring said detective. This is one of those stories. Holmes has died, and Dr. John Watson, in his advanced age, has decided to document an adventure. What we come to learn from Dr. Watson, is that this particular case, “The House of Silk” has been too shocking to tell, and could not be put to print while Holmes was alive. Thus, he left instructions that this tale remain sealed for 100 years. Somehow, through Anthony Horowitz, it now can see the light of day. As “The House of Silk” opens, Mrs. Watson has decided to retire with some friends in the country, and Dr. Watson has decided to come stay with Holmes at 221-B Baker Street in his old rooms. The stage is set for another crime to be solved. What we learn, is that an art dealer, named Edmund Carstairs is seeking Holmes help. He feels he is in danger from a mysterious man with a livid scar on his face. His story involves a train robbery in America and a shootout with a notorious gang led by a pair of Irish twins. He fears that a survivor from that shootout has marked him for revenge. He also shares that on his voyage back from America over a year before, he met and married an attractive widow named Catherine Marryat. Carstairs mother has recently died and his spinster sister has become paranoid. And one of his Irish serving boys is behaving strangely. Something clearly is amiss.But…What does Sherlock ask Carstairs?He asks him…Does Mrs. Carstairs know how to swim?Holmes and Watson call in the Baker Street Irregulars (the street urchins) to locate the elusive and threatening American with the livid scar on his face. Will this simple affair now become more dangerous?And now…Mycroft Holmes (who typically represents the government), and Sherlock’s older brother, is suddenly warning him off this case. What gives? And then…Dr. Watson gets an invitation by a reclusive professor of mathematics to see his groundbreaking work.What is this all about? At the climax of this case, Holmes solves not one, but 3 interrelated mysteries. How is that even possible? Well, because…Horowitz is excellent at mimicking the style and tone of Arthur Conan Doyle and Victorian London. As Dr. Watson had shared earlier, this was a dark tale that needed to be put away for a long, long time. And Horowitz shines a light on some of the darker elements of Victorian life that Doyle never would have approached. Thus, the crux of the mystery lies in one of those dark corners, which some readers may find hard to read.Still…Others may enjoy revisiting Sherlock and Dr. Watson, and even Mycroft through Horowitz’ creative lens....more",Notes are private!,6,31,1,not set,"Aug 25, 2023","Aug 25, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11093329-the-house-of-silk

As it turns out she has a case she would like her to consult on in her country, which Tempe agrees to do. No sooner is she there, than this same woman cop is killed. And while there, Tempe is being attacked and uncertain what this all means to the case, and wondering if any of this relates to her own unfinished case back home. Now normally I would stop here with this  and say that there are many red herrings. It is a twisty, immersive thriller. But…I am not sure I can do that this time. I am deeply conflicted. The plot just felt so convoluted. While the investigations of the cases were interesting, and there is always danger that Tempe is placed in, it ALWAYS seems to come uncomfortably close to her.

Julia, the detective is heading the investigation. She thinks she knows how this will go – but…She has no idea how personal this is going to get. Because the criminal at the heart of the disappearance is holding all the cards. He has an important secret. Julia’s most important secret. And everything depends on this secret being kept. Julia cannot find out what happened to Olivia – and she must frame someone else for her murder, or her secret will come out. How do you overcome something like this?I didn’t know how to feel.

I emerged for lunch briefly. And continued to read until the last page. (And yes, the parts that were uncomfortable, I scanned over.)But even so…It did not keep me from enjoying or appreciating this book.Let me just say this…Sometimes there are books that just deserve to be acknowledged as unexpected masterworks. Yes, I knew that it had all these awards behind it before I even opened the pages. But…I could have said…Who is kidding who? What is all the hype about anyway? Because, seriously that does happen, right? But this one worked. It was a dark, haunting mystery. It had location – Haiti. And…It had an interesting flawed character. So, let me just tell you about the story.Our protagonist is Max Mingus, a Miami P.I. who specializes in finding lost children. He also is an ex-con, who was imprisoned for killing 3 sadistic murderers. Newly released from Rikers Island, he is still mourning the loss of his wife, Sandra, who only days before his release died in a car accident. With nothing left, he takes on the missing child case for Haitian billionaire, Allain Carver, whose son Charlie disappeared 3 years earlier. Payout: $10 million. Unfortunately, 3 other detectives died trying to find Charlie. Is this really what Max wants to do?Having nothing to lose – and nothing to live for, Max says…Yes.Max’s investigation takes him to Haiti, and into the deep dark world of voodoo and black arts and the magic and myth of “Mr. Clarinet.” Who are the good guys – the bad guys? What will Max find? What darkness lies underneath?We see the poverty. We see the injustices. We see the ugliness as he continues to look for Charlie. And…What past of Max’s is all unpredictably linked with that of the misplaced Charlie?As Max delves even further into the darkness where Mr. Clarinet and the solution to this case dwell, the P.I. realizes that losing one’s life might not be the worst price to pay in a land where the dead and dying still stroll the streets. (Strike up the creepy music here!)This book is…Challenging. Compelling. Dark. Haunting. Trigger warnings: Pedophiles. Sex trafficking. Sexual assault. Child abuse. Black arts. Gun Violence. Mind control/magical compulsion.As difficult as all of this was to read (and yes, as a read, I knew when I could skip over the more uncomfortable parts), Max was a reasonably likable character. Someone readers could like and root for and hope would be successful in his pursuit of justice in the end.

In hopes of finding that one important someone that will sit with them. Maybe even take one step further and take them and want them and love them – and be their forever home. For anyone who has ever had a dog, we know how much unconditional love they give to us. The beautiful unbreakable bond we have with them.This beautifully illustrated book, also by the author, reminds us of that special love and connection that animals have to humans. And how life transforms and expands with a dog (or 2 – or 3 – or 4) by our side. There are so many conversations we can start with kids through this book about: Empathy. Compassion. Friendship. Caring for animals.

So, I decided it was time to visit Joe’s life and find out what was happening. Joe Talbert Jr is now a reporter for the Associated Press enjoying some success. But…Suddenly his career takes a hit and he is needing to take a “recommended” leave of absence. He decides to follow-up on a report about a man named Joe Talbert that was found dead in Buckley, a small town in Minnesota. Could this be his long-lost father whom he has never met? He learns that this particular Joe (known as Toke) has a daughter, so he may have a sister who is in the hospital all alone. He leaves his long-time girlfriend, Lila who is studying for the bar, behind with his autistic brother Jeremy.While investigating the death of Toke, he finds his questions aren’t welcomed. Apparently, Toke wasn’t well-liked and there are a few people that stood to profit from his death. Joe’s investigation unravels a lot of secrets including a land dispute and some issues over Toke’s deceased wife’s inheritance. And… If Joe is related to Toke, he may be eligible for some of this inheritance which could put him in danger. This news also creates some tension for Joe and Lila, as well as some suspenseful mystery and family drama.

Since I was still fresh from Takeover, I didn’t want to forget how I felt about the characters, so I decided to begin reading it. (I know, I was in the midst of other books, too…but, I was anxious to see if this was going to be a good series…or not.) Let me just start with the premise of the story and then I will go into my thoughts about it.Jillian Perry is the wife of a wealthy video game creator and mother of a little girl. She is found dead in the woods. The police consider it a suicide. But…Our protagonist, forensic investigator, Theresa MacLean thinks otherwise. In fact, the more she investigates (yes, she is investigating – something forensic investigators don’t typically do) the more she believes it is murder. There is one big problem…There is no physical evidence to explain how she has died. No fatal wounds. No signs of strangulation. No signs of drugs or poison. Nothing. As far as the forensics experts can tell, she just wandered into the woods and froze to death. Theresa’s boss is pushing her to close this case and move on. But she is still recovering from the death of her fiancé (Book 1-Takeover), and can’t let this case go. She also fears that the killer is going to strike again. Apparently, whatever technique the killer is using is diabolical, and only Theresa can figure it out – and she has a plan to use it against him. Now…Granted the author demonstrates an ability to create memorable characters and suspense and an interesting plot, including some fascinating forensic techniques. You see…The author creates numerous suspects and red herrings, but not a very satisfying ending. Part of the fun of reading a mystery is attempting to arrive at a solution (as readers), as well as understand where we are going and why – and the author doesn’t give us an opportunity. Unfortunately…Her writing style lacks flair for a mystery writer. And that kind of spoils the pace and flow and energy of the reading experience for this reader/er.

This book was selected by the Sunday Times as one of the 40 best crime novels published 2015-2020 and is translated into 17 languages. This story takes place in Mumbai, India with the retirement of Inspector Ashwin Chopra. On his big day he is rewarded with 2 mysteries. A drowning under suspicious circumstances and a baby elephant that was left to him by his uncle. The elephant becomes the Inspector’s companion as he accompanies him around the city during the investigation of the drowning victim, Santosh Achrekar. Chopra’s replacement is convinced he committed suicide. There are sub-plots that draw readers in along with the descriptions of the countryside. Inspector Chopra (retired), with his polished mustache (see cover) and obsession and need for understanding of every detail, reminds readers of Agatha Christie’s Poirot. He may not meet all the physical description of a Poirot, but his mannerisms and approaches to his work are there. What’s different?What may be different here is that he has a sweet relationship with his wife, Poppy who is also strong-willed and committed to her husband. She takes care of him, as well as teases him, making her a very actively present character. We also get a sense of her POV throughout the story.About memories…Sometimes the plot goes back in time – through memories, which introduces us to Chopra’s childhood, meeting Poppy and his early years in the police. This might be useful information if anyone is interested in continuing with this series. And then there is location…Although the location of this mystery is exotic, it still reads like a cozy. It features a gentleman detective with moral values. Readers will be introduced to Mumbai – glamorous Bollywood to the seedier slums. Along with: sights, smells, atmosphere. All in all… It was a comfortable, easy read. And quite honestly, how many stories would have an elephant as their capable partner? That in itself, deserves a star! One last note…One thing I want to share is background on the author. I had read some s that some were upset that Khan was not a native of Mumbai and therefore how could he possibly write this story. From my research...I learned that he spent a decade living in Mumbai. After returning to England, he has worked at the University College London in the Department of Security and Crime Science. According to his own website, “Crime Science is an approach to crime prevention, reduction and detection that attempts to use science from a range of disciplines – both engineering sciences and social sciences – to tackle crime.” It appears that his work in this department and his decade in Mumbai, impacted and informed his writing.He has continued to write many more stories that have garnered many awards. ...more",Notes are private!,2,5,1,"Aug 22, 2023","Aug 24, 2023","Aug 22, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/24717411-the-unexpected-inheritance-of-inspector-chopra

I had been a bit worn out from my HF and WWII books, and so I took a break from reporting about them for this past week. This one had also been a difficult one to talk about, too. So, I thought I would ruminate on it for a while before setting down my . Sometimes stories can have emotional triggers, and we have to be sensitive to how that can affect our responses to the story and our  of it.As in this case… Premise: This is the story of Marijke de Graaf, a married woman that was a Dutch political prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp in 1943. She volunteers to work at the camp brothel in exchange for a reduced sentence. While working at the brothel, she catches the eyes of Karl Muller, the second-in-command Nazi officer at the camp. Karl struggles with the brutality of the job and his desire to make his father proud. He sees Marijke as a welcome release. Alternating with Marijke and Karl’s stories is that of Luciano Wagner, a political prisoner in 1977 Buenos Aires during the Argentine Dirty War, who is trying to work through his difficult relationship with his father. Where do I even begin to share my response – my feelings about this story? Although well-written, this story, was distressingly bleak. Seeing this side of a brothel the author does a good job of detailing all the various ways in which the Nazis reinforced their power over their prisoners as well as their officers who visited the women. There were many heartbreaking scenes that were difficult to read. Karl believes he is in love with Marijke and he schemes to get rid of her husband who was assigned to a neighboring camp. This storyline was the worst part of the book for me. There was an eeriness and creepiness that was downright disturbing and I found myself almost giving up on the book. But…I wanted to know about Luciano’s story, and how it tied in with the 1943 timeline. (Sometimes I even wondered, why it was even part of the overall story.) Eventually, readers will discover why. Still…In this timeline there is a sense of hope, as Luciano and some of his fellow prisoners use their jobs at the prison to try to help the resistance and the families affected by the war. But…I still have conflicting emotions about how Luciano’s story turns out. Bottom line…This story is not for the faint of heart. It is not an easy read.

The real-life Cuban revolutionary Evangelia Cisneros is the book’s title character, joined by 2 fictional women, Grace Harrington, a newspaper reporter who is inspired by real-life Nelly Bly, and Marina, the wife of a farmer’s son who has been thrown out by her wealthy family. Readers are placed in New York City in 1896. We find Grace Harrington wanting to become a respected female reporter for one of the city’s major newspapers. This ambition puts her in the middle of the circulation wars between William Randolph Hearst (New York Journal) and Joseph Pulitzer (New York World). The term “yellow journalism” – describing sensationalized and sometimes false coverage – which aptly describes Hearst, was encouraged in the midst of solid news reporting. Grace wants to be a solid reporter, although she eventually finds herself working for Hearst. Meanwhile, 18-year-old Cuban Evangelina, who had joined her exiled rebel father in the Isle of Pines, is attacked by a Spanish colonel. Unfortunately, she is arrested and sent to one of Havana’s worst jails. Here, her survival is tenuous. Still, she refuses to retract her accusation. Marina, married to Mateo, a farmer’s son, is in the midst of the conflict in Spain. As the conflict escalates, she finds herself separated from her husband and forced to leave the farm. Transported to Havana with her daughter and mother-in-law with little money to survive, she has no way of knowing if her husband is still alive. History, war, politics, pain, suffering, imprisonment – all of this is complicated and well-documented within the pages of this book. And the fact that a publishing tycoon would exploit all these factors to sell papers – not surprising. Cleeton shows the complexities of this era in a very cohesive, compelling way by also weaving in historical facts.(BTW, although this has nothing to do with the story, Hearst Castle is not too far from where I live. The pure ostentatiousness of it, is reflective of the way this man lived.) Let’s consider the title of the book. Cleeton weaves together Grace’s stark reporter’s tale against the backdrop of Gilded Age NYC with Evangelina’s transformation from the beautiful girl in the headlines to a woman dedicated to her country’s freedom, and Marina’s resourcefulness and sacrifices. When their stories eventually intertwine – it is surprising and memorable. There is also some romance – but I won’t say whom and what may or may not happen between them. But…	Love is a critical theme here, and not only for a husband, child, parent, or possible future partner. In addition to the history, this story includes finding love, losing love, and keeping love in one’s heart despite the uncertainty of life and death that surrounds those characters. History in this book includes Cuba, Spain, and NYC – as well as the Spanish American War. But mainly, Evangelina Cisneros. But what we will also find throughout this story…Heroes. Villains. Greed.

Named after Edgar Allan Poe, the Mystery Writers of America honor the best in mystery fiction, non-fiction, television, film, and theater published or produced in the previous year. The very first sentence of the book tells us that Claire Gravesend is dead. But…Is she really? Of course, she is. She appears to have jumped to her death from an apartment building. Our private detective stumbles upon her body, and takes pictures of the corpse, intent on selling them to the press, but finds himself in the middle of something deeper.Hired by the mother to investigate her death, this same private investigator, Leland Crowe, finds himself tracing her path across country. And now we start venturing into the weird. Immortality? Whatever Claire was searching for could be the key to everything. Even though we don’t get to meet Claire, the shadow of her hangs over the story. She had terrible scars on her back, and she was on a mission to find out where they came from. Then…Crowe meets Claire Gravesend alive? Or her look-alike? And now things are getting complicated and dangerous. Gritty. Dark. Everything has a place and every move has a purpose. Lots of action. Propulsive and compelling. The villains were even terrifying enough to feel believable. And…Crowe bounces back from injuries quickly (do we suspend disbelief here?), and despite his moral greyness and questionable methods, he still wants to do what is right. (Side plot re: ex-wife makes him a bit more human.) So…Even as a flawed protagonist, he was somewhat likable. Unfortunately…When the plot went a little science-fiction-ey it began to lose its momentum for me. Not that the storyline couldn’t be compelling, or plausible, it just felt disjointed, a bit. For me. Because… When it gets a bit sci-fi it just isn’t my kind of mystery.

Have you ever walked in to a book, and wondered, how does this person know me so well? Did this person secretly come into my life and follow me around without my knowing it? I barely got into the book, and I am greeted with these words… on page 7 of the paperback version.“I live in their world when I am writing” the author (character) said to the class. “I’m going to make my own worlds,” Alice told her brother.” Alice is our first protagonist. She wants to be a writer. And she is determined, even if this is not the quest her parents want for her. And no, my destiny isn’t to be a writer. I always knew I wanted to be a teacher. And I did fulfill my quest. What I like is the vision that the author felt, and that Alice could see it, too...for herself. That is what I connected to, as well. That is why those words above meant something to me. And it didn’t stop there. On page 10…“When she had to go out in the real world, she watched for what people didn’t know they were telling you. She noted a hand playing with a necklace. An eyebrow, as an interrogative or a dismissal. The way little kids’ shoulders would turtle up near their ears when a bully was near. She listened…to the pauses. The falter. The emotional floods of surprise or warmth or anger.”So much of what Alice did, she did to collect for her stories. I would do the same thing, but for a different reason. I was being an observer. So, I could be a better teacher, counselor, facilitator. The skills that served me in my life. One character, her teacher Professor Roberts, shares… “If you think about it, every story – is grounded in things we already know, and every book is about questions that have already been asked.” In other words, we most likely already know the answers to life. We just need to pay attention. Observe. Be present in this moment. And I could truly appreciate that because I live a present moment life. But…I was barely on page 12, how was I going to make it through this book, if all I was going to do was stop every few moments to contemplate all these thoughts that were being shared throughout these pages? Could I keep track without taking notes? Was I back in school again?And then…I remembered.This book isn’t about me. It starts with Alice and the book in her head. After a tragic event. And how that book in her head finally becomes, “Theo.” And how this book “Theo” will affect so many others who come to read it. Just like the opening pages of this book, “No Two Persons” touched me. “Theo” reaches others in ways that matter. “Wandering is a gift given only to the lost.” ‘Theo’s’ opening line. “Did you write this for me?” She wondered. (The character, Lara, The Assistant.)On page 50, the character, Lara, The Assistant who decided that this would be the book the publisher should publish, is thinking about the importance of reading to her child.And…“…how your first read of an extraordinary book is something you can only experience once.”“It’s like eating the best ice-cream cone of your life on a hot day, you want to eat it fast, but have it never end.” Or the character Rowan, The Actor, as he does the audiobook of ‘Theo,’ reading the last line of the book, “All that matters is that we try.” We meet more characters throughout the story, and find readers that are impacted by “Theo.” And… We are witness to their transformation. And all I can say is…Extraordinary writing Ms. Bauermeister. I was already a fan, But…Now. I am completely Wowed.And what I can say to all of you that are reading this …Be Wowed too.

An opportunity to untie ourself from the illusion of the ego mind. If you are unfamiliar with yogic philosophy, this is not a new concept. It is all about freeing oneself from one’s thoughts. There are 5 parts – Awakening Consciousness, Experiencing Energy, Freeing Yourself, Going Beyond, and Living Life. What makes Singer’s process so fascinating is that he has stripped the philosophy down to its true core, yet he doesn’t oversimplify it. He offers the truth (from his perspective) – clearly, and powerfully. It isn’t from any particular religious framework, either. He takes several religions and philosophies – weaves them together to create a wisdom that is understandable. There will be questions asked. As an example – chapter 3: Who are you? And in these moments we can become the observer and see ourselves for who we truly are. Not just a name or a label or a person that does a job. Or a body that occupies a space.

When the elegant actors would take each other’s hand and walk into the bedroom and close the door. I appreciated that as viewers we were allowed to have our imaginations do the work for us. And if it was a mobster film, and someone was shot, we wouldn’t have to see the guts and gore, we would just know that something ""bad"" happened. The storytelling was beautifully magical in so many different ways – the musical background gave us hints of what was to come, and we would just go with it. Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall were part of that magical era.  “You know how to whistle, don’t you Steve?” That was one of the most famous lines uttered by Bacall in the movie, “To Have and Have Hot” where they met and began their infamous love affair while he was still married to his previous wife, Mayo Methot. But that wouldn’t stop them from eventually ending up together. Bacall eventually married him – she was just 20, where Bogart was 25 years her senior. This book is the story of their relationship. In many ways a celebration of what was considered a great American love story of this romance – capturing the complexity, contradictions and challenges. The author attempts to offer a deep and comprehensive look at both, as well as break down the unlikely love that they shared. But before we get the together…He does spend lots of time first on detailing their early years separately – Bogart’s upbringing in New York City, as well as Bacall’s rise as a model and actress. And then…He takes time to share a portrait of their courtship, as well as their 12-year marriage; including their fights, reconciliations, the children, the affairs, Bogart’s illness and Bacall’s steadfastness until his death. He also goes beyond Bogie & Bacall by exploring her relationships with Frank Sinatra and Jason Robards, who would become her second husband, and her identity crisis she faced.What is interesting and different about this book, is that it seems to address issues not talked about in other biographies of this same couple. For example, Bacall was just 19 when she started dating Bogart, who was so much older, still married, and even married twice before with children. (So thrice married before he met Bacall.) How did that age gap influence their relationship? Did she lose anything by marrying a Hollywood superstar more than twice her age? And probably, one of the most asked questions, how did Bogart, a man of average looks, become one of the greatest movie stars of all time – one that women swooned over? Mann answers all those questions. As well as explains their unparalleled successes – including their individual successes – and the extraordinary love they held for each other that lasted, despite the conflicts they endured within their marriage. For those who love old Hollywood – and especially these two, this will be an interesting book. For those who have not yet been introduced to Bogie & Bacall, this will make you want to go stream or rent some old movies. (Come to think of it, maybe I will, too!) The book has some pictures, lots of sources and notes, and a complete index. It is filled with entertaining details and thoughtful insights. Take a step back in time. I will leave it with the author’s words… “…Hollywood’s greatest love story, complicated, devoted, passionate, contradictory, genuine, and everlasting.”...more",Notes are private!,17,42,1,"Aug 18, 2023","Aug 22, 2023","Aug 18, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61419643-bogie-bacall

I had been doing a library search online for a completely different book, when this one came up. I am so glad it did.This is the debut novel of Ann Kidd Taylor, the daughter of acclaimed novelist Sue Monk Kidd. The two previously collaborated on a bestselling memoir, Traveling with Pomegranates, in which young Ann ponders her direction in life. Apparently, her direction is the family business of writing. This is a beach read of a different type, with a first-person narrator, Dr. Maeve Donnelly who happens to be a marine biologist specializing in sharks pursuing her research throughout the world. Maeve has loved sharks since the day she was first kissed by the love of her life, Daniel and nearly killed when bitten by a shark. Maeve’s backstory is related through all these childhood, grown-up episodes of her life. Including the before story of when at age 6, Maeve and her twin brother, Robin were suddenly orphaned when their parents’ small plane crashed in the Everglades and they were sent to live with their grandmother Perri in a literary-themed hotel on an island off the Florida’s Gulf Coast. Daniel, 3 years older, befriends both Maeve and Robin, since his father abandoned his mother and him. It seems inevitable that Maeve and Daniel would end-up together, but things happen and that is not the eventual outcome we readers expected. Instead...They go off to become the scientist and chef, respectively. When Maeve returns from one of her trips, she is greeted by one of the reasons why Maeve and Daniel are no longer together... Hazel, his now 6-year-old daughter. Hazel is a delightful character – silly, serious and completely unselfconscious. And a perfect reason for giving the book its title. There was much to appreciate about the story of Maeve and Daniel, and I could feel all the angst and love between the two of them. Will they or won’t they succeed at a second chance at love together - especially with the precocious Hazel?But then wait...There is Nicholas someone who Maeve worked alongside. Could he be her forever instead?What does Maeve want with her life?And does Robin, her twin ever grow up? He seems to have failed at everything he has attempted even when he has been hand given every possible opportunity – and now he has a novel he insists that Maeve read that is finally going to be published. Is it her and Daniel’s story – or something else?In the midst of these decisions, there’s a group of people harvesting shark fins illegally and they could be very close to home. Was that mystery necessary to this story?Still…Who doesn’t love Perri (grandmother) and Marco, the man who has stood by her all these years? Can we look forward to something for them?There is a lot of love between these pages. Imperfect. But still something to appreciate.

Playing catch up!One day, our favorite forensic anthropologist, Temperance Brennan is visited by a woman who considers herself a Web sleuth – someone who likes to solve cold cases and match missing people with unidentified remains. Typically, law enforcement isn’t too enamored of these amateur sleuths and doesn’t open their arms to their enthusiasm. But…Her information does make Brennan curious enough to investigate the case of a teenager who has been missing for 3 years. The girl’s parents don’t seem all that interested in her disappearance. They feel she has run off with a boyfriend – and good riddance – as far as they are concerned. As it turns out, she didn’t follow their religious upright views, and thus, she lost importance in their eyes.

Titus Crown was born and raised in Charon County, Virginia but moved away to work for the FBI. He returns to take care of his father. He becomes the first Black sheriff after defeating his crooked predecessor, under whom racism thrived and drugs were allowed to run rampant through the county. As sheriff, Titus, must deal with the usual – petty crime, drugs, abusive husbands, drunks. But, on the first anniversary of his election, a former student walks into the local school and shoots a beloved teacher in his classroom before being fatally shot by Titus’s deputies seconds after hinting about bad things in the teacher’s phone. Titus’s investigation leads to a field full of bodies of children of color. The murdered teacher and the young man who pulled the trigger were involved in some atrocious crimes, and there are videos and photos of all of them. There is also a third masked man who is still loose.As the investigation progresses, things get complicated. The killer has connections to a local church, and the bodies had religious messages on them. The story gets darker, grittier, more intricate. Religious zealots and racism are front and center in this story. The story feels real. The characters are believable. What sets this story apart from so many others, is its unerring depiction of small-town rural life and the uneasy (and sometimes violent) interactions between Charon’s white and Black citizens.The reality of the people he described – like the backwoods snake-handling Jesus shouters, placed readers in the center of his story. Whether we wanted to be there or not. And then…This is a book filled with so much “controlled” anger. One of Titus’s deputies – white – asks why someone wasn’t looking for the Black children that were found in that field. Titus tells him that people probably are looking, but not getting much help from the press: “Blond hair and blue eyes make the news.” Next time you watch missing persons reports on the news, take a look…you will probably notice…he probably is right. One last thing…The epilogue. The last page. Titus and Ol’ Rebel Joe. You will know it when you read it. S.A. Cosby knows how to engage his readers. His writing is confident and skilled.

Well, I learned rather quickly that this is what I would expect: science fiction (not my genre), forensics (my thing!), technology (okay, I can go with it!), action (yes, I like this, too), humor (this is always good, as well), animals (will they get hurt? – I am very sensitive, here…), geocaching (I am rather naïve about this), high school (well, what do you expect when it is YA), mystery (yes, yes!), suspense (I am happy!) and friendships (I’m in!). So now, that we got that out of the way… This is a rather captivating series that incorporates a bit of sci-fi and crime with a contemporary perspective, utilizing teen protagonists who are navigating an unusually adventurous adolescence. Premise: Tory, Hi, Shelton and Ben (the “pack”) have been infected with canine parvovirus, and as a result, they have been permanently altered. Though this secretive altered state breeds some uncertainty and fear, the pack finds they can use it to their advantage to solve mysteries, avenge justice, dodge violent criminals, and navigate high school. Pretty impressive right?Compelling, too. Reich does a great job of creating this character pack as humorous, relatable, and passionate. The plots and subplots are suspenseful and inventive. The pack who demonstrates admirable resilience and loyalty while facing challenges and uncertainty make for an interesting and entertaining, even thrilling read.Lots of dog love, too. To be honest, as much as I enjoyed it, there were moments that were a bit much for me (again, I am not a sci-fi fan), so I will not continue with the series. (Note: Seizure, Code and Exposure follow.

Can anything more happen to Terry?So…Did Vernon do it? Should Terry play detective and find out? Is this the worst defense case that Terry can be given, or will this case help Terry’s sagging career? Complicating matters…Terry has doubts about the firm, since it is headed by a secretive, manipulative legal star who seems to want to fire, bribe and promote Terry simultaneously. What should Terry do? And yet…Terry is so endearing with us readers. He keeps finding out things about his co-workers that make us readers cheer him on. How many more secrets will there be to unravel in this book anyway? Now…There are a few things to consider…Wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton is part of the mix; London riots are in here too, armed foreign nationals; real estate development; a confession late in the book is so casual it seems kind of silly; sometimes characters outlive their usefulness to the author and vanish; sometimes they just vanish. And…Terry is rather a moody guy. The novel swirls around him, switching gears so often, it is sometimes hard to know whether as a reader we should shift from 2nd gear, to 3rd gear or go directly into drive. So you are probably thinking – how reliable is Terry as a narrator anyway? Still…It is a smooth drive read. Because as readers, we are always rooting for Terry.

In thThis was an incredible anthology of short stories, a project of the International Thriller Writers (ITW) who paired bestseller writers together. In this way, readers got to see favorite characters meet up with other favorite characters to solve crimes. They were placed in unlikely scenarios or settings outside their comfort zones, working with individuals you would not see in their “books.” As an example, you had Patrick Kenzie teaming up with Harry Bosch to solve a cold (and not-so-cold) kidnapping case in Boston; Lincoln Rhyme and Lucas Davenport combine their respective specialties to solve a series of grisly New York City murders; and even John Rebus and Roy Grace wrap up a decades-old mis-recorded case in Brighton. Some were exciting, full of high energy and complicated plot twists, that seemed to work well in a short story format. Some seemed cut short and were constrained within the limited pages. And some, at times had too many characters to follow within the short story – like, who really are the stars here? But…The most successful stories, were the simple ones. Where there were just two main characters at most – like Kenzie and Bosch. Or Jack Reacher and Nick Heller. Less complicated for the reader in a short story format. Still…This is a great in-between book to read while reading the novels. One or two stories at a time. In any order. 22 thriller writers. And…Best of all…If you are unfamiliar with some of these thriller/suspense, mystery writers, this is a sampler of their styles, to some extent.

But one that you don’t necessarily need to read cover to cover. It is one that gives you an opportunity to hear from 83 different authors about their favorite bookstores. Where they are located and why they are important to them. Sometimes we forget the importance of bookstores.

So, having this opportunity, to listen to a writer talk about why a bookstore is important to them – not just to sell their books – but, how these places impact them, is meaningful reading. I can remember when my husband and I were travelling in our RV through the many small towns across the United States. One of the things I would appreciate most would be stopping in the little private owned independent bookshops. I loved how the booksellers would display the books, and tell me who was recommending what book and why I would want to read it. I had many impulse buys on those trips based on those visits. And I don’t regret any of them. Those were some of my best reading experiences. What I enjoyed about browsing through this book most…the writer’s stories. Their love of their bookstores. Their memories. The importance those bookstore walls were to them. Let’s not forget the importance of bookstores. They not only have books.

But this morning when I was clearing out my LFL donation box, his book appeared. I am not usually attracted to short stories (other than mysteries), but for some reason, the premise of his got to me. Anne Lamott wrote the foreword. Her first sentence, “Mark Yaconelli is an unusual person, as brilliant as he is plainspoken.” She went on to share his different attributes. Showcasing him as someone who could be an activist, or a goofball, charismatic, deeply articulate yet compassionate and silly. Something she felt, we as readers would find between these pages. I felt compelled to do exactly what she suggested. Open this book. And so, I did. I began to read. 	And I only stopped for breakfast. And then again for some routine chores. And then again for our dog walk. And then when we got back from our walk, I stuck my nose in the book, and read some more, until I finished it. Every time I found something I loved of his that he said, I added the quote to my favorites on my page. You will find a lot of those quotes either within this  or below. I was mesmerized by his words. His thoughts. I literally was entranced. What I have come to learn over the course of my reading life, is that storytelling is an art form. A true storyteller will capture us immediately. And if they don’t, we as readers, will become impatient, sometimes, regretfully critical. (After all, read some of our s!) When writers can capture us at the beginning, we are in for a heart-felt read. And that is what obviously happened here for me. Take for instance, the author’s first sentence in his first story, “A Place the Soul Once Knew.” “There are moments, often unexpected, when you find yourself at home in your own life.”I live within those moments, too. I live a present moment life. Not all of us do. We are in a hurry. We have things to do, life expects that of us. But, here in this moment, he has us standing at his kitchen window watching the weather, listening to the birds. He is recognizing how distant he has become from life itself. And asking a very difficult question of himself…“How long was I out?”This is a very sobering question, indeed. He is referring to life as we have all experienced through this pandemic. The helpless despair. Withdrawing from public spaces. (I personally still don’t go to public closed spaces; i.e., restaurants, movie theatres, large group events. And, if I go to a grocery or retail store or a doctor’s office, I still wear a face mask, even though it is no longer required. So, I get what he shares here.) He questions our humanity to one another. He talks about the impact at schools. Friends. Family. Relationships. In some ways, he is giving us in this first story, an introduction to what is to come throughout the book – an opening to his soul of storytelling. And…To the many storytellers he has experienced to this point…in his lifetime.There will be 180 pages, 12 stories, 3 interludes (short disconnected stories with their own soft setting, so to speak), an acknowledgements and notes. He will take us back through his childhood, into his present, and share anecdotes of what he sees around him. We will be a passenger on a journey with him as he shares his experiences and observations – of the listening – and the telling. There is so much within his short stories that I can relate to, that I almost feel like we have led parallel lives. (I believe many readers might feel similarly.)As an example, in his story, “The Catacombs,” he shares a lot about his dad. I could relate to what he shared when he said, “One way to become a storyteller is to have a father who is impatient, busy, easily distracted, whose attention you crave.” The author spoke of how often his father was unavailable for most of the important events in his life. I remember resenting my father for those very same things – especially missing my high school graduation. And yet, if I attended some work event of my father’s, his colleagues would gather around me and share how much my father would rave about how proud he was of me. They would then go ahead and list all of my many accomplishments, as I would stand blushing in shock, never realizing how important I was in the eyes of my father. Because I never heard him share any of this, EVER with me personally. Still…My Dad, was my role model, and so much of what this author shares, his father did for him, too. It was always the little things. We gained so much through the little things. The stories they shared. We listened to their every word. And in this way, we learned. And we grew. And we became the best version of ourselves, too. Through our own stories. “The transformation occurs in the space between one heart and another. To be heard by someone who is present, open, and caring is to be led into freedom.”As I am reading along, in his story “Pure Medicine,” the author asks, “If stories are relational, if their power is to connect us to others, to our own hearts, our values, and the natural world, then why are we so estranged from one another? Why is the earth suffering from such mindless exploitation? Why are there skyrocketing increases in depression?”He brings up a good point. He talks about the time we invest in social media “reading” stories, and how we allow it to consume us. Not always in a good way. Concerned that if this goes unchecked, our distractions could ruin us. We may yearn for connection with others – but…He makes us question whether we are truly connecting – if we are allowing ourselves to be exploited by various media or political and corporate interests.Is our mindless consumption of stories disconnecting us from our humanness – our ability to connect face-to-face with each other?The author reminds us in this story – that storytelling is being human together.We need this reminder so much in today’s world. I have provided a selection of quotes below that I think compliment his stories well. I highly recommend this book. It will do your soul good. I’d like to close with the author’s own words…“We live in a world that is alive and generous and in need of care. Strangely, paradoxically, it is in serving and singing and telling our stories to one another that we discover the homecoming we’ve been longing for has been here, among and within us, all along.”...more",Notes are private!,2,59,1,"Aug 15, 2023","Aug 15, 2023","Aug 15, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60143370-between-the-listening-and-the-telling

It was the Winner of the New England Book Award for Fiction, and the Winner of the Kirkus Prize; as well as a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award. This book is a meticulously researched fictional homage to Margaret Mead. It showcases her restless mind, and gives readers a portrait of Western anthropology in its early years – as we take a 1933 field trip with her up the Sepik River, in New Guinea with her second husband, Reo Fortune, and English anthropologist Gregory Bateson, who would eventually become her third husband. Andrew Bankson, an English anthropologist they run into upon arriving at a local government station is the novel’s narrator. The book isn’t exactly an easy read. It is rife with visceral imagery and filled with the smells of disease, foul breath and unwashed bodies. People are not pretty in this novel, which makes it beautifully realistic.

Lower-middle-class Connell lives across town with his unwed mother, who had him in her teens and works as a cleaning woman for the Sheridans. Marianne and Connell begin an intense, private, complicated, don’t-tell-anyone-we-are-in-a-relationship. As readers, we follow them over a 4-year period. Connell is concerned about his social standing if anyone should discover his involvement with Marianne. Marianne could care less what anyone thinks of her. As readers, we are witness to their on-again-off-again closeness (sex) and misunderstandings and insecurities. Throughout the story, the author gives us glimpses into issues of class, privilege, passivity, submission, emotional and physical pain, kindness, depression, and sibling abuse (Alan, the brother, towards Marianne). Her focus is on young adults as they struggle to navigate their lives – coming into themselves and the world around them. There were some scenes that were difficult to read. (Especially between Alan and Marianne.)The author’s use of dialogue sometimes cut to the heart. She seamlessly integrates well-crafted texts, emails, and even FB posts into her narratives. Still…I wasn’t sure what I wanted for this pair. I found myself lamenting…What is really best for them?The ending. (No spoilers from me.) But… Was the ending satisfying?An interesting read. Far from feel-good. But…Was it worth your time?

Premise: Frida Liu is a 39-year-old single mother of an 18-month old daughter named Harriet. She has a respectable, but dull job at the University of Pennsylvania. In a spell of insomnia-induced irrationality, Frida leaves Harriet home alone for 2 hours and is hauled into police custody for child abandonment. The accusation isn’t technically wrong; after all she did leave Harriet unattended. The problem is that when Frida tries to repent, everything she says or does is interpreted by the authorities wrong. And that doesn’t go well for her. Frida’s mistake was serious, but she’s also a deeply sympathetic character. Her love for Harriet is desperate, and her hope for a reunion heartbreaking. But, it’s clear that in Chan’s surveillance hellscape, there is no real path to redemption, no way for a flawed mother to win. What happens to a person when she has no way to beat an intolerable system and no way to escape it? This was a terrifying read. A horrible dystopian future. I can understand that one mistake that Frida made – but beyond that…How do I even rate this book?Is there really a mommy-shaming culture out there?I know now why I wasn’t interested in reading this book in the first place.

I know, I am very lucky to be a repository for such wonderful books. As is, my neighborhood. There is no doubt, Urrea is a gifted storyteller. With this story, it is almost like getting invited to a party. Also, a funeral. When the novel opens, Big Angel de la Cruz, the patriarch of a sprawling Mexican-American family, is getting ready to bury his mother, and to die. I mean seriously, the first sentence of the book says…“Big Angel was late to his own mother’s funeral.” Doesn’t that make you want to keep reading?Big Angel is in the late stages of terminal cancer, and so he gathers his relatives for a Saturday, funeral and on Sunday, his last birthday party. Now…This may sound like a tearjerker. But the book’s spirit is high. Even in its saddest moments this book just feels full of joy. Even Big Angel spends a lot of time listing what he is grateful for…“Family, marriage, working, oysters, being taller than my kids.” Readers can still feel the passion between him and his wife, Perla, even if he can’t act on it. And…We feel the pleasure of family, throughout the pages. It doesn’t mean the de la Cruz family is perfect. They struggle with all sorts of ailments…addiction, exhaustion, alienation, frustrated ambition. One is married to a woman who might be a bit off. One spends the whole funeral and most of the birthday party outside in their car. Everyone is grieving. Especially Big Angel. Yet…This is not a novel about grief. It is a novel about how amazing it is to have been alive. About being amazed.This book is a celebration. Of life. Of vulnerability. So even if the subject seems morose, the story isn’t told in that way. Open the pages of this book, settle back and be amazed.

This book seems to be caught up in war…again. I say again, because we know that was the basis of All the Light We Cannot See. In this story...The earliest action takes place in mid-15th century with Omeir, an ostracized boy with a cleft palate. He is in the Ottoman army and a reluctant witness to one of history’s most consequential battles. Anna is in this part of the story as an orphan desperate to raise money to heal her sickly sister. She starts plucking ancient manuscripts from an abandoned priory and selling them to well-heeled Italian book collectors. They are hoping to set up a library. But...Anna keeps one literary treasure for herself: a comic allegory called “Cloud Cuckoo Land,” written more than a thousand years earlier by the Greek writer Antonious Diogenes. We get fragments of this codex throughout this novel.Some 500 years later, Zeno, an American soldier from Idaho, is captured during the Korean War. And...While there he is befriended by a British soldier who teaches him classics. When he returns home and retires, Zeno volunteers to direct a group of fifth graders in a play to be performed at an Idaho public library. It is the manuscript “Cloud Cuckoo Land.” Then...Far off into the apocalyptic future when planet Earth is ruined, we follow 14-year-old Konstance, who is on an intergalactic spaceship called Argos. The ship is controlled by Sybil, a supercomputer nanny. To stay engaged they listen to a library song that is from an ancient story called “Cloud Cuckoo Land.” So...What is the point? Remember when I said, librarians and bookworms throughout time are the heroes of this book?Well. Consider this…Past. Present. Future. A literary battle against literary disintegration?

Any one of these stories, other than the last one, might have made their own compelling book. But all 3 in one? In this er’s opinion it all felt…Too much. Not necessary. Over-the-top. “What really matters,” one of the many insightful children proclaims, “is that the story gets passed on.” Yes, libraries are important, and we all love books.

CLEVER!! They are 22 of some of the most popular mystery writers paired together (male vs female author) to collaborate on short stories. Each story includes each author’s main character being brought together to work on a case. Sometimes actually working together (in some instances). In this way, the paired authors are creating mini tales of suspense that are truly quite engaging! Now you can see why I wasn’t always falling asleep! Besides…can you even imagine Dr. Temperance Brennan (Bones fame) working together with Jack Reacher? I think what I enjoyed the most actually had nothing to do with any of the plot lines or suspense, even though they all held my interest. It was the witty humor and banter that was displayed between the characters (several of which I recognized) because of my long love affair with mysteries. It's hard to pick a favorite, as each shorty offers their own special 'something' that makes its plot unique. This is truly a must read for any short story OR mystery fan that likes a strong character lead. As with all collections, some of the collaborations are more successful than others but the list of winners will vary from reader to reader. As much as I enjoy catching up with “old friends”, this is also a great way to try on a new-to-you author & maybe find another series to add to your growing pile of must-read books!

This is a story about Ellis Island in the early 20th century – told from an immigrant experience in 1902 and from 2 perspectives. The first perspective is Francesca. She is a young Sicilian woman fleeing her abusive father. The second perspective is Alma, a second-generation German-American, forced by her stepfather to work at Ellis Island so that she, an unmarried woman, can contribute to the household income. She is compassionate and devoted to social justice issues. Alma yearns to become a translator, a challenging route for a woman at this time. At Ellis Island, the two woman’s paths cross, they become friends, and find ways to help, learn and support each other. With Francesca’s support, Alma tries to expose the abuses happening at Ellis Island. The author does a good job of mixing fact and fiction within the storyline – in that, if anyone were to take a tour of Ellis Island today, you aren’t going to hear about what the immigrants suffered, or the blatant prejudices they faced once they entered NYC and beyond. The author exposes these injustices, showcasing the critical side of history by sharing with the reader the neglected but important part of history through her historical fiction, an engaging story of memorable and strong female characters. Which makes this…A powerful story of female friendship, a look at the immigrant experience and triumph over darkness. ...more",Notes are private!,11,26,2,not setnot set,"Aug 11, 2023Aug 11, 2023","Aug 11, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/55813959-the-next-ship-home

My conclusion will give you an understanding of where I am now.Premise: This book examines the impact of social and political beliefs on the lives of 3 young women living in 1938 and beyond in Germany. Hanna, following her mother’s unexpected death, is now living in Berlin with her Aunt and Uncle, who are Hitler supporters. Hanna aspires to be a doctor, like her mother. Hanna is befriended by a second teen, Klara. Klara’s parents are active in the Nazi party, and have grand plans for Klara to marry an SS officer. No doubt the author’s discerning insights into the strained social settings the teens are thrust into are causing this reader sincere stress and angst. Events hosted by Hanna’s Aunt and Uncle and the deplorable, disgusting plans that involve Hanna also feel unimaginable and difficult for this reader/er to witness. But…This reader/er continued reading.The third young woman is Tilde (mixed Jewish and Gentile heritage), an amazing seamstress. She and her mom live in fear for their safety. They earn a meager living at a fabric shop while Tilde’s dream of studying law disappears. The story is filled with historical details and political views of women’s “duty” to Germany. Young girls, groomed to be in service to the Fatherland are encouraged to join the Band of German Maidens (BDM), which is part of the Hitler Youth. The “schools for German brides” teach that “motherhood is your sacred duty…the very reason you were born.” Is this the girl’s destiny?What will become of Hanna, Klara and Tilde?Will they serve their country under Hitler? – or forge a better life?What will become of their friendship?Will they survive?Compelling.

As if people are stealthily walking through a train station – wearing their trench coats with hats, to hide their true identities. (Okay, I admit, my imagination has gotten the better of me!) This tale is spiced with morally ambiguous characters – so, are you ready for this train ride?Our protagonist is John Russell, a freelance journalist who has been living and working in Berlin for the last 15 years. He is a divorced Brit with an American mother. It is 1939 and it is clear that war is inevitable. John has no illusions about what is going on, but like many he feels powerless to do much of anything about it. His son Paul, is an active member of the Hitler Youth, and his unwillingness to make his son’s life difficult is of paramount concern to him. Plus… There is John’s lover, Effi, who is a young starlet who is making a comfortable living appearing in films filled with pro-Nazi propaganda. John just isn’t interested in getting in the way, even if he is morally against both. (To this reader, both of these storylines are personally difficult to navigate.)On a lonely New Year’s Eve, John is approached by a Soviet agent who asks him to write some pro-Nazi feature stories for a leading Soviet newspaper. It seems the leadership of the Soviet Union is interested in pursuing a pact with Hitler. The money is good and there is a reasonable amount of journalist freedom involved. He accepts the assignment. Where are we going with this storyline, this reader asks.Next store to him lives an American journalist named Tyler. Tyler has uncovered some secret plans to “purify the race by sterilizing the mentally handicapped and all the other so-called incurables.” Not long after this discussion between Tyler and John, Tyler dies – supposedly by suicide, and the groundbreaking story that Tyler intended to release, never sees the light. How does this affect John? What actions does he take with a Jewish family trying to flee Germany? Will he grow a conscious to help the Soviets undermine Hitler?Will any of his actions change the lives of his son and his lover?How do any of these decisions affect the moral decisions any of the characters make when siding with one form of evil over another? Lots of questions which means – this might be a really good book discussion selection. The author does an interesting job of showcasing an economically prosperous yet politically bankrupt pre-war Germany as it hangs over the action of its characters. John Russell is a very interesting character. He obviously yearns for meaning in his life, something beyond being passive against one thing or in favor of something else. Will he find inner peace?

So, when I saw The Best of Adam Sharp at our Library, I felt it was a book I was expected to read. I should probably start this  by saying that if you expect this novel to be anything like The Rosie Project you'll be disappointed. Especially if you are anticipating any laugh-out-loud moments. Not here. On an intellectual level, I had no objections to anything Simsion wrote about: relationships are complicated; people are complicated; everyday living has a way of numbing relationships. It's clearly a book about every day life, about the routine that many of us settle into. But it's also a book about fate, taking chances and how, in life, we often don't appreciate the people that love us most.

I was feeling my own PTSD with historical fiction. There is something to be said about being in the midst of war – whether we have personally experienced it or not – if an author is successful, they can take us inside their story and bring us full circle through a myriad of emotions. That means – to me – that they are fully successful. They have done their job by making us believe, as readers, we are truly within the historic walls of time and thus feel everything the characters are experiencing. You know what I mean?And even if it had been some time since I had read some of those WWII books I had recently ed, I had been in a period of refreshing myself with them, so I could write my s in real time. And because I was doing that, I was in a sense, re-living the war over and over…again. But…I had heard so much about this book from so many of my GR friends, and I wanted to read it. So, I did.Thank you. Besides being a war story, it is a sweeping, tenderhearted love story, too. Captivating, absorbing and beautifully written. It was emotionally charged and moving that took readers into the lives of 2 families. The Thompson and Gregory family worlds intertwine after 11-year old Beatrix Thompson is sent to Boston from London to live with the Gregory family for the duration of the war causing unlikely friendships to be forged, loyalties to be stretched, heartache to occur, and the meaning of home to be changed. The prose is vivid and expressive. The characters multi-layered. Vulnerable. The plot moves quickly. It is a coming-of-age story that includes a tale about life, loss, friendship, heartbreak, guilt, grief, courage, hope, war, romance, regret, first love, and complex (very complex) familial relationships. The author does a great job of blending historical facts with fiction and emotion.

Brendan, a member of the U.S. Special Forces, says that he can. Or can he? Set on Martha’s Vineyard, this story starts with a fisherman spotting a man and a child treading water in the middle of Nantucket Sound. They are nowhere near land. They aren’t even near a boat. The pair slip under the water when the fisherman’s boat draws closer, and don’t resurface. This story feels part romance, part coming-of-age-story, part-thriller. It goes into the passion of first love, gives readers a huge topping of grief, trauma and mental illness. There is much to absorb.Cara, an aspiring artist, adrift after graduating from college, decides to spend her summer on Martha’s Vineyard. While sketching, she meets Brendan, a handsome Special Forces soldier on leave. He is quite charismatic, and funny. The two become madly and passionately in love. He tells her his secret – of being able to breathe underwater – because of experimental surgery performed on him in the service. Cara believes him – she watches him – and thinks this is what she sees. But then…He gets moody and strange and there are disappearances on his job. Unsure when he will return from his deployment, Cara plans to move to New York City. Brendan unexpectedly returns, Cara changes her plans, and finds herself pregnant. Brendan is convinced their baby Micah also has the gift of breathing underwater. When she witnesses something Brendan does with the baby to prove it, Cara takes off with Micah. Only to find the next morning that Micah is gone with Brendan. After the kidnapping, Cara realizes that Brendan may be mentally ill. The question for readers now becomes…How far would Cara go to find her missing child and the troubled father, her first love who took him?This seems to be the driving force for Cara over the next several pages.Five years later, stable in a new life, Cara still believes Micah is alive. When she spots Brendan she is determined to find Micah.Will she be successful?The setting for this story is beautiful. The author shared, “There’s just nothing like the feeling of being on a small island, surrounded by water at all times.

Interestingly enough, I never heard of this book before. I was doing an online search for a book on my library’s website, when this one came up. I thought it looked interesting, so decided to order it. Each page references a city devoted to an author, based on their book. As an example, you have Monterey, CA. The illustration features the Monterey Canning Company. The Which represents Cannery Row by John Steinbeck, 1945. The What is the beautiful oceanside street ‘where life at its most colorful ebbs and flows.’ On this page about Monterey and cannery row, the author starts by sharing, “in the early pearly morning, The Row begins to wake. Gulls start their vigils on corrugated-iron rooftops, waiting for trash to become lunch; sea lions bark like hunting dogs over the heave of the ocean.”I love the way she transports us there.

Agatha Christie fans will appreciate her imaginative powers of creation in this particular character – a refugee from the GSo, who is Hercule Poirot? Agatha Christie fans will appreciate her imaginative powers of creation in this particular character – a refugee from the German invasion of Belgium that brought Britain into WWI. She gave him such a rich history. He became a ranking policeman in the city of Brussels, before coming to London to become a private investigator solving crimes and sharing a flat with an ex-officer of that same war, Captain Hastings. In many respects, we could also see Captain Hastings as his Dr. Watson, the man who would carry the revolver in emergencies and who was the sounding board for his theories. Christie made Poirot in his first case, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, a foolish-type figure. She was very particular in her description of him as a short, portly man, with an egg-shaped head. And… Let us not forget his little mannerisms, and his attention to his mustache. Always attention to his most famous mustache. Or…His immaculate clothes of a bygone era. Still…She also gave him an incisive brain similar to that of Sherlock Holmes. A sharp mind that could cut through any lies or secrets and find the murderer when not even Scotland Yard’s greatest detectives could. David Suchet, portrayed Poirot to perfection in the PBS series. Albert Finney did so on ‘Murder on the Orient Express.’ But… Suchet is the one I see when I visualized Poirot and read these 51 grand short stories this past month in-between all the other books I was reading and ing. Still… Even as I allowed myself to be carried away in these stories that I have read before (because they still felt as fresh as if I had never read them or seen them performed)…Who was Poirot really? Poirot is a bit of a mystery himself. Christie doesn’t divulge a lot about him. Like…how old was he really? Why did he choose not to marry? What was his connection to Captain Hastings? How did Poirot earn a statue in his Belgian town? How did he earn the money to live so well? Like Christie…Poirot has secrets. Can we as readers find out just a little bit more of Poirot through these pages? Besides what Poirot solves in each of these cases?What I can say is that anyone who is an Agatha Christie fan of Poirot, this will be a joyful read. For those unfamiliar, this is a chance to learn about a “new” crime professional. Any one of these stories will be an opportunity to breeze through times past and experience a different way of solving crimes. Using one’s keen observations.

They remind me how much I love to read, and how much we love so many great authors. I had forgotten that I had read this book a while ago, until it was deposited recently as a donation at my Little Free Library Shed. I remember when I first read this, I had also done some background on James Baldwin and discovered that he had written this novel after he had given up being a youth preacher and left the church to become a writer. He said that it took him more than 10 years to write this, having spent time in Greenwich Village and Paris before moving to a small town in the Swiss Alps. He finally finished it in 1952. In a 1961 interview with American broadcaster and oral historian Studs Terkel, Baldwin shared that he didn’t think he would ever finish the novel because of the shame he felt inside for the life he had in a Negro church. (Many see this novel as semi-autobiographical.)He also felt “ashamed of my father, ashamed of the Blues, ashamed of Jazz, and of course, ashamed of watermelon: all of these stereotypes that the country inflicts on Negroes, that we all eat watermelon or we all do nothing but sing the Blues. Well, I was afraid of all that; and I ran from it.” Eventually he stopped running. The title of the book is actually a refrain of the African-American spiritual: “Go tell it on the mountain/over the hills and everywhere/go tell it on the mountain/that Jesus Christ is born.” The story is centered around 24 hours in the life of John Grime’s – and it is his 14th birthday. His mother gives him money which he uses to explore the city for the day. As readers we explore the city with him. We can feel his anger – because this is not his life. He is reflecting on the various demons ruling over his life: his violent preacher stepfather, his church, and the racist society into which he had the misfortune to be born. He does not get to experience the riches or splendors that he sees. Yet he dreams and hopes big for himself. As readers we are feeling the essential aspect of life in America, its contradictions and seductions, that bittersweet mix of love and hate that so many feel towards our country when we see this racial divide.And then…He finds himself at the church. And we can sense what that holy feeling is that takes over John. Is he transformed? Is he saved? Is he destroyed or renewed? Baldwin’s novel is well thought out, and well-crafted. A lyrical work.It can even be thought of as a protest chant. It definitely is a brilliant portrait of a young man struggling with complex issues. A landmark classic novel. ...more",Notes are private!,2,61,1,not set,"Aug 05, 2023","Aug 05, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17143.Go_Tell_It_on_the_Mountain

For my daughter-in-law’s birthday this summer, we got her a cozy chair blanket with an otter picture on it. She lit up! There is something about an otter!This is an enjoyable story that animal lovers will appreciate. But…it is also an educational experience, too. Odder is written in free verse and inspired by true events, according to the author’s note at the back of the book. It also has lovely illustrations throughout by Charles Santoso that add to the story. Premise: Otter pup Odder is separated from her mom after a fierce storm. Fortunately, strange animals – humans – discover her and take her to a strange place, and restore her health. Eventually she goes back to the wild, has fun, makes friends – but after being badly injured by a shark bite, lands back with the humans again to be given a wonderful job of nurturing and raising other pups at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. There is much to love about the story – the feelings of adventure and impulsivity of the otters. The natural movements of a shark. The ways of the bay/ocean. The wonderful human intentions (to keep the otters healthy and/or happy in the wild). The importance of play. Messages of resilience, compassion and empathy.Some trigger moments for discussion with kids…Since the story is about orphaned pups and told from the viewpoint of one of them, (Odder) there will be some violence and scariness. A sense of fear, grief and uncertainty of being permanently separated from Mom is essential to the story – which may be difficult for kids to understand, even while kind humans provide a safety net. Other difficult parts to discuss with kids may involve when Odder is attacked by a shark and can no longer be in the wild, and another otter delivers a stillborn pup. Yet, even though…The story will have moments when it is centered on grief, loss and separation as pups lose their moms, moms lose their pups and friends lose each other – there will also, be in the background, a dedicated, caring group of scientists and volunteers working hard at keeping them safe. I strongly recommend that when readers are finished with the story, they read the Author’s note, to learn the amazing fictional backstories of these animals and their caretakers at the Monterey Bay Aquarium in Monterey, CA.She is also the author of The One and Only Ivan.

Since retiring from the public library where he has spent his entire professional career, he’s enjoyed a life of almost uninterrupted solitude in the house his mother left to him decades earlier. He is devoted to his books. The story begins in the narrative present between 2005 and 2006.In the opening pages, Bob encounters a woman suffering dementia and returns her to a nearby retirement center. Bob’s brief encounter with her, is enough to inspire him to volunteer in that same place, which surprises the center’s lax manager, Maria. This provides the author with an opportunity to construct funny dialogue involving quirky folks. We find the author a master at the way he gets his characters to talk at and with each other.The story goes back in time in the novel’s second section in which we have an opportunity to learn more about Bob Comet’s past relationship – meeting and falling in love. As readers we are introduced to his ex-wife, Connie, and his best friend, Ethan, a fast-talking playboy who ends up stealing Connie away from him. We also see him in his job at the library, and meet the character of Miss Ogilvie, Bob’s first boss. Some of the excitement that takes place in this section remains peripheral to Bob and to the plot.

As a reader, I wasn’t sure this section was really necessary to the overall story arc. Overall, ‘The Librarianist’ presents us with a rather interesting character in Bob Comet. He embodies an unspoken sadness that infuses the majority of the novel. Even so…There was something rather decent and human and thoughtful about him.

The letter discovered was typed by none other than A. Einstein who wrote to F. D. Roosevelt in 1939 about the consequences of recent scientific research. This letter informed the President of his duty to bring this matter to his attention. He actually named names of individuals involved and said, “it has become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction in a large mass of uranium, by which vast amounts of power …would be generated.” While this had the promise of a new and important source of energy he warned that “extremely powerful bombs of a new type could be constructed.”And thus this fictional story was born. All he had to do was create characters and invent a plot to weave through that historical background, without misstating the critical facts. Premise: Nathan Silverman’s idyllic life is soon changed by the increasing bigotry against his family and the rest of the Jewish community after his uncle is arrested on Krirstallnacht. He leaves Germany for New York City with only his mother’s wedding ring for survival. While attending Columbia in 1942, he decides to enlist in the military to fight the Nazis. He is selected and trained as a spy, and then ordered to report to the Manhattan Project. Mission: to smuggle out a physicist hoping to defect who also was a friend of his father, who was also a physicist. He travels with Dr. Allison Fisher, a brilliant scientist who trains him, and whom he also develops strong feelings for, as well. Will they be successful in their mission? So…Was this book exciting?

When that happenIn 2017, the UC Santa Barbara Library and the Office of Educative Vice Chancellor chose this book as the UCSB Reads Book of the Year. When that happens, the intention is that the university and community-at-large come together for dialogue about important topical issues related to what this book represents. During the school year, the university sponsors faculty panel discussions, film screenings, exhibitions and other events on campus and throughout the community – which also includes, book discussion groups at local libraries. They then host the author for a free lecture at their campus hall. (The San Luis Obispo County Public Libraries along with Cuesta College has sponsored similar programs, as well.) Since this was the selected book for 2017, it also led me to read it at that time. And of course, in catching up with my s, here I am bringing it to you on Goodreads. The author once shared that he was inspired to write this novel from enjoying his experiences of eves-dropping on conversations of his daughter and friends! Oh my! Already, he is giving us a hint of his wondrous sense of humor which is interspersed through-out this novel. Bottom line this book is about a Mexican girl named Nayeli, who is traveling north to find herself and then a trip home again. Nayeli is feisty and intelligent and truly likable. Her quest is to bring back men who have abandoned her town. The odyssey will take the young women to the underworld of the Tijuana slums across the border and into the complications and adventures of the US prejudice and ignorance and then back home. Her intention…she feels her town needs warriors ready to battle the “bad men” taking over the town with their drugs.Nayeli is greatly influenced by the movie, “The Magnificent Seven.” In some ways, this book is a satire – showing both sides of the border with genuine sympathy and humor. Late in the novel, there was a scene in which a man in the hotel – a place where Mexicans are actually welcomed – makes a point of turning off the TV when a scene comes on depicting illegals climbing over the border like rats. Urrea, it seems, is suggesting something similar – provoking readers to turn off the inaccurate portrayal of Mexicans as violent intruders. In paying attention to his message, readers can see the novel for it’s true intention – light and humorous, and while not the dramatic statement this writer is capable of making – still thought-provoking and well-worth reading....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,not set,"Aug 03, 2023","Aug 03, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7519613-into-the-beautiful-north

I had another book on my currently reading list to get to – but I was curious and decided to read the blurb more closely. I couldn’t help myself. This is the author’s debut novel (published 2015).

I am now bringing my  to Goodreads.Let me just say that this is not a legal thriller for which Grisham is typically known for – it is more a coming-of-age story. I read that Grisham had originally serialized this in a different format in his magazine, The Oxford American, in a semi-autobiographical way, in which he shared about his growing up below the Mason-Dixon line. Now, as a novel, it is set in 1952 Arkansas, narrated by 7-year-old Luke Chandler, the only child to a family of cotton farmers. The plot introduces us to a cast of eccentric characters including his father, grandfather, a hillbilly clan and migrant workers who work the farm. We get a sense of the labor and weather of working a farm. And part of the weather includes the floods and tornadoes. Grisham is trying very hard to keep readers from getting bored. The plot also throws in an illegitimate birth, an interracial affair, and a couple of murders. Grisham isn’t afraid to tell a story. There is a folksy tone that is somewhat endearing. As readers we can’t help but feel hopeful for the future. That everyone will survive and do well.

You see, for more than 200 years, the Owens women have been blamed for everything that has gone wrong in their Massachusetts town. Gillian and Sally, as children were forever outsiders, taunted and talked about. Their elderly aunts encouraged the whispers of witchery. Of course, it didn’t help that they lived in a musty house and enjoyed exotic concoctions and a crowd of black cats. Even though Gillian and Sally may want to get out, as adults they still return. The plot moved slowly, but it was still entertaining. The magic was enticing – but I wanted more. I couldn’t help but find myself comparing the book to the movie, since I saw the movie first and kept visualizing Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman in the parts. And of course, Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest were brilliant as the aunts in the movie, so they were easy to see in my mind, as I read the book, as well.

It is attended by Carmen’s (straight) brother, Nick who is stoned and in drag, and her (gay) sister, Alice who disappears after the ceremony to have steamy sex with the other bridesmaid, the groom’s sister, Maude. Are you with me so far?A few hours later, horror descends upon this group when Nick, Maude and Alice, the sisters’ friend Jean and her folk singer companion, Tom all head off into the dim 3 a.m. night, with Nick’s casual, drugged girlfriend, Olivia, behind the wheel of her old dodge.

The stigma associated with it is even worst. And yet, we can’t underestimate the devastation that this dis-ease can create on the psyche and physical body of those it affects. What becomes of our own self-esteem, the self-judgment of what we are supposed to look like – how thin we are supposed to be in comparison to someone else when we look in the mirror each day? How many of us have been self-critical and taken extremes to have what we believed would be the “perfect” body to meet the “perfect” image for acceptance by others – or most importantly, acceptance by ourselves?And what kind of relationship would we have with our own weight scale to get there?Eve Yang starts off her book with the heading – 5 pounds. We know immediately what she is talking about. Her ""protagonist"" Olive is assessing herself. She is realizing what it is going to take to look like the perfect person, if only she weighed 5 pounds less. The mirror was judging her again. And then we see almost immediately the cause and effect of what caused her need to be so concerned. Her coach. “You look in shape,” he said nonchalantly. How many adults have given us these messages “nonchalantly” without realizing how hurtful and painful and messy those expectations of us to look and be a certain weight affect us to do these extreme things to ourselves?Turning the page, we learn that this same coach insisted that other girls on her swim team, lose 5 pounds, too. Why? Will it help them to swim faster? Olive describes these girls with an already lean physique. This er wants to know…what is wrong with these adults? The author then begins to describe the science behind anorexia nervosa – but not dismissing the environmental or social influences that contribute to its cause. While talking about the science, she also weaves Olive’s personal story in-between the pages. Her story is now. She is relaying her experience even as Covid hits. Her parents are there with her. Concerned. Wanting to watch over her as she eats. Do they need to weigh her regularly to make sure she doesn’t slip away? The good news is that she has the support of her family. But even with their support, she is out of control and needs a doctor’s care and the ER. How had she become a high-risk patient? How could a person do this to themselves? Would she risk eating for a feeding tube? What happens to rational and logical decision making? The author goes into scientific explanations. What will it take for weight restoration? Mind restoration? Nutritional rehabilitation?What happens when one has to go to a specialized ICU unit? The dangers of what happens to a body that is starved? The types of dis-eases that can develop? What eating less than 500 calories a day can do to one’s body? As readers we continue to become witness to Olive’s story. We become hopeful for her metabolism and its recovery. How will she recover from her obsession with weight loss?The author provides much in the way of giving excellent background science of what a body goes through – what is needed to assist the recovery, besides sharing Olive’s own personal, harrowing story. She is honest about the triggers that can lead to relapse, or the cause of anorexia in the first place. There was a point in which Olive was talking to her doctor about the time she was swimming and she said, “I wanted to be better. I wanted to be prettier and more athletic. I wanted to be satisfied with myself because I’ve lived my entire life feeling the opposite.” At that moment I wanted to cry. How many of us have felt that way at one point or another? The author’s science discussion is interesting and relevant. Her story heart-breaking and touching and important. For her she needed to break free from the constant mind screaming sentence that would tell her by eating she was going to gain weight and be fat. She needed to be able to find a way to have a good relationship with food. Recognize the positive nutritional life-saving benefits of food. For anyone who has young children, it is so important to recognize the pressures they face just be-ing in this world. So important to help them see that they are enough, and beautiful just as they are. And hope that there aren’t people (especially adult role models) out there who are judging them based on how they look, or expecting them to lose 5 pounds, because they are not good enough just as they are.Because look at what just one person did to this individual who took the time to write this book. The good news is that there can be recovery. I have to believe writing this book was cathartic for this author. I didn’t ask her, and I may be assuming, but it felt like it as I read this story.

And panicked voices. As the chapter ends, Tessa asks, “are we afraid?”The novel then takes us to…Diane and Max’s New York apartment waiting for their friends to arrive from Paris for a Super Bowl party. Martin, Diane’s student is the only guest who has arrived at this point…When…The football game is about to begin and…The TV screen goes blank. The phones go silent. The computer is dead. Martin suggests that the Chinese government may have launched a “selective internet apocalypse.” Diane makes a joke about aliens. This opening sounds all the usual alarms of worldwide disaster. But this isn’t DeLillo. DeLillo has something else in mind. He is suggesting that maybe, just maybe we may have an unnerving dependency on technology. “What happens,” the narrator asks, “to people who live inside their phones?” I am not going to begin to share what ends up happening next – that would just spoil the upcoming scenes. But, I will share…The trauma/drama that ensues is a bit looney, and what DeLillo suggests, could make all of us want to stop. Pause. Think out loud for just one moment and ask ourselves...

A group is willing to be human guinea pigs, so to speak when they gather at a London “live-in” clinic for a pharma firm’s vaccine trial as a fictional pandemic set’s in. Neffy is the narrator, and she and her fellow subjects, Rachel, Leon, Piper and Yahiko will be receiving both the virus and the vaccine in their medically isolated bubble. (There were more subjects – but these are the only ones that Neffy initially meets.) As Neffy is awakening after a few days after receiving the virus, news from the outside world worsens. Inside, “time has folded in on itself.” In her awakened state she learns that the clinical staff have vanished; media and the internet have failed; the streets around the facility are descending into violence. As hopes of rescue dwindle, Neffy learns that she alone might have had both the infection and the antidote, with the immunity that recovery confers. What will this mean?And…Where is everybody else? And what is this “revisiting” technology that Leon has created and how does it play into the story?And why does Neffy write to an octopus throughout the story? Is the author trying to make a point about the use and abuse of scientific innovation? Or the use of laboratory octopuses? There is definitely a tension felt about what happens/could happen to humanity when there is a lockdown. This tension permeates throughout the book. The darkness, eeriness, almost dystopian world is thrust upon us as we continue to read. Especially as the group finds their way out of the clinic, and through London.The ending feels rushed and unexplained and flat. What happened?

This is only her second standalone novel. Elinor White is very much her own woman, but she can be considered just as interesting as Maisie. Like Maisie Dodds novels, The White Lady is full of historical realism of life in Britain during and between the 20th century’s two world wars. What may be different from Maisie Dodds novels, is that it does not have the feel of a cozy mystery. It is darker and more haunting. We learn that Elinor was a child saboteur in Belgium during WWI. Her family was part of a Belgian resistance group working to undermine the German army after its invasion of Belgium in 1914. She learns to shoot at 12, at 14 she protects her sister from a violent act against her. After that, she and her family escape to England. When we first meet her, it’s 1947, and she is 40-something living in a small English village. No one knows her history of what happened with her during the war. In some respects, not even Elinor. All that will eventually be revealed to readers.Elinor befriends Jim, Rose and Susie Mackie. They are under threat from Jim’s grandfather who runs a major crime family in London. When Elinor witnesses an attack on Rose by the family, she decides to make this family her mission. As readers, we will learn eventually why this will be important to her. There are dark scenes within this book that are difficult to read – it shows the realities perpetrated by war, the dark side of post-World War II Britain, the years of austerity and shortages and the criminal element that came back from the war with bad intentions. As readers, we will see…what war has done…The addictions to drugs. The violence. The gangs. Elinor’s single-handed battle against one particular coldblooded gang is tied to this novel’s timely theme: how men have always underestimated women and how women have used that to their advantage. She’s unseen by men because she’s “a woman of a certain age rendered invisible by her vintage.” This book was…A Difficult read for me on some levels, because the underlying themes of war and the various issues that were brought out that I will list below as trigger warnings.

They have no time to eat properly. She also fails to thrive until a takeaway leaflet for Clement Street Soup and Sourdough flops through the door of the flat she’s hardly ever in. She falls in love with the food. But then…A visa issues means the brothers behind Soup and Sourdough must leave. Before departing they give Lois the “starter” for the sourdough bread. Because she was their “number one eater” they want her to feed it and nurture it.She wants to honor their wishes – even though she isn’t sure how. So, through trial and error and internet research, Lois seeks to recreate the staple. Little does she know that eventually this will turn in to her entrée to the high-end cafes and farmers’ markets of Silicon Valley. Sloan uses food as the centerpiece of a tricky but intoxicating exchange about authenticity and ownership, and about taking and sharing: What, exactly, is culture? And how should society best appreciate it? The book is similarly open-ended and insightful about culture’s fraught relationship with technology.

Book 2 is already out, but it took my local library forever to get me this one. So let us begin the .Judith Potts is a 77-year-old independent, whisky drinking, retired puzzle making woman who enjoys swimming naked in the Thames. As it so happens one evening while out for her naked swim, she witnesses the murder of her neighbor. She doesn’t see who did it, but she definitely heard it. She decides to investigate on her own. Especially when the police pull up and leave just as quickly and find nothing. Upon her own snooping around, she finds her neighbor dead at the edge of the garden, slightly submerged in the water. This leads her to continue into the investigation as to why would anybody want to kill her nice neighbor. As she goes on this hunt for clues, she fixates on who the killer must be. She adds Becks, the wife of the local vicar and Suzie, the dog walker, of another murder victim, to her team of investigators. Now they become the Marlow Murder Club. And then…Because there is a third murder, Judith is convinced this “serial killer” is going to come for her. Why?Who is this person and why is he or she killing these nice people in Marlow?And then…Judith gets too close to figuring out who the killer is, and they do actually decide to come after her. On a dark and stormy night! (Cue thunder and lightning!) Will the Marlow Murder Club and police be able to save Judith in time?This little cozy is fun and annoying but…It was just as brilliant and twisted, too. If readers thought they knew who did it, well think again.

It just didn’t seem necessary to have to put readers through this.And then…The climax we were waiting for, doesn’t necessarily happen.

We learn that he had invented a program called “Own your Unconscious” which reshaped human culture. Egan explains to readers that this program does the following:“By uploading all or part of your externalized memory to an online ‘collective,’ you gained proportionate access to the anonymous thoughts and memories of everyone in the world, living or dead, who had done the same.” A parody of social media?And that’s the end of Bix. It’s like the rest of the stories leap forward into other forms and themes and characters as chapters progress. I find myself confused and disillusioned by all the noise. The only thing that feels genuine is Bix’s 28-year-old son who we see toward the end of the book who rejects his father’s work. As a struggling fiction writer he rejects social media and prefers a good old-fashioned “ancient” book. That’s me. Give me a good old-fashioned print book any day.

So, coming in to this new town experience, will these 3 big challenges be met for her?As it so happens, her first day, moving day, finds her wandering around to a nearby park and seeing a couple of girls playing softball who happen to be struggling because one doesn’t do well at pitching. When Liv offers to pitch, it begins to help her ease into taking care of challenge #1 – friendships with Becky and Charlotte – who just happen to be part of the local softball team and her new school.

Why?A desperate woman and wife harboring secrets, she has to know if she can trust her serial cheater husband Craig when the going gets perilous. What will he do if faced with an “or else” ultimatum?

How could I read such a personal story as this one, and be prepared to give it an honest ? Would I be able to be thoughtful, generous, sensitive, or understanding? How do you rate someone’s personal life? There was so much to take in hearing both P.O.V. Especially with his father sharing his diagnosis of bipolar disorder and early dementia based on inherited genes right from the beginning. (Of course, the cover of the book – is a great give-away, as well!) Lukas is also very open with his early reflections of what he saw of today’s world and what his father fought for, and how disappointed he felt his father would be, living in today’s world. This seemed important for him to talk about these views early on, because of all the things his father cared for – and all that Lukas saw in today’s world that didn’t coincide with his father’s philosophies. As I read the pages, I wanted to reach out and say to Lukas… “I hear you. I see you. I feel you. I understand.” I wanted to cheer for both of them. Their writing felt beautiful and gorgeous and heart-felt. This was an emotional read (for me). I could feel so much from their experience of living within the confines of bipolar disease. How does one fight with their mind day in and day out? And how does one witness on the other end the struggles of someone you love?As I continued to read, I felt such a connection to this family. As readers…We continue along through the corresponding chapters between father and son – the son’s chapters are the ones titled Reflections. The father, Lowell, is sharing his growing up years, to college and beyond, and as we read, we are witnessing his progressive decline in his “health.” He doesn’t know exactly at the time what is happening with him – but, we already know, of course – he told us at the beginning of the book. Still…It is compelling to listen to his story. To share in his observations of his self-story. And of course, to listen to his son’s heart-felt reflections. To share his own story of growing up with a loving father and mother, and the adventures he and his brother experienced growing up in a life filled with love and adventures and travel and of course, challenges to be understood. (Father:) The traumas to live through. The activism that defined him. The education that stimulated him. And what could hopefully and eventually stabilize him. (Lukas:) His reflections bring to light so much of how his father influenced him. His mother. Their family. Their life. And the cause and effect of his own struggles. And his life learning lessons. “To keep moving forward, we have to let purpose lead the way.”The love is loud and clear between these pages. And for anyone who needs to understand bipolar disorder – or even what it takes to be there for someone in need of support – come here. Take a look at what this family was able to do. At the end there are some more words, poetry and pictures. A beautiful book. A spectacular reading experience.

It is a story of one man and one family. But…It is also the story of what happened to America in the second half of the 20th century. The author addresses real and imagined conspiracies to the media’s Heisenberg effect (an interviewing process where the interviewees tend to give answers they think the interviewer wants to hear) to the threat of terrorism and random violence. As a writer, he showcases his ability to be shrewd and absurdly comic and brilliant about the vignettes of American life. He also shows the chilly and sociological effect. Sometimes there are laugh out loud moments. He makes us readers want to probe beneath the surface of his characters’ lives; his hero’s chronic alienation is even given a history and a source. The author has a way of rattling our emotions by taking us inside the character’s lives as if we are inside the story, as well. The story opens with a breathtaking passage that seamlessly captures the experience of 35,000 people watching the classic October 3, 1951 ballgame in which the Giants beat the Dodgers to win the pennant race. It is the same day that America learned the Soviet Union had exploded an atomic bomb, the day the cold war took a deadly new turn. These are two completely different events but they will impact the characters and the story over the years and decades. As readers we will be introduced to a cast of baseball fanatics, conspiracy nuts, hustlers, con men, scientists, businessmen, school children, graffiti artists and nurses, to name a few. We will also recognize a few real people’s names, too. Cutting back and forth in time between a multitude of plot lines, DeLillo creates a rich narrative that keeps readers engaged. As readers, we feel right in the middle of it all. How can I best describe this piece of work?Dazzling. Should I create a new shelf?

Some armed with guns, stun guns, knives, batons, baseball bats, axes, and chemical sprays!And I am not talking about a scene from a movie!On January 6, 2021 we weren’t attacked by outside forces, but it was a unique attack on the United States of America – on our own Capitol by American citizens determined to overturn a free and fair election. What was worst, was this attack was provoked by the then 45th President of the United States of America. My husband and I were riveted to our television screens. We couldn’t believe our eyes. What was going on? Was this real? Even then not all was being revealed to us. It wasn’t until the January 6th Commission came together that we would see the truth of what this man inspired amongst his followers. A cult following of misguided individuals believing his election was stolen from him and thus asking these same persons to march on the Capitol and disrupt the process of the election proceedings. But it wasn’t a peaceful march. It was an attack. People were maimed, hurt, trampled, and forever changed. And those people that were attacked – were law enforcement – good people, public servants, that were protecting the Capitol. The aftermath of what occurred to many, will be remembered. Congressman Adam Schiff shares in the foreword, “That Donald Trump was willing to so baldly lie about a matter at the heart of our democracy – whether the American people could rely on the results of a presidential election to ensure the peaceful transfer of power – now seems self-evident, even unremarkable, when we consider the violent attack on the Capitol…” For weeks, the American public was given the opportunity to watch the proceedings live on television. The Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States of America spent over 18 months working with a committee staff interviewing hundreds of witnesses and compiling thousands of documents to come together with a report to create a conclusion that would hopefully shock the country in to recognizing that what this one President did was unconscionable. Mostly, it was a reminder of what it means when anybody who decides to run for office, they put their hand on their respective bibles, and they take that oath, and swear by the oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States of America. When that oath is not upheld what should happen to the individual who has not done so? In her foreword, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, shared, “The Select Committee…has succeeded in bringing clarity and demonstrating with painstaking detail the fragility of our Democracy.” Bennie G. Thompson, Chairman, shared in his foreword, “When I think back…I am frightened about the peril our democracy faced. …I also think about why the rioters were there. The rioters were inside the halls of Congress because …the then-President of the United States, told them to attack. Donald Trump summoned that mob…They put our democracy to the test. Trump’s mob came dangerously close. Courageous law enforcement officers put their lives on the line for hours while Trump sat in the WH, refusing to tell rioters to go home, while watching the assault on our republic unfold live on television. When it was clear the insurrection would fail, Trump finally called off the mob telling them “We love you.” Afterward, Congress was able to return to this Capitol Building and finish the job of counting the Electoral College votes and certifying the election. But who knows what would have happened if Trump’s mob had succeeded in stopping us from doing our job?”There was much more the Chairman said in his foreword that needed to be heard, but there is something else he shared that really stood out. Even today, we should be concerned as a nation – as a democracy to even consider that this person should ever be allowed near our Oval Office again. He said…“There are people who want to take America backward, not toward some imagined prior greatness, but toward repression. These are people who want to roll back what we’ve accomplished. …Our country has come too far to allow a defeated President to turn himself into a successful tyrant by upending our democratic institutions, fomenting violence, and as I saw it, opening the door to those in our country whose hatred and bigotry threaten equality and justice for all Americans.” Vice Chair Liz Cheney who probably became the most famous for being beaten back by her Republican peers, still held her head high in her beliefs and patriotism. She shared in her foreword, “From the beginning, Donald Trump’s fraud allegations were concocted nonsense, designed to prey upon the patriotism of millions of men and women who love our country… (Describing Trump’s unwillingness to stop the attack on the Capitol) In addition to being unlawful, as described in this report, this was an utter moral failure – and a clear dereliction of duty. …No man who would behave that way at that moment in time can ever serve in any position of authority in our nation again. He is unfit for any office.” LA Times writer, Miles Taylor interviewed, Former Republican congressman Reid Ribble on July 9, this year. Ribble told him of a recent test that he did. Ribble was a founder of the Tea Party movement, though he was disillusioned by Trump. Speaking to a group of several hundred churchgoers in Wisconsin, he decided to poll the congregation.“How many of you believe the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump?” Ribble asked.A sea of hands went up. It was almost the entire room. Ribble disguised his shock by shifting to a second question, which he hoped would cause most of the hands to go down.“And how many of you believe Donald Trump is still the rightful president of the United States?”Some hands dropped, but roughly half of the room kept their arms in the air. It was worse than he had realized.“Populism — in almost all of its historical iterations — tends toward authoritarianism,” Ribble told Taylor. He continued, “The test with the congregation reminded him of another dark period in history: pre-Nazi Germany. In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler rose to power on a Big Lie. He alleged that Germany had been on the path to victory in World War I, but that its leaders surrendered prematurely. Victory was seized from Germans by corrupt politicians, Hitler said. The people had been “stabbed in the back.”In reality, the German military had been defeated and the country had no hope of winning the war; nevertheless, millions believed Hitler’s lie amid the harsh conditions of postwar life, from political gridlock to inflation. Anxious Germans welcomed the rise of a disruptor who could upend the institutions they believed had failed them, paving the way for Nazism. “He created a whole class of victims,” Ribble said, “and then he told them he would vanquish the villain.”Taylor concludes that Ribble worries Trump’s lies have created an opening for another dangerous leader to rise — or for Trump’s return to the Oval Office. And that the untruths have created an angry and restless electorate.Let’s consider this…What Ribble shares is being stated in 2023, 2 years after what occurred at the Capitol. People continue to follow 45 like a cult revering a religious god-like leader.And Vice Chair Liz Cheney said that Trump was “unfit for any office.” So why aren’t people seeing this truth? What the January 6th Commission Report shares should concern All Americans. The January 6th Commission report, all 814 pages includes: the Foreword; Executive Summary; the Narrative – The Chapters: The Big Lie, The I Just Want to Find 11,780 Votes, The Fake Electors and The President of the Senate Strategy, Just Call It Corrupt and Leave the Rest to Me, A Coup in Search of a Legal Theory, Be There Will Be Wild, 187 Minutes of Dereliction, Analysis of the Attack; The Recommendations; and, the Appendices. The recommendations include criminal referrals to the Department of Justice (DOJ) which are justified. It is hoped, at least by this reader, that eventually the DOJ will bring charges against Trump. And that he will be convicted. The evidence is clearly here.Obviously, this is not a book one reads cover to cover. It is a tremendous resource for the DOJ. The televised hearings if you watched them were riveting, compelling and well-produced. This is a well-documented report of the work of that committee.No matter what side of the fence you were on, what happened that day, should never have happened. It should never happen again. And the only way to stop it, is to make sure he never happens again. Or anyone of his kind.Update: It is fitting to note that on August 1, 2023, as shared by The Washington Post columnist, Jennifer Rubin, “a federal grand jury indicted former president Donald Trump for his role in the 2021 Capitol insurrection. Those concerned with the fate of our democracy should appreciate the magnitude of the charges laid out in the indictment. All Americans should savor a sense of relief that the Justice Department is seeking to hold everyone involved in the coup plot accountable under the law.” Special Counsel Jack Smith defended the rule of law and in many respects made history today with this inditement. Jennifer Rubin goes on to share: “Trump is charged under Title 18, Section 371, conspiracy to defraud the United States; Section 1512, obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding; and Section 241, conspiracy to “to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person … in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States.” Six co-conspirators were not named but they appear to include former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark and attorneys John Eastman, Sidney Powell, Kenneth Cheseboro and Rudy Giuliani, who assisted in the phony elector scheme. The sixth is described as a political consultant. Smith identified seven states in which the fake elector scheme operated.”In another The Washington Post article on August 1, 2023, journalist Rachel Weiner, shared that:“Conspiracy to defraud the government is punishable by up to five years in prison. Conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding and obstructing an official proceeding are both punishable by up to 20 years in prison. The civil rights law carries a sentence of up to ten years in prison — unless a person was killed, in which case the maximum punishment is the death penalty. Prosecutors are not arguing that Trump’s actions led to any of the deaths that occurred during or after the Jan. 6 attack.”The question becomes, will justice be served? Will the people who support him finally wake up and see him for who he really is? Bottom line the Jan. 6 committee made this week’s jaw-dropping developments possible.

The action is split between England and Italy, and raises questions about national character – the possibility of personal connection across social differences. This is something that occupied the author throughout his writing career. The action of the novel begins at a train station, as Lilia says her goodbyes before embarking on a trip to Italy. She is a rather frivolous woman, a widow, who since her husband Charles death, has been living with his family. Her mother-in-law, Mrs. Herriton, and her two children, Philip and Harriet, have supervised Lilia closely to assure that she does not do anything to disgrace the family. However, they have allowed her this Italian journey in the hope that this experience will “civilize” her.

It was also a winner of the 1979 National Book Award. I was attracted to the book cover, and the idea of it, that made me want to explore reading it. This book is a true accounting of a wildlife research trek into the Himalayas. In many ways it reads like a novel. It is rich with sensory detail – capturing the sights, tastes, smells, sounds and textures of the author’s journey, along with his observations and feelings of his experience. It is almost as if we have our backpack along with him and biologist, George Schaller, as they climb in the remote Dolpo region of the Tibetan Plateau to observe the blue sheep and solve the evolutionary mystery of their origins. But their true reason for being on this adventure is to capture a glimpse of the elusive snow leopard. His story is told through a series of journal entries from September 28-December 1, 1973. Although broken up into short segments, it doesn’t bode well to skim or read in snippets (although to be honest, I had a tendency to do this – skipping along – backing up – going forward – and back again, if I felt I missed an important detail.) It is a slow read. After all, even though I said it read like fiction, it is still not. There are a lot of biological facts and observations and insights about the conservation of Nepal. A lot of their exploration that year helped to establish the National Park that preserves the snow leopard territory. There is also an eco-spiritual aspect to the book. The author is grieving the loss of his wife during this trip. We can feel this loss, and we are a part of his meditative process. This sometimes colors his observations.

This is a story about family and how they pull together in a terrible crisis. It isn’t a romance, although romance surrounds this story. It is about a husband and his children and how they manage as their wife and her mother struggle as she lays lingering in a coma in a hospital after a tragic fall off a horse. And while Liam, the husband finds a hidden pillowcase of his wife Mike’s that reveals a lot about the first marriage of hers that she never talked about – including the identity of her husband and the father of the child that Liam has taken on as his own. As the family waits anxiously for her to come back from the coma, she seems to react to the name of her first husband, so Liam thinks that maybe bringing him into the picture might advance her healing. So Julian willingly comes back. Because you see, Julian, the ex-husband, is also a vain, spoiled, movie star, and he also remembers Kayla (that is what he called her) as the love of his life, that he let get away. Liam realizes bringing Julian back, might risk Liam’s marriage to Mike, if she eventually wakes up. He has always felt that she has kept something back from him – and now that he knows about Julian, he understands more about her first love.Liam is an unusual romance hero. He is more the steady and responsible guy. Whereas, Julian is supposedly the compelling and charismatic guy. But Liam has an enormous capacity for love. As readers we are rooting for him. As readers follow the back story, and recovery, we are uncertain whether we are that enamored with Mike. We recognize that she never fully committed herself to Liam because of her feelings for her first love, Julian. Even considering how he left her. But, the intention of the story is to watch the growth and change in all the characters. So…Did it work?Is it eventually a happily ever after? - and for whom? (No spoilers from me!)Cute. Been-here-before. We all know how it is going to end. Was there something that didn’t work?There was a silly plot device to have Julian’s character a movie star.

Stella has an extended memory and longs for a larger domain and a zoo. Ruby, a new baby elephant is plucked from the wild, and introduced in the Mall to learn tricks from Stella.

Thank goodness it wasn’t happening in today’s world! This just wouldn’t be the same story. This book is elegant and compulsively readable. The author takes readers from Nebraska’s farmland to New York’s Adirondacks in just 10 days. We revisit American myths with a mix of warm-hearted humor and occasional outbursts of violence and malevolence. The novel begins on June 12, 1954. We meet Emmett who is being dropped off at his foreclosed farm to pick up his 8-year-old brother, Billy. The driver, is the warden of the Kansas reformatory where he had been living the past few months. He was released early because of his father’s death. The kindly warden reminds Emmett that he has paid his debt to society and he has his whole life ahead of him. What the warden didn’t know, was that two fellow inmates had hitched a ride in his trunk and were now left at the farm along with Emmett and his brother – trouble-maker Duchess, and his hapless but sweet protégé, Woolly. (Interestingly enough, Woolly is the nephew of Wallace Wolcott from Rules of Civility.) One of the joys of reading this book, is wanting to know what led to these 3 being in the juvenile reformatory in the first place, and that also keeps us turning pages.

We worked successfully together to get a community pool in our neighborhood. And, Karen is also a local author whom I invited to be part of our Local Author’s series at our library when I was facilitating the program.She was also instrumental in teaching me the hand over heart breathe exercise to calm my racing anxiety, which can be found on page 19. In this book, she shares her own personal journey to finding 12 spiritual truths to starting over at any stage of our lives. Whether a person is experiencing a relationship break-up, a loss of a loved one or healing to deal with strong emotions, there is always an opportunity to address change in one’s life. Questions that Karen asks readers to consider:Do we have a broken heart and want to heal it?Do we wish we could feel better?Do we want to stop thinking about that person from our past?Once we face any questions that stop us from moving forward in our lives, we can at least take the steps to face where we have been and where we would like to go. One of the things I appreciated about Karen’s book was that it was part of my “tool chest” of self-discovery tools I needed to find a way forward for me – towards present moment living and self-awareness. And…How our thoughts shape our life. Thoughts have power. What power do we want to give our thoughts today? How do we choose to wrap up our past so that we can have it serve us – instead of overpowering us?So many healing lessons in this powerful book. There are 3 parts with 12 chapters. Part 1 – Master your body, heart and mindPart 2 – You are Not your pastPart 3 – Build Your Bright futureThis book is as if Karen is taking her life coaching expertise and presenting her experiences for readers into their homes and guiding them personally. She emanates a warm glow and a soft heart and a wonderful writing style that makes readers feel safe.

He doesn’t have much, but Maple, his black and white mutt, and a desire to put his words on a page for others to read – and a world to explore and see. His chance encounter with a literary giant gives him the insights he needs, along with more characters to open his world to more than he would ever expect. Who was Landon Cassidy? Where was he going to take us readers? Were we ready to appreciate his journey? As readers we are invited on this journey watching him interact with a variety of characters, while he explores, and discovers himself along the way. Landon seems to walk through life, an observer, sometimes as if he is looking from the outside in. And in the process, he meets people who help and guide and give and provide – kindness and friendship and support. And who doesn’t need that when we are trying to find our way? And, it doesn’t mean that he doesn’t give and learn from these experiences, too. And by the end of his journey, as readers we can see he has succeeded at his craft, still traveling light, and on his own. How did he get to this point?Alves’ words are fiercely descriptive…he opens with…“The sun casted a translucent fog over the fertile Texas hills. Bulbous and cobalt. Earthworms, flecked with dirt, drawn out by the inviting rains, writhed across the torrid pavement. Blue jays and blackbirds sang in dulcet notes…” As readers we could feel ourselves present within the story. Like the keyboard depicted on the cover of the book, Alves taps out his words throughout the story, challenging readers to ask Landon to break a smile, or cry a tear – because that is the time, we like him best. Like knowing how important his dog, Maple is to him. Even if it is just listening for Maple’s collar chime to know that it is time for Landon to leave his bed. Landon’s movements are always deliberate, and we are sometimes patient as we watch for them. This was a wonderful debut novel from a natural storyteller.

At one, I found this book that caught my attention because of its creative childlike print cover. I suppose her introduction also grabbed me as well when she shared her thoughts on Should and Must:“Consider the possibility that this book made its way into your hands because you wanted it to. Because a part of you has seen a crossroads in your life, and you’re ready for the journey ahead.” Hmmmm...How could she possibly know this? I wondered.At the time, I was on a journey.

And for anyone who understands that transformation period of being career-centered to just being retired, I think you know what I mean. What am I supposed to do with my time? – was a typical question I was asking myself. She said: “There are two paths in Life: Should and Must. We arrive at this crossroads over and over again. And every day, we get to choose.” She goes on to explain the difference between what should means and what must means:Should being the standards that are placed on us by others. Must can be – what we are born to do – where are passions lie. It really comes down to passion. Where does one’s passion lie?The book describes exercises that readers can do to explore the shoulds and musts. Since then, I have found myself in a very comfortable life. I enjoy present moment living. But at that time, I appreciated the opportunity to explore the questions that this book posed - because I was still figuring things out.

Live like there’s no tomorrow.”Author, Michael Robotham’s first 9 novels were focused on psychological suspense with his main character London policeman Vincent Ruiz and clinical psychologist Joe O’Loughlin, who suffers from Parkinson's. Robotham who lives in Sydney, Australia, shifts the location of this book to Texas, and has focused on a variety of desperate characters, who do not resemble anything like his fragile and introspective professor O’Loughlin. Having said that, his ability, as an author, to get under the character’s skin, makes this story very convincing and quite an exciting read. Premise: The story opens with the escape from prison of Audie Palmer on the day before he is due to be released. Palmer has been in prison for a decade for an armed robbery in which four people were killed, including two of his gang. The $7 million stolen in the robbery has never been recovered, and despite years of beatings, he has never spoken about it. Now he is on the run.Why?And why did he leave one day before he was to be released anyway? And not only are the police after him, an assortment of crooks are as well. But Palmer’s mission isn’t about the money. His mission is to save a life. Whose? And why?As the pursuers close in, the truth behind his escape becomes clearer. This book is…Action packed.

As humans we find ourselves so superior. And yes, we can be. But we lose sight of the givingness and gorgeousness of the natural world of animals. And what we can gain and learn from them.

Because it allows us to see animals as intelligent beings with inner lives and emotions – even personalities. And those of us who have domestic pets, probably already know this. But what about those that are in the wild, fending for themselves?Safina is an ecologist. In this book, he delves into the inner worlds through 4 parts – elephants, wolves, orcas and comparisons to other animals. He interviews biologists. He conducts field observations. He travels to Africa and Yellowstone National Park, and the Pacific coast between the United States and Canada. He talks to many specialists. He studies the behaviors and personalities of these animals. As an example, in the study of the wolves, he notes the different alpha males and females – some ruling their pack calmly, others tyrannically. And when human hunters kill, they cause collateral damage that reverberates down the social hierarchy breaking up and reshuffling packs, often costing more lives. Even killer whales know how to teach their young exceptional dietary specialization. They have cooperative hunting techniques and are intensely social, while mothers contribute to the survival of the children. Even grandchildren – well after menopause. Elephants and wolves even recognize each other well after separation. Most academics would not consider animals having an emotional capacity, but Safina believes these animals do. This may be controversial in nature. And the author realizes this. Even though this book may appear academic in nature, it is an exceptional read. Short chapters. Pictures. Notes.

Even hurt by the nastiness we see in the world each day. Sometimes we get tired and wonder how we can gather our energy again. And then we realize the importance of kindness. To ourselves. To each other. And…That words matter. This book reminds us of this. In her small, 124-page book, Forrest is able to convey her feelings about kindness, give examples of small acts of kindness that have changed lives, and convince the reader that, as she says, “kindness is a revolution whose time has come.” Forrest knows best, having come from a difficult background herself, experiencing personal cruelty and depression. Coming up from this in her life, she recognizes how important kindness is when we don’t expect it from others – but when we can offer it, instead. Each of the 13 chapters in this remarkable little book begins with a true story of kindness that either the author has experienced herself or has been made aware of by her readers, or those to whom she speaks, or mentors.Her stories work effectively to draw the reader in, then treat them to a lesson that always hits home. By the end of the book, it’s impossible not to see fellow human beings in a different light.In today’s world, kindness is not a concept often encountered. On any given day, we experience jealousy, harshness, disinterest and apathy. How often do we see random acts of kindness happen every day, in people’s lives? And, more importantly, how often do we take the initiative to create that kindness ourselves? Just maybe this little book could make readers ask themselves these questions and, want to start changing the world, one kind act at a time....more",Notes are private!,1,15,1,not set,"Jul 04, 2023","Jul 04, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/576371.A_Short_Course_in_Kindness

For those who haven’t been following this series, Letty is Lucas’ adopted daughter. Which leads me to recommend, that you might be better off following the series than cold-feet jumping into this one as a stand-alone. Letty Davenport currently works for a United States Senator who has gotten her a position as investigator for the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security. She is more than ready to move into this position and is now partnered with Rod Baxter an out-of-shape computer programmer that the NSA wants to insert into Ordinary People (OP), a hacker collective. Letty will act as his bodyguard. They have to drive from Florida to the OP base in CA to safely decrypt a Bitcoin wallet that the company stashed to protect from getting in the wrong hands. This is an interesting partnership of two opposites. Letty’s calm. Baxter’s fatalistic. But they both have a sense of humor, human decency and basic justice as their focus. Their patriotism anchors the complex story.Even if some of the slang might feel dated, modern innovations make up for it.  It is a fast-paced mystery that doesn’t shy away from current events. This may be uncomfortable for some – for others, they may see it as characters on a mission to do what they believe is right for their country. ...more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,not set,"Jul 04, 2023","Jul 04, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/61843534-dark-angel

Apparently, this is Book 1 of an intended series. The author is already well-known for her New York Times bestselling Books of Elsewhere series. This one is a story about friendship, magic, and the gray area between good and evil and will attract YA readers. Although, admittedly, as an adult, I had fun taking a peak between these pages, myself.Premise: This story is about 11-year old Van who wears hearing aids. While he may not always hear everything, he certainly sees everything. He is a keen observer, and notices little things that others overlook, like small, forgotten items that he secrets home to his imaginary world. His opera-singing mother is usually preoccupied with other things, so when Van comes across a strange girl stealing pennies from a fountain, he is naturally curious. Eventually his quest leads him to a hidden underground chambers where he follows the girl (who we learn is named Pebbles) to a room labeled The Collection. In this room he finds shelves filled with glass bottles which turn out to be captured wishes. Who would steal wishes?Why?Do they help make them come true?Or do they stop them from coming true?And what does Pebbles have to do with all of this? And now, how can Van suddenly be able to talk to animals?Things start to get more complicated when Van gets kidnapped by men from the underground chambers. For me to tell more, will just go into spoiler territory. Are wishes tied up with power, control and good or bad?And when Van finds out what Pebble’s big secret is, how will readers feel when the book closes.This story gives readers great characters, interesting world-building, lots of suspense, and leaves readers wanting more.

I have said so many times that children’s books not only have a story to tell, they have a lesson to teach. And so many times, they provide an opportunity for a busy parent to come together with their child for a read-together and read-aloud experience. It is interesting because when looking at this book at first, we can look at it not as a children’s book from a surface perspective, even though Edward Tulane is a toy rabbit. To describe him, he seems rather narcissistic, cold-hearted, and incapable of love. Not typical for a children’s rabbit toy. But something unspeakable happens to him, and life takes a dramatic turn (for him) and he meets many different people, who all need him – whether he likes it or not. If nothing else, we see the growth of this rabbit over time. And this is an incredible learning lesson to be taught. How he changes from the interactions he has, and from being left alone without a child, that makes a difference, too.With this book there are:Short chapters.Pictures at the start of each chapter and inside many of them.A straight storyline. This is a story of rabbit who gets lost and discovers love as he finds his way home. It is a great hero’s journey for Edward (the rabbit) who begins as a very proud, “rude” rabbit but gradually learns how to love and hope. There are contrasting relationships with Edward. It is fun to see and discuss how he makes Abilene happy and then Susanna and then Bull and Sarah Ruth/Bryce. Even with these different relationships, love is found in all of them. Trigger warnings: (Bryce and Sarah Ruth’s father is an alcoholic and hits Bryce. Edward’s face is smashed in the diner.) And with some of the darker themes, those who are reading this with their children or grandchildren or their students, will know how best to address any of these issues. I believe we can count on knowing that children can be resilient, and typically ask lots of questions. Overall, this story is quite lovely and I believe children will enjoy hearing about Edward’s adventures. I also think, readers/kids will most likely appreciate the deeper themes – like what is love? How do we love? Overcoming pride and selfishness. As an adult reader, I couldn’t help but feel touched by the characters. They seemed like actual, real, living people.

I read voraciously as a kid. A lot of times it was silly romances, because, well I was always looking for my Prince Charming. But I was also growing into a modern girl, one who had big ideas about becoming someone, and doing something big in this world. I was also fascinated by people. And mostly people who did bad things to other people. I never understood why humanity was so cruel to each other. I wanted to learn. I wanted to fix them, I guess. My Dad gave me this book as a gift, and I remember devouring it the minute I got it. I was fascinated with Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. And I have been a fan of the two in all the many versions, since. But the true genius is right between these pages. When Conan Doyle started writing about the private detective, Holmes was a self-proclaimed anomaly, something that didn’t really exist in our world or at any point in history. Although the detective novel may have been in the beginning stages. One of the most interesting facts, is that Conan Doyle didn’t think Sherlock Holmes was a worthwhile investment of his time. It is the reason he tried to end the series at different times. Remember when he killed him off the waterfall? (Oh no - did I just give away a spoiler?! - forgive me my dear GR friends! You know me, I don't typically do this...but...it was part of the point I was making about the author - so I apologize for this!)He was more interested in writing historical pieces, and about the after-life. (We won’t go there!)But people wanted Holmes, and he complied. Thank goodness!Another interesting fact is that those in academics considered Sherlock as a historical figure, as if he truly existed. It is done in jest, on some level, but it is a common convention which began quite early, because Dr. Watson, was publishing the exploits in periodicals as case notes. And that made people clamor for more. (Of course, we know that Dr. Watson was Conan Doyle's character, too.)About this book... It has 4 full length novels and 56 short stories about the colorful adventures of Sherlock Holmes and his side-kick Dr. Watson. The author, John Le Carre wrote in November 14, 2006, as he ed the 150th printing of this edition, “Dr. Watson doesn’t write to you, he talks to you, with Edwardian courtesy, across a glowing fire. His voice has no barriers or affections. It is clear, energetic and decent, the voice of a tweedy, no-nonsense colonial Britisher at ease with himself.” Ahhh.... you can feel that, right?For me the stories and novels are well-written. They appealed to my younger self. I was fascinated with Holmes ability to read people. And I wanted that skill-set. I decided early on that was going to be an important “ability” for me to have as a life skill. Focus on the small details. Look directly at people. Listen to them. Hear what they are not saying. And to be honest those skills have served me well. (Thank you Sherlock!) There are passages of beauty, moments of suspense, and many, many quotables. It is addicting. We as readers, are drawn in and become the detective, too. Holmes was a towering genius in so many ways. Dr. Watson gives the stability, where Holmes in his creativity is sometimes off kilter, but we love him, and we are always mesmerized by how he can solve cases. And…This was probably the only time I was not intimidated by 1,122 pages. I still have my copy of the book my Dad gave me.

In this story, they team up to investigate a murder which leads them to bringing a dangerous, group of vigilantes to justice. The vigilantes are bored, wealthy Americans, that are out to make their political points. Especially when it comes to targeting the worst of society – in their opinion. And, what makes it exceedingly difficult for law enforcement, is that their violent actions against these people are popular on social media. In many ways, this is a very contemporary story covering a lot of issues that are currently making waves/news…As an example.... The waning Covid pandemic, Bitcoin, and the ongoing division and animosity between conservatives and liberals in the United States political scene. All of this adds credible interest to the story. The story has some good twists and the antagonists (villians) are an appropriately objectionable bunch. The story is gripping in the right places, well-written, and hard to put down, once started.

This story follows main character Maisie as she celebrates Christmas by visiting her favorite cabin owned by her parents’ best friends. It is in Utah. She grew up with the two sons of the owners of the cabin, and at about age 13 she fell in love with the eldest brother, Andrew. At the start of the novel, she gets drunk on eggnog and makes out with younger brother Theo, which is unfortunately witnessed by Andrew. Things only get worse when the brother’s parents announce that they are going to sell the cabin. Devastated by her actions and losing her favorite tradition and place, Maisie gets a chance to do it all over again by asking the universe for a do-over.

Premise: Maggie’s life in London is far from what she ever expected or wanted for herself. Her father is suffering from advanced-stage Parkinson’s. She is taking care of him while her mother is spending most of her time in Ghana. Her brother lives his own life on the other side of town. When her mother returns from Ghana, Maggie sees this as her opportunity to live life in London. She finds a flat share and moves in with two other women. They go out, and then tragedy strikes. Maggie is forced to re-evaluate her life.As readers we are given the opportunity to be introduced to Ghana culture. Do I like the characters? Debatable. Still…There is Maggie. She is beautiful and I want the best for her. When she had the chance to be on her own – as readers we could feel her naivety and vulnerability. I wanted her to succeed, but I was also concerned in her approach to her newfound freedoms. Even the characters I didn’t care for (like Maggie’s mother), were well-developed with good backstories, which made the book believable. Having been a caregiver to my mother who also had a form of Parkinson’s (although she was in Assisted Living) I could relate to the pressures of that role for Maggie. I was upset that her brother and mother weren’t more engaged in the care and process. And I could also feel how it felt for me with my own family (since my brother and sister were also distant with our own Mother’s care {for obvious reasons} – both living out of state/country at the time.). Still having said all that…For the most part…The story was smart, funny, deeply affecting, dealing with themes of our time with humor and poignancy: from familial duty and racism, the complexity of love, and the life-saving power of friendship. Most importantly it explores what it feels like to be torn between two homes and cultures. Finally, it celebrates being able to find where we belong....more",Notes are private!,8,49,1,not set,"Jul 03, 2023","Jul 03, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60784605-maame

This is the first book in Baldacci’s John Puller series. John Puller is a combat veteran, who is in the U.S. Army’s Criminal Investigative Division. The book begins when a postal carrier in a rundown West Virginia coal town is trying to deliver a package, and instead stumbles onto a bloody crime scene. Yikes! The victims are an officer with the Defense Intelligence Agency, his wife and their 2 children. John Puller is assigned the case, and is told there is much interest “at the top.” This is the best book to start with Puller. You get all his background here, if you want to start the series. We also meet Samantha Cole, the detective-in-charge, who has her own family challenges, who will be working with Puller on this case. The investigation goes deep and wide, which keeps readers up way past their bedtime turning pages. Trigger warnings: there is a healthy dose of violent images in the way people meet their demise, and sprinklings of rude words.Any way you look at it, you can never go wrong with Baldacci. Another winning character and series to follow. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Jul 03, 2023","Jul 03, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11007587-zero-day

But I didn’t read it right away. I think I felt a bit sad about it. Or moody. Maybe that was it. I know that the title intrigued me, but I also knew it was another WWII story, and it was going to be emotional, and I needed to be in the right frame of mind for it, so I waited to be ready for it. I was right to wait. And now, I am bringing my  to Goodreads. Part of reading this historical memoir was realizing that once again there is a piece of history that we find ourselves being introduced to that we hadn’t realized. Or, overlooked. When the Germans launched their blitzkrieg conquest of France in 1940, they seized over 45% of the country. Much of the southern part of the country remained “unoccupied.” The Nazis in affect installed a subservient pro-German puppet regime. Their individual in charge was Marshall Phillipe Petain, a WWI military hero. We learn in Frenkel’s memoir how unprotected the Jews were under Petain’s regime in the spa resort city of Vichy. Prior to the Nazi “invasion” Frenkel and her Russian Jewish husband, Simon, opened a bookshop in the capital of Germany. It attracted a curiously mixed group of customers. French literary giants lectured in her store, until Hitler gained power in Germany. Despite official Nazi antisemitic policy, Frenkel’s store remained open even after the 1938 Kristallnacht pogrom. However, in August 1939, just before the start of WWII, she shuttered her bookstore and fled to her beloved Paris.She became a refugee again when the Germans occupied the French capital, so she escaped to the French Riviera. But then there was Petain’s police rounding up Jews. This book describes the terror, despair and fear she faced on the run. Mostly fear of betrayal. And then…She finally escaped to Switzerland. The story of her husband, who isn’t really mentioned, was actually murdered in Auschwitz in 1942, and most of her family living in Poland, including her mother, also was killed in the Holocaust. Hebrew: Af al pi chen (Nevertheless to the contrary and despite everything.) In the end, she returns to Nice where she was able to live out a quiet, unnoticed life until her death in 1975 at age 86. Although, I share just a timeline of tidbits of the direction her life took – it is a gripping story – worth exploring – for readers to actually read the details for themselves. The back of the book gives an excellent chronology of important events and a dossier (including documents and pictures) and explanations.This is truly a remarkable memoir providing eyewitness testimony of a neglected aspect of the Holocaust: Vichy France and the Jews....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Jul 03, 2023","Jul 03, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/49249849-a-bookshop-in-berlin

It is said that Wade chose the name of Viola to honor his grandmother whose heirlooms inspire his fiction.This book was part of that search I conducted through my local library for books about characters in bookstores or libraries. “Only I could gift myself hope.” Premise: Susan Norcross runs a popular bookstore in her tight-knit Michigan lakeside community. She was raised by her grandparents after her parent’s tragic accident. Now here she is at 40 facing Christmas without a partner. But this is different for her. Everyone knows that her grandmother and her mother married a man dressed as Santa, and it is supposed to be her destiny to do the same. So, when she meets someone at a Santa Run who appears to be the one, and they are supposed to meet after the run, but he doesn’t show up what happens to her destiny Santa man? Hope. Loss. Family.

That is my favorite genre. And what really started me down that path, was my love for Sherlock Holmes. So, when I found this book at another Little Free Library, I was instantly intrigued. I couldn’t help but wonder…“You mean, there was a real Sherlock Holmes?”Premise: The author looks at the life of Edward Oscar Heinrich, whose pioneering work in forensic science led him to be dubbed as the American Sherlock of the 1930s. She details some of his most famous cases and methods used to investigate them. He may have established many forensic techniques in his lifetime, but most, more than any, were quite flawed – still, he started something that established modern crime scene investigations. The author writes in a narrative style, drawing the reader in. Her storytelling flow keeps the book easy to read, especially as a non-fiction book. Although, there were times that the style was a bit distracting from the facts of the cases. The cases were the most interesting. This book begins and ends with one of Heinrich’s most famous cases about a man accused of killing his wife. The author takes the reader through the case and his methods. In the end, she leaves it to the reader to determine if the outcome was what it should have been. As readers, we encounter movie stars, priests, and a number of other fascinating cases. As readers, we are introduced to the beginning of forensic techniques that are still used by police today – including detector tests, fingerprint analysis and ballistics – and how they assist in cases. Readers also learn what methods are no longer reliable in forensics, such as handwriting analysis. As one who loves mysteries, and police procedurals, getting an insider view of early forensics fascinated me. Trigger alert: some case details could be off-putting to those who are a bit squeamish. ...more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,not set,"Jul 02, 2023","Jul 02, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/54734968-american-sherlock

It was actually released in 2008 as part of a special Black History Month program. It was a National Book Award finalist, and it won the Scott O’Dell award for Historical Fiction. I am now bringing my  to Goodreads. This story vividly portrays slave life in colonial New York. The author includes rich detail not found in the average history textbook. Issues such as having to suppress feelings, being ill-treated, never owning shoes that don’t pinch, and what it feels like to be branded. Yes, you heard me correctly…branding humans. The story is about teenaged Isabel and her 5-year-old sister Ruth who were under the impression that they would be freed upon the death of their owner. But recent Revolutionary upheavals in distant Boston prevent contact with the lawyer who drew up the will, and the girls are sold to a Loyalist couple, who take them to New York. Isabel is made a half pet, half page for the wife, Mrs. Lockton. While doing her duties, Isabel overhears Lockton’s friends plotting to kill George Washington. She is hoping that if she passes the information on to the Rebels, they may be grateful enough to assist in her freedom. Her information helps to foil the plot, but both sides view slaves as legal property. In her fight to get away, she is branded in the face. Worse yet, Ruth has been sold away from her. How can you not feel something when you read the following:“Melancholy held me hostage, and the bees built a hive of sadness in my soul.”What will become of Isabel? Will she find justice?Will she find her freedom?Will she be reunited with Ruth? Even though this is fiction, it is an absorbing read. The book was written for children/young adults, but any age group can appreciate it. It would make a good book group selection. An appendix at the end of the book gives insights into whether Isabel is based on a true person. And, apparently there is a sequel to Isabel’s story, called Forge which came out in 2010. ...more",Notes are private!,0,31,2,not setnot set,"Jul 02, 2023not set","Jul 02, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6948520-chains

It’s beautiful, right? As I understand it, it is a skyline picture of Tokyo in a deep blue with pink text. There is a feminine, delicate feeling to it. I almost wanted to pick the flowers. Premise: Mizuki seems to have it all. 2 perfect children. Devoted husband. Or is he? As we come to learn, he embodies a traditional sense of the world – so he sees his wife in a stereotypical way – she is his wife/servant. She has no purpose to him, other than to serve him. Which leads her to an affair with restauranteur Kiyoshi. While we explore this facet of Mizuki’s present life, we get a glimpse into her past – her study abroad in the U.S., her living with a rich white family, knowing what life is like outside the boundaries of Japanese society. We learn about her ambitions in her previous life, and how lonely she has become in her current life - her marriage.Morally, we as readers may find ourselves conflicted. We understand her unhappiness and why it would lead her to an affair. But is this the way to address her problems with her marriage? In many ways, this story is a character study. As readers we can look at the situation from a holistic approach. If we were the therapist, what would we be advising the characters to do?Would it have been easier if Kiyoshi and Mizuki’s relationship were platonic and it was just an emotional affair? Or would the fact that it is still happening outside the marriage still make it wrong? This is the author’s debut novel. The writing is beautiful, despite the moral dilemma we are having to read. Definitely a great discussion selection. ...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,Jul 2023,"Jul 01, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56304464-fault-lines

Being a short book, I began reading. I didn’t stop. I just closed the book, and I am feeling every moment of it. I want to talk about it with you. I would love to hear your thoughts below. Interestingly enough this book is meant for middle-school aged children. Premise: It is an attempt by parents to have the book, “The Adventurers” removed from a fifth-grade curriculum because of the ending sentence in the book, which one of the parents discovers. This sentence reads as follows:“At that moment Rick knew just how deeply he loved Oliver, and Oliver knew just how deeply he loved Rick, and the understanding of this moment would lead them to much of the happiness and adventure that came next.” This is a powerful and realistic book. It portrays the forces that battle to determine and control the novels and topics that some people feel are appropriate for young people to read, as opposed to trusting the wisdom of teachers. Those conflicts have always existed, but this author showcases the debate – between parents, students, the school board, and teacher. And even allows the “author” to bear witness to it all, as well. It exposes the pitfalls of championing a cause based on what is best for “others,” showing that such crusades tend to marginalize whole groups of people in the process. As readers, we see a far-fetched misinterpretation of how a few pages unleashes a town’s misunderstanding about and lack of acceptance of the LGBTQIA+ community. And, like many instances in real life, the young people of this story are the most measured, reasoned, accepting and helpful voices. Young voices should be part of the discussion. Their perspective is relevant. It resonates even more now, because they deserve to have the opportunity to be fully educated and not be denied the opportunity to learn. Mr. Howe (a character in the book), their teacher (who identified as gay), had the opportunity to speak at the school board meeting, and gave a very moving speech during his allotted 3 minutes. “Well. Let me be the first to say it tonight: There is nothing ‘inappropriate’ about being gay… There is nothing sinful about it. There is nothing to be ashamed of. There is nothing about being queer that deserves censorship rather than expression. Nothing. This should not be a matter of debate, because a person’s humanity should never be a matter of debate. Instead, it is a matter of the highest principle we can aspire to, which is equality. …In challenging a book, they (his parents) would have been trying to turn off a tap, when who I am is actually an ocean…But even if you pull all the queer books from our class, even if you could manage to somehow pull all the queer books from this town, I guarantee you, you will not stop us from being who we are. The worst damage you can do is to make the more vulnerable of us feel bad about it. But you cannot hold back the ocean. The ocean will not be contained in such a way.” (Page 146-147)In this book, the kids and teacher won over the town. But in towns across our nation, this is not what we are seeing happening. Books are being banned in such a way that even librarians and teachers have to get parent’s permission for what books can either be put in the libraries or taught in the classrooms. My personal thoughts…As a college educated individual, I also spent many years honing my craft at teaching. Beyond my Master’s degree, I also got a specialized certificate from Harvard University in Program Development to enhance my teaching experiences. I was proud of what I could bring to my classroom. I don’t know if I could ever live under the edicts of a DeSantis or parents suddenly questioning some of the Dr. Suess books, I was using to instill creativity in my students. Let alone the sensitive issues we were discussing from a peer counseling perspective. Books teach. This is a beautiful teaching book. And the message of trusting teachers, is a good one. (Bias intended.)Also…People need to be allowed to be who they are – and we should be allowed to read about them – at any age. So that we can appreciate and understand differences. We need to honor and embrace and accept each other. And the sooner we can do that – the sooner children can learn and grow and love themselves as they are....more",Notes are private!,0,56,1,not set,"Jun 30, 2023","Jun 30, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59447530-answers-in-the-pages

Since this is the same circumstance that happened to Callie’s mother years earlier, she doesn’t believe it was suicide. Something sinister is afoot and Callie is determined to discover what it is. Even as she pursues leads, her complicated emotions have her wondering if she is searching for closure for the teenage girl she used to be, who was scarred by her mother’s death. This is the author’s debut novel. As readers we can view it as a sensitive story of a reporter coming home to face her past, and hopefully lay it to rest. Only concern…Sometimes it felt like Callie was rushing too quickly to judgment, but the author seemed to use those moments to show her protagonist’s fallibility. Could this mean…Perhaps that is a sign that this might be an ongoing series? This might be fun to see another bookseller solving crimes. 3.5 stars. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Jun 30, 2023","Jun 30, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/66086944-smile-beach-murder

She has moved on, has friends, a business and the love of a wonderful man. But the appearance of Kelly and her son tears down the walls she has built around her heart. The child is her ex-husbands, and he is struggling with his mother’s death. Suspects pile up as to who could have killed his mother, Nora's ex-husband’s wife, who happened to be the affair that took her husband from her. More fingers point to Nora as the culprit. The problem is, most likely, Kelly’s son, knows who did it, but he has severe autism, and his only form of communication is through his origami creations. I had a hard time getting into the story. Here are some of the reasons why...I don’t think this is a true stand-alone. It appears that these are reoccurring characters. So, they have a history, and it was hard to follow. The author could have done better in bringing new readers in. There are also a lot of characters, and it was difficult keeping up with all of them. I’m not sure how I felt about a child being involved in a cozy mystery. In some ways, this one is supposed to feel justified, but it seemed a tactic that I wasn’t too comfortable experiencing as a reader. The evidence gathering wasn’t always clear to the reader and the suspects were a bit too easy to spot. The story was straightforward, but a bit slow at times.It might be better for readers to start at Book 1. Still…It didn’t leave the reader hanging, as there was resolution.The one thing I will say I enjoyed the most was the opening line of the story. “I loved this book.” I just wish I could say that it applied to this one. P.S. - I am not going to rate this book. I know I am an outlier about this book. The fact that I have not read the earlier books, I think has put me at a disadvantage for having more insights into the existing characters. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Jun 29, 2023","Jun 29, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61838490-paper-cuts

The novel begins months before Jane’s murder – a brutal stabbing is committed in their holiday cottage later that day. Police aren’t getting much help from guests because all the suspects were together dining and are each others alibis. The one suspect who has no alibi, is her new husband, William. But, forensic evidence seems to prove his innocence. The investigation seems stalled until one suspect, William’s ex-wife, Lucy decides to provoke a reaction on the part of the killer. Oh what a web we weave!The novel goes back and forth in time, mixing first person narration from Lucy, William’s ex-wife, with third person accounts of the past. A bit frustrating to follow. Even though it was executed well enough technically, it did not contribute much to the reading experience overall. Lucy comes across as the most complex and sympathetic character. She was given some interesting, harder edges. She is easy to sympathize with while being quite difficult to like, at the same time.Other characters are barely fleshed out – other than maybe Jane prior to her murder. Because of their lack of play in the novel overall, by the time we came to the end of the story, any revelations seemed unimportant, as to what role they may have played. As readers, we need to understand motivations, and this wasn’t fleshed out very well. Which brings me to the book’s solution…All the way through the book I thought there was going to be a twist ending – a magical reveal. The author didn’t go there – but…the actual explanation that is delivered isn’t a satisfying one, either…to this reader. That partly reflects that the killer’s identity, while not the one I presumed, is not a surprise either. The clues presented, just didn’t work for me – and it was a flimsy motivation for murder.

There were so many mixed s, and I have had so many hit and misses with this author, I was ready to give up. But Goodreads went down yesterday and after our walk with the corgis, I sat down and read. Premise: We meet up with Harriet, a conflict-avoidant surgical resident, and Wyn, a quick-witted charmer who dances through life. They share a close group of friends. And every year there is an annual getaway. But this year they have broken up – but they still decide to go, but they aren’t going to tell their friends they have broken up. So, they will just pretend they are together. Sigh. Hallmark Movie been-here-before drama. But…Are we as readers still rooting for them? Do we want this happily ever after? Oh…I wanted to really like this book a lot, I really did. I am a romantic at heart. But because the narrative relied heavily on the tensions of their fake dating and their shared past, the chemistry between them did not have time to mature and develop. And I found myself just so not in to them. Their witty banter just felt out of place. Their slow burn romance did not feel like something that had to be earned, and thus the happily ever after, while satisfying, did not feel as deserved. Sigh.The author uses a non-chronological structure that alternates between the Maine cottage set and present day and flashbacks to Harriet’s past labeling chapters accordingly – i.e., Real Life or Happy Place or Dark Place. It causes the pace of the book to suffer and the chemistry between Harriet and Wyn to be less convincing.Now having said all that – I will say, I enjoyed Harriet’s friends. Henry did a wonderful job of capturing the complicated, chaotic relationships between Cleo and Kimmy. She could have developed the relationship of Parth and Kimmy better.

You won’t find it anywhere, because it is out of print now. It was published in 1992 by Kendall/Hunt Publishing Co.The publisher came to me because they were impressed with the Orientation for New Students program that I established at the college I was teaching at in San Luis Obispo, CA. I had also created a one-day new student orientation program for students and parents that they would attend prior to the semester beginning each fall – called SLO Days, which was very popular. All my notes for the program that I used as part of this program and class that I helped to create, eventually became this book.The book was used in the classes, and taught by several other instructors over a period of several years, before the orientation program was transferred into the counseling division. The purpose of this book was to empower students to make the best possible use of their time at college. The intent was to provide them with a discovery process that involved learning about themselves, the college they were attending and its processes. (After all, even though the book was written to use at my own college, the publisher had intentions of selling it to other colleges, as well.) I always believed that empowerment leads individuals to personal responsibility taking and accountability, moving from an attitude of: “What do I have to do to pass this course?” to “How can I get the best possible education and experience for myself?” The subjects covered in the book included: transition to college; relationships with instructors; library and campus resources; learning styles; study and learning skills; time management; stress management & wellness; problem solving/decision making; assertive behavior; goal setting; values; cultural diversity; and, majors & careers. I also included evaluation and self-assessment tools to help students get a sense of where they were at, and where they would like to go – and to see how far they have come by the end of the experience (semester/book). The idea for the book was simply to help new and returning students adjust to college life. I thoroughly enjoyed this experience of writing, teaching, and experiencing students in this transformative stage of life. Of course, I will rate this a 5-star book.

Although you can read this as a stand-alone mystery, it is easier if you have read previous novels first, because these are continuing characters who grow over time. Premise: This is a Ruth Galloway mystery set in Little Walsingham, Norfolk. It is a town known for its deep roots in the Catholic past and the subsequent transition to the Church of England. It opens with Cathbad, the druid, and former Catholic, who is housesitting for a friend. When he emerges from the cottage one night, he sees a woman. At first, he believes he has a vision of the Virgin Mary. What he really saw was a young patient from a nearby recovery clinic – now dead – had been murdered. In the meantime, Ruth (a forensic anthropologist) hears from an old university friend, now a woman priest, who is also in Little Walsingham for a theological conference and wants to meet with her. She shares some threatening letters that have been written to her. With the young woman murdered, and Ruth’s friend under threat, Ruth, DCI Harry Nelson and Cathbad, reunite the team to seek the killer who is targeting these women. Griffith’s novels are usually good when they are immersed in lore, legend, ritual and history. And this one fits those categories. This is not a typical police procedural. Instead, you get more of Ruth’s and Harry’s thoughts as they contemplate what is going on and how they are reacting to the information they each are collecting in that moment. As readers, we can appreciate that they both are propelled by wanting to right wrongs and getting justice.Even as slow as the first half of the novel was in getting to the point, the last part of the book with the crime’s resolution makes it worth the read.

He is an ex-NYPD officer who was pushed off the force after being set up for rape and becomes a Private Investigator.

The first is the year 1958 in Havana during a time of political unrest in Cuba. Elissa Perez is the sheltered daughter of a wealthy sugar baron. Her life takes a fateful turn when she begins a passionate affair with a revolutionary named Pablo.The second is told from Elisa’s granddaughter Marisol’s POV when she travels to Cuba in 2017 to scatter her grandmother’s ashes. While there she experiences the current political climate and meets Luis with his own secrets. Even though it appears to be a romance novel, it seems more focused on pillow talk about Cuban politics from a generational perspective. An ongoing theme of the book is family loyalty and expectations. We also experience the hardships and experiences of leaving and staying in Cuba and/or adjusting to a new country. It is also obvious that the author has some strong passionate views about Castro that are felt through her characters. In this way you can feel the experience and terror of the hold of that government on the people. The author does a wonderful job of painting Havana with its flaws and natural beauty.

She moves in after the breakdown of her marriage. The cottage needs lots of TLC. While renovating it, she finds some letters that were dated from a century earlier. Love letters. It is through those letters that we are taken back into the second timeline of the story. This timeline is of Lady Alice, the letter writer. She was sent to the countryside in disgrace after speaking out about women’s suffrage, and Zach, the young gillie on the estate. (A gillie is a young man who attends to someone on the estate.)Theo is fascinated by these letters, and begins her investigation into finding out more about Lady Alice.

My husband, wondered where I disappeared to – well, not really, he knows he can always find me with my nose in a book, somewhere close by! Anyway, this book. Wow! Can I just say, that for a moment? Some books and stories will do that, where you walk in to a novel, and you think you know what is going on, and then, there is a twist, and a turn, and then…What? Did that really happen? You know when they call a book a psychological thriller? Well, this one is. It is engaging. It is unsettling. It is unusual. And yes, you have to suspend disbelief. And if you can, well get your popcorn ready and settle in for a strange read.I am not going to go into the premise because to tell anything of the plot will give away too many spoilers. I will say this though…There are some flaws in this storytelling, because the author withheld a lot before taking us to the ending. Her ending was the equivalent of someone jumping out from behind a door and yelling “surprise!” I remember shaking my head in that moment, and saying to myself… “What? Did that really happen?” (I know you already heard me say this, but now you know why I said it!)I read somewhere that the great mystery writer P.D. James was adamant that readers be allowed to figure out the truth for themselves. She said authors “should be deceptively cunning but fair” in their planting of clues. With her surprise ending, well…how far were we as readers to suspend disbelief? So, for this, I had to cut a star in half. Still, just because of that, I don’t want you to walk away from this book. This is an engaging, intricately plotted, well-constructed, super twisty, page-turner, suspense thriller. And if you aren’t a stickler for realism, this book is quite entertaining.

Before I go into the premise of this story, I want to share a brief comment on the author. I love his writing style. He shows great knowledge of what it seems to be a cop solving murders concerning valuable objects, such as rare books. Yet, on another level, the text and history of the books he is looking for (and the lives of the famous authors that are brought up in the books he is looking for) serve as both clues, red herrings, and solutions…which create creative twists to his stories. I admire the way he does this! Premise: Cliff Janeway has been tasked with finding a lost collection of books by famed explorer Richard Burton (no not the actor). In addition to the mystery of the collection, there is a murder to be solved. The author is brilliant at hiding the clues in plain sight and just waiting for the reader to connect the dots.

How will the author set up the story, playing fair with the reader without giving too much away – yet do everything possible to keep our attention?

They arrive at the end of December. Just before a blizzard cuts them off from the outside world. As the weather worsens, so does everybody’s mood. And then…Someone is murdered. Who did it?The plot description makes it sound like a whodunit. It was marketed as a thriller. But is it?The book is told in 5 POV’s. Over 2 time periods. The first 3 perspectives narrating the story is prior to the murder, and the latter two is telling the story in the murder’s immediate aftermath. The central issue with the book is that it goes to great lengths to hold back on the identity of the victim. Even though we are told early on that one of the guests died, Foley keeps the readers in the dark. It isn’t until half way through the book, that we find out the gender of the victim. Why?And in the final two chapters before the end, we find out who it is, but to be honest, by then, I figured out who it was – did you? So, is it really a mystery? There are clues and red herrings – but they don’t work well when you don’t know what mystery you are trying to solve. And the eventual reveal is simply that someone saw the crime committed. Sadly, the suspense only carries the story so far.Am I being too analytical here?The good news…yes, I will give it that…everything comes together in the last 50 pages.

It is now one of the most popular books in my Little Free Library Shed. On October 9, 2012, at just 15, Malala was shot in the head at point blank range while riding the bus home from school. She fortunately survived. This book shares her extraordinary journey from northern Pakistan to the halls of the United Nations in New York. By the age of 16 she had become a global symbol of peaceful protest, and the youngest-ever Nobel Peace Prize laureate. To consider what she and her family had to endure in the fight against global terrorism, and the right for girls’ education, is such a remarkable story of love and survival. I had been aware of her on the periphery of my own life, especially when she was being mocked by Trump. The audacity of the man, sickened me, considering all that she and her family traversed to fight for the rights of girls and women – and at the time, it seemed like something that would happen only in her country. To see so many rights being challenged here in the United States, happening now, is a travesty. Yet, what is shared in her book, gives us great insights into the type of person she is and the type of ruling circumstances she lived under – and what it takes for people to overcome it. Her story isn’t just about the political and social atmosphere – it also conveys life as a young girl – enjoying friends – thinking about the future – being with family. There is much to appreciate about the openness – honesty – hardships – and challenges she experienced in her young life. And for those reading (experiencing this) in book format, at the back there is a glossary of terms, and important events page on what was happening in Pakistan and Swat from August 14, 1947-July 12,2013 when Malala addressed the UN. In her notes, Malala writes as to why she has developed the Malala Fund https://malala.org.“My goal in writing this book was to raise my voice on behalf of the millions of girls around the world who are being denied the right to go to school and realize their potential. I hope my story will inspire girls to raise their voices and embrace the power within themselves, but my mission does not end there. My mission - our mission, demands that we act decisively to educate girls and empower them to change their lives and communities.” You can’t help but be in awe of her courage. And her continued willingness to support girls around the world. It is nice to know that since this book has been written she has gone on to graduate Oxford University.

So, as a reader we always feel like we are right in the middle of a government conspiracy. But reading something that is this old, gives us a moment to pause.

I first saw it as a story of a mouse who is born different from “others.” As he grows, he doesn’t develop an interest in typical mouse pursuits and is somewhat spurned by the mouse community. One day he hears music and follows it through the walls to find himself in the princess’ room. He is now hopelessly in love with the princess. When the mouse community hears about this, they condemn him to the dungeon, hoping he will be eaten by rats. (And this is the point I wonder – is this really a children’s story?)As the story progresses, we meet many interesting characters. Despereaux grows in strength and courage. As I mentioned, I wondered if such darkness could make this a children’s read on their own kind of story. But I also felt that about Harry Potter, too. There is a lot of psychological realism here. The actions of characters – they bring up some interesting talking points to address. Would it be better for parents/teachers to address it with kids?Darkness. Light. Good v. not so good.

She works as a sharecropper on the plantation where she was originally enslaved. She hasn’t seen her family in the last 10 years. She is then on the road with the plantation owner’s 2 teenage daughters from his mistress. During the journey they take shelter in a church with a wall full of newspaper clippings on it. The clippings are called “Lost Friends.” For 50 cents, a person can publish the details of their family member to get a hold of the “seeker” if anyone had information.

Or will they become victims of their own success, amassing wealth at the expense of continuing a legacy of helping humans escape reality using VR technology?With all that is going on with technology, and virtual reality, there is a sense of what are we (humans) in for here?

At times it feels uncomfortably specific in detail. But, if I am being realistic, that is what makes this book work. The characterization of Pat’s thoughts and emotions feel exceedingly real. After all, Pat portrays a unique 30-something guy who has just been sprung from “the bad place” by his mom and her legal team. And he is trying hard to reintegrate himself into the world. Now to complicate matters, the author introduces the character Tiffany as Pat’s female friend. Even though Pat is married, we come to learn he is estranged from his wife. Still, he is uncomfortable with Tiffany. She has her own issues. But, it makes for some interesting relationship dynamics.All in all, this is a strong book that tackles some tough issues. It is willing to portray mental health issues openly, but sensitively, as well as family and new relationship dynamics.

At the tiA couple of years ago, during the height of the pandemic, I attended a Zoom book discussion group on this book over a period of a few weeks. At the time we were discussing it, obviously it was a highly polarized ideological climate in the United States. George Floyd had just been killed and there were many demonstrations that had been taking place around the country. The author, who is white, wrote this book prior to any of these incidents, but she did write it after Trump had become President. Her book laid out how racism is the bedrock of American society and how she believed white Americans are holding it in place. Her term “white fragility” refers to the intense emotions, the defensive stance and the argumentation white people experience, take and utilize when confronted about the topic of racism. She provides many relevant examples which we discussed in our group – such as: A white man insisting that white people are being discriminated against because of affirmative action.Or a woman of color claiming a white woman is speaking over her.Other examples illustrated white fragility at a national level, such as the Black Lives Matter movement being contorted into ‘All Lives Matter’ by white people who feel threatened. Or... The anti-immigration policies of Trump’s administration. Her book skillfully walks readers through many elements of white fragility, as well as providing a history of racism and our assumptions. She shares,“If we cannot discuss these dynamics or see ourselves within them, we cannot stop participating in racism. The good/bad binary made it effectively impossible for the average white person to understand – much less interrupt – racism.” (page 72)The hardest part of the group experience was reflecting on gaining a window into the white supremacist society and movement. She feels we each have a responsibility in dismantling this movement brick-by-brick. Her point…We live in a broken system that holds up white supremacy and racism, and it is our job to work towards fixing it. Educating the populace is one answer. Voting is the other. This was not an easy read. And definitely not an easy discussion. But…we need to start somewhere.

As the reader, we want to know what happened in the past – what happened to the wife? – what will happen in the future? – how will the little girl survive her grief?

Because some of those other characters were truly mean-spirited.And when you get mad at characters, you know you are invested in what is happening within the story. Tyler says, “The question is – how do I live my life? Do I live my life as though it matters? That our relationship to God, to one another, to ourselves – matters.” And Tyler has his opportunity to give his best sermon when it matters, which allows the congregation to become their better selves. One of the things that Strout shares at the end of the book as a note is the following…“Through the telling of stories and the reading of stories, we have a chance to see something about ourselves and others that maybe we knew, but didn’t know we knew.

The novel explores a wide variety of themes, the most prominent concern is the tension between science and religion, particularly the Evangelical Christian background that seems to haunt her. She keeps a journal in her desk at work with entries addressed to God. As readers we find Gifty intelligent and self-aware, but unable to find resolution for her tension.

Realizing she needs meaning in her life, she sets off to Antarctica where she meets up with the science team and a baby penguin who needs her attention, where her life will be transformed. But there is more…She is reunited with an unknown grandson named Patrick, she has found before her trip. What will we learn about him? And Veronica’s past? And what can this trip do for them that will help change the outcome of both their lives?Patrick is somewhat a “lost soul” who is embittered by how his father (the one that Veronica gave up for adoption) left him and his mother. So, his initial meeting with his grandmother isn’t a good one. He wants to make up for it, but she has already left for Antarctica. As he attempts to find out more about her, he will discover diaries that give him insight into his grandmother and why he feels he must join her in Antarctica. As readers, it is at this point that we watch the relationship between grandmother and grandson build into something more.

Lucy is implicated for a murder that occurred in 1942 in Manzanar camp where 10,000 Japanese/Americans were interned following the bombing of Pearl Harbor.

She grew up in foster care and has been struggling to make ends meet. She doesn't always earn her money in the best way.

He seemed to know that espionage is a nasty business that attracts readers. And look how well he has done with his books being translated into film. But rarely has death been so central or so painful. And no doubt, at 89, this being his last book, he may have been thinking about his own legacy.Interestingly, his main character, only appears fleetingly and she is the one who is revealing her pending death - and yet it is central to the book. Is le Carre also being revealing about himself, too?Complicating matters is the presence of her alive husband who inserts himself into the life of the bookseller, Julian. (Remember? His character was the one that attracted me to the book in the first place.)Julian has moved to a quiet seaside town with dreams of opening a bookshop. By chance - or is it? There is a lot of anger amongst the characters. Lots of frustrations. Despair and frustration about barbarities committed in the name of geopolitical interests. It comes out through the characters.

I discovered the books after seeing the show.

He writes with warmth and insight about the tricky questions facing individuals in a post-war universe. His writing comes with a certain secular bent - should you express personal freedom or should certain desires be curtailed? Do you have ultimate responsibility to yourself or to society first? Is revenge for a crime ever forgivable? Who is best to mete out the most appropriate punishment? Runcie compares his writing to Father Brown or Inspector Morse with morals. If you are familiar with those two characters you know who I mean. I like the author's writing style. It is simple. He has an easy way of creating a sense of suspense.

Gratefully that is what the expectation was of my college professor at the time. I remember sitting with my fellow students reflecting on it. We each got to be in a group and talk about it and discuss the characters and motivations and such. But, back in those early days, I was a kid, what did I know? I was shy, mostly listened to the intellectuals in my group. Tried to make sense of it all. I wasn’t sure I could relate to Jean Valjean, an escaped convict. When this book was donated to my Little Free Library Shed, I was given another opportunity to revisit it. If anyone knows me, they know I abhor large books. This paperback was a Penguin Classics Deluxe edition. 1304 pages. The Notes started on page 1305 and went all the way to page 1416. I was intimidated. All these years later, I was still intimidated by this book.So, I made a pact. I said, “self, take your time.” So, I did. I took a year to re-read this book. And I read it in-between everything else. I finished it awhile ago. But I am now bringing my  to Goodreads.This is a tale of injustice, heroism and love. It follows Jean Valjean. As I mentioned earlier, he is an escaped convict who wants to leave his criminal past behind him. But that isn’t such an easy thing for him. Another man is arrested in his place, and his conscious eats away at him. There is much to digest about the interactions that take place for Jean, the people that enter his life. The poverty. The prostitution. The compelling and compassionate view of the early 19th century French society. Even the eve of the battle of Waterloo to the July Revolution of 1830. There is some humor. Kind of dark. But it is also a serious book. Consider the author’s book title – translation: The Miserables. Another character that is throughout the book is Police Inspector Javert who is in relentless pursuit of Jean. He is an interesting character – pitiless, amoral law enforcement. People go to the pit of jail for stealing bread to feed their hunger. We feel this tragedy throughout. But his character is well-drawn. And part of all of this that comes through in Hugo’s theme is the brutality of law without justice. The poor. The dispossessed. The miserables. All in all a powerful reading experience.

The author goes through great efforts to help readers understand unconscious bias (or explicit bias). Which could be defined as prejudice or unsupported judgments in favor of or against one thing, person or group as compared to another, in a way that is usually considered unfair. It helps to start with that definition so readers can see how she strives to focus on ending bias and what an uphill battle it is.This is a book that is deeply compassionate. It is a rigorous exploration of all the ways bias can limit our engagement with the world. It shows how our personal bias multiplies as a society to create barriers and unjust hierarchies. It is also a guide to liberating ourselves from bias. And, intuitively, we know it is not something that will happen overnight. This will be a lifelong journey that will take humility, curiosity and love.

I am now bringing my  to Goodreads.This truly is a beautiful story. A tribute to love and forgiveness. Premise: Ko Bo Bo is 12 and lives with his 80 year old uncle, U Ba, in Kalaw, Burma. He is a smart and perceptive boy. He can speak English, which sometimes gets him in trouble, because he does it better than his teachers. He also has a large scar on the left side of his face for which he has no idea how it came to be. He only sees his father once a year, and he never sees his mother. He doesn't understand any of this. So, he sets off on a journey to find out.The characters are beautifully drawn. The love and compassion between characters is felt deeply. The history of the country is felt and experienced through the story of the past that is shared. Small moments. Sweet moments.

Everyone was excited to hear her speak about what motivated her to write this novel, her love of history, her love of Shakespeare and the romance of it all. As a retired educator, Helen enjoyed the opportunity of augmenting her Masters Degree in English with the study of Shakespeare by traveling to both Stratford-upon-Avon, England as well as spending lots of hours at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C.

There is also a real feeling of #metoo in here with the ‘bad men list’ and the growing movement that encourages women to speak out about the sexual harassment they are experiencing. And then what happened for me as a reader?Something felt off for me. I wasn't sure what type of book it was supposed to be. It felt disjointed in many ways. Is it a legal thriller? A mystery?

She provides readers insights into her life, including how she is discriminated against as a person with limited abilities. Through her narration, readers hear how Melody’s disablement impacts her life.

As readers we want to love this journey for Melody, but one of the failures of Draper’s novel is the outdated language, concepts and ideas about her challenges that perpetuate throughout the story. For example, slurs such as ‘retarded’, ‘spazzed out’, and ‘idiot’ are text in the story and are never challenged in any way.

When she is sent to photograph the scene of a supposed suicide – who insists she was murdered – it opens up a difficult case for Rita that puts her on a path to complicated trouble.

If you have read anything about Orwell, (in my research I learned this), he was a disillusioned socialist, strongly opposed to communism - especially anything under Stalin. So it makes sense that his story was influenced by these global anxieties of the time. Still...how real does 1984 feel today? The true horror and genius of 1984 isn't so much the mass technological surveillance... (consider the evolution of CCTV that helps to solve crimes as they occur). Rather it is a cautionary tale showing glimpses of a grotesque society that exists in a near and future society. One in which technology exploits humanity as opposed to benefits humanity. Obviously it is doing so in the book.But, if we were discussing this book now and talking about it in today's world view, should we not be concerned? For example - how is technology being used to exploit humanity today?...i.e., Social media - fake information?The books message from the Ministry of Truth: War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery.

Sad because it brings up a topic that is far too common coming up amongst children – bullying.Why do kids bully? Understanding how and why a bully uses aggressive behavior is key to knowing how to handle a situation. But, to see it happen amongst children – they don’t always know how to defend themselves, or even talk about it. We can surmise sometimes that someone who is a bully might do it because they lack attention from a parent at home and so they lash out at others at school or at play. Or some other kinds of things could be happening to the bully kid – to cause them to lash out at others. Any way you look at it, looking at the picture of this little boy on the cover of this book, and feeling his sadness, made me feel sad, too. What makes me feel happy, is the ending. Premise: Justin is bullied by other kids. He is a very sad boy. He looks to a dream to take him away from his sadness. In the dream he is granted 3 wishes. An adventure ensues. And then…he wakes up. He is on his school bus where he is being bullied by the other kids. And then suddenly, there is another child that causes the bullies to be silenced. The child’s name, Irvino, is the same name as the “kid” who had been in Justin’s dream. What we can appreciate is Justin’s quiet introspection. He is shy. He is not assertive. He does not want to fight the bullies. But he does want a peaceful existence. And then there is Irvino, a new friend who comes to the “rescue” so to speak to show the “mean” kids that this is a boy that needs to be left alone. In a way, does Justin need another child to make this happen? Or can we just learn from the peacefulness of Justin’s non-action to appreciate that fighting and aggression is not necessary? That bullying others does not bring about anything good. At the same time, can we also consider that the one that is bullying might have other issues that need to be addressed? As I have said so many times – there is much that can be gained in a children’s book. This is a beautifully illustrated book, with much to be learned in these pages. This book should be in every school and every library.

The back-story could have been a genuinely interesting disappearing person mystery set during WWII when the central character, Maud, while still a child, lost her recently married sister, Sukey. The second level of the story is present day, in which Maud is concerned about the disappearance of her long time friend, Elizabeth. A key to the novel is that Maud confuses past and present because of her dementia - and that affects her investigation into Elizabeth's disappearance. Maud struggles to be heard and believed, and her determination to solve the double-faceted mystery can also be considered both moving and believable. What made this a difficult read for me was the credibility of Maud's narrative voice. A certain amount of suspension of disbelief. I felt was necessary here. What happens when there is an unreliable narrator? For me, I was distracted. I kept wondering what was credible. Would that make the mystery more suspenseful? I don't know. I don't believe the solution to the historical mystery would have stood alone as a whodunit, because we suspect the answer quite early in the novel. (I won't say who - it is a spoiler.) The ending also somewhat undermines the strong theme running through the storyline about the potential for people with dementia. My mother suffered from dementia in the last years of her life when I was taking care of her, and so, I am aware of the complexities of the disease. Maybe because of that, this one felt too personal for me? ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,Jun 2023,"Jun 01, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/24179216-elizabeth-is-missing

It is narrated by character Ruby Lennox born in 1952 - conceived in 1951. The plot alternates between chapters recounting significant events in Ruby's childhood during the 1950's and 1960's with extended ""footnotes"" about the earlier generations of her family told in non-chronological order. Atkinson is not a typical writer. She is quirky in her way - creating characters (and there is a large cast of them) exploring life around historical events - but told in ways, like this, that are unusual for the reader to read.

If you haven't read, the first book, you may be a little lost with this one. They are a bit connected.

This book picks up after Avery's testimony which had to do with the impeachment of President Stokes. If some of this story seems to mirror real life politics, don't be surprised. That is what I believe drives this author. In this book, Preston Davies, a clerk for a recently deceased federal judge, felt that his judge had been blackmailed. He is concerned and really feels Avery should look into it. She is a bit skeptical, until she witnesses Preston's murder. While details can enhance a story, it seemed to be an overkill in information. (And bodies.) I'm sure with Abram's vast political astuteness this would add to the authenticity of her setting and the characters she presents, but the pacing of the plot felt off. Unfortunately there were just too many characters to keep track of, and they didn't stand out from each other. In the end, the story had trouble holding my attention.

Yes, we as readers get to watch this dual investigation take place - because you see, Mrs. Murphy and Tucker talk. To each other. Of course, Harry can't hear them. But, we readers can.

In A Conversation with the author at the back of this book, when asked what inspired her to write this novel, she shares a story about one of her favorite movies, “The Philadelphia Story” with Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant. If you aren’t familiar with that story, Tracy Lord played by Katherine Hepburn, comes home to get married and finds her ex-husband C.K. Dexter Haven, played by Cary Grant living next door. Of course, just from this premise, you can see that he is going to meddle in her life, and create all sorts of havoc in her plans to marry again. For the author, she loved the “funny dialogue and the scandalous way the adults were always making bad choices.” Would this be how she would write this story? This is the story of Sam and her first love, Wyatt. After their devastating break-up as teenagers, Sam tries to build a life that would protect her from ever feeling that desperate or lost again. She has even avoided the summer home where the two fell in love and found a stable relationship with a doctor who lives by the rules. Then…Her parents convince them to come check out a potential wedding venue, and Sam finds herself colliding with the person she used to be…And…The man she used to love. Shall we do a quick recap here?So, let’s get this straight. We have a woman from NYC who goes home to her family’s summer house on Long Island only to run into the boy next door who used to be her great love…except she brought her fiancé with her.

He now lives a very privileged life with his twin sons and wife, Abby in Manhattan. The first 37 pages of the novel takes him back to Memphis, where he has the opportunity to clear the air with an old friend/colleague. Was Grisham trying to fill in the 15-year time gap since Mitch and Abby fled the town? And…Was it necessary to the overall story? Especially since there was no resolution to what occurred when he visited.We then see Mitch being sent to Rome to take the lead in a case involving a Turkish company, that is seeking payment for building a bridge in the Libyan desert. When Mitch assigns the London-based Scully associate, Giovanna to go on a fact-finding mission to the bridge, she is taken hostage with a demand for a $100 million in ransom.And…Now this book becomes a ""legal"" thriller, with Mitch having to outsmart the captors (to keep Giovanna alive) and find a way to pay the ransom. The book moves at a fast-pace, and sometimes it doesn’t feel like Grisham is giving readers an opportunity to breathe comfortably through each scene. Which makes this novel somewhat frenetic. Almost like searching for Waldo, where readers may ask…Where in the world is Mitch now?And wondering, when we do have a moment to catch our breath…Is it necessary to give readers the feeling that Mitch and Abby may be on the run again?What happened to Grisham’s writing? Do we really need all these dull details about plane tickets, car rides, and another delicious meal the characters are eating?I have been such a fan of Grisham, devouring each book I can read, especially since they are typically so generously donated to my Little Free Library Shed.But…This one, even though I couldn’t wait to read it, I wish he hadn’t written it.For a much better Grisham, see my  of “The Firm” here: https://www.goodreads.com//show......more",Notes are private!,42,123,1,"Dec 07, 2023","Dec 11, 2023","May 23, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/123285511-the-exchange

The premise is that actress Kitty Karr (Tate) passes away and wills her fortuned estate to the Black St. John sisters. The world is confused. Why would a famous “white” actress do so? Elise St. John is one of three sisters who have been rich and famous since birth because of their parents’ talents. Now she is nominated for an Oscar, but she isn’t sure what she wants. To complicate matters, her neighbor and friend Kitty Karr, has left her in charge of settling her estate.

This story takes place in two different eras and goes back and forth between the two. Erratically and uncomfortably.

There were multiple POV that could have been told in chronological order. Some characters were introduced, and yet we spent no time understanding who they were or why they were important to Kitty. The pacing of the story felt off. What could have worked better: The books portrait of colorism, racism, and life lived in segregated America was compelling. It captured the horrors of racism, the tight bonds that tie us generationally, the nightmare that colorism causes in the Black community.

I kept re-reading the first several pages over and over as if I had been daydreaming and just couldn’t find my vision correctly. And then I finally moved on and found my way. The basic story starts with 18-year-old Ginny with a brother she adores and a circle of friends whom she would do anything for until one terrible night she loses them all to a school gym fire set by someone. The town believes Daniel was responsible for the fire, but Ginny makes a shattering discovery that casts blame on the person she trusts most in the world. Over the next two decades Ginny puts aside her wanderlust and her dreams. We watch as her life seems to pass by until old lies and hard truths and good friends help her to regain herself. Some of the book is written in journal passages from the past which at times helped give better insights into the various characters and how they all fit in with what actually happened to form Ginny’s present character. The story did a good job of pulling readers in. I’d Give Anything is ultimately a story of facing one’s past in order to face one’s future. As readers we will experience twists that bring old friends back together and tear others a part.

I am still learning how to record my books. This I started reading this book a while ago, and just recently put it in Goodreads as currently-reading. I am still learning how to record my books. This is one of those books, I read slowly – which isn’t typical me. It was an in-between book for me. Where I would read a bit of this one, and then move on to other books, before returning to this one and savor a little of it before coming back again. There was something unusual about this book where I just needed special time with it – to digest how I felt about what I had just read. Usually, my in-between books have been non-fiction historical novels or short story books. This was my first novel I have treated this way. If I were to try and describe this book simply it would be to share that it is a story about doors – where they lead, where they don’t, and how to open them. It’s also a story about stories – how they are interwoven with our lives, how we are motivated by them and shaped by them, and how the pursuit of our own stories shapes the choices available to us. The publisher’s synopsis that got me to get excited about this book was that ‘in the early 1900s, a young woman embarks on a fantastical journey of self-discovery after finding a mysterious book in this captivating and lyrical debut.’ Why wouldn’t I be intrigued about an adventure of a woman because of a book? Isn’t that why we are here on Goodreads – because of books? We love books. We devour them. We escape into them, hoping that it can give us insights into other lives – perhaps even our own. And of course, there is always something to learn from them. Books drive us. And this one, definitely intrigued me. This one is part historical fiction, part fantasy. In many ways, I believe readers will long for doors of their own (that escape I alluded to earlier) – why not seek an adventure here? January is our protagonist, and we see the novel through her eyes. She is employed by a wealthy benefactor (having no memory of her parents), who while he travels the globe, she resides in his mansion. After she finds this strange book, the novel progresses into a “book within a book” format where truths are revealed to January that she only thought she imagined.We grow to love January as a protagonist. She is opinionated, fierce, strong-willed, ahead of her time. The novel will provide layers of mysteries to unravel as readers get deeper into it – more doors – and worlds. The book will also touch on themes of classism, sexism and racism which further add to the readability – we can look at them as educable moments. But for the sensitive reader, please be aware. I want to compliment the author for her way with words. On the book cover she says she is an ex-historian with lots of opinions and excessive library fines. As a reader I loved her way with words. I was in awe of her ability to shape a sentence. One of my favorite quotes from this book sums up a lot about books, and this book, too: 'Those of you who are more than casually familiar with books -- those of you who spend your free afternoons in fusty bookshops, who offer furtive, kindly strokes along the spines of familiar titles -- understand that page riffling is an essential element in the process of introducing oneself to a new book. It isn't about reading the words; it's about reading the smell, which wafts from the pages in a cloud of dust and wood pulp. It might smell expensive and well bound, or it might smell of tissue-thin paper and blurred two-color prints, or of fifty years unread in the home of a tobacco-smoking old man. Books can smell of cheap thrills or painstaking scholarship, of literary weight or unsolved mysteries. This one smelled unlike any book I'd ever held. Cinnamon and coal smoke, catacombs and loam. Damp seaside evenings and sweat-slicked noontimes beneath palm fronds. It smelled as if it had been in the mail for longer than any one parcel could be, circling the world for years and accumulating layers of smells like a tramp wearing too many clothes. It smelled like adventure itself had been harvest in the wild, distilled to a fine wine, and splashed across each page. But I'm stumbling ahead of myself. Stories are supposed to be told in order, with beginnings and middles and ends. I'm not scholar, but I know that much.""This particular quote, I believe gives readers a feeling that is hard to put into words – a sense of nostalgia about books – about stories – about how we feel about them. Places we may have never been or stories we may have not read – or stories we long to read. That TBR pile sitting beside our bed? I think that once you pick up this book, you will see why I took my time with it. Maybe you will glide through it, because you couldn’t put it down. Still, even as glowing as I am sounding, there was one tiny off thing about the story – there are aspects of it that were predictable. Or familiar. I don’t want to say – because I don’t do spoilers.Still, I don’t think it affected my enjoyment of this story. To me, it still is a magical adventure, with much suspense, romance, and very lovely writing....more",Notes are private!,12,104,1,"May 20, 2023","May 22, 2023","May 20, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43521657-the-ten-thousand-doors-of-january

If your dream answer is yes, this book may make you think twice. It is the 1980’s. Gail is young. She is adventurous. She wants to join the circus. To become a trapeze artist. And through this story, we will not only see her realize her dream, we will gain a historical premise of how the trapeze came to be, and why she would want this as part of her life. This truly is a dream of flying. Not something to be taken lightly. And through her eyes we learn about the life behind the scenes of a circus, the domination of men, the communion of women and how they interact. This story is honest. It is raw. It is truly revealing. The detail into the life of circus people – what happens, how they live – how they behave towards each other, may not be easy to read, at times – but, it can also be spellbinding for those fascinated by something that is very different than the life we have known or lived. Gail, is also the book’s narrator, she is the one who shares with readers her curiosity about the circus, and makes us witness to its darkest truths. “The cages of the animals were called with food and feces,” Gail says. “The tux-clad prop guys now were in blue coveralls, and their unshaven faces and toothless smiles showed their true essence. I could barely stand to see this version, so I ran outside.” One er shared that they felt these sentences reflected “a metaphor for anyone who chases after a dream – be it a business, relationship, family, or bucket list goal – and must decide whether they will love it anyway.” In so many ways, we can’t help but wonder if the author is giving us glimpses into her younger self – showing her strengths, especially when…no spoilers from me.

They meet again at Goldman Sachs years later on the job. They are both smart and both opinionated.

I could see the stress of the world around them. This isn't a light romance novel. It is a serious look at relationships and differences and tackles the question of how much we can and should tolerate from our loved ones when it comes to their beliefs and actions. Also, the characters felt so real to me. They were so messy and didn't always do the right thing. They frustrated me at times. And they excited me, too. I could clearly feel the tension that Jess was experiencing as she questioned what to do with her Josh problem, especially when he decided to vote for you know who in the 2016 election.

Unfortunately, this is not the dream relationship she or we as readers were anticipating. What we as readers come to learn as well is that this is not a romance or love story. Adelaide, the character, is sweet, kind and a bit obsessive – and, a bit desperate. The story transitions between her past and present, providing some insights into her current behaviors, especially with scene 1 – the one we walk in to at the beginning of the story. Even so, Adelaide only had one speed, overdrive, in all things, especially drinking, partying and her determination to make Rory love her. And speaking of Rory, if she had been healthy (this will eventually be explained in the book), she would have recognized that he didn’t deserve her. Despite her shortcomings, or the issues that were eventually revealed, she was a likeable character. My problem with this story is that it shouldn’t have been set up (marketed) as a love story. It set up false expectations by doing so. There is an important message here about dysfunctional mental and emotional health masked by overachievement and charm. Readers (me) may not want to go there, if not being told this is what this story is all about. I believe, we deserve to know what kind of story we are really getting into when we choose it, and this one wasn't really what I thought it was going to be.

In late April this year, Matthew McConaughey decided to present a free program called The Art of Livin' through Facebook based a lot on what he brought up in his book.And... He wanted the community to catch more Greenlights, find their frequency and fill the gap between where they are and where they want to be in life. So...It was filled with high energy speak with lots of guest speakers (high powered Tony Robbins being one of them) talking about how everyone could get more for their lives. And...He believed that everyone has the potential to be better in this life - especially if they believed in themselves. What...I found interesting, was that his own book sales of Greenlights hit the top seller list again while this event was being promoted... and since.Still...

Even though success didn't come easily, navigating success when it came, was harder for him to understand how to enjoy.And... He would play any part, enjoy the journey, and fell into rom-coms until he decided he had enough of them. Even as we all swooned over him. (Well, I did.) Greenlights isn't just an autobiography, or a comedy or a series of adventures. McConaughey is giving us a picturesque view into his life. We see him in and out of his movies. He is essentially providing us readers to come along for a ride on the highway of life. Yes - those yellow and red lights may annoy us, but eventually they always turn green! Hence, the name of the book: Greenlights. Besides...His family, one of his greatest joys is his foundation, ""just keep living"" which helps at-risk high schoolers make ""healthier mind, body, and spirit choices."" So...The fact that he decided to go beyond his book, and bring his philosophy of living to a stage, for free, and now a program for minimal price, (where some of the proceeds feed children)...

It’s the most basic fact about human life — tied with birth, I guess — but it’s so startling too… A worldwide crescendo of grief, sustained day after day, and only one tiny note of it is mine,” the narrator writes. Edi is dying. Ash is her best friend. They have been for over 42 years. What is beautiful about this story is that the author achieved something that is difficult. She talks about death with humor. And we as readers can be present – albeit with Kleenex. Edi is now in hospice care near Ash, while her husband and young son are back home. Even as Ash’s personal life is a mess, we see the beauty and burden of caring for someone in their final moments while also showing the gift of Edi and Ash’s once-in-a-lifetime friendship. The author is also frank about the physical reality of cancer and explicitly shows how grueling it can be to care for a friend while watching them die – there are falls and tears, leaking tubes that soak Edi in bile, and gradual changes to Edi’s appearance and mental state as the end draws near. As Ash says, “It’s monstrous. It is too much to take. Why do we even do this – love anybody? Our dumb animal hearts.” But the author is also open and honest about the joy we feel and how it commingles with the grief and how happiness and gratitude can coexist with sorrow when she shares: “Life is just seesawing between the gorgeous and the menacing – like when you go for a run and one minute the whole neighborhood is lilacs in purple bloom, and then the next it’s stained boxer shorts and an inside-out latex glove.” Or in one final word…“And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make. -She made – and took – a lot of it.” This truly was a warm and remarkably funny book about death and caregiving that will make readers laugh through their tears.

And it appears obvious that this debut author is a fan of Meryl Streep, because this novel is a tribute to the actress’ talent. The story is told in several narrative voices and begins with Lolly, the matriarch. It continues throughout, back in forth between Isabel, June and Kat – two sisters and a cousin, all somewhat estranged, brought back together by innkeeper Lolly. Lolly has an announcement. Kat is already present, because as Lolly’s daughter she lives at the inn. Now the four women are back together with their own baggage, besides the sister’s luggage. And June has brought her son, Charlie. Each POV is shared in their own separate chapters. We have the opportunity to watch Meryl Streep movies, figure out how each character will glide through their personal dramas and allow the discussion to be sparked and communication to be opened between the women. Surprisingly (is it?), while watching each of the Meryl Streep movies that they begin to share their stories with each other. And the layers are peeled away and conversations lay open their lives for a sense of compassion between each other. In those moments, as readers we could feel empathy and hope for them.

She was everything to her, so much so, that she is still mourning her loss six months later.

Did she step back in time?Is this what her aunt meant when she said the apartment was magical?So now things start to get complicated for Clementine. She starts to realize she is having feelings about Iwan. But is he real – when he is 7 years ago – but in her present now only in her apartment? In the meantime, an up-and-coming chef by the name of James Ashton, approaches her company with a book proposal. Is this Iwan? Only 7 years older? He is so different than the one she is liking in the apartment she is enjoying who is 7 years younger. Yet, there is chemistry. What is happening here?I love magical realism with stories. It can play us readers in any way it chooses. And certainly, this is one way in which Clementine never knows when she opens the apartment door whether she will be drawn into the past or not with Iwan being present or not. It is a unique way of approaching a romance story – unpredictable and fresh. There is also more to the story to appreciate. Clementine is surrounded by wonderful friends, each with fully developed personalities.

The sNothing is as it seems. “Most other people are other people.” – Oscar Wilde.The story is a murder mystery with a strong psychological component. The story is about a professor’s murder in the late 1980’s. Twenty-five years later, a literary agent receives an intriguing manuscript called the Book of Mirrors which almost seems like a confession to the professor’s murder. What could this mean? There is one problem. Pages are missing. Not all the pages of the manuscript are provided! Is it possible that the author is confessing to a murder through his novel? What will this literary agent do to find the truth? Will this case finally be solved? What is this literary agent willing to do to get to the truth? The premise of the novel is interesting: a book sample is submitted to an agent, who gets hooked by what he finds. (Indeed, it was enough to make me read well into the night/morning.) The agent was so enthralled with it, he reaches out to the author, who unfortunately dies. Still, that doesn’t seem to stop the agent from being curious about the murder and the investigation – so he decides to investigate both. The first part of the novel is, comprised of the sample chapters submitted to the agent (a book within a book story). The second part is the perspective of the agent’s journalist friend who is hired to investigate. The third and final part of the novel is told from the perspective of the retired policeman who was on the original case. The story begins at a pace with near-relentless momentum. But there were flaws. The middle section felt muddled and slow. My attention waned. I found myself not really certain that I was going to believe who really killed the professor, or why, or if it mattered. I felt less interested and/or invested in the characters. By the end, I just wanted it to…well, end. 3.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,18,3,not setnot setnot set,"May 09, 2023not setnot set","May 09, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29905588-the-book-of-mirrors

I read this several years ago, but I am now bringing my  to Goodreads. Where do I begin? Do I talk about the friendship between the two couples of 35 years? Or do I talk about the love, or the order versus chaos, or the nature versus art, or the academia? I know, it sounds like this could be complete chaos. And yet it isn’t. It is so much more. When we think about the friendship between these couples we consider it a reflection about life, memory and art. It gives the book a complexity without detracting from it being an engaging story about interesting people. Or are they complicated people? Illness happens. Jobs are lost. Wars start. Dreams lost. (One wanted to write a book about one of the characters. Life imitating art?) Stegner seems like a realist in his own reflection as a writer telling this story. I wonder sometimes if he knows these people personally. (The characters he created.) Still, it seems like the unifying theme overall is the friendship. Even if there is underlying tension. So, even if this book was published back in 1988, it is such a classic, and could be read and taught today in college classrooms. (It probably is, right?!)

The Prologue opens with: “Nicole often wondered what happened to the body. A few months after she arrived in Lagos, a body appeared in the lagoon close to the compound, bobbing along on a blanket of trash, a bloated starfish face down in the river.” So at least in that moment, we know, it is not her. Yet, the heart of the story is her disappearance. She is a London woman married to a successful Nigerian man from a wealthy family. She has two delightful boys and she lives in luxury at her parents—in-law’s house in a wealthy Lagos suburb.The book is told from two perspectives. Her own story – up until she disappears, and that of her estranged aunt Claudine, who brought Nicole from Jamaica to London many years before. When Claudine finds that Nicole can’t be found, she decides to come to Nigeria and play detective herself to find her – under some very unreliable advice - “All I’ll say is people in Lagos are not what you think. Everyone is hiding behind a façade that matters more than the truth. We play our roles too well. . . . But we have a phrase: ‘Shine your eyes.’ Nothing here is what it seems.” Between Nicole’s story and Claudine’s story, there is some mystery to unravel. The question becomes for us as readers - do we care to get to the ending (which can be considered plausible), when some parts of this book are long and somewhat boring and predictable, and the characters, not always likable?This is a Good Morning America May Book Club Pick – and our Little Free Library Shed is one of 150 recipients from across the United States to win this debut author’s book.

Blind Goddess is the first book in Edgar-nominated Anne Holt's international bestselling mystery series featuring detective Hanne Wilhelmsen. This tale felt a little contrived.. from the immediate suspicions about the connections between important matters, to the convenient pieces of evidence that are suddenly discovered, to the behavior of naive journalist who seamlessly breaks into a lawyers office. It wasn't so much piecing the clues together as being handed to investigators on a plate! I found the plot to be melodramatic and yet SLOW. I actually skimmed some pages to just get on with things. And yet, I can't say I disliked the characters--sometimes they were interesting and fun in and of themselves. But it is not a good sign when you find yourself saying to a book, ""NO! Make the copies NOW! Don't leave the originals on your DESK, for crying out loud!""

I remember sitting around the room having the discussion. It was difficult. We were discussing this book during the height of the Trump presidency, and this book was examining blackness in America, Nigeria and Britain. It was also addressing the universal human experience, based on the author’s observations. Those of us in the room (it was a large crowd that day) could feel the author’s intentions. We wanted to be a part of the conversation. But…We needed to understand the author’s message. Americanah tells the story of a smart, strong-willed Nigerian woman named Ifelmelu who, after she leaves Africa for America endures years of near destitution before graduating college.She then starts a blog entitled “Raceteenth or Various Observations About American Blacks (Those Formerly Known as Negroes) by a Non-American Black.” This blog helps her to win a fellowship at Princeton. In researching the author’s background (which I typically did as the facilitator), I learned that she has acknowledged that many of Ifemelu’s experiences were her own. In Ifelmelu’s life is her boyfriend (from high school) Obinze who outstays his visa and takes illegal jobs in London. Eventually, Obinze is deported, and Ifemelu thrives, because she seeks authenticity. She seeks to be her true Nigerian self, including keeping her hair natural. Most expected black women to straighten their hair.Without going into detail (no spoilers from me) an event occurs which haunts Ifemelu. She returns to Nigeria. She finds that Obinze has found wealth in Lagos as a property developer. Even though there is some time spent on their “reunion,” the story takes a turn towards negativity about Nigeria and their feelings about ‘Americanahs.’ It is being described as “a country too proud to have patience for ‘Americanahs’ – a term used in Nigeria to refer to people who pretend to be Americanized or have been Americanized.This is…A beautiful and immersive story about immigration and identity. And…A story of cultural contrasts of Nigeria and America. Mostly there are…So many messages in this book. And…So much to appreciate about the discussion of race and identity. The clash between cultural principles and the compromises made. Country values. Discomfiting realities of our time. How history repeats itself, but also how vicious circles can be broken.

And then we probably had to do it again in college. Right? And then we wondered why we would want to do it again. And yet there is something to be said about how this classic has something significant to be shared. A learning lesson we can gain. It is a play. And typically we don't read plays we act them. And yet this play deals with relevant issues - racism, love, secrets and loans. Modern world issues, even if it wasn't written in the modern age. It may have been written as a comedy in Shakespeare's time, but to the modern reader, it isn't so much a comedy but a tragedy and shows something that is so wrong with our world. (As an example why is the debt ceiling being held hostage in this very moment?) We already know that racism is wrong and shouldn't be tolerated. At. All. And yet it is rampant. Today. Yet in this play it shows how those that face prejudice just let it happen and don't even try to stop or overcome it. Was Shakespeare a racist by making Shylock the worst character - the modern banker? Shylock seems set on revenge against those who had abused him in society. While we acknowledge this as an onlooker we forget to be grateful that our society is just a little better than presented. And yet I can't help but ask the question: Are we better today? It is obvious in this story that money comes before love. So many moral dilemmas played out in this play. So, yes, reading this in high school and college - good places to start.

My edition is so old, you can't even find it. It is a Modern Library Book edition This book was given to me by my Rabbi as a gift on my confirmation. My edition is so old, you can't even find it. It is a Modern Library Book edition with an introduction by Eleanor Roosevelt. It doesn't mean that I am that old (although I am old-ish), but, the copyright is 1952 (I will say I wasn't born then). I still have this book. So this book is very personal to me. For a past I experienced growing up in a very prejudiced neighborhood. The anti-semitic past and hatred I endured living in Southern California. So a lot of times, I had to hide that I was Jewish. To protect myself. And it is especially hard to see the hatred in today's world. I don't practice Judaism today. But it is my history. It is a part of me. And my ancestors have endured a lot. So, yes, this book, Anne Frank's experience, it is personal. Premise: the diary of a young girl beginning on her 13th birthday (6-12-42). {Interesting that I am posting this  on the date that would have been celebrating her birthday 81 years later.} The diary ends August 1, 1944.Despite all that was going on around her, Anne was a happy and cheerful person. She was talkative and inquisitive. She was challenged as a teenager, and didn't always understand everyone or the situation, but she still had a great sunshine spirit. I think this was another reason the Rabbi felt this was an important book to share with us young ones as we were entering our commitment to Judaism. He not only wanted us to understand what it meant to be a Jew, and the sacrifices of those before us, but the joy of a good positive attitude - despite the circumstances they endured.

Daniel, a 10-year-old boy grieves for his mother, still, as his father a solicitous bookseller for the Cemetery of Forgotten Books awaits someone to choose the next book. The idea, is that each book awaits someone to choose it, and thereby renewing the books own lost life. Mostly for its handsome binding, Daniel picks out a novel titled “The Shadow of the Wind” by an obscure Spanish writer, Julian Carax. This choice will shape his life, launching him as a young man, upon a gothic quest, which will be the center of this novel. At the same time, the book will go back to the 1920’s and tell the story of the odd redemption for Carax’s own dark tragedy. Once grown, Daniel is drawn to pursuing the mystery of Carax, who was supposedly killed in Barcelona at the start of the civil war. He continues his investigation through meeting others connected to Carax, especially as he learned that many of his books had been burned. So…Who is the arsonist? Carax was a failed author whose books never sold but the few who read them found their lives transformed. Why would anyone want to burn and destroy Carax’s books – or him?Also…Readers learn the mystery of the message of the Cemetery and how it became to have books first possess and then transform the lives of those who rescue and read them. Much passion, mystery, revenge, against-the-odds love story, coming-of-age saga and melodrama (mildly supernatural thriller?) play out through these pages. And…Will readers be satisfied with the outcome?At the end of the book, the author provides maps and pictures and a tour of where the characters went…“The city is a sorceress, you know, Daniel?

Although Jane Eyre was received with some criticism at the time of publication for portraying a heroine with strong feelings, it shows some popularity still today for it's romantic journey. There are beautiful observations on the pure and transcendental nature of love and the importance of truth - since we know there is more to Mr. Rochester, than he is immediately sharing. In many ways it was a romantic mystery that provided an opportunity for some happiness for two souls that needed a happy ending.

What's not to like about a brooding hero and doomed love? For me...a lot. Most view this as a classic love story, but its most memorable scenes are filled with violence and the characters appear nastily to one another and even end up killing each other. For a normal love story, we wouldn't want both lovers to deliberately marry other partners, or die. So, even if we view young Catherine and Heathcliff as friends and soulmates, spirited, wild and adventurous, with no care about the social notions of propriety, whatever happens later, does not match their once young hopeful spirits. And thus the novel evolves into something quite ugly and mean spirited... for lack of better words. So as readers, how could we not grow to hate Heathcliff for his cunning cruelty and brutishness? We may want to pity him when we witness his torment when Catherine dies and he says: ""I cannot live without my life; I cannot live without my soul."" But, the way he has carried on as an adult...and the decision that he takes with his own life in the end - is that his redemption? Can we finally forgive him?

I have noticed so many women/men of age who have done ""work"" to try and maintain a youthful look, and yet there is something unnatural about their look. I don't know why I needed to mention it, but it felt like something to mention - we seem as a society to be focused on outer appearances - we miss the point of the whole self - the substance of the whole person. It is a shame when we forget there is so much more to the person than the physical - outer person. Anyway, onto this story...Of course, this isn't a modern story. This one was published in 1890. And it is about a man who had a self-portrait painting done that shows his exquisite beauty. He wishes that he would remain this way, and he does. But, what doesn't is his painting. The painting ages as he should have done. Dorian Gray, is a beautiful physical person with privilege who takes advantage of his looks. The book seems to create a social commentary, criticizing the way in which good-looking people can get away with bad acts simply because of this social predisposition. Is this true? Are we more inclined to listen to a pretty person, as opposed to one with a scarred face? Throughout the story, we watch the destruction of Dorian Gray. We also read anti-semitism and sexism throughout the story which was difficult - but understandable considering the time it was written. So many interesting ways in which this story went.

Although the target audience is middle schoolers, this is a book that can be read by any age group. And, if you have only relied on watching the movie - stop, turn around and consider picking up this book. It is inspiring. It is refreshing. We can learn something from it. August doesn't look like anybody else. He has a rare genetic disorder. And so, his mother protected him by home schooling him. But, he wants to go to school. The problem is that August lives in a brutal world. So surely, middle school is the last place he could ever hope to be or find normal, right? This book gives a very realistic look at the frankly cruel reality that is a typically hushed topic in children's books. Wonder is about something that we don't really like to talk openly about because it is so rare and so very sad. And that is simply...how we react to, and/or respond to people who don't look like us. What happens when we create this hurtful rejection because this person doesn't fit the mold of what we expect? The goodness of August is that despite what he lives with, he is a boy who can't be hushed into silence. He chooses not to be invisible. He wants people to see more than what is on the outside. We can learn a lot from August. Because in truth - we all are more than what we present on the outside. This book is bold and funny and engaging. We as a human race can do better.

I am now bringing my  to Goodreads.The Lorax symbolizes concern for the environment. Some adults have embraced it and some have seen it as controversial and considered it anti-capitalist propaganda. If I could roll my eyes towards those individuals, I would. For Theodor Seuss Geisel, the environment was a serious moral issue for him, but he wanted to make it fun for kids. So, this book is set up with wonderful zany illustrations using rhyme and made-up words and unique characters to lighten the story and appeal to children ages 6-older. Premise: The Lorax speaks on behalf of the trees, and appears to complain about the pollution from the factory. The smoke was so bad that the swans could no longer sing. So, the Lorax sent them away to escape the smog. The Lorax also angrily pointed out that all of the byproducts from the factory were polluting the pond so he also took the fish away. Of course, the Lorax’s complaints only made corporate angrier, and they vowed to make the factory larger. And when that happened, the last truffula tree that fueled the factory fell over and died, thus ending the factory for good. The Lorax left. And then…What was left was an empty factory and pollution. Moral of the story, and why would this be an interesting leadership lesson for a college course? (Or any educational setting? – or parent/child experience?)I won’t go into the exact lesson that we “played” with the book, but think about it for a moment. What makes this book so effective is the combination of cause and effect: how unfettered greed can destroy the environment, followed by an emphasis on positive change through individual responsibility. Now…Consider the impact of one voice. Could anything have been handled differently? And now the discussion begins. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Jun 29, 2023","May 01, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7784.The_Lorax

I was appalled at the way he was treated by his Uncle and family. I was so pleased by his rescue to the magical world that would soon become his life.

Good vs evil is not a new concept, but upon learning the truth about what happened to his parents, Harry now can set a path to heroism. I will say this though, the darkness that Rowling creates in her character Voldemort (he who shall not be named, who I named) is probably the creepiest villian I have ever read. As readers, we are truly behind Harry all the way in finding how he can stop this evil. Last thought.

This is a difficult book to penetrate. Heller is kind of nuts. Okay, I began somewhere. His intention, I believe is to illustrate the absurdism of the war, as this one was written at the time of the Vietnam war. He writes about the daily life of the soldiers of the U.S. Army. Within the book is a passage that tells us about the meaning of Catch-22:""There was only one catch and that was Catch-22, which specified that a concern for one's safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind. Orr was crazy and could be grounded. All he had to do was ask; and as soon as he did, he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions. Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he didn't, but if he was sane he had to fly them. If he flew them he was crazy and didn't have to; but if he didn't want to he was sane and had to.

Although it garnered no awards, it has remained consistently in print, and has sold millions of copies since its publication in 1961. It obviously was made in to a successful 1970 movie.

But, we also see Margaret Mitchell writing characters in a way that isn't exactly pretty. Was she making Klans people heroes? Was she showing us how the South truly was? How could we not be deeply disturbed by the racist underpinnings of the book? So, maybe it wasn't the book I loved, but the fictionalized view of what the movie presented to me back in the day.

We were reading the Penguin Classics annotated edition which was 464 pages. I knew I was in for it as a reader and facilitator. Another long book to overcome. And yet…So much to experience within these pages, which made it such a discussable book. The opening scene is Oklahoma. A man, Mr. Joad, wants to build, but he has no security. In fact, none of the farmers have security. The cotton crops have sucked out the roots of the land and the dust has overlaid it. The men from the bank or the company, sitting in their cars, try to explain to the squatting farmers that the original tenants (their grandfathers) who settled the land no longer have title to it, and that everything that they built will be razed to the ground – including their homes. The son, Tom, who has just been released from jail hitches a ride with the preacher who had baptized him when he was young, only to arrive home to find his family getting ready to set out for California. The bank had already knocked down their house with the tractor. The Joad family had read flyers about picking oranges in California, and felt this was the place to be. Everyone else has headed in that direction, as well. So…Off they go. And then…Steinbeck describes the beauty of what the “Okies” now see as California. But…Californians aren’t so welcoming. And…All those trusting “Okies” are herded into “government” camps. Fearing the violence and the discomfort of what they see, the family moves on through California, hunted by anonymous guns while they are picking peaches for 2 l/2 cents a box, hoping only for a little land free of guns and dust on which they might settle and work. The promised grapes of California have turned into the grapes of wrath. (Hence the title of the book.) Will goodness come to this family at some point for them? I could tell you all sorts of things here of what happens to Tom, or the preacher, or even the family, but then I would be breaking my long-time rule of providing spoilers, and that doesn’t work for me.

This is the final book in the series due to the death of the author last year (2018). Knowing “That Old Scoundrel Death” was the last book from this author, brought a certain sadness to reading this. Still, I kept an open mind (since it was really the first I have read in his series.) In the old days when I would lead my local Library Book Discussion Group I would do whatever I could to find out information about the author. So, being curious, I decided to look more into Bill Crider, especially his Sheriff Dan Rhodes series. This is what I discovered: The official first book of the series was 1986’s “Too Late To Die” but was not, however, the book that may have started it all. Apparently, there was a running gag throughout many of the books concerning terrorists taking over Blacklin County in Texas. (You can ask the town’s commissioners.) But the sheriff just does not believe it, or even think the possibility is likely. It’s more than likely this came from Crider’s first published book written with a friend in 1981, a Nick Carter book titled “Coyote Connection.”Bill Crider (July 28, 1941 – February 12, 2018). Crider taught English at Howard Payne University in Brownwood, Texas, and went on to become the Chair of the Division of English and Fine Arts at Alvin Community College in Alvin, Texas. In addition to teaching, Crider’s passions included reading, writing, book-collecting, music, movies, blogging, and cats. Crider appeared to be a prolific writer of mystery, science fiction, western, horror, and children’s books.Crider, along with comedian/TV weatherman Willard Scott wrote a couple of cozy whodunits, featuring of course, a nationally recognized weather forecaster by the name of Stanley Waters. The books are, “Murder \ Under Blue Skies” (1998) and “Murder in the Mist” (1999).The Sheriff Dan Rhodes novels are character driven with a significant amount of wry humor. Two of his returning characters are Hack, the dispatcher, and Lawton, the jailer. They give Rhodes grief, and make him work for every piece of information. (For me they were a bit annoying…but, that could just be me!)Which leads me now to this story. How did I feel about it? I guess we are lucky to have small town sleuths in the spirit of Sheriff Dan Rhodes. Interestingly enough, in this book, the Sheriff even thought of not running for office again.

The Senator returns home from a speaking engagemenI actually read this back in 2018, but this is my first chance to post it as a  on Goodreads. The Senator returns home from a speaking engagement and discovers his wife murdered. Who would do this and why? And…Is the Senator guilty or complicit? These are the questions that we as readers must discover answers to in Margaret Truman’s Murder on K Street, a Capital Crimes Novel. (Yes, her father was President Harry S. Truman.) There are 23 titles in her mystery series. As readers we have been treated to a view of the Washington, D.C. areas in unusual ways.Throughout the series, each locale is explored and used as a backdrop for the mystery. Murder on K Street is no exception. For many, the combination of politics and murder mysteries makes this series an enjoyable read. Another wonderful thing about this series is that Ms. Truman has kept the violence low-key – it happens, we know about it, but there are not pages of gore, blood and/or guts. Instead, she trusts in the readers’ imaginations to envision the scene and keeps the unnecessary unsaid. The same is true for her use of profanity – used discreetly, in character, as needed, without the need to use it as a conversational gambit. The pacing of the story is brisk and clear, for the most part, and even with the less worthy machinations of racial tensions, it is a tale that keeps the reader’s interest. As always, Ms. Truman keeps the political environment as part of the story as a whole. Margaret Truman died in January of 2008, so this is the last book in the series. Her mystery writing will be missed....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,"Apr 23, 2023","Apr 23, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2040166.Murder_on_K_Street

Fast paced, interesting, great characters. When the novel focuses on the mystery involving Benedict Arnold, “The House of Secrets” is classic Meltzer. What doesn’t work for me are the characters. Hazel, her brother and even Jack aren’t remotely likable, and readers will have difficulty sympathizing with them. Since this is the beginning of a series, the likability factor needs to be amped up for readers to really connect. Could this be because he has a co-writer?

The story is told in alternating letters from Tina Hopgood, who lives in England, and Professor Anders Larsen, who lives in Denmark. It reminded me a bit of 84, Charing Cross Road, where there is also a letter writing correspondence between two unlikely people.

Review here: https://www.goodreads.com//show...In Meet Me at the Museum their letters carry on for a timespan of about a year with conversations ranging from history, ecology, herpetology and biology, to venturing into their personal lives, their children, their thoughts, likes and dislikes. The plotline expands beyond the two characters involving their families and what is happening in their lives. In parts you forget you are reading this entire novel in letters. There are moments of joy, despair, hope and loss. It is not a fast paced read. It renders so much honesty and simple goodness, it does not require speed or loud activity. It is a journey inward in a sense. Something to read while sipping hot cocoa. Very lovely and sweet.

This mission is to:Create islands of sanity, guiding with courage and integrity, dealing with the impossible, directing social change, depending on diversity, inspiring with the joy of interbeing and standing up for what is right.

As the ecologists have noted: nature bats last.” Wheatley writes, teaches and asks the right questions. This book is a call to action.

It was harrowing and beautifully written. Even though the target audience was YA, I still felt okay reading it as an adult. I felt the sense of danger, resolve and survival.

Should he step out of the hotel, he will be killed. On. The. Spot. With humor, energy and charm, the book follows the Count's life as he tries to live his life and make sense of his circumstances.

The author is a foThis book tells you exactly what it is on the cover: A friendly guide to how animals live, and; how we can make their lives better. The author is a former veterinary technician and animal advocate, so her understanding of animal needs is obvious. And this book – well, she is on a mission. It is clear that she believes that the more that humans know about the animals in our world the better we will care for them, and the better our lives will be. And for anyone who is an animal lover, I believe her. What attracted me most to this easy-to-read book were the illustrations. The illustrations by Lisel Ashlock are gorgeous. Readers can spend a day just turning pages looking at them. Sharing them with young children – or viewing them for yourself. It is as if you are looking at photographs. Absolutely stunning!The author has broken the book up into 3 sections. At home, In the backyard and Falling in love on the farm. In the chapter, At home, she shows readers how to speak “dog-ese” and “cat-ese” if that is your preferred pet. You are also shown ways of providing forever homes for some of the less adoptive type pets, and how you can see them in a different light. In the chapter, In the backyard, we learn about building bee houses, dealing with pesky moles (and how we can live in harmony with them) and creative ways to bird-watch, have mindful walks, and more. Also…In the backyard chapter, one beautifully illustrated page titled, “there’s beauty in the night” was on the owls. It reminded me of an owl who lived in our Cypress tree for about 10 years. It was wonderful to listen to its nightly call. And sad when we were awakened by its deathly fall one morning. We were told by the local rescue group that he had lived to a wonderful old age, probably because he had a home he was comfortable and settled in. That made us happy.In the chapter, On the farm, she teaches readers what can be done to help farm animals lead a better life. What is particularly interesting is that she also shares what makes them unhappy, too – which can be key information for those choosing to raise farm animals. In a more personal chapter, on “giving sanctuary” she shares about some of her own farm animals including how to foster a farm friend. This wonderful book also includes: acknowledgements, resources and an index. A truly delightful, resourceful read.P.S. - not that it should matter, but she is the wife of Jon Stewart, host of The Daily Show. He really isn't mentioned, other than as ""my husband,"" or his name in the slight bio in the back.

This story, although fiction, is drawn from the real-life Kopp sisters, who in 1914 found themselves in the headlines after factory owner Henry Kaufman crashed his car into their buggy. Now, this may not seem like a lot to base a story on, but we are talking about women in the early 1900 era. Where expectations are to just be compliant and accept that an accident occurred. But not with these women. They demanded restitution, and thus a campaign against them of harassment and intimidation begins. It is interesting when you think about this story being based on real people, because even if we are reading fiction, we get a true sense of the bullying tactics employed by Kaufman. And what it must have been like for women of that era.Including, the unnatural strength it took for the Kopp women to stand up to him. We also see the women being responsible for the family homestead. Another out-of-character feature for women of that time.The characters are drawn beautifully. We see them messy and flawed, struggling against the norms of the day. We even get tastes of Miss Marple (Agatha Christie’s heroine) as they work their way through a bit of a mystery. (No spoilers from me.)It is a well-layered plot with history and mystery that will keep readers turning pages, especially fans of historical fiction. It should be noted that for the year that this was published, 2015, it was a New York Times Editors’ Choice, An Indie Next Pick, and a Best Book of the Year for NPR, Washington Post, BookPage and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. And, one last note…The author once owned a bookstore with her husband called Eureka Books in Eureka, California. They sold it in 2022. Why bring this up? Because, during our travels we had the opportunity to visit the store. How many times does a person get to visit a bookstore owned by a successful author?

Instead of painting the KKK as pure evil, Stallworth looks at the complexity of the group and what drives its members towards heinous acts and an irrational aversion to non-whites and multiculturalism.

Another one that I removed from the thumbs-down shelf. This is the end of the Grant County series. So, if you haven't read #1-5, it is recommended that you do so. The story finds us with Detective Lena Adams in a jail cell suspected of murdering a woman. Chief Jeffrey Tolliver has gotten the call that she has been arrested. Jeffrey's wife, Medical Examiner Sara Linton, has little patience for Lena. (You see why you need book 1-5?) While Sara is fighting her own battles at home, she has little patience for her husband having to fight for his detective. So as Jeffrey and Sara try to save Lena, we can only expect a climax and a final, unforgettable twist to keep us readers engaged!

I wasn't sure I ever wanted to go there, and sometimes I was reminding myself, ""don't read this book at night.""To be honest, I don't read her books any longer - for this very reason.

Slaughter has a unique ability to make you care about the most damaged of characters, creating unlikely heroes who get thrown into the most twisted of circumstances. Her books are without fail dark, disturbing and utterly impossible to forget. Fans of her Grant County books will probably enjoy Will Trent (did you know there is a TV series now?). Those unfamiliar to Slaughter’s work will find this a good place to start before diving in to Slaughter’s serial thrillers. One problem I encountered which tended to strain my suspension of disbelief was the introduction of a reasonably highly-placed investigator with dyslexia, yes, Will Trent. I wondered why she felt this was going to be necessary, and how she was going to play this since she made it such an integral part of the plot. Still, as interesting and deeply flawed as he is, there is much thrown in, in this first book. We meet Georgia Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Will Trent when he is asked to help investigate a murder/rape. We also get some back story on Will in this book which introduces us to character Angie who works as a Vice cop. All in all this could be the beginning of a very interesting series.

The horrifying plot was hard to maneuver through for a mystery novel. I am finding that serial killing and sadistic murder seems to hit the best seller lists, but for me, I am finding myself less than motivated to want to read them. There is nothing entertaining about these themes. Maybe the problems for this author is that she goes a little deeper than most into the psychology of the use of abuse of children, making clear the damage it causes. Thus, to read this book, when seeing such pain in others... especially children, well, I believe, it places the reader (in my opinion) in an uncomfortable position.

What is particularly interesting about this 70 year old story is that it presents as a futuristic American society where books are outlawed and ""firemen"" burn any that are found. The story is told in third person. It follows protagonist Guy Montag through his routine as a 24th-century fireman. He seems content with his lifestyle, recognizing that burning illegal books is a good thing. This changes when he meets a strange girl who portrays creativity. Why will this be significant to Guy?Bradbury is making us question how we are viewing our world. There is much philosophical significance, especially for the time period in which it was written. However, what is profound about this premise is what we are experiencing 70 years later - today. The banning of books - the presumption of what books should or shouldn't be allowed to be taught in the classroom. Even though Bradbury was published in 1953 (perhaps considering what had occurred during WWII Germany just a few years earlier), there is still much to contemplate about what we have or haven't learned about history continuing to repeat itself. The message of the book is significant. The characters a bit flat. But because it is a classic, it is worth its time and discussion and that is why it gets 3.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,6,34,1,not set,"May 13, 2023","Apr 21, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28502000-fahrenheit-451

Unfortunately, his days of innocence are numbered, because soon his family home will be destroyed by bombs, and he will be part of an underground railroad helping Jews escape the Nazis. His parents think that if he enlists as a German soldier he will be protected, but once he is injured, he is recruited at 18 to be the personal driver for General Hans Leyers, one of Adolf Hitler’s most important commanders. Now, with the opportunity to spy for the Allies inside the German High Command, Pino endures the horrors of the war and the Nazi occupation by fighting in secret. Pino’s story is closely based on a true story, which makes it even more compelling. As the story progresses into the war years, it becomes more fascinating and action-packed. The author makes us witness to the many atrocities of the war, which are difficult to read at times. But as readers we are pulling for Pino. At the same time, we root for Pino as he experiences the tenderness of romance with Anna, a girl he met while helping with the underground railroad. This is a thought-provoking, emotional story. Heart-wrenching, as well. A well-researched WWII drama. But...Flawed in some ways. The author could have done better. Still...

My first experience with her was reading and discussing Bel Canto in our Library Book Discussion group. She has a way of taking us inside her stories and making us feel as if we are present - a part of what is going on - maybe as an innocent bystander. Mostly I love her because she writes with amazing warmth. She wrote these essays during the pandemic. She said she wrote them as essays as opposed to fiction because of her ""fear of death."" She says while writing any novel, she considers what would happen to her fictional universe and all her beloved characters if she dies before it is finished. She worries that they would be wiped out too. And just from that sense alone, we feel that this probably would be the greater tragedy. So for her, during this pandemic period, ""what was the point of starting (a novel) if I wasn't going to be around to finish?""

Meaning that Tom Hanks felt a need to describe everything a little too much. So, I will not go into that in this . Let me just say, that for me, as much as I love Tom Hanks the actor, and loved his book, Uncommon Type: Some Stories, I had a very difficult time immersing myself in this one. It took a long time to get through the details – the stories on each of the characters he chose to introduce on his way to making the masterpiece movie. And if you are really interested you can download the screenplay by scanning the link at the end of this book. Seriously. I am not kidding. Having said all that, how did I really feel about this book? Let me say this…Tom Hanks has a way with charming banter, inspirational speeches about show business – “the Business of Show” as his characters like to call it – that truly show what he knows intuitively – instinctively. These speeches are usually delivered by an experienced hand to a promising tenderfoot who is new to the business, but nonetheless instinctively gets what it will take to get a movie made. He made me believe that show business can be made up not of attention-desperate moneymen type drama addicts, but of hardworking individuals plucked from obscurity on the basis of their glorious talent for getting it done. There is no way we can’t admire his (Tom Hanks) commitment to moviemaking… one that ignores the corrupt, even ugly parts of the process. I admire his relentless good cheer. I admire his nice guy persona. I just wish it didn’t take so many pages to tell this particular story.

For those of you fascinated by Hollywood history, it’s stars, and others who lived, stayed, breathed or played at Hollywood’s most iconic, storied and scandalous hotel, you will want to read this book. This was an absolutely fascinating and absorbing piece of history! The Sunset Strip is an iconic part of Los Angeles. The Chateau Marmont has been the perfect choice for anyone seeking premium privacy – thus it made sense that it would attract Hollywood types from actors to producers, and later on, rock stars, and those who engaged in all manner of lurid and scandalous activities. So many famous people resided there for months at a time and sometimes longer, while others passed through briefly…making their mark. The author had a monumental task telling the famed hotel’s history which he did quite well. I thought he did an amazing job with familiarizing the reader with all the owners, the staff, and the guests throughout history and managed to recreate the mood, ambience, and atmosphere of each decade and what the hotel meant to the generations of people who passed through its doors. For me, personally, I enjoyed reading about the guests from the thirties through the fifties best of all. The glamour and style of these decades disappeared, never to return. Even so, it was a time when such great innovators and game changers gathered under the same roof, where the party never seemed to end and the creative juices flourished, and it was all done with great style. The scandals were titillating, but much was still left up to the public’s imagination- not like today when there is very little of the myth or mystery left (especially with the onset of social media) which helped create true Hollywood legends. Still one hopes that the Chateau Marmont will survive whatever the next big curve in the road brings, and will remain a steady keeper of secrets for Hollywood’s elite for decades to come… Enjoy a piece of decadent history....more",Notes are private!,8,12,1,not set,"Aug 25, 2022","Apr 20, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50895445-the-castle-on-sunset

I am disappointed, I was not as enamored of The Last Chance Library, as much.Especially…When this book has library in its title. Premise: June Jones has worked at the public library since she was a teenager. It is her safe and happy place. Her mother use to be in charge, but now after her death, 28-year-old June is a quiet library assistant, still there, quietly tucked away offering support to patrons, rather than leading story times or programs. But…Closure of the library is a possibility. And…The villagers want to do something about it. To be a part of the protest, would be under threat of being fired, but June really wants to help. So…What is she to do?This part of the story was…Charming. With…Some larger-than-life secondary characters. And…A gentle romance. But…Is June going to find her voice? Confront her fears?The good news is… That it is always nice when stories showcase the importance of libraries to communities… And… Community members become champions of their local libraries. But…There were a lot of triggers in this book to wade through – grief, death of a loved one, alcoholism, homelessness, family estrangement, cheating, depression. It was a bit of an overwhelm.

This includes the beloved giraffes that were very much a part of an earlier life experience for him. He decides that before he dies he wants to make sure to write down in a journal his memory of an eventful trip he took many, many decades ago during the Great Depression. And this is that story. A wonderful, bittersweet coming-of-age novel designed to celebrate hope in what sometimes feels like a hopeless world. The first female zoo director for the San Diego Zoo happens to procure two giraffes and a rhino from Africa. This is the story of how the two giraffes survived the transport via ship and now surviving the quarantine in New York, must now make the trek all the way to California. And of course, this is Woody's story, too, because he happens to hop-a-long to be one of their caregivers. It doesn't matter that he doesn't have any experience. This novel is beautifully written.

It is obvious that he loves what he does and as a reader, we love the relationships he develops with other characters so naturally. In short...Chambers is delightful and relaxing.

It seemed like the perfect time, while people were still feeling raw after everything that occurred relative to George Floyd. First, let me talk about the book. On some levels it is attempting to teach about the history of race in America. On other levels it is offering to teach about critical thinking – as in presenting history as a set of ideas about race through the lives and work of historical figures. (Even though the authors insist this is not a history book.) So…It has educational value.It also intends on spreading positive messages on how people communicate and support one another, by how they come to understand differences. This book was written for adults, even though it is a middle-grade version. It frames African-American history as a history of competing ideas: 1)	Haters – segregationists believe Black people are different from and inferior to White people and preach separation of the races. 2)	Cowards – assimilationists believe Black people are damaged, whether through external or internal causes, and focus on how they can win the approval of Whites. 3)	Antiracists believe there is nothing wrong with Black people and focus on dismantling systems of racism. It also charts historical and contemporary events involving violence, including lynching, police brutality, assassinations, rape, and the killing of Emmett Till. There was much to read between the pages, but, if it wanted to engage young readers, I think it missed its best opportunity. How to engage them in talking directly with one another. I guess I wanted more on how to better open the lines of communication with each other. And not so much on the negative side of history. Not that knowing this isn’t important to point out. In discussing the experience with listening to the authors, it was fascinating and gripping and provocative and inspiring. The book is a beginning for understanding. Opening doors.

This novel follows the destinies of two families - the Trasks and Hamiltons - whose generations sound hopelessly biblical. Steinbeck is a visual writer. I am a visual learner. Already we have a connection. Setting is important to a Steinbeck novel. This setting is the first thing we experience in this novel. The way he describes the Salinas Valley of the time, makes it sound like Paradise. I find myself enchanted. Even though I am a beach girl, through and through, his descriptions of the valley are mesmerizing. This is truly a human story. Steinbeck shares... ""We have only one story. All novels, all poetry, are built on the never-ending contest in ourselves of good and evil."" Cain and Abel. The re-telling of that bible story. But he also creates characters that resonate with us. One actually based on his own grandfather - the character of Samuel Hamilton (his grandfather actually being born in Salinas). Mostly this is truly a literary story because it is so good. It is thrilling and suspenseful, funny and heartbreaking. It is full of great characters that you care for and sometimes fear for them, as well. You can see what horrible things are awaiting them, and want to warn them, because you are so invested in their well-being. Sometimes you might even recognize yourself in their strengths...and weaknesses. When you are this close to a book - you know, this one is the one that stays with you. And when you close the pages at the end, you can't help but notice... this book, it is still with you. What do we call this book - East of Eden? A masterpiece.

Review here: https://www.goodreads.com//show...In this page-turning thriller, Mitch is a young lawyer at a top law firm in Memphis, Bendini, Lambert & Locke. He is brilliant...But...This is a law firm he should not have accepted the offer. Especially as a top of his class student at Harvard with many other pending offers available. And…Even though this was the last place that he and Abby wanted to settle, the offer was just too good to walk away from…Especially when they offer a brand-new vehicle and pay off his student loans, and arrange for a mortgage on a new home, with their very own decorator. Eventually…Mitch and Abby begin to feel uneasy about this decision. And…When he is approached by an FBI agent about two recent deaths of the firm’s employees, Mitch decides to investigate. And thus…The book takes off.As readers…We become involved in a fast-paced action thrilled mystery suspense that keeps us turning pages. So…Even if we know what is happening, and what could possibly be to come, we are still interested in the eventual outcome. (Whether you saw the movie, or not.)Would it have been better to read the book first? Probably.

My cousin recommended this book to us (my cousins group), and so I decided to add it to my political reading list. I am glad I did. A short, compelling read, (written and) published at a time when its message is incredibly important.He shares that the enemies of the common good range from the slumlords to megabanks and untrammeled hedge funds. He feels that these ""enemies"" all disregard the rules of society for selfish gains. Reich stresses the importance of the truth; and, he proceeds to point out the problems caused by lies.He presents a few reassuring words and suggestions on what we must do to restore Americans' faith in the common good which includes a model built on the ideal of truth and equitable competition, not the ideal of individualism without rules or constraints. Consider what Reich shares here: “If we are losing our national identity, it is not because we come in more colors or speak more languages than before. It is because we are losing our sense of common good…We have never been a perfect union. Our finest moments have been when we sought to become more perfect than we had been.” A superb and quick read recommended for everyone’s reading list. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Jun 28, 2022","Apr 19, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/37506435-the-common-good

Let me share what I was excited about first. The title of the book. And the book cover. And the premise for the story. Okay we have 3 potentially positive possibilities going for this book. Who wouldn’t get jazzy about a bookshop in Paris? Look at the Eiffel Tower on this book cover? Sounds dreamy, right?The premise was that bookshop owner, Sarah was going to do a 6-month job exchange with Parisian friend, Sophie and run her bookshop in Paris. How fun, right? And, Sarah thought her boyfriend Ridge would be all excited to come along for the ride, too! (He didn’t.)So, what’s my problem, then?Well. Okay, don’t get me wrong. I love stories about books and bookstores. And I love stories about love and romance…that works. But I was really getting very annoyed at the romance/ ‘happily ever after’ aspect of the story. Especially when the boyfriend kept saying he would come and he didn’t come/sort of, barely showed up. Still there are more redeeming qualities to the story.I did love the way that Sarah explored Paris and the way she chose to make things work in Paris and at the bookstore when everyone was working against her. She made it an adventure – she wandered – she stood up for herself – she explored. That part of the story worked for me. The wrap up ending did not. “Distance made everything that much sweeter. I missed him, and he missed me. I was falling into the abyss of messy, manic love. And it was divine.”Blech. Ugh. Seriously? Is that what it takes?So, what does this mean for the overall story? Romance fails in my eyes, even with a HEA trope. If you understand me, thank you. ...more",Notes are private!,7,25,1,not set,"Apr 02, 2024","Apr 19, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/45287335-the-little-bookshop-on-the-seine

However, new readers may find this book a good volume to enter the series because of its unique setting and independence from Penny’s typical characters that reoccur in her novels. The book stands alone. However, as a trusted Goodreads friend reminds me, because of the character development throughout, it is probably better to start from the beginning. Still...it is up to you, how you choose to get in to this series. Just know...you have been appropriately advised!This story has him investigating the murder of a monk at a monastery. But interwoven through the murder investigation are deeper, darker and more personal mysteries. Penny focuses a lot on interpersonal relationships. As you get to know her characters, you begin to understand this about her. Penny has done her research, and weaves a captivating tale that reaches the very heart of what makes us human: music. Through her storytelling, we feel the essence of the existence of these monks’ music and it helps to bring the novel to life. There is a sense of richness and beauty to what we read – and it becomes difficult to put this book down – not just because we want to know what is going to happen with the investigation, but also because we are listening to the music, in our own way, as readers....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,not set,"Jun 21, 2023","Apr 19, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16045144-the-beautiful-mystery

Present day Caroline is investigating the unsolved apothecary murders after discovering a vial that's related to the apothecary on a mudlarking expedition in London. The 1791 storyline details how the (lost) apothecary became linked to the murders in question. Nella (1791) creates poisons for women who are being threatened by men. She felt it was her way of protecting the women who had nowhere to turn. A significant part of this story as it twists through the lives of these two women and the disappointments they have in their own personal relationships, is how it reflects on the implications of committing murder. Even when it is done to protect those who cannot protect themselves and have no recourse in the law, is it right? Is it justice? How does it weigh on the reader? How does it weigh on the characters souls? I am curious how readers felt about the ending. No need to give it away. Just how did you feel? Were you satisfied?

Dolly Parton has written over 3,000 songs, with approximately 450 of them being sung and recorded by other people.“I am a singer, an entertainer, and a businesswoman. But if I had to choose just one thing to be, I would choose to be a songwriter...Everything I am starts with that song. No matter who you are as an artist, if you don’t have a great song, you’re not going anywhere.”The beauty of this book is that we now get all the stories behind her music, besides the lyrics. Still…If you have seen her on stage, she usually has a little story before she begins singing each of her songs…But…This book gives not only details but pictures, as well. Which makes this book a beautiful artful musical story of her life.And…I bet all of us have some favorite songs of hers, that we still hum in our heads. For me…I love 9 to 5, Jolene, Coat of Many Colors and I Will Always Love You…Which…To be honest, I didn’t realize ‘I Will Always Love You’ was her song…Especially…Since my first time hearing it was in a movie theatre years ago watching “The Bodyguard” and listening to Whitney Houston belt it out. Of course…Now that I have seen a variety of Dolly Parton shows on Netflix, I have come to recognize her as the original songwriter/artist. And…Her rendition of it is uniquely appealing. Mostly…I love the complicated reasons (shared in this book) behind the song that make it such a powerful one.One more thing…About ‘I Will Always Love You,’…Did you know that it was also re-recorded for the soundtrack of her 1982 movie with Burt Reynolds, for “The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas?” That was 10 years before Kevin Costner’s movie, “The Bodyguard.” Anyway…This book gives us the songs and their stories divided into 3 key areas: song lyrics, archival photos and written passages that feature her retelling of various events.  And…She shares the telling of these events in such a folksy way. Along…With grace and humor. Especially…When she combats insults by beating people to the punchline. (We know which body parts of hers have gotten the most attention.) And…One of her most famous comeback lines has been…“It costs a lot of money to look this cheap.” Still…Regardless of all the attention to her physical anatomy or over-the-top, flamboyant costumes and plentiful iconic wigs, we are interested in her. From…Her impoverished childhood in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, to her subsequent move to Nashville to make her fortune. Along with the tumultuous 1980’s that created many challenges for her that sometimes caused depression.This story…Her-story gives us Dolly in all her down-home warmth and goodness.

How can a lover of books resist a book about books?  “All the things that are wrong in the world seem conquered by a library’s simple unspoken promise: Here is my story, please listen; here I am, please tell me your story.”For many people, I imagine libraries are like places of worship - everyone is made to feel welcome and part of a greater community. I certainly have felt this way about our local Library.A library, is not only a community of readers, but also of people looking for help, or someone to answer their questions, teens wanting a safe place to hang out, adults taking free classes, book discussion groups, children’s reading hours and programs. . . the list is endless. Our community libraries fulfill many roles. If you haven’t hung out in one long enough, please do so. You will be pleased with the results. Back to this …The Library Book is centered around the biggest fire to ever hit a library.It happened on April 29, 1986 at the Los Angeles Public Library. But along with learning what happened that day and the investigation afterward, Susan Orlean has chosen to use this book to give us facts about reading, libraries and books.I was a bit disappointed that the story took such a meandering path around the actual fire and crime. Especially with me being such a fan of mysteries. I’m one that wants to delve into the mystery - dig deep into what happened and gain more insights into what actually happened on that fateful day. Yes, she does provide some background by sifting through some newspapers stories and investigators' reports, but it seemed to get lost within the pages, as other stories were unfolding, too. Still...I also began to appreciate just how much the author put into this book to cover so much other information. To remind people about how important libraries are to their communities. In this way, the author was the perfect saleswoman. For that she gets an extra star. ...more",Notes are private!,10,23,1,not set,"Sep 06, 2023","Apr 18, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/39507318-the-library-book

I am now bringing my  to Goodreads.I want to say I am typically a fan of Barbara O'Neal, but this one didn't work for me. This was, in my opinion a soap opera melodrama mess. The narrative bounced around between the melodrama and quiet introspection, and it really just never balanced out. It starts out with sommelier/vinter Maya chopping open casks of wine as an act of rage, an accident among many spurred by her alcoholism. Already, I am not sure I like her. Off to rehab she goes. Then her celebrity chef Dad, Augustus dies unexpectedly. Moving on...Maya continues to struggle with her sobriety and several unplanned twists in her personal life. Then there is Meadow who is in her own whirlpool of grief. Meadow actually had been Augustus partner in creating the restaurant that brought the fame. She's Augustus' second ex-wife, Maya's mother being the first. I should have left the story at this point. Are you following this soap opera mess? Not yet. How about... did I tell you about Norah, Augustus' current girlfriend? Don't care? Good. Neither do I. Anyway, there are more characters, and to be honest, I started getting a headache, trying to keep track of their drama. The Book suffered from info dumping, too many characters with too many problems. Too much was centered on Augustus who seemed like a cad. Everyone was stuck in a past, and grief over this cad. Honestly, the book needed to be more than grief over this one man. My solution: Move on. Find another book to read.

The storyline, I mean. I am just asking that the author be creative. I really want them to think outside the box. I have read enough Colleen Hoover that sometimes I am hearing the word ""formulaic"" in my ear, and that isn't good when I start to feel that happening to me.I look for a story that gives me quality of narration, character arcs, plot, twists, world building. Am I asking too much? With romances, I just think it matters. I like to believe with romance, that either a story gives me butterflies or it doesn't. Like falling in love. Or frog vs prince charming. So here is The Flatshare. After a really bad breakup, Tiffy is practically on the street. She needs a cheap flat, fast. Leon needs more cash than he can earn by working night shifts as a palliative care nurse. He has a one-bed flat that is empty at nights, and he has this big idea. Since Tiffy works days, and Leon works nights, why not share the apartment (and bed) - simple right? So even though they never meet, they soon grow more familiar with each other than two virtual strangers ever should or could. How did I feel about this premise? How many of you have fallen in love via post-it-notes? Well...the premise was cute...but...was it romantic? I think it was cute. I don't think I can really tell you much more without spoiling the story. It's just there was a moment where the book had certain (implied) promises. And then it started taking some unexpected turns, and well, it just felt uncomfortable for me. I guess I was hoping for more light and fluffy. So maybe it was my problem with expectations? But for the most part, it still was cute. 3.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"May 12, 2023","Apr 18, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36478784-the-flatshare

I knew the author’s name… But I knew so little else about her. Who was she? When I looked her up on Wikipedia I was surprised to learn that she had only written two novels. But…Also, 31 short stories. Perhaps because she died at 39 years old.And…After reading this collection of short stories, I was not surprised by the description of her style…“She was a Southern writer who often wrote in a sardonic Southern Gothic style and relied heavily on regional settings and grotesque characters, often in violent situations.”Yes.When I picked up the book, there was a note inside. The note said…“Summer – I started to read Flannery O’Connor when I was in college and just love her. I suggest starting out with ‘Revelation.’ Talk about a wake-up call!!! Another good one is ‘A Good Man is Hard to Find.’ Enjoy – Torrey.” Well…Torrey, I don’t know how Summer felt, because the book ended up as a donation in my Little Free Library Shed. So…I started to read, the stories in the order you suggested. And…Yes…What a wake-up call, indeed! In this collection, 12 had not been read prior to this publication. This was also published 7 years after her death. What I came to discover as I read her, is that she put human style out in front: hard, straight, incomplete, sin – all its ugliness taking physical form. She was relentless and unsparing. And…Certainly, in that time and era…There was no political correctness to her. She didn’t care what was coming out of her characters mouth, it was just going to be said. The thoughts could be cold and heartless, too. But…They described the truth of how she saw it. And…How people truly behaved…And…Felt. They were just being…Themselves. In their stupidity, their meanness, their puzzlement, their Southern “ruralness.” And…As the reader, we could recognize this in the characters. We are not shocked by their attitudes or behaviors. We just know this instinctively as their nature, their life. Because the author through her writing reveals an uncanny grasp of the nuances of human behavior. Her descriptions of human faces and human bodies, are so apt, you felt as if you were in the room with them. But…At the same time, you didn’t want to be noticed, for fear one of the characters might include you in the story, too. It was said that her illness, lupus, which took her father’s life as well, influenced her writings. She suffered with it for 12 years before dying at such a young age in 1964. She was…A complicated person with an unapologetic writing style.This truly is a stunning and compelling collection of stories....more",Notes are private!,2,23,1,not set,"Oct 19, 2023","Apr 18, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/284996.The_Complete_Stories

But small-town Kentucky quickly proves equally claustrophobic. Especially with her overbearing father-in-law.

This is actually based on a true story.Triggers: abuse, incest, accused murder, misogyny. To be honest, I am not a real fan of this author. But, I am a fan of Eleanor Roosevelt. So, I was interested in this story, because of her. The part I loved about this story - is that it was a love story to literature - and books and the bonds of female friendship. The progressive women characters in this story were amazing. Inspiring. In many ways they were ahead of their time. The hard part of the story for me were the triggers I mentioned earlier. It is hard to read stories with that kind of focus. I wonder sometimes if it is really necessary. There was also some controversy with this book in 2019 by author Kim Michele Richardson to her book, The Book Woman of Troublesome Creek. She felt there were too many similarities. The publisher totally defended Moyes story. Both stories were evaluated and no further course of action was taken against the author Moyes.Readers, can always choose to read both books.

I put it on my good shelf, but I am not so sure. I am rethinking this, as I write this . Premise: Two missing girls. One who disappeared 10 years ago. One who went missing a few weeks ago. Then, we are transported back two weeks before that date to right after the second disappearance to slowly piece the puzzle back together, day by day. The problem is the story is told backwards. When we begin, the protagonist Nicolette presumably knows the answers to the mystery, yet she doesn't tell us, the readers what she thinks about it. The intention, probably, is to create suspense. But for me, it only created frustration. The book is told in first person narrative, yet, we aren't being given privy to her thoughts and feelings or her full knowledge as to her actions or inner thoughts. What? Is this really fair? Okay, we could suspend disbelief. But, really? How much? Apparently, this is the author's first novel for adults. She had previously been writing for a YA audience. Maybe she underestimated her reader audience for this book? Or me. So, was this a good read as a mystery? No. It was only ok. I am changing my shelf now. 2.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"May 28, 2023","Apr 17, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/31443400-all-the-missing-girls

Michener. I read a lot of Michener novels in my youth, and always appreciated the attention to detail he provided as it related to the landscape and his characters. This novel feels insightful. It is told in four parts by four different people who all have something to do with reading or writing or publishing. The people feel real (autobiographical?) and the work is very clever with a few twists and a surprise added to the mix.

I have to admit I was completely enchanted with The Silent Patient.https://www.goodreads.com//show... It really is shelved as one of my all time favorite books now. So, when the Maidens came out, I couldn't wait to read it. Let me start by sharing the basic premise of the story. The book's protagonist is Mariana who specializes in group therapy in London. She gets a call from her niece Zoe who shares that her friend Tara has been murdered. In a rather gruesome way. Mariana heads to Cambridge to be with her niece. Police arrest someone who Mariana believes is innocent, and thus she starts her own investigation. That was my first problem with the book. She zeroes in on Edward Fosca a charismatic classics professor, who has a cult like female following, (which included Tara), called The Maidens. Hence the title of the book. Are you still with me? On to my second problem with the book. Now all this back story about Greek mythology slows the story down. In my opinion, it was cumbersome. But the story picks up pace with all the dead bodies. Is that really how you want to capture our attention? Shouldn't the story just flow?Now, I must be honest here. I am not one for gothic storylines, so we are off to a poor start for me. Perhaps that is my third problem with the book. And the climatic all around problem with the book is...The creepy atmosphere doesn't help the unsatisfying plot and sometimes exasperating protagonist (is it really her place to be doing this investigation?). And the book's ending, while surprising just doesn't feel earned. Is this really a 2.5 stars rating? Okay, I'm being generous, I rounded it to a 3, which isn't typical for me to do. I really wanted to like this one. I hope the author's next book is better....more",Notes are private!,8,62,1,not set,"May 09, 2023","Apr 17, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45300567-the-maidens

Well, that was me a while ago with this book. I was over the top beside myself because of all the s I had read about how good this book was. The basic premise of the story was that Millie has to find a job before she lands right back in prison or she will violate parole. One wrong move and she will be trapped again. So, what could be more exciting than working for Nina Winchester? Well, she does exactly that. She becomes her housemaid. She takes care of her home under her watchful eye and her spoiled daughter. But Nina isn't exactly the best boss one could ask for. And it doesn't help that Nina has an attractive husband who isn't quite happy in this marriage. So, I am already having trouble with characters I am not liking. This is not working for me. What am I going do? This was called a psychological suspense story. I felt it was more creepy. Also, this author seems quite content in coming up with a variety of twists. I, on the other hand, was so exhausted by the twists, and overwhelmed by the nastiness of the characters that I just couldn't take it, and had to walk away. I know. This is a hot, popular book. I abandoned it. I left. I gave up. I'm sorry. Now you know why it is a thumbs-down. 1 star.

Premise: It is about a boy who loses his Grandfather, and a journey he takes with a talking cat to save books. Now, anything that has to do with books, I am all in. Of course, anything with talking animals, I am there, too! There are clearly learning messages for readers to capture throughout this book. Not just for Rintaro (the boy) to grasp, but for us readers to gain. The talking cat, Tiger, leads his young student through these trails (the journey) with a mixture of aloofness (after all he is a cat) and charm. Still…Rintaro is high school age, dealing with loss, going through a difficult time in school. There is a sense of youthfulness to this story – addressing lots of issues important for this age group. Yet…This story can appeal to anyone. Regardless of age. It is a journey not just through books, but through identity and the processing of grief. This is a lovely story for any book lover. It is charming in that we gain a sense of friendship, and love, and healing from grief. And of course, the mission to save books from various perils. If you like books about books, this might be a great one to cozy up to – or discuss with a group or friend. ...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,"Jul 02, 2023","Apr 17, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56755560-the-cat-who-saved-books

I am now bringing my  to Goodreads.I picked up this book because of the title. Having facilitated a library book discussion group for over 12 years, I was interested. I like to read about people in book clubs. What is it like for them? So…this is what led me to this book.Premise: This is a story about the lasting value and importance of women’s friendship. It is set amidst a group of Army wives with chapters taking place in both present day and 10 years earlier. As readers, we experience close connections, long grudges, and the possibility of reconciliation and renewal. In the present, Regina and Sophie both receive an “SOS” from their old friend Adelaide. They both come to her aid. Not realizing that she has called both Regina and Sophie to come, who are estranged from each other. (Oy!) But…This is about Adelaide, and the women put their differences aside. Meanwhile we are taken back in time to how they first met on the Army base, since their husbands were in the same military unit. Adelaide organized a book club for spouses, and this is where an unbreakable bond between these women is initially formed. But…Something happens to break that bond. And details/reveal doesn’t come until later. Again, had it not been for the title of the book, I would not have been drawn to the story. The most interesting part for me were the sections corresponding to the books the group is reading, and it made sense thematically and from an entertaining perspective. Still…The drama of the women… been-here-before. ...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,Jul 2023,"Apr 17, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57330219-in-a-book-club-far-away

I saw the author, Gail Lukasik in a televised interview and felt compelled to get her book.It was on the hot list at my local Library, so it took awhile before it was available for me to read. I believe the foreword by Kenyatta D. Berry, J.D., Host of Genealogy Roadshow (PBS) says it best when she shares: “This book adds to the ongoing conversation about race and racial identity in America because it looks at the ramifications of institutionalized racism and racial passing through one family’s story. Passing is something we don’t talk about in our society, but in the African American community we know it exists. It’s part of our collective history as Americans. Passing meant better opportunities for jobs, education, and quality of life. Racism and the continued oppression of African Americans exist today. This book will be the impetus to conversations about periods in history that have been forgotten but still resonate in people’s lives today whether they know it or not. Some too painful to remember, but we know ‘it wasn’t right.’” A powerful read. Not perfect, but it was her story to tell. ...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,not set,"Apr 27, 2023","Apr 17, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34181487-white-like-her

But…I have wondered, what attracts anyone to read anybody’s s? To follow any of us? I’d like to believe it is how we tell the story of anything we read. Which leads me to this book…I wasn’t sure how I felt about this book. This author definitely has his pulse on historical events. He begins this story with a poet having to protect his mixed-race daughter from Hitler’s racial laws. The author then follows the heartache that her grown daughter endures, having to send her own daughter away to save her life during the Castro revolution. Readers are then slipping forward and backward through eighty-six years. We go from Germany, to Cuba, to New York and back to Germany in 2015.Interestingly enough…Even though the Holocaust plays a memorable role – front and center – and it is very-well researched by the author – the main characters are not Jewish. The author does however, feature some graphic experiences of the Holocaust…And… The voyage of the St. Louis liner from Hamburg to Havana, which carried mostly Jewish refugees. This Holocaust coverage might be considered a trigger warning for some readers. No doubt, there is a lot of crime against humanity, and many moral issues presented throughout this story – in which the generations of women that are travelling through those 86 years are touched – which makes this a very good book discussion selection. So…How did I feel?Anger. Grief. Helpless. Sad. Hopeful. I’d like to believe that books like this can educate. That perhaps we can learn that hate isn’t the answer. That we are entitled to think and believe differently. And have varying opinions. And be respectful of those differences....more",Notes are private!,24,40,1,not set,"Nov 21, 2023","Apr 17, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61272710-the-night-travelers

So this is how the book starts…“The old lady lifted a black velvet bag from her sewing box, loosened the cord and took out a silver Smith and Wesson revolver.” What are we in for here?Premise: For 6 years, the hit TV series Swift has been plagued with misfortune. The media is quick to decide the program is cursed, but who is to blame? The filming is now in the Bath area. Detective Superintendent Peter Diamond’s investigation into the suspicious death of one of the stars takes a turn when one of the rigging crew goes missing soon after. I love Peter Lovesey’s Detective Superintendent Diamond. His series has wit, humor, clever plots, and of course, the iconic Diamond. He also has created a great team that puts up with his quirks. At the same time, he also has Diamond appreciative of them. There are a lot of things to unravel before solving the case, and I was fine not figuring things out right away. I enjoyed the deviousness of the plot. I especially appreciated the interactions between the characters. Especially when they took readers backstage to look at the filming of a hit TV show.

He meets Joanne, the love of his life. While Joanne completes her studies, he goes to New York, gets a job as an apprentice on NBC, and before we know it, so much happens with his life. Even as he tries the seminary (that isn't a good fit), he still sees he is good with children. As readers, we see him as perennially kind and caring in everything he does. He may not have been best with his own sons, but, he found a way to translate how to be a good Dad on to the television screen. Rogers lived simply. He sang and spoke through puppets. To read about him is to be elevated. But mostly it is to ask ourselves one simple question, ""am I a good neighbor?""

To be honest, it took me a few times picking it up and putting it down before I finally picked it up one last time and couldn't put it down. This can be considered a contemporary novel with a twist. Set in a small cafe in Tokyo, those who know of this particular coffee shop, know that it hides a secret. One seat in particular allows a person to go back in time. This story is told through the eyes of 4 people seeking this chance to go back in time. But, with some very specific rules - most importantly, that they must return before their coffee gets cold. You were wondering about the title of the book? Well, now you know. I don't think I gave away any spoilers here. The question for readers is, what if you were given a chance to go back in time - would you? And if you had only one chance - who would you choose to see? This is a character-driven story in which we are introduced to them not so casually facing these questions. Some things about the story felt incomplete. Something I really can't explain, but it did raise a lot of questions of what we would be willing to do for the people we love. 3.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,8,62,1,not set,"May 20, 2023","Apr 17, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/44421460-before-the-coffee-gets-cold

Does it make a difference as to what will happen in our lives, if it is tampered with? Now…This is a typical question that gets me each time I read a book about time travel.

So, why do I bring up the question here?As it so happens, the story begins with this sentence…“In 1972, two seconds were added to time.”And thus…The story unfolds. How did changing the clock by two seconds impact these characters?Joyce tells the story in 2 narratives; the story of Byron and the present-day story of Jim. There are segues between the 2 narratives as the connections between them are slowly revealed. But…For me, it just felt like too much was going on. And…There is a darkness, sadness, and loneliness to this story. The moorland setting definitely affects the mood, as well. Joyce allows readers to feel the weather effects including fog and a wild rainstorm. Even if Joyce felt that “life can change a little for the better” I wasn’t totally convinced, even though I will be the first cheerleader for hope.Still…Even with its flaws, this book has characters that are trying their best to find a place in the world. Trigger warnings…OCD, depression, mental illness. Finally…I am a huge fan of Rachel Joyce, but this story did not work for me.

But he was more. He was a Holocaust survivor. This is his story. He takes his time telling his story. The process He was 100 when this was published. But he was more. He was a Holocaust survivor. This is his story. He takes his time telling his story. The process is sometimes heart-wrenching, because obviously the experiences are. It is his experience. And yet…He is composed. Even as he shares some of the most horrific crimes committed against the human race in Nazi Germany. And…He’s not shouting. It’s almost as if we’re children listening to a bedtime story by our grandparents – although, it’s not the greatest subject, it is an important one. A memory that needs to be preserved for posterity. This is a highly readable memoir. His stories of the dreadfulness of the death camps and the Nazi efforts to kill him would cause anyone to live in bitterness and anger…but to him, he doesn’t feel that is a solution. He tells his story without bitterness. He inspires readers to make life beautiful even under the most unfavorable situations. He says, “I will tell you my story. It is sad one in parts, with great darkness and sorrow. But it is a happy story in the end because happiness is something we can choose. It is up to you. Through all of my years I have learned this: life can be beautiful if you make it beautiful.”We can learn a lot from Eddie Jaku. The 15 chapters give us much to contemplate.In today’s fast-moving- post-truth world, no one is naïve as to consider that sacrifices, speeches, or sentiments are enough to change the course of history. But… We cannot afford to let the hate that permeated during Nazi Germany ever happen again. Under no circumstances can the horrors of Nazi violence or its magnitude be undervalued or taken lightly. His memoir forces us to reflect and gather the courage to not lose hope even in the most difficult times. Personal note…I believe in Hope. I have courage in a better world. I want to believe. Eddie’s survival through what he went through tells me we can do better as a human race. He reminds us of hope, compassion and kindness. Let us go to a place of hope, compassion and kindness, always. On October 12, 2021 Eddie Jaku passed away in Sydney, Australia.

What happens if there is an answer, and it was in the wrong hands? When Isacc, the patriarch of the eccentric and gifted family dies under suspicious circumstances, his family gathers for the first time in years. Alternating between Hazel’s POV and her brother Gregory, and her Uncle Philip, there are a series of puzzling clues and plot twists, trying to find the answer to the question (which Isacc’s life work professed to have found the answer to). The quirkiness of the characters, and the family drama made this story cute, but a little over the top. The grief felt about losing their patriarch, that felt real. And for that, I appreciated that part of the story. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,Jul 2023,"Apr 17, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35297219-the-last-equation-of-isaac-severy

Chris is an amazing facilitator, and the group was delightful, inspiring, and quite welcoming in allowing me to be included in their tightknit group! Being apart of this discussion reminded me that I still had not posted my  of this book. So, I bring it to you now.This book finalizes the Practical Magic series. So, let’s begin at the end. This is how the author starts this book. “Some stories begin at the beginning and others begin at the end, but all the best stories begin in a library.” Oh yes. The library. And for anyone who has followed this page-turning fairy tale series through its previous three books, Practical Magic, Rules of Magic and Magic Lessons, along with its star-studded movie adaptation, then you know there is a lot to learn about the Owens saga. The Book of Magic begins at the end, which really is the demise of Jet, the beautiful witch who, with her sister Franny are now considered the matriarchs of the Owens clan. So, coming to the library, readers learn along with Jet that she has 7 days left with her life. What will she do with it?And thus, the story takes off. Much will happen with an abundant cast of characters, that may bog down the story a bit. And if the ending seems a bit sweet after all that messy, just remember that this was a witchy fairy tale, meant to be a bit imperfect. Just let yourself go with it!...more",Notes are private!,8,37,1,not set,"Mar 28, 2024","Apr 16, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56898179-the-book-of-magic

I came into reading this series at #4. So, I am reading it as a stand-alone, unaware of the history of these characters that existed through books 1-3. Second this book is translated into English.

Did I scare you there for a moment? I wanted to share this, because sometimes translations, and books being read out of sequence (which I have a tendency to do), can be tricky. On to the story...Detective Galileo is Manabu Yukawa, a perceptive physics professor, who occasionally assists the Tokyo police department. There is a complex case the Detective Chief and Detective Sergeant would like his assistance. There is an assumption of murder from a crime that has taken place approximately three years prior where a body was completely concealed and almost destroyed by fire. Of course, it now has been found. They have a primary suspect, but, he chooses not to confess to the crime. And now to the parade - the title of the book. Taking advantage of the distractions provided by the festivities, what should occur but...another crime! Is the incident connected to the first crime? Lots will happen...no spoilers from me! Just when it seems like all shall be solved, Detective Galileo uncovers another long-buried secret. What shall this long-buried secret be? How will this tie up all the loose ends? The book has its way of finding closure that is satisfying for readers. There is a hint of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie amongst these pages.

And now, all these years later, they are striking up this will-they-won't they romance, born from unfounded hatred. Oy! Did I care? It seemed like manufactured sparks between these two.

Despite knowing his life was coming to a sooner end than it should, or perhaps because of this, he created a story about finding love in the final chapter of one’s life. I fell in love with this book from page one, the first sentence and beyond. I fell in love with Louis Waters and Addie Moore and how they talk into the night about their lives and pasts, their transgressions, their hopes and desires, their losses, their families and how they bring joy to each other to ease the loneliness. I love how the title so perfectly reflects this. Our Souls at Night is simply, profoundly, an exquisite homage to love. And it broke my heart. Because, the story just has a way of capturing your heart enough to feel strongly about what you are witnessing (through reading and through watching on film). I read Our Souls at Night in one sitting and wept in the final pages. Haruf passed away in November, 2014 at the age of 71. He will be missed. The Netflix film first aired on September 29, 2017. It is a wonderful translation to film, capturing the essence of the book extraordinarily well, and with performances that are as wonderful as the written characters.

We are seeing revolutions that transformed first people, and our planet. He even touches on the changes in agriculture. The portrait offered is frequently violent. (Especially in those early stages.)As he gets closer to modern age the tone and selection of topics change. They become more eclectic. There is talk of happiness. Religion. Human psychology. Media. Language. Social movements. Still...The author is inspiring, too. Whatever the flaws, and believe me I am no expert on history, this book was certainly compelling. ...more",Notes are private!,2,8,1,not set,"Jun 18, 2023","Apr 16, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/23692271-sapiens

A Jewish American success story. Live in Brooklyn. Summer on Martha’s Vineyard. Rich. Exclusive social world. This is a story of family conflict. Parents are at odds. Secrets. Dysfunctional. There is grief and guilt, and weighty themes, and race playing a critical element in the story. It was for me an unpleasant read, because the characters in their privilege were unlikable.

Alice launches an affair with Ezra, decades her senior. For the first few chapters, it seemed too tired and too insular a story to hear again. But…As the story progresses, the undercurrents grow stronger and the story resolves into an interesting meditation on creativity, empathy and the anxiety of influence. We watch as Alice struggles to escape from Ezra’s certainty. I won’t go into details, it gets into spoiler territory. Years pass and a new book begins. One about a Muslim man. Amar is an economist, the son of Iraqi Kurdish immigrants. He is detained at Heathrow airport on his way to Iraq where his brother has disappeared. Amar’s story, in contrast to Alice’s is bold, mournful, unabashed, told in a graceful forceful first person POV. The book’s final chapter is an interview with Ezra, some years later. (I won’t reveal the spoiler here of what was disclosed.) What are we learning about Alice?What are we learning about Ezra?Are they living their best lives?In some ways we feel that by herself, Alice is forgettable, but in Amar, she demands to be remembered.

So, I don't believe in diets.And then...I found myself skeptical. And concerned. And I started to ask questions. And do some research. And I found that there were doctors and nutritionists and scientists that were criticizing this book. There was one Wikipedia article by Michael Matthews calling this author's diet/book a scam. He said: ""The Plant Paradox is rife with inaccuracies, misrepresentations, and outright misinformation, and the diet espoused in it is unnecessarily restrictive and blatantly designed to sell people overpriced and ineffective supplements...there's enough high-quality research to say we know enough about lectins to blow all of Dr. Gundry's principal hypotheses out of the airlock and thereby dismantle and disarm The Plant Paradox.""Matthews saw it as fake science. So, it doesn't appear that his book is based on scientific driven facts or medicine. As a reader, I would be concerned. It is our body.

But since I am now ing Party of Two https://www.goodreads.com//show..., I thought I better also bring this  to Goodreads, as well. What I will say is this, before we start…Alexa and Drew are related to Olivia in Party of Two. They will make an appearance in that story, but you need not read this story, to read Party of Two. They are stand-alones. Premise: Alexa and Drew meet in an elevator. It just so happens to get stuck, so why not start flirting with each other. Drew invites Alexa to his ex’s wedding. Now, this isn’t something she would normally do, but there is something about Drew that she is drawn to, so she agrees. Drew is a pediatric surgeon, and Alexa is the Chief of Staff for the Mayor of Berkeley. What is in store for these 2?Humorous. Light-hearted. Sexy. Lots of sexy. But…There are also a lot of hard-hitting issues, too.The author addresses interracial dating, white privilege, growing up in ethnic backgrounds, and racial bias from law enforcement. Alexa makes these points to Drew as to what it was like for her growing up as a woman of color. Drew uses this knowledge to reflect and be more aware. Although this seemed like a situation of insta-love romance, the couple seem to want to make this relationship work, despite the many fights and misunderstandings. Still…A bit too much been-here-before set-up, though.

Then the beginning of the book starts off. What?This book is another case of a decent plot going about it from a strange angle. We eventually learn in Chapter 1 that Patrick Lanigan, the one I described above, is the one we are talking about who was caught by bounty hunters and turned over to the FBI. This is all summed up in the first 30 pages. So, what more was there to say in this book, Mr. Grisham? I guess Mr. Grisham wanted us to know why Patrick did what he did. Which really was the slow moving part of the book, and least interesting. This made the book dull and the plot a struggle. The only interesting part was what happened to Patrick at the end. Maybe that gives this book the extra half star. 2.5 stars. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Jun 03, 2023","Apr 16, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7844809-the-partner

It is not hard to be a Grisham fan of his older books. Especially when he features Jake Brigance. For those who haven’t read Jake, this is his 3rd outing, so, if you haven’t heard of Jake Brigance, then you may not want to start with this book. Jake is a small-town Mississippi lawyer who specializes in unpopular cases that on the surface seem unwinnable. He first appeared in Grisham’s debut novel, “A Time to Kill” which also became a popular movie starring Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock in 1996. Jake returned in “Sycamore Row.” With “A Time for Mercy” Jake is still living with the repercussions of the earlier murder trial. Hence, the reason why readers need to read the books in order. Jake is broke, taking any case he can get, which also appear unwinnable, with a new client that seems guilty of murder. The back story of the murder is fairly clear to readers within the first few pages. And his client appears to have killed a cop. But, is the killing warranted? Defendable? As it appears?Jake is up against the wall on this one. But this is a complicated town, and a driven community. Readers will see issues of race, class, religion, politics and family dynamics played out and not always with sympathy or grace. This story is masterfully plotted and slowly paced with an eventual courtroom drama to experience. Will justice be something different in this case?...more",Notes are private!,4,27,1,not set,"Mar 15, 2024","Apr 16, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/53529219-a-time-for-mercy

Ian actually is a rather unattractively described writer with a few extra pounds who lives in a bland apartment. Now, as a best-selling thriller writer, he has snagged a movie deal and has been invited to be a part of the promotional jaunt in Hong Kong. While working on his next Straker novel, some bad guys are working on a real-life operation similar to his book. They assume that Ian is a CIA spy sent to thwart their operation.

Sure enough it did – so I went ahead and ordered this book to read on our quick RV trip up north.  Apparently... This is the 8th book in the series, which appeared obvious when several cases were referred to in this book reminding us of some of Mrs. Pollifax' adventures and the sticky situations it would get her in. So...It is recommended that you not start with book 8. Go back to the beginning of the series. It will probably be easier to understand the characters and their back stories. Moving on..Mrs. Pollifax looks like an ordinary person but with extraordinary skills. The author shows these skills as she takes us through a story that includes some drug smuggling, kidnapping, rather bumbling agents and geriatric martial arts…albeit with some humor. After all...How many characters do you find that can be simultaneously part of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the garden club at the same time?This is truly a comfort read – light, fun, and adventurous. Unfortunately, the author died in 2012, so, even though there are 12 to the series, that makes it the end. It was noted in an obituary page from the New York Times that ""ers sometimes quibbled about the improbability of her novel's basic premise."" Still...Her books proved popular because Mrs. Polifax made ""an irresistible early, feminist heroine."" So...Should I read more of her?

Here is another one, I want to share on Goodreads. With this one I am excited to say was a wonderful debut novStill playing catch up with my s. Here is another one, I want to share on Goodreads. With this one I am excited to say was a wonderful debut novel. This is a London-based thriller featuring DC Cat Kinsella. Cat isn't exactly the empathetic type (with live people), but she is with murder victims. She is a believably flawed, self-deprecating, and quite human character that I really enjoyed. And she gets along with her older partner - DS Luigi Parnell, a devoted husband and father, who is generally well-liked in the department. As readers, we are dropped right into the middle of a crime scene - and it isn't pretty. As Cat and her partner dig into the victim's life, something comes up that turn's Cat's life upside down. And this is a spoiler I am not going to share. Just know it has an impact on the story. As readers we will find that this isn't just a murder mystery with twists (shocking twists, by the way) it's about Cat learning her way into her herself and her career. All I will say is this, if you haven't read this by now, you might want to put this on your ""must read"" list soon!...more",Notes are private!,2,47,1,not set,"May 10, 2023","Apr 16, 2023",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/35396595-sweet-little-lies

The author does a beautiful job as she captures the themes of literature, philosophy, the search for happiness, and love within the pages. It is full of substance, and one can safely expect to find beauty, truth, and goodness in it. It asks the right questions and provides the proper directions for the reader to find the answers. It is, at the very least, a call to deeper thought, and at the very most, a call to much higher things. One can expect to find within these delightfully water colored-covers the key to the good life. As an example, many times I had to stop and pause because I was so swept up in the philosophy discourses between the characters (at times trying to sort it out while having the secret wish to have that mind). I even copied a few sentiments down so I could return to them. As an example, on page 243, “If you travel in a hurry, without pausing or resting, you’ll return without having found what you’re looking for.” How many times can you relate to that on your travels? And…on page 54, “This is where she discovered that intelligence, this wonderful gift, grows in silence, not in noise. It was here too that she learned that a human mind, a truly human mind, is nurtured over time, with hard work and discipline.” As a life-long learner it gives me a wondrous thrill to know learning never stops, and that my mind is still in the process of nurturing and/or sharing what I learn… and, that intelligence can be ever growing. I loved this book. I was not only charmed and delighted, but obliged to sit and truly contemplate its message. This is the book for book discussion groups to discuss! As a final note, I did something I haven't done in a long time. I purchased a copy of this book for my personal library. And I put my  between the pages. To remind me of the love that I feel for it. Sometimes a book does that to you, long after you close the last page....more",Notes are private!,6,35,1,"Nov 23, 2022","Apr 16, 2023","Apr 16, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18774984-the-awakening-of-miss-prim

After all, it won the 2021 Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Then again…Not all Pulitzer Prize winners are great books. And…This one has mixed s. I am one of them.The novel takes place in the 1950’s. The novel’s title character is Thomas Wazhashk. He is a night watchman for a factory where women work during the day using gemstones as drill bits for the Defense Department. One of the workers is his niece, Patrice, also known as Pixie. Thomas’ main job is to watch over the gems, and protect them from thieves. The novel will follow the fate of these two characters. This story is inspired by Erdrich’s grandfather, who wrote many, many letters to politicians in Washington, in an effort to save his tribe from termination. The current and ongoing nightmare of missing and murdered Native women lurks in the shadows of the book. Although moved by the subject matter...I had difficulty connecting to her writing of it. I appreciate all that the author shared about her grandfather, and the historical issues shared in her afterword notes. Including Erdrich’s following note…“Indeed, the Trump administration and Assistant Secretary of the Interior Tara Sweeney have recently brought back the termination era by seeking to terminate the Wampanoag, the tribe who first welcomed Pilgrims to these shores and invented Thanksgiving.”It was mostly through this history, past and present, that encouraged her to write this story. So…Even if the story didn’t resonate with me as much as I would have liked, we all see and read the same book and have our own perspectives. I encourage you to still read this one, and form your own thoughts about it.I leave the last words with Erdrich…“…if you should ever doubt that a series of dry words in a government document can shatter spirits and demolish lives, let this book erase that doubt. Conversely, if you should be of the conviction that we are powerless to change those dry words, let this book give you heart.”...more",Notes are private!,6,20,1,not set,"Dec 08, 2023","Apr 16, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/53746633-the-night-watchman

He is dyslexic, and amazingly well-managed for an individual who sought his own life at the age of 14. As we first meet Enzi we are drawn in to his world by the author’s thoughtful way of presenting him – soft, invisible, resilient, awkward, likable, human, gracious, survivor. And then… We have an opportunity to meet Enzi in the future as we come into the next chapter. As his older self, we watch Enzi navigate some difficult decisions. The flow of writing kept me engaged and interested and concerned about what was happening, or could happen, or why he was doing what he was doing. And oh what a tangled captivating crime mystery thriller plot for us readers to experience. Some bad things will happen, and we will be stirred and gripped as we follow along wondering, what will Enzi do? Will Enzi grow wise, or will his trust in others guide him down a path he will regret? Will he show courage to change, or grow into a better version of what he always hoped for himself? The supporting characters are believably real. You can feel like you know them. Even if you don’t want to. Mostly, the author makes us want to turn pages as quickly as we read them. In this way, the author is an artist with words. Highly recommend that you take a walk through Enzi’s life in this stunning novel. Many thanks go to the publisher Flooding Island Press for providing me with a copy of this print book.

It will be a bumpy ride! ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"May 30, 2023","Apr 16, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/24937499-her-final-breath

First let me say that I have been a long time fan of Charlie DonleHere is another book that I have read and I am now bringing my  to Goodreads. First let me say that I have been a long time fan of Charlie Donlea. So, any time a book of his becomes available, I am usually ready and willing to check it out at our local library. And sometimes, I decide to look back and see if I can play catch up on some I may have missed, like this one, which is his debut novel. So where do I begin in trying to describe this one - because I have lots of mixed feelings. That is why I would say it is a 3.5 star for me. Let's start here.Gripping. Edgy. Dark. Suspenseful - murder mystery. It opens with a shocking scene and ends with a shocking twist. However, it also leaves readers with some unanswered questions. In my mind, that is a big no no. As much as I am a lover of mysteries, and crime fiction, and such, I am not in to darkness. Okay, I loved Harry Potter. But, if it is too dark, it's like watching a horror film, and I am going to be the one that will walk out of the room, or cover my eyes, and say, ""is it over yet?"" Kind of hard when you are reading a book. How do you know when to come back to the right page? Anyway, this story is fast-paced and can be considered captivating told in a past and present timeline with alternating points of view between Becca (her story before her death) and Kelsey (an investigative reporter looking into her death). Yet, in many respects, these alternating P.O.V.'s were the interesting parts of the book.

I wasn’t going to go down that troubling path of reading a book series out of order. So…I began to read.Our main protagonist is Mike Bowditch, a young Maine game warden. Now, what is particularly tricky, is that he is put into the middle of a very serious investigation.The main suspect…His father. How does one overcome this?So…What readers come to experience is a young man’s struggle, at the beginning of a promising career, attempting to balance the demands of a profession, with the expectations of family loyalty. An interesting premise, to say the least. Readers have the opportunity to tag along with Mike wondering how he is going to handle his dysfunctional family circumstances.Did his father commit the murder? No spoilers from me.At the same time, readers are also getting to know Mike. And…Is he a character we are going to want to root for and follow into a successful continuing series?Most importantly…Will he do the right and just thing? Tracking down his father, through the Maine terrain (an interesting character in itself), readers experience Mike and his father navigate their past and present relationship. What stands out the most…Is the attention paid to location and sense of place. I have said this many times in my s how much a place can be just as much a character – because it appeals to our senses – the images – the awakening of our imagination to the location, that some of us may never witness. (I for one, have only seen the tip of Maine from an airplane.) So…What do I really think?This is an engaging plot with solid characters… Because…Of the environment and the conflicts that arise within it. I imagine that the series will prove to be quite successful, too. ...more",Notes are private!,4,13,1,not set,"Oct 07, 2023","Apr 16, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6905079-the-poacher-s-son

Frances has been famous, rich and stylish. Her husband, Franklin was a corrupt, scary lawyer. He dies in bed, and now his money has run out.

This story is character driven. There is tension. A meticulous investigation. A chase at the end. And clarity as to what occurred and why. Even if it isn't edge of the seat exciting. And a TV series, if interested....more",Notes are private!,12,31,1,not set,"Jun 04, 2023","Apr 16, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56269063-the-heron-s-cry

HI wanted to read this book because I have a secret passion for The Great British Baking Show, better known in Britian as The Great British Bake Off. How can you not appreciate famous bakers Mary Berry (original), or Prue Leith and Paul Hollywood judging these passionate amateur bakers? And we as viewers get to salivate over the amazing dishes they are baking. For those who are also fans, have you ever tried to bake any of them? And if you did, have you come close to succeeding? (Sorry, I couldn’t help but ask!) Of course, it is the ultimate baking battle for the crown of Best Amateur Baker – given as a glass plate. Now, with this story (yes, finally the  of the book), we have an Americanized version. We are introduced to six amateur bakers who will compete in a tent (sound familiar – to those who may also be fans of the show), vying for the coveted Golden Spoon. (Hence the title of the book!) While competing they will be staying at a beautiful manor in Vermont owned by the famous baker, cookbook author and hostess of Bake Week, Betsy Martin. She has been doing this show solo for 12 years, but now this year she is having to co-host with someone she resents, award winning baker Archie Morris. Archie Morris’ character when described sounds very similar to popular Hell’s Kitchen host, Gordon Ramsay. So, you can imagine how keen Betsy is about having Archie as her co-host. In her mind, he’s just not the right person for her cerebral cooking competition show. Now that we have the basics out of the way…let’s begin at the prologue. It’s a rainy, thundering dark and stormy night. When Betsy ventures out to check if everything is okay out in the tent, she sees red. And it probably isn’t frosting. Did someone conveniently leave something off of their resume when they applied to be an amateur baker for this show? The ultimate exciting beginning to a cozy mystery. Or not. Sound cliché? Do we now get a chance to know what this red is all about? Has a murder occurred – and if it has, can we know who the victim is? Of course not! On we go to meet all the contestants! And this is how the story goes. Each chapter is told in different narrative voices – the competing bakers, and Betsy, over the course of the competition – bread, pie and cake. And it’s not until approximately page 217 that we hear a blood curdling scream (oh sorry, maybe that was me!), and finally we as readers are faced with the body! The victim. By this point, do we care? What will happen now? Who did it? Why? But things aren’t as it seems. There are some twists and turns in this silly who-dun-it. If you are willing to stick with it. Is there justice in the end? Some readers might salivate over the culinary sections, but non-foodies may be bored by all the relentless details. For the record, I really wanted to like this book, but when the characters aren’t even likeable, it makes it very difficult to care what happened next. I hear that this book is in development as a limited series for Hulu. Maybe, that might be a better medium to convey the novel’s intent? And usually, I am one who likes the book better than the movie.

Child is a billionaire investor of an algorithm that a prestigious law firm is using to launder money. Child is not charged with any white collar crime, and is assured this is an open and shut case. What he is charged with is the murder of his girlfriend. Not all things are going to be simple for Eddie. There is a catch. Or shall we say an incentive. Eddie's wife is also an attorney, and apparently she has signed a paper that could implicate her in an illegal operation that could get her prison time. So... if he can get David to obtain a plea deal, the Feds will drop the case against his wife. What is up with the Feds and this case, really?So Eddie meets David. He believes him to be innocent. But, court cases are not about truth, they are about what can be proved and what a jury will believe. As Eddie attempts to prove his clients case as innocent, things start to happen to Eddie.

She is excited to meet this woman because she had bought a beautiful pair of earrings from the woman's online store.""How long have you been a jeweler?"" Brené asks.Blushing, the young woman answers… ""I wish. I'm just a CPA. I'm not a real jeweler.”Brené writes… 'I thought to myself, I'm wearing your earrings right now, not your abacus.'

I just do it because I love it.""Since when did our passion require an apology?Or, let’s ask it this way; since when did paying attention to and following our heart require some kind of justification?And tell me, what's the detriment in being “just a” CPA?It's as if there is some capricious seed of scarcity that takes root in our spirit, and measures everything we do, or yearn for, or desire, against some unattainable bar of ""not good enough."" For whatever else happens, when it comes to our heart, we believe--and convince ourselves--that we're not jeweler enough. Or CPA enough. Or good enough. Or... fill in the blank... enough.There is no doubt that our sense of not enough is exacerbated in a world under a cloud of uncertainty and fear. Days when we don’t have words (or solutions, or prayers) enough. To make things worse we are susceptible to the cultural hook that what we are paid for, is who we are. And we park our identity there in the never ending place of: ""So... what do you do?""So... let us Change the question. Instead of ‘what do you do’ – ask yourself and others: ‘what fuels you? What makes you come alive?’ This way we don’t allow our well-being to become attached to the wrong measurement.“Just” Instead...

I am now bringing my  to Goodreads.Readers learn quite quickly that this is the story about Beth Murphy who has taken elaborate steps to plot her escape from an abusive husband. We also find that Sabine Hardison’s husband comes home to find Sabine is missing. There is one detective very determined to find out what happened to these 2 missing women. The author, goes into immense detail about how Beth planned her escape, what steps she takes to bury her identity, and how and why she chooses Atlanta as her final destination. What readers don’t find out is the name of her abusive husband – because in Beth’s anguished musings, he is you – the reader. (Kind of creepy, right?)Alternating with Beth’s escape narrative is the story of missing wife Sabine. Her husband Jeffrey comes home from a 4-day seminar to find his house empty. Let’s play our own detective, shall we?Beth drives away on Oklahoma’s Muskogee Hwy, she meets an accomplice in Tulsa Oklahoma. Jeffrey and Sabine share a house on the Arkansas River. Could Beth be Sabine? Is the author playing with readers?Beth is doing the been-here-before kind of stuff – the cutting of the hair – dying it – checking into seedy hotels – going back in time with the memories of abuse, et al. Now Ingrid, Sabine’s twin sister is all mad at Jeffrey, wanting to know where she is. She begins to interrogate him. She has no fear of him. But no answers are forthcoming. So, the questions remain. Where is Sabine? And who is Beth? Will Sabine be found alive and will Beth survive if her husband tracks her down?This is a terrifying page-turner with a conclusion that is entirely unexpected.

Between 1999 and 2003, John Gilkey used dozens of credit card numbers acquired from his department store job to steal $100,000 worth of rare books before he was caught and sent to jail. It was through the efforts of one bookseller named Ken Sanders that Gilkey found his way to jail, and Bartlett’s interest as a journalist, that this story found its way into its own book.Bartlett seems to want to make something more of his crime by asking, “what is it about books that made him continually risk jail time for them?” But what we come to learn, through her interviews with him, isn’t his obsession with books, it’s his obsession with stealing, period. On the other hand, we have the thief’s antagonist, Ken Sanders, a “rare-book dealer and self-styled sleuth.” He was the one who helped track down John Gilkey. His job is to protect booksellers from theft and fraud. But what we learn is that his role is mostly sending out e-mail. So, how important is this book really?Who gets more book time in the end? The journalist herself… the author. She even spends time touring a bookstore with Gilkey that he once victimized.

Alex is a budding scientist, grows up in a small WiscoCatching up…Reading a GR friends beautiful  reminded me that I needed to get mine posted. Alex is a budding scientist, grows up in a small Wisconsin town, in a household full of secrets. No one will tell her why her mother disappears for months, and/or why her unmarried Aunt Marla moves in to take care of the family. Or…Why her father disappears into his work, sometimes not returning home at night. Meanwhile…Something is going on in her community, as women spontaneously “dragon,” erupting that sometimes levels buildings. Of course, these isolated eruptions are suppressed and not discussed by local news or police, and fire crews respond to the “incidents.” Scientists who seek answers to the phenomenon are called in for questioning and blackballed from their universities. Considering this stifling environment, Aunt Marla is a breath of fresh air. As a mechanic in a body shop she stares down men who cross her. Then Aunt Marla disappears during a “mass dragooning” of nearly 650,000 women, leaving a baby behind. Beatrice is adopted as Alex’s “sister,” and any mention of her aunt or dragons is forbidden. Her mother begins obsessively weaving knots, and her parents cut off Alex’s friendship with a neighbor girl, who then disappears. The odder things became, the more Alex is forced to pretend she doesn’t see what she sees.The silence and conformity – “mass forgetting” are as suffocating as a world that uplifts men while constraining women to secondary roles. As a reader it feels like an indictment of a system of gender apartheid.And yet as readers…We have an opportunity to watch Alex navigate her first relationship and find her own path, and shift from the suffocating conformity of the 1950s. But…We can’t help but feel the bruising of the current decisions of the Supreme Court that have affected women, and the push to ban books, and how important freedom is…Especially the voice of women. We don’t ever want to lose that. I believe the author was making a point here. And…It wasn’t subtle. Books can provide important messages that way.

I am now bringing my  to Goodreads.This is another Amos Decker thriller, Baldacci’s FBI high-profile consultant, who was a former cop and football player. For those who have been following the series, Decker is known as the Memory Man because he was sidelined after a head injury with the most unusual side effect: a perfect photographic memory. This serves him well in investigations. He has a partner, Alex Jamison. Before I begin, I have to say…This may be the most unusual, strange, fun, Decker story yet. The story begins with Decker and Alex being sent to an area to investigate a murder, which is actually controversial in real life. And Baldacci is known for bringing “real life” issues into his fictional stories. In this case, North Dakota is the oil fracking center of the nation, so as readers we are getting a blow by blow on how it is done and what adverse effects it brings. Still…It has been a boom for this small town in which this murder has occurred, making the city fathers very rich, and well, somewhat strange. Now…it gets a bit stranger. Down the road is a sort-of-former Air Force early warning facility that has some mysterious goings-on. Even stranger…A religious cult commune which is next to this sort-of-former Air Force facility, had employed the dead woman as a school teacher, when she wasn’t working as an escort. (Are you following all of this?)The coroner keeps uncovering clues, Decker’s brother-in-law shows up, and the story keeps getting stranger. But as readers, we keep wanting more…information that is! Because this is Baldacci, after all! But then…Who should walk in…but…Super-secret agent/assassin Will Robie and his partner Jessica Reel, accompanied by their super-secret boss Blue Man (from another popular Baldacci series) to help. Did I say this was going to be fun – or what? Just go with it.

I am now bringing my  to Goodreads.One of my favorite genres to read is legal thrillers. I love to be in the courtroom. I love watching Justice in action. Especially after they have done all the work to catch the “bad guy.” And as readers, we typically know or suspect who the bad guy is, so to see the lawyers work their magic (the authors write it) is always fascinating to me. I also typically like this author. So, I was ready to read this one. Premise: Jason Rich is an attorney. He is an alcoholic who has been reprimanded by the bar for appearing under the influence in court. And now his sister, Jana has been arrested for the murder of her husband. The killer has been arrested but he says he was paid by Jana to do the job. Jana asks Jason to defend her, even though he has never tried a criminal case in his life. Jason decides to take the case on mostly because he cares about his niece. This is the first book in the series, so there is a lot to set up – getting us familiar with Jason, his background and his struggles. This takes up about the first half of the book – and this in some ways drags the book down for me because of all the subplots. Maybe they will show up in future books? Either way, it just seemed to be a bit much, and took away from the story. I also am not one to feel comfortable with a character and their addictions. So, I was glad that not too much attention was put into this other than to make note of it. Still, because this is an issue, it makes me less than comfortable whether it is a character/series I would want to follow. Also, the ending was a bit unsatisfying. Was the author trying to lead us to the next book? And if so, I am not happy that we as readers are being set up in this way. Sorry, no spoilers. Yes, there was courtroom drama. I will give it that…But…For all the other reasons… This is why the stars are low on this one. And why you won’t find me following the Jason Rich series. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Jul 26, 2023","Apr 15, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/58920609-rich-blood

Would everyone cry out “reverse sexism?” The novel depicts a world in which women, empowered by a genetic mutation that enables them to harness and wield electrical currents, ultimately find themselves capable of the same greed and cruelty as their male counterparts. In many ways, this novel wants to be introspective, exploring the many reasons why a paradigm in which gender expression aligns with power – physical, economic, even political – in creating a better world than we want it to be. The premise of this story, is that Neil Armon has written the novel that he turns over to the writer, Naomi Alderman for an early read. In this novel he gives a physical ability to young women (typically teenagers) that spreads quickly as a viral video, simultaneously awakened in girls around the world. This power, an electricity gathered in a physical organ connected to the collarbone called a “skein,” is coursing through their bodies. With the touch of a fingertip, or water, they can shock another person. Torture and kill, too. And thus, the zapping begins. Can you imagine what the world might have looked like with the reversal of the 2016 election?This book does. I won’t go into all the places this plot goes with this zapping – the variety of characters – the satirical upside-down world created between the author’s book world and what does or doesn’t happen. What I will say is…There is truly an underlying message regarding women’s empowerment. My question is…Is this the appropriate way to create this message – through this story?

When I looked inside, I saw many John Grisham novels. Now my heart was palpitating! Someone must have given me and this neighborhood heaven on earth! (Okay, I may be exaggerating here – I know not everyone is a Grisham fan, and sometimes, not even I give him 4-5 stars (see above for this one), but, seriously, he really is a good writer, for the most part – and that day was a good day for my LFL!)On to my .Premise: The story begins with young brothers Mark (11) and Ricky (8) witnessing the suicide of a lawyer. But before dying he shares some secrets about the murder of Senator Boyette. The incident leaves Ricky in a coma and Mark shaken. Enter the FBI to solve the murder of Boyette. Mark is terrified something is going to happen to him so he refuses to talk. Reggie a lawyer is assigned to help Mark. There are some good characters here. Mark for one. He’s young. Brave. Courageous. Strong. Fierce, while being naïve, terrified and willing to cry. Reggie the lawyer. Sweet, tough, funny with heart. Also, strong and fierce when it was called for. She could also be witty and sly.Judge Harry cared about the kid’s welfare. We don’t always see this, and he was portrayed well. The story gives excellent insight into child mentality while also touching on some of the social aspects of child delinquency.The suspense of the story is quite compelling. There are other areas of the story which moved slowly and seemed over-used as the criminal element. (Won’t say because I don’t want to give away any spoilers.)Yet...The story is good with some action and suspense and courtroom drama to keep readers engaged.Still…The end. Emotional.

She played Annalise Keating in “How to Get Away with Murder.” I was mesmerized by her smart, sassy, hypnotic performances each week. The depth of her acting was fierce and I remember my husband and I shaking our heads each week wondering…Who is she really? When her memoir came out, I was first in line to check it out at my local library. I wanted to know more about the person behind the persona. By this time, I had now had the opportunity to see several of her movies and other television productions. I was definitely a fan. I had already determined that she was an astonishingly, multidimensional, superbly, talented and gifted actor. What would her story reveal to me, as a reader?Her memoir opens with a telling scene from her childhood. An upbringing marked by trauma, that undoubtedly took years to process. This scene involved bullying, something that would follow her throughout her young life.“This was one more piece of trauma I was experiencing – my clothes, my hair, my hunger, too – and my home life being the big daddy of them all. The attitude, anger and competitiveness were my only weapons.” And thus…We know where she came from and why…And what motivated her to be what she would become. Her home life is described matter-of-factly. She doesn’t downplay any of it. We will read the good, the bad and the ugly of it. And…It becomes all too clear, how the angry, defensive child – with everything against her – would have just enough fight in her – to go on to Juilliard – because of that same fight in her – to eventually win two Tony awards. She also won an Emmy for “How to Get Away with Murder.” This memoir is also a testimonial to the hard work it takes to overcome adversity. And…It also is great advice for aspiring actors. She is a prideful, Black woman, hoping for more opportunities for other Black women that won’t just be relegated to a convenient folder labeled “Black performers.” Still…It is about joy with life. Her prose is forthright and supple and delightful and direct.

Let me say, even for a novella, this is an amazing selection for a discussion with a group of people. It is a tragic story that touches on class struggle, race, sexism, alongside the main theme of friendship and loyalty. George and Lennie are journeying on foot through rural Depression-era CA. They are headed towards a ranch where they hope to get work. George is small and sharp, but can be easily frustrated. Lennie is huge but very simple-minded and impulsive. The two together are trouble. Yet, they also have a dream of the future where they hope to work their own land and have a simple life. In many ways we hope that George and Lennie can realize their dreams. But, you also know that Steinbeck isn't that kind of writer to make it easy on his characters. He sets too many other things in motion that creates conflict. And through this short novella, there are powerful scenes, relevant themes with much room for interpretation. Is this the American Dream? What about the imbalance of power? Were the characters more caricatures than characters because the story was short?

One night while he is away, her place is burgled, and she is attacked by someone who seems intent on harming her. Her boyfriend returns to comfort her for a few days, but then he leaves, and then she leaves for an assignment.

Apparently Lo has been taking anti-depressants and drinking (a lot), so her accounting of what occurred is not something to be exactly trusted, since nobody else seems to believe her, and no body seems to have been found. Of course, by the time any one is rounded up, where is the body? Now, being on a cruise ship, it is almost like this is a locked room scenario. So the killer must be on board, and does any of this have to do with the burglary and/or attack to Lo prior to the cruise? Lo's POV sometimes feels misleading, unreliable, and the drug-induced affects just gets to be too much. The constant reference to her ""state of mind"", and drinking ... well it grew tiresome. After awhile I wasn't sure I could believe anything - or whether I cared, or if I wanted to believe anything. The overall (plot) storyline seemed like it could be intriguing, but by the time it got to the ending I felt somewhat exhausted and disappointed. Yes there was suspense, but it was chaotic, and that didn't work for me. 2.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,not set,"May 11, 2023","Apr 14, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28187230-the-woman-in-cabin-10

Which…Added a fresh and engaging perspective to the discussion. In this small, but mighty book, the author’s intention was not only to shine the light on feminism but to redefine it by making readers aware of what she believed has been the “blatant discrimination and insidious, institutional behaviors that marginalize women around the world.”Her intention was to showcase cultural biases, by showing how the culture treats boys and girls differently, and how the gender divide could be harmful for women and men alike. “We do a great disservice to boys in how we raise them. We stifle the humanity of boys.” She argues that feminism aims to deconstruct gender roles and binaries that are harmful to males, too. Through our discussion we wondered if gender privilege for men came at a price. As readers, we could surmise that her hope is that we as a society can affect change. She shares a desire for hope by creating a reframing of feminism in the modern era.And yet…She was still shining a light on her awareness of invisibility as a woman of color. And…Of women in general. And wondered if that would ever change for women. There was a section in the book where she discussed how women feel the need to dress like men in certain situations in order to gain more respect. We wondered how that made each of us feel – men and women alike. And…Why? Is it because of the definitions we assign to gender within our society and culture?This was an amazing book discussion selection. Her book had so many relevant issues to address. And…So many questions to uncover and strip away about gender roles and identity and respect and the gap between male and female success and mobility.

It was perfectly planned and expertly executed. Mysteries should be cunning and clever, and Ms. Christie was brilliant with this one. The title tells us that Roger Ackroyd is murdered, and the story attempts to sift through various clues to determine who committed the crime. There are many culprits. It appears so standard on the surface as to what could have happened, but it is anything but standard. What is masterful about the plot is that we are kept guessing until the end. And that has a lot to do with the characters, and the narration. But most importantly is the end. What makes it so climactic is the build up without the reader being aware of where it is going. Even if we suspect, the ending is still SO satisfying it leaves readers much room for plenty of theorizing and contemplation. Brilliant. Brilliant. Brilliant.

She is a writer who is quite attached to books, because, “they made me feel less alone.” And…So, her point was if she wrote, others would feel less alone, too. Lucy’s story is about loneliness. It shares glimpses of her childhood of hardship, shunned by her Amgash classmates, as well as, living in a world not quite open to hugs by her adult friends in New York. In fact, her current friends wouldn’t have an understanding of what it was like to live with little heat, or food or no books, or no magazines or tv. So…Now, there was a lot for Lucy to catch up on. This is a story, too about Lucy’s time in the hospital with a mysterious infection for almost 9 weeks in New York in the mid-80’s. At that time, she had a husband and 2 small daughters aged 5 and 6, but she had been largely estranged from her parents since her marriage. Mostly, her father, didn’t like her husband because he was of German extraction with “blond German looks.” And… As a WWII veteran, that was blasphemy for his daughter to marry someone of German descent. But…Because Lucy is in the hospital, her mother comes for a visit, and she remains in the hospital room with her the entire stay. And…Slowly the ice between them melts. While…Spending time gossiping about the fates of some of the girls and women of Lucy’s youth. But…They don’t talk about Lucy’s dad. Or her brother. Or her present life in NY. Or even her present success as an author. Or even her young family and new friends. Lucy was just happy to have her mother with her.For readers, we can reflect on family. Solace and love.

Marie-Laure lives in Paris near the Museum of Natural History where her father works. When she is 12, the Nazis occupy Paris and they flee to live with their uncle by the sea. They take with them a valuable and dangerous jewel from the museum. In a mining town in Germany, Werner, an orphan, grows up with his younger sister, enchanted by a crude radio they find that brings them news and stories from places they have never seen or imagined. Werner becomes an expert at building and fixing crucial new instruments and is enlisted to use his talent during the resistance. It is clear that Werner does not believe in the Nazis even though he is forced to join them. “Werner is succeeding. He is being loyal. He is being what everybody agrees is good. And yet every time he wakes and buttons his tunic, he feels he is betraying something.” (Page 250)What will be key here, are not just the characters and what they “see” or “hear” but what the importance will be with the jewel. How will their lives intersect and why will it be important? Doerr has a way with words, his description of things, his flair for aesthetics. Did I sense a little magical realism here? Werner is supposed to be a villain. He is after all a Nazi, right? But why are we liking him? There is conflict here, and yet we are watching and waiting as to how the author is going to bring Marie-Laure and Werner together, because isn’t that the eventual intent? As readers, isn’t that what we are wanting? “My God, there are none so distant that fate cannot bring them together.” (page 120)...more",Notes are private!,0,87,1,not set,"Jun 17, 2023","Apr 14, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18143977-all-the-light-we-cannot-see

This book is comprised mostly of humorous tidbits from her journey to stardom. She also gives advice to women in the workforce. What was obvious was the messages she wanted to get across: She wasn't there to play second to a man, she was there to do what she wanted to do whether they liked it or not. She also shares strong advice for women: 1) Use their voice. 2) Speak in statements rather than apologetic questions. She writes, ""Don't be fooled, you're not in competition with other women, you're in competition with everyone.""

I remember how sad I felt about his diagnosis of cancer, and yet, how moved I was by his courage. This man was so inspiring to me. His book was moving, even though there was much to read about what he was personally experiencing was heart-breaking and obviously fatal. Because…We have a young, once vibrant 36-year-old non-smoker, neurosurgeon with lung cancer. He was a rising star at Stanford University School of Medicine when he first began to experience weight loss, and severe back pain that led him to see a fellow physician which would reveal multiple tumors and his diagnosis. In that single moment, he writes, “the future I imagined, the one just about to be realized, the culmination of decades of striving, evaporated.” As readers, we can’t help but feel his heartbreak, too. Because this diagnosis not only stole his future, it stole his identity. He asks, “Who would I be, going forward, and for how long?” How many times in life have we gone through a life introspection? The why am I here – where do I want to go now? What am I meant to do now? Kinds of questions. We are given great insights into his medical training, his steady diet of literature, his learned background, his contemplative disposition and his kindness. Many times, we understand that some doctors want to become doctors for the money, status, and what they can gain from their position. For him, he wanted to “forge relationships with the suffering, and to keep following the question of what makes humans life meaningful, even in the face of death and decay.” And now what about his own? Here he is as a patient. His words are endearing for his honesty. We watch him persevere through tortuous chemo treatments. But he was unable to finish the book. His wife, Lucy wrote the epilogue, and finished the manuscript. Even Abraham Verghese’ foreword adds some perspective to the first-person account.There are so many moments in the book. Kleenex please. Holding his child for the first time, as he lies on a cot in the same hospital room where his wife has just given birth to their daughter, he writes, “the possibilities of life emanated before us.” And yet, a few pages later he says we are reminded that only memory and words, “have a longevity I do not.” Please…Pass the Kleenex. 4.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,9,36,1,not set,"Jul 15, 2023","Apr 14, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25614898-when-breath-becomes-air

I always enjoyed reading Maeve Binchy short stories in-between my novels. She was such a cozy writer in so many ways. Besides, what better way to travel to Chestnut Street in Dublin, Ireland and meet up with the neighbors?Binchy was such a lyrical writer, too. (This book was published after her death in 2012.) You almost feel like you are one of the many people present in the story. In this collection, her husband tells us in the introduction that Binchy wrote the stories over a period of decades, with the intention of tying them together so that they just would flow between each other. Her editors attempted to do that with the 36 they collected for this volume.Readers can sense the feeling of community and connection through the lives and loves and relationships of the various individuals who come and go through the pages. What I have always loved about Binchy is her ability to capture human nature in such a realistic way. Even if there is tension, or more questions than answers, there is a story to be told, and characters and settings that have been brought to life. Sometimes characters may even pop over into another story. Most importantly, it reminds us that there is something important about being a neighbor.

Yes?So, AJ Fikry is a cantankerous guy who happens to own Island Books in the fictional resort village of Alice Island, off the coast of Massachusetts. The novel begins with an encounter between Fikry and Amelia, a publisher sales rep, which goes poorly, due to his bad behavior. Now, let's not be all mean about Fikry. He is suffering, his wife has recently died. Book sales are down. He doesn't have any friends. And his prized asset (his retirement) ""Tamerlane"" a rare collection of poetry by Edgar Allen Poe has been stolen. The chief of police, Chief Lambiase, who is kind, gets involved because of the burglary. Now...moving on...Fikry's life becomes complicated when a precocious 2 year old named Maya is abandoned in his bookstore. It is determined that her mother drowned. So, Fikry adopts her. Moving on...Life is transformed for everyone. The author adds twists, makes it enjoyable, even if it is a predictable story. Of course, what makes it especially delicious for me, is that the main focus of this book, are the books and the character's relationship with them. Each chapter begins with a shelf talker - a mini  of a classic novel which are penned by Fikry. I was in love with the story and the premise and the characters.

He is a retired divorcee living in suburban England. He appears haunted by a chain of incidents that occurred when he was a teenager in the early 1960's. Most significantly it was when one of his friends commits suicide after he had made a girl pregnant. Even as we visit that past event and his boyhood friends, they graduate and go their separate ways. We see Tony at university where he meets his first girlfriend, Veronica. That relationship doesn't work out for him, and she goes off to date his friend Adrian, who then he learns commits suicide. Tony meets another girl, marries her, has a child and appears to forget the whole situation about Veronica and Adrian. His wife has an affair and they divorce. Years later he receives from Adrians mother some money and his diary. Tony learns more than he ever imagined. The question for me as the reader is did I really care for the introspective musings from a middle-aged, self-centered protagonist who tried to find meaning in a rather mundane, uneventful life? Could Tony ever have been a better friend if he even tried once to get out of his head?

A lot of us were dealing with either aging parents, or our own feelings about death and dying. His focus was on assisted living. I was caregiving my mother, and my husband was caregiving his father in the same assisted living environment. So, this discussion and book was very personal for me, at the time. My Mom and father-in-law have since passed on. (Interestingly, within two weeks of each other.) But I remember how helpful this book was for me, and the group of men and women who surrounded me in discussion that day. We shared how to distill what mattered most to each of us in life so that we could navigate our way toward the edge in a meaningful and satisfying way. I won’t go into the various stories that he shares about the different people through his pages, I think that is best read by readers, but he did bring up a variety of heartfelt statements that were meaningful discussion moments for us as a group. As an example…“It is not death that the very old tell me they fear. It is what happens short of death.” In our discussion, we wondered how our family would feel about telling them, “I’m ready to go” or even if we would know how we would feel when we were ready to go. It was that fine line about striking a balance between fear of death and just being ready to let go. I remember that this wasn’t an easy discussion to have with my mother. Especially as her mind began slipping from the Dementia with Lewy Bodies/Parkinson’s Disease. One day, my mother shared with me that she was afraid of her own pending death. I tried to calm her. I remember her asking me what stage she was in of Parkinson’s disease. And I tried to explain it to her as sensitively as I could. I found out that after I left, her caregiver called me and said she was in tears, because she thought she was going to die soon. I drove back to her immediately, to calm her again and reassure her that wasn’t the case. I realized then, that this was only the beginning that things were going downhill for her – mind. So much of our discussion about this book, talked about the various fears and challenges associated about end-of-life. The book asked us to consider…How can we appreciate, honor, value a life, our well-being to live and die in dignity?I certainly appreciated the experience of this book in working with my mother through her end-of-life.

She has a way of crafting a character, that makes readers feel engaged.This was another Library Book Discussion selection. The museum is a Coney Island boardwalk attraction presided over by Professor Sardie. Inside live various people with various unusual characteristics and unusual names – i.e., Wolfman, the Butterfly Girl, the Goat Boy, the Bird Woman, the Bee Woman and so forth. Also, living with Sardie, is his “daughter,” Coralie, who has, from the age of 10, spent hours suspended in a tank of water playing the human mermaid for paying customers. And…As she has gotten older, he insists she perform lewd for paying customers after hours. Coralie, who narrates part of the story, has a freakish affinity for water. Her father has trained her to swim extraordinary distances, even in the icy November Atlantic, most often at night. She is at home in the tidal currents of the Hudson River. Coralie also hides a secret shame. She was born with webbed fingers. She hides them when she is not playing the human mermaid. As it so happens…There are sightings of a sea monster in the Hudson River. And of course, Professor Sardie wants this monster as part of his living displays for his museum. Little does he know, that it is his own 18-year-old Coralie. In the meantime, one evening, on one of her nocturnal swims, Coralie emerges and catches a glimpse of a reclusive photographer named Ezekiel Cohen who likes to walk his dog in the woods of northern Manhattan. He has abandoned his Jewish faith, and changed his name to Eddie. Eddie has his own history.He was witness to the terrible Triangle shirtwaist factory fire, and he is attempting to solve the mystery of a young woman’s disappearance. Once Coralie and Eddie discover each other, their mystical attraction and mutual obsession become forces of their own, driving the story forward. There is so much to love and hate about this story. Girls with unusual talents, love at first sight, mysterious parents, addiction and alcoholism, orphans raised by unsuitable people, how people treat others that are different….I can go on. But…It is Alice Hoffman. And…As a storyteller, she does mesmerize readers with her words. And that…If nothing else…Makes for a great discussion....more",Notes are private!,4,25,1,not set,"Oct 07, 2023","Apr 14, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18144053-the-museum-of-extraordinary-things

This is a Pulitzer Prize winner. Does iI read and discussed this awhile ago with our library book group and I am now bringing my  to Goodreads. This is a Pulitzer Prize winner. Does it mean it is a good or a great book? I will be blunt with my personal opinion. My answer: No. Premise: This is the story of a teenager. Theo Decker. He survives a terrorist bombing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art while losing his mother in the attack. He walks off with the real-life 1654 masterpiece, The Goldfinch. And off we go with this story.This is a 784 page book. Another one of those books where the author feels they have a lot of story to tell. It is sprawling. It has larger-than-life characters. There are dark deeds. Surprising twists. And in the end, an emotional kick in the gut. Stephen King called this book, ""a smartly written library novel that connects with the heart as well as the mind."" Readers around the world agreed with him. Except this reader. Me. Maybe a few in my library group, too. I kept wondering if I was reading the same book he was? I remember sitting around the table with fellow book enthusiasts and we asked the question, what makes a work literature, and who gets to decide - especially whether it is worthy of a Pulitzer? We shook our heads and decided we really couldn't answer these simple questions - especially as it applied to The Goldfinch. Our complaint: the book seems to represent itself as serious fiction - but in our experience, we weren't feeling it. Some of the characters were more like caricatures. As far as the story, how will Theo get out of his situation? How will he grow up? Why did we have more questions than answers. It just seemed like the plot kept going on and on and on - but to where? And the characters - were any of them even likable? Most importantly...Is this a book that stands the test of time? You know like Steinbeck, or Jane Austen, or the Bronte sisters, or Wallace Stegner.

It is a screwball comedy about a brilliant, emotionally challenged geneticist who is determined to find a suitable wife. His way of doing it…Design his own questionnaire with the help of a patently unsuitable woman who keeps distracting him from his search. Of course, you have to appreciate the sweetness and charm with Don Tillman’s (our protagonist) geekiness. As our narrator, we can appreciate how appealing he is despite his eccentricities.What is obvious is that humans typically can’t see what is clearly in front of them, and that is what this book seems to play off of really well. And… Don’s character who is somewhere on the autism spectrum, is oblivious about his attraction to Rosie Jarman, a beautiful doctoral candidate in psychology. Because he can’t get his social cues, he thinks she is part of his “wife project.” Rosie, on the other hand, is on a Rosie “father project” trying to identify her biological father.

We also see her relationship blossoming with her boyfriend Adam, who also has a passion for music. And...We are also aware of her close-knit family. 'If I Stay' is a reminder of how short and innately sweet life is, and how we can’t take advantage of those people who matter most to us in our lives. Some ers saw this as sappy, and full of teen angst. At the time I read it, I guess I was up for just letting the feelings flow. I could feel the emotion. Sometimes it was… heart-wrenching and heart-warming, and at times funny. 3.5 stars.The movie version was released in August 2014. ...more",Notes are private!,0,55,1,not set,"Jul 15, 2023","Apr 14, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/4374400-if-i-stay

I am finally bringing my  to Goodreads.Premise: This book takes place in Germany, and has 3 primary POV’s, though Le Carre adds a few more later. The central protagonist is Issa Karpov, the son of a Russian war criminal and his Chechen “war bride.” Issa claims to have been tortured in prison. He now appears to readers as a traumatized refugee in Hamburg being sheltered by a couple of frightened Turkish immigrants. He seeks help from Annabel, a German civil rights attorney, who is sympathetic to his story, and attracted to him, as well. Issa leads her to Tommy Brue, a British banker, whose bank stashed his father’s fortune. Annabel seeks him out. Issa says he wants to become a doctor. Brue also wants to help Issa out, because he finds himself attracted to Annabel. Although it appears like a potential love triangle, nothing more than touching hands occurs. Apparently, as Annabel and Tommy attempt to help Issa, the Germans, the British and the Americans all want a piece of him. Why?The author appears to be doing a critique on the war on terror, but if that is all readers see, then the point is missed. Issa can be any stateless individual from the wrong place with the wrong background. No one really cares about his religion, only what he knows and who he knows. Le Carre does a good job of not being too preachy, but if he was attempting suspense, he failed at it. The story line is rather predictable. Still…The author attempts to write a complicated and compelling story. This isn’t necessarily a spy thriller, as the spies take a background seat, and the civilians take center stage.What we have here are grubby, believable, morally compromised protagonists. The question then becomes…Which was better – the book or the movie?...more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,not set,"Jul 05, 2023","Apr 14, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4940647-a-most-wanted-man

I am now bringing my  to Goodreads.I want to start out by being honest with you. I am conflicted about this one. This is a story about the Iraq war. It was a finalist for the National Book Awards, and one of the New York Times 10 best books of 2012. It also won the PEN/Hemingway award. In many ways it was a beautiful book, about this man's experience, but it was difficult to read, to discuss, because there are so many opinions about it (and I'm not just referring to the book). The war in Iraq was horrible, and such an infuriating and heartbreaking mistake. It was so costly to so many, and this author, captures much of that. He wants those of us who were untouched by the war to experience it from his perspective - what it meant - the damage it created to those who fought it - and the book brings it out. So what is my problem?Before I go there. Yellow Birds is described as a ""story of two soldiers trying to stay alive."" The narrator is 21 year old Bartie and an even younger soldier, Murphy, that Bartie befriends. The setting is Al Tafar, a horrific battleground. The author does a wonderful job of giving us a great description of the city, of the death...of the bodies. He doesn't hold back on the brutality of the situation. I think what was happening to me as a reader, was that I felt the author was speaking SO loudly to me. It just was too much. Was I being too sensitive as I was reading the story? It is powerful. It is a graphic testament to the pain of war. Maybe we (who weren't present) needed to be shaken out of our ignorance and complacency. Although I didn't feel that was how I was about it - I protested it vehemently - but, in truth, I wasn't in the midst of it. I have no doubt this book was received well. It probably should be. It just was difficult for me for all that I shared. Side note: It was a great discussion group selection. For us...Lots of emotions, thoughts and opinions came out on the table that day. We kept it even keel - stable, balanced, as best as any facilitator could under the circumstances of the subject....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,not set,"May 24, 2023","Apr 14, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13366259-the-yellow-birds

But to be honest, I didn't really finish the book, so if you choose not to read this , I am good with you walking away right now. Because that is what I did with this book. I will share what I recall. I am now bringing my  to Goodreads.This is a story of the unraveling of a marriage - well one that was based on being together for 20 years - maybe not in law, but time. The story begins about domesticity and ends as a whodunit. Each chapter has alternating voices between Him and Her giving the readers dual perspectives on the couple's life together. Jodi, the ""wife"" is a psychotherapist. Todd, the ""husband"" is a real estate mogul. Todd is an adulterous creep. Sorry...I couldn't help myself - it was my best description, in the moment of this . Jodi is uncomplaining, a rather...well... silent wife. One of the lines in the book shares...She knows Todd is ""a cheater, and he knows that she knows, but the point is that the pretense, the all-important pretense must be maintained, the illusion that everything is fine and nothing is the matter."" Why does Jodi put up with this? Apparently there is something from her past that keeps her tied to him. No spoilers from me. Todd in turn has his own excuses for his bad behaviors. And it gets disgusting - his latest, he has known since she was a baby. Can it get any worse? Yes, they named their dog, Freud. Is this the point where I exit the book, left?The author died before publication. Still the darkness of this story, the explicit sexuality. It left me extremely uncomfortable.

I am now bringing my  to Goodreads.Sometimes it is hard to go into another WWII holocaust story knowing what to expect. I was hesitant to read it, but, willing because I could appreciate a good discussion. And with WWII books about the holocaust, sometimes the books can showcase a new or different perspective – a part of history that hasn’t been told. It makes the story more palatable. The author’s central character, Andras Levi, is a promising student of architecture who leaves his native Hungary to study in Paris in the late 1930s — until his scholarship is revoked when anti-Jewish laws go into effect. As you might expect, the trials he and his wife and their extended families face will grow worse in the years to come.  Orringer provides another literary glimpse of the day-to-day horrors of that time, and also reminds us of the potential contributors to the postwar world – the architects and painters, the professionals and tradesmen – who were lost from this horrific war not just from battle but also from inhumane treatment. The strength of this story is her ability to make us care deeply about the people in her all-too-real fictional world. As horrific as this time period was, we can’t help but feel what the horrors were, and what was in store for the characters we grew to care about.

It deals with cancer.It deals with young love.It deals with the hard realities of growing up fast when faced with a cancer diagnosis. We meet Hazel who is 16 with cancer who joins a support group. There she mets Augustus. They find comfort, love and hope with and through each other. As readers we learn about their inner struggles. We are let in through Hazel's story to the emotions brought on when having to face life and death discussions. The book helps readers to approach the topic of death with humor, dignity, grace and emotion. Even though parts of the story moved me to tears, I never felt it was morbid or depressing. I could appreciate the thoughtfulness of the love story. As readers, we can appreciate Augustus' (Gus) character as he is filled with vibrancy and life. He teaches Hazel how to be strong. Even though we only see his character through Hazel's eyes, he is someone who is impossible not to love. This is definitely a difficult topic, yet Green has done an amazingly wonderful job in using warmth and humor to tell this story. 4.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,5,41,1,not set,"May 20, 2023","Apr 14, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11870085-the-fault-in-our-stars

I am now bringing my  to Goodreads.For anyone looking for the perfect discussion book, this one fits it. We are dealing with a suspenseful mystery, family and courtroom drama. The story opens amid a grand jury hearing with Andy Barber, a former assistant district attorney being grilled by Neal Logiudice. Neal happened to be Andy’s protégé at one time.The questions and concerns involve whether Andy should have been investigating the killing of a boy named Ben Rifkin. Why is this important? Because…The victim was a classmate of Jacob Barber, Andy’s 14-year-old son. What exactly are we implying here? This is where it gets interesting. Hold on…Because the author takes readers on an interesting ride between a legal thriller and an issue-oriented family breakdown. At times readers feel left in the dark, as much as Andy…As brilliant as he is as a prosecutor, how smart is he really about his son?Is he innocent or is he guilty?It seems that before the murder, Andy and his wife, Laurie, just didn’t seem to know much about their son. As suburban parents, they think they have done right by him. But…Jacob found Ben’s body. And…Ben was a bully, with Jacob as his frequent target. And…Apparently, Jacob’s classmates have found him a bit strange. The more his parents uncover, the more the story heats up. And…The more we as readers question Jacob’s innocence.And…When more is discovered with Jacob, the more the title of this book makes sense. The courtroom drama is spectacular. The author pays a great deal of attention to the legal and dramatic tactics, which makes readers feel as if we are actually in the courtroom. There is much to appreciate about the drama, family dynamics and mystery in this story, along with the opportunity for discussion.Also...There is an Apple Plus+ TV series based on this book. But..Don't count on it following the book verbatim. ...more",Notes are private!,14,47,1,not set,"Nov 04, 2023","Apr 14, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11367726-defending-jacob

Review for Sourdough here: https://www.goodreads.com//show...Of course, I was immediately attracted to the book because of its title. A bookstore. For any of you who have been following my s, I love books about books. Bookstores. Libraries. I am in love. So that starts me off on a good footing with the book. I am hopeful and ready to begin with a smile. Open the pages. Here we go.Premise: Clay Jannon, an unemployed Web designer, takes a job working the graveyard shift at a 24-hour bookstore, owned by the strange Mr. Penumbra. The store in itself is rather odd. It has two kinds of customers – random passers-by who stop in so rarely that Clay wonders how the store is able to stay open; and, a “community of people who orbit the store like strange moons…They arrive with algorithmic regularity. They never browse. They come wide-awake, completely sober and vibrating with need.” So, who are these customers?Well…These particular customers seem to borrow a mysterious set of books, which Clay has been warned not to read. Now, how can you tell someone “not to read” something. Of course, this is going to make him want to…read them, right?Not an easy task…because…They are written in code. So…He seeks the help of his roommate, his best friend, who also happens to be his romantic interest and a wiz at software, to help him unravel this code. She also happens to work for Google in data visualization. And what should happen…A greater mystery is stumbled upon. Mr. Penumbra has disappeared. And off they go to track him down.This is an enjoyable, warm, intelligent, plot with lots of philosophical questions about technology and books and the power that both contain. The prose maintains an engaging pace.The characters are quirky, and there are charming moments. And modern moments. It’s not a perfect book, it tries to be clever where it doesn’t need to be.

The question always was, is she real or is she imaginary? The author sets the tale in the wilderness of Alaska where a couple (Jack & Mabel) have relocated after the birth of a stillborn child. One evening after a playful snowball fight, Jack carves a girl out of snow. In the morning, the couple catches sight of a tiny child running among the pines. She is dressed in the snow girl's red hat and gloves. When she presses her nose in the window, her face is a mirror of the one Jack carved out of snow. Is she the daughter that Jack created in the snow the night before? Real? Imaginary? We are in the midst of magical realism here. When the couple visit with her, the world is beautiful and new and quiet. Is that something we long for? But then, as the story goes, the winter recedes, and so does the snow child. We feel the loss. About a third of the way through the book, the story lost a bit of its magic. It was as if the author had to find an ending. But, it just didn't fit. I wanted something more.

They are:As part of this story, the author spends a lot of time sharing observations about murder and human behavior. Including the investigator's role in crime solving. Now, yes this can be interesting. But...These author's observations can also deflect from a reader's interest. It becomes overbearing and takes up too much space (in my opinion). It causes the novel to become too lengthy, and thus, in my case, I found myself needing to skip read, to get to the point of the story. Also, because of the author's writing style, some of the characters were flat. I noticed on several occasions where the author chose to cut off the dialogue with too many explanations about what was going on - in the mind - or the body of the character. We as readers could infer this on our own by the characters actions - if written in as part of the story, just fine. This style of writing was annoying.

Because, if I don’t, I won’t be honest with this . Enzo is a dog. And Enzo is our narrator. And this book draws us in from the very beginning. His loveable and loyal nature kept me engaged throughout this story. And… Well, I couldn’t help but look over at my dogs every now and then and wonder what they were thinking about me – you know what I mean? Premise: Enzo belongs to aspiring race car driver Denny, his wife and young daughter. Enzo’s goal is to finish his life as a dog so that he can come back as a human and no longer rely on gestures to communicate. But in this life, he also has a purpose. To protect and support his family. And while he might be restricted to gestures, those gestures offer his family a lot more support than he may fully realize. It is a compelling story with an almighty twist. No spoilers from me. The story isn’t just about Enzo. It encompasses the human lives struck with joy, tragedy, failure, success, setbacks and ultimate triumph over adversity. It is also about life and death. And ultimately…It is a love story…To our 4-legged friends. Both heart-felt and heart-breaking.

Some men, but mostly women over 50. The discussion was filled with high energy and enthusiasm. I thoroughly enjoyed leading this discussion. The story is about 16 year old Katniss who lives with her mother and younger sister in a present-looking future in which 12 outlying districts send one boy and one girl to appear in an annual televised event called The Hunger Games at the Capitol. It is a fight to the death. And...it is on live TV. This way the public can cheer on their favorite players.

It is Seattle’s Panama Hotel, and in the novel, Henry Lee stands there as the book opens and he is remembering an old, doomed love. Premise: This hotel has been boarded up for over 40 years and the new owners have made a discovery. The basement is filled with the personal items of Japanese American residents who were sent to internment camps during WWII. The sight of a flowered parasol sends Henry back in time to 1942 and his experience during what he always refers to as the war years (always italicized). The story is told through Henry and his friend Keiko in 1942 and the story of Henry and his son in 1986 as Henry begins to share long hidden pieces of his past. What results is a story of a shameful period in American history and the resurrection of relationships based on this time of cultural significance and misunderstanding. By far the strongest part of Ford’s story is his ability to draw the reader into the life of young Henry as he navigates being a teen, prejudice and a world at war. As readers we can feel the national embarrassment that was the internment camps, the stoicism and loyalty of those sent away and the callous disregard with which their departure was greeted by their neighbors of all ethnicities. Seattle wasn’t just a country at war with the world, it was a city divided and at war with itself. The less convincing part of the story was Henry’s relationship with his son, tainted by the anger and resentment of the relationship Henry had with his own father. More detail went into the back story, and maybe that was for the better, because it was more interesting, and I found myself enjoying that part of the book more. Still…The story is strong. Characters feel real and believable, for the most part. Henry is a likable and complicated protagonist....more",Notes are private!,4,21,1,not set,"Sep 24, 2023","Apr 14, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3367956-hotel-on-the-corner-of-bitter-and-sweet

And…It gave me a different appreciation for pitbull dogs. But…I have had a personal experience with one that I will share at the end of my  which changes things for me. Still…It doesn’t change how I feel about this book.Premise: This is the story of Chance, a pitbull puppy that was raised in a puppy mill and then turned over into the world of dog fighting. This is also the story of Adam a person who has destroyed his career and his marriage. Violence and uncertainty surround both of these two, which don’t make for a very good beginning. They both seem to be running away – Chance from the people who will put him in the pit to fight again and Adam from the hurts of his past. Then…Through some act of kindness, they come together. And…This becomes their story of how lives can change.The story was beautifully told. It was one where readers rooted for both Chance and Adam. Also…Readers could feel the pain and angst of the horrible life that was bestowed upon Chance. It definitely made me feel some compassion for his breed after reading this story. But…Our personal story, if interested…An incident occurred in our corgi dog, Oliver’s second year. We were in our off-leash training cycle, having a leisurely beach walk with our dogs. Now, understand, Oliver is a very friendly boy. He loves everybody – people, and dogs. So, when he saw this other dog, he wanted to greet him, and off he went, despite our cries of stop! We were beside ourselves, and my husband went running quickly after him, while I stayed with my other dogs. But…He wasn’t fast enough.When suddenly…The dog took Oliver in his jaws and began shaking him. The owner did nothing to stop his dog. My husband was still running frantically to stop and get Oliver from the clutches of his dog, before something tragic happened. When my husband, approached and asked for the owner to please help (please note this was all happening in fast-time), the owner splashed his beer in my husband’s face. Granted, at this point, my husband was rather frantic, and his voice was probably begging rather loudly asking him to please help, because the man just stood there belligerently while it was happening. (My husband sensed he was also drunk, which didn’t help the situation, either.)All my husband could do at this point, was try and distract the owner’s dog from Oliver so he would release him from his clutches, which he eventually did. The incident probably took about 15 seconds. But it felt like minutes!The owner did nothing but walk away from us with his dog, as we lifted our bleeding Oliver and rushed him back to our car and to emergency surgery. Yes, he was a pitbull. And… Thankfully, Oliver survived. He had deep puncture wounds to his neck and leg. And…Gratefully, Oliver is still a loving, happy-go-lucky guy who still loves people and other dogs. And yes, we take full responsibility for Oliver being off-leash, even though dogs could be, in this place. We were in training, and it was an awful situation that could have been prevented, if he were on leash. Unfortunately, we had no idea this would be the outcome. Since that incident, I have been somewhat reluctant to be around pitbulls, recognizing that even if their owners teach them right, there is still an internal instinct that dogs have, that cannot be ignored. I know sharing this incident is not part of the … But… It is part of my story. If interested, I have pictures of Oliver posted on my profile page.

I am now bringing my  to Goodreads.Believe it or not, this is Michael Connelly’s first legal thriller. And of course, he would choose to create a cynical defense attorney as his defining character and lead protagonist. Mickey Haller has spent his professional life afraid that he would not recognize innocence. He is a pro at defending criminals – out of the backseat of his Lincoln Town Car. And he doesn’t have many friends in cops, prosecutors, or even clients, at times. From bikers, to con artist to drunk drivers or even drug dealers, Mickey Haller doesn’t care – this is his client list. But one day he accepts a rich Beverly Hills bad boy as his client. This could be the paycheck he has been waiting for – especially when he believes this new client is innocent of the crime of brutally beating a woman. But an investigator is murdered when he gets too close to the truth, and Haller is realizing something isn’t quite right with this justice system. Even though Haller is handling some very shady characters, there is something about his character that we can appreciate as readers - he has an interest in coming to an honorable resolution that respects and upholds both the law and his morals. I also felt I was given good insight into the legal system with some behind the scenes information and how the justice system works and can be manipulated. I also love courtroom drama. So, I felt the courtroom scenes were very compelling showcasing some excellent legal strategy without being tedious. As is typical with any Connelly book, there were many twists, turns, surprises and tension. The action was fast paced and it captivated my attention throughout.I loved the character development and the plot flowed with steady builds. And, once pulled in it really was hard to put this one down. If it seemed like it was too tidy of an ending – (let’s shoot up the bad guys kinda deal) – maybe that is what was needed, to get to the truth. I am not one for looking for revenge as the best outcome, but I do like lawyers with a heart of gold, and Mickey Haller is one....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Jun 29, 2023","Apr 14, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40612032-the-lincoln-lawyer

The room in which we all sat to discuss it was overflowing. So many were excited to be present to discuss this one. The book was set in Jackson, Miss, and revolves around the life of 3 unforgettable women - Abilene, Manny and Miss Skeeter. The trio embarks on a dangerous journey to challenge the status quo and make the masses hear the voice of the often-unheard section of society. The author does not write with the sole purpose to capture the dark days as a maid, but really wants us to see the reality that people were facing in that day and time. (Unfortunately...It still feels so present, doesn't it?) We hear the story in the 3 women's narrative voices. The story is fast-moving and intriguing. It brings to life the racism that was (is?) prevalent in America at that time. This is definitely a woman's story, sharing about dark times that feel so real even now.

It took a while to warm up to the story. It was complex. But, we could all agree that the story was multilayered with commentaries on isolation, love, politics, and humanity. If readers can be patient with this book, we can allow ourselves to also be open to Oscar. 3.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,"May 30, 2023","Apr 14, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/297673.The_Brief_Wondrous_Life_of_Oscar_Wao

Where do I begin with what has become the first in an Olive sighting series. I believe there are now at least 7 books now in which Olive makes an appearance! But let’s just begin here. Now typically I have issues with characters I don’t like. Because I like to connect and root for them. And if I can’t connect with them, it makes it really hard to get into the story. So, here is a perfect example of a character readers may not be friends with, but we can’t stop reading about…Olive Kitteridge. I know. She was really annoying, but I still couldn’t stop reading about her. Picture this. Olive is at her son’s wedding. What is she doing? She is looking through her new daughter-in-law’s closet. And she doesn’t stop there. She takes a magic marker and draws a black line down the arm of a beige sweater. What? No, she didn’t stop there either. She steals a bra and one loafer. She imagines her new daughter-in-law saying, “I must be losing my mind.” Would we even think of doing that to our daughter-in-law? Well…maybe? If we didn’t like her?In reality, we (or at least me) couldn’t wait to see what Olive was going to do next. What is happening to me here? Olive is as annoying as could be, and yet I am giddy as can be, watching who she is going to annoy in the next chapter. Small town in Maine. Ordinary people? Doing ordinary things? Secrets kept? Secrets told?What is Olive’s husband up to? The writing is epic. The story is vivid. A great discussion book. And even if Olive may annoy us (or is it just me?), we really care what happens to her. Whatever you decide...Start here. With Olive Kitteridge. It is a book that reminds you of why you love to read books....more",Notes are private!,13,46,1,not set,"Jul 09, 2023","Apr 14, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5552635-olive-kitteridge

So…It was inevitable that our Library Book Discussion group would also discuss this. Interestingly…The most significant question became…How many of us, truly knew our neighbors?I recognized that living and working in my community as long as I did, I didn’t really know my neighbors that well. It wasn’t until I had opened up my Little Free Library Shed years later, and the pandemic hit, and the libraries were closed, that neighbors started coming more to my LFL. And…That made it possible for us to…Talk more to each other. Why did it take so long?Because we just were too busy with our lives, and working, and raising families. And…In most suburban neighborhoods, that is how life had become. Lovenheim’s quest to get to know his neighbors was a murder-suicide a few houses away. He wondered if a tragedy could have been prevented if the residents on Sandringham Road had known each other more closely. One of his ideas to get to know his neighbors was to institute a sleepover. You know…The kind of thing best known amongst kids, but now doing it amongst adults. Learning about each other’s families. Of course, not everyone was up for the idea. Still…He was curious. And…He continued to explore his neighborhood.And…As he did…He would find the professionals, and the one battling cancer. He even spends time getting to know the street’s mail carrier and the newspaper deliveryman. Each add perspective to how the neighborhood feels. There is also the “walker” in the neighborhood. What does she see on her daily walks? Why would she not like living there even though she admires the beautiful homes?And…Even though it may be an affluent neighborhood, the question becomes, does socio-economic status play a role in lack of neighborliness?Or…Are they just too busy, as well?And then…There are the dogs of the neighborhood. Of course. How can we not enjoy the special relationships they bring?The experience of reading such a book, allowed participants to truly appreciate the importance of neighborhoods, and a sense of community. And…Taking time to really find out about your neighbor. And just…Check in. We don’t always know what goes on behind closed doors. Who may need our help…or not.

One of our first mysteries was this one. Premise: Scotland Yard Commander Adam Dalgliesh investigates the murder of an investigative reporter in an isolated, secure manor house. Rhoda, the investigative journalist happens to be at this manor to have plastic surgery to remove a scar from a long ago attack from her abusive father that left her disfigured. Why now? Her reply, “why not?” So when she is murdered, the question for Dalgliesh and his team, is: why would anyone be interested in an investigative reporter? As readers, we can rethink this investigative reporter thing. The reality is, we have come to learn that she is more of a gossipmonger. So... There are probably many people she has gossiped about who have a thing against her, leaving the list of suspects more than a mile long. Still…Dalgliesh has his own questions, too. And as readers, we are following along with him rather anxiously, too.Why choose this physician? Why choose the manor clinic over a more convenient London hospital? Did one dictate the other?So many secrets and old crimes are just a few of the bewildering and captivating aspect of this case. The characters are well-developed, vital and vibrant. The location is moody and atmospheric. The plot has just enough twists that are unexpected as they are unpredictable. And…This was the last case of the Adam Dalgliesh series.

I knew my role as Facilitator was going to be an important one with this book. I wasn’t going to just ask the standard questions that were set up by the publisher for this book, I had my own prepared. I was ready.Skloot’s account of Henrietta’s life was told with sensitivity and genuine warmth; the explanation of attempts to culture cells and the subsequent commercialization of the cell line touch on scientific integrity – even with the author’s lack of scientific training. But that wasn’t just the point of this story – even though it was a significant part of the story line. She had a story to tell, and she told it beautifully. It was partly a historical accounting, part detective story, and part ethical debate. It combined narrative threads into an absorbing challenging read that made for an immensely engaging discussion. Little did anyone know that back in the day when Henrietta was suffering from cancer, that her cells were being used in a culture lab and being developed and distributed as ‘HeLa’ for other researchers. This Dr. Gey birthed a multi-billion dollar industry that revolutionized medical research, while Henrietta remained anonymous and her family unaware. It took 20 years to learn the truth about her “immortal” cells and their subsequent exploitation for profit. The author’s role detracts from the main focus of the book, but the family’s reaction to the news reveals a heart-breaking chasm between cutting-edge science and the lives of ordinary Americans.This is where medical research ethics questions abound. And emotions come in. For the family. For readers, as well?In her words the author writes:“The Lackses challenged everything I thought I knew about faith, science, journalism and race. Ultimately, this book is the result. It’s not only the story of HeLa cells and Henrietta Lacks, but of Henrietta’s family – particularly Deborah – and their lifelong struggle to make peace with the existence of those cells, and the science that made them possible.” This is a complex and thought-provoking read. It is intimate and astonishingly broad in scope. Amazing discussion experience.Update: It is interesting to note, that today (August 1, 2023) on what would have been Henrietta’s 103rd birthday, her descendants, settled a lawsuit against Thermo Fisher Scientific for profiting from cancer cells that were taken from her without her consent shortly before her death in 1951. Quoted on this day, August 1, 2023, in the New York Times, one of her grandsons, Alfred Lacks Carter Jr., said, “it could not have been a more fitting day for her to have justice and for her family to have relief. It was a long fight, over 70 years, and Henrietta Lacks gets her day.” The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in Maryland in October 2021 stating that Thermo Fisher Scientific tried to secure intellectual property rights on the products the cells had helped develop without compensating the family or seeking their permission or approval. ...more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,not set,"Jun 23, 2023","Apr 14, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9571617-the-immortal-life-of-henrietta-lacks

Our illustrious Steinbeck period with our Library Book Discussion group.Steinbeck takes I continue to catch up with s for posting on Goodreads. Our illustrious Steinbeck period with our Library Book Discussion group.Steinbeck takes us to the East Coast for this setting, a small seaport which could be anywhere along the coast of New York and/or Boston. His main character is Ethan, an unaggressive spirit working as a clerk for Alfio Marullo. What is sad about Ethan, is that he is Harvard educated, and a descendent of New England shipping captains. In years past, his family was one of the most important in town. His father lost the fortune, and Ethan has lost the family store, and now he is reduced to being a clerk, in the employ of an immigrant, Mr. Marullo. Ethan is married with two children. This is the story of his moral descent into corruption and crime. As Steinbeck notes in the novel…“A man who tells secrets or stories must think of who is hearing or reading, for a story has as many versions as it has readers. Everyone takes what he wants or can from it and thus changes it to his measure. Some pick out parts and reject the rest, some strain the story through their mesh of prejudice, some paint it with their own delight. A story must have some points of contact with the reader to make him feel at home in it. Only then can he accept wonders.” So, what do we choose to accept as readers?Ethan shapes his lies to get through what he believes will work best for him. And… In so doing, he shapes his own son Allen’s behaviors, especially when Allen wins an essay cash award and we soon learn that he actually had plagiarized his essay. Who is role modeling here?What it comes down to is this…Steinbeck’s commentary on the hypocrisy of our social morality, where cutting corners, ruthless competition, under-cutting friends, and betraying loyalties are just the way the game is played and the main rule is not to get caught at it. Hawley’s character serves as a mirror that exposes this in all its ugly detail in his honesty and lack of driving ambition, and then he carries the logic of betrayal and ruthlessness to its logical conclusion and… (No spoilers from me!) As always, Steinbeck’s dialogue is full of life. With obvious moral lessons here. Which makes this…Such a great discussion book. ...more",Notes are private!,11,46,1,not set,Sep 2023,"Apr 14, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4796.The_Winter_of_Our_Discontent

Well, if it was an opportunity for us to bring food, that was actually dishes made from the cookbook, it was an excellent idea! So…We did, and it was a delectably delicious time had by all! The whole premise of this book is to get kids to eat healthy (probably adults too, if I am being honest!), by “hiding” pureed vegetables and fruits in everyday foods that kids eat. One of my favorite recipes was the brownies made with spinach and carrot puree. https://jessicaseinfeld.com/recipes/b... (Full disclosure: Not everyone will like them, they aren’t the real thing!)One of the setbacks for this book was the advanced planning expected. As long as you have a well-stocked kitchen, it should be fine – those of us who are not typically “cooks” should be able to follow the recipes, easily, but it does take planning to make sure you have all the ingredients before creating a full meal plan. The cookbook also provides parenting tips. Not that I was at a place to need them (being a grandparent), but for those who do, I could see them as quite helpful.

Several programs were also initiated to also showcase different types of issues relevant to what the book’s themes were presenting, before the author came to speak in a large auditorium at the college. What we could appreciate about her story began with her opening line…“I have a farm on a dead-end street in the ghetto.” But the true essence of the story began on page 38 when a postal worker called her in a panic begging her to pick up her mail order package of bees because they were attracting other bees and “freaking everyone out.” So, that is what she does. She picks up the humming box, and casually plops it into the front basket of her bicycle, and proceeds down Telegraph Avenue in Oakland, CA. Where amidst traffic she is followed by other bees, while her bees are churning around in their mesh box in her basket. How can you not love an urban farmer?In her book…She gives her account of raising fruit, vegetables and livestock on a small, scrubby abandoned lot in Oakland. This isn’t exactly the perfect landscape. We are talking about the scum view neighborhood of urban decay. Drug dealers. Homeless. Prostitution. Gunfights. A loud freeway overhead. A billboard overlooking the lot warns against sexual predators. And yet…She transforms this lot into a small slice of paradise. Her own “Farm City.” Turkeys. Ducks. A goose. Rabbits. Pigs. Her own dialogue with life. Animals run through this book and the bustle is invigorating. But…She is also raising them to eat. And…She doesn’t see a contradiction in loving them and painlessly and humanely finding an end to them. That part was probably the hardest to read and discuss.

We are in Elmwood Springs, Missouri, during the transition from war to peace, where everyone is aiming toward a bright future. With a bunch of quirky, but real human characters. But the true leading character is the town. Its evolution is something to watch. Post WWII, we feel the optimism and hope. It feels like any small town across America that gives you that feeling of a rocking chair on the front porch and a fireplace burning wood in the winter. The people gathering together, supporting each others businesses - or talking about what is happening - even if someone just got a dog. Everyone knows everyone. Fannie Flagg is at it again giving us a story of small-town life from the heartland. Characters you can enjoy and appreciate. And of course, discuss. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jun 09, 2023","Apr 14, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/31493.Standing_in_the_Rainbow

But, it doesn't mean I have to like it, or respect it. This is the life of rebellious teenager Holden Caulfield and the people he encounters. He has a foul-mouth. To be honest, when such words are used in books obsessively, it makes me cringe. I am less than comfortable reading them, and less than interested in caring about the character(s) spewing them. I can get their mood by other means. I get that the blunt, offensive language is supposed to ""add more"" to the strong emotions of the protagonist, but...it did nothing for me. I get the teenage angst. The feelings of alienation. The struggle against the world. I imagine that the author wanted this book to be thought-provoking. And his way of presenting it would make it so. The author took us through the streets. His protagonist is questioning his purpose. How he chooses to participate in this life, while observing life around him. And Holden is an unreliable narrator. He is depressed. Self-sabotaging. Rambling. This is not a happy story. But it is one that makes you think.

I think all mothers know the answer to that question! We also know that caregiving isn't exclusively a gendered attribute, so it could easily represent parental or caregiver devotion. What about the needs of the tree? The tree gives us the perfect example of unconditional love. Does that mean that there is an unhealthy relationship between this child and the tree?

Can you imagine a bunch of adults sitting around a table dissecting this one? Seriously, it was an amazing discussion pick - and I recommend considering this for an adult book discussion group. In fact, I would suggest looking at various YA novels, as well. Don't limit yourselves to just adult best seller picks. Children's books have a lot of great learning and educable moments within that make for great discussion experiences. On to my  for Goodreads.This is the story of Claudia and her brother Jamie who are in a sense, two runaways, kind of, who become involved in an art-historical mystery. Where do they runaway to: The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The first paragraph sets the stage when the first sentence says it all: ""Claudia knew that she could never pull off the old-fashioned kind of running away."" Even the second sentence is telling us how logical minded she is that she can't fall back on anger or a simple knapsack on her back. She knew that she couldn't run from somewhere, she needed to run to somewhere. A big difference in thinking. And this is the true adventure of the story. Amazingly, they spend a week in hiding at the Met. In reality, we can't even imagine in today's world that ever happening. Security is too vast. But for us as readers, we get to experience their awe of the art world, their baths in the ""pool."" How they scrounge around for food in the closed restaurant, utilizing the public bathrooms to clean oneself, which adds to the joy of their runaway experience. The story is light-hearted. It gives us moments to pause at the children's independence. And certainly our feelings as adult readers as witnesses to it. And how many wouldn't want to be set free in a museum unbounded for days at a time? Sort of magical, yes? But...Is it realistic? Of course not. But, set that aside, and just go with it. For adults, discussing it, we realized this was a story long before the Amber Alert. And in today's world, we would probably have been on the edge of hysterical about our lost kids. So...Putting all that aside, when this book was written (1967)...this was a different time, place, and world view. We could appreciate it for that. ...more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,not set,"May 26, 2023","Apr 14, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3980.From_the_Mixed_Up_Files_of_Mrs_Basil_E_Frankweiler

The author does a good job of presenting prose effortlessly graceful in its restraint.

She is also enjoying her boyfriend’s charming country home. The story almost reads like a little girl’s fantasy of a grown-up life – but with melancholy.

We read and discI read this several years ago and I am now bringing my  to Goodreads.I want to share that this was a book discussion selection. We read and discussed this book as a 3 week, library book discussion event! It was an epic experience. Of course, it was a very Large book and at the time, felt it deserved to be broken down into sections so that we could give it the time it deserved for discussion. Most of the regulars in the library book discussion group didn't like reading books that were over 300 pages, so you can imagine what it would have been like for me to ask them to read this book (all 1104 pages) in one week. (BTW, for those of you who follow me regularly, I led my local library book discussion group for 12 years on a weekly basis. - Yes, we discussed books weekly. Although, typically one of those weeks was devoted to me bringing in a local author - thus, they got at least one week off from reading and didn't have to read the author's book that we were hosting - it was usually an interview/talkback session that I would do with the author.) Side note: We were also supporting selling the authors books at our local author events.I digress. Back to the ! For the sake of this , I will not break this up into a 3 week, session - it will be discussed all in one - right here - right now! ;) Here goes...Premise: When the cathedral at Kingsbridge burns down, the newly appointed prior hires Tom Builder to manage the rebuild. In order to pay for it, Prior Philip asks King Stephen for the rights to take stone from a nearby quarry and wood from a local forest. This puts him at odds with Bishop Waleran, who wants the wealth owned by the priory. You can already see the conflict arising. It took awhile for the book to ""build"" momentum. Or even arrive in Kingbridge to begin the actual building of the cathedral. And with so many characters being introduced there were a lot of people to manage as we got to know what was happening. And in this way, with all those characters, it definitely felt like a relationship book. We get to watch how those relationships play out between the various men and women who meet - become friends - live together - sour - and so forth. (Aliena and Prior Philip, one example.)Then there are the various threads to the story. How can you not have them in a story this long. Jonathan, as an example was one of those stories, where he was abandoned by his family and raised by the monks. Or Jack. And the earldom of Shirling. And the competition between Aliena's family and so forth. As shared earlier, in a way, it felt like we had to keep a scoresheet to keep up with all the characters. Still, it was a lovely story in many ways. You couldn't help but connect to the characters and hope for the best. And it was definitely a delight to discuss as a group. Still...even though, I loved the writing, and the characters, and the experience we had as a book group discussing it, I am not one for large books. And even though I was excited by the thought of continuing on with the series, when I did finally get ahold of ""World without End,"" once I realized it fast-forwarded into the future beyond these characters, I chose not to continue. I know, I am going beyond this , by sharing that small point about ""World without End,"" but I was also just sharing why I was not motivated to continue the journey with this series. 4.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,not set,"May 26, 2023","Apr 14, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5043.The_Pillars_of_the_Earth

Premise: During a family vacation, Mack's (our main protagonist) daughter is abducted and killed. Her body is never found, but evidence of her death, is found in a shack. Years later, the family including Mack's other children, are still torn over the tragedy. Mack is in his own rage against evil with such conversations aimed at God that include such things as - why should bad things happen to good people - or evil allowed against the innocent - especially against children. His wife maintains her faith in God. Mack wants only vengeance and heads to the shack for exactly that - but instead finds redemption. How do I best describe this book in words?Mystical. Surreal.

I happened to be with my old friend, Jill walking around in a booksI was visiting friends and family in June 2002 in southern California at the time. I happened to be with my old friend, Jill walking around in a bookstore in a mall, when a book literally (I kid you not) fell off the book shelf beside me. It was this book. I picked it up. I said, “You obviously want my attention.” I think the reality was the book telling me, “No Karen, you need my attention.” It was the beginning of a journey that changed my life. This book is still in my collection. I am now bringing my  to Goodreads.I open the first page, and my note in the corner says… “She begins…6.20.02.”What I have come to learn in my own life is that there is one basic question:What is it that I need and want to be happy in this life? When I have clarity about that everything falls in to place. And everyone around me will be happy as well. Think about it a moment. Because it is true. So much of what we expect, or work towards, has always been about trying to make others happy. But what has typically happened, is that we have a tendency to lose ourselves in that mission. But the reality is – joy is our birthright. The author reminds of this in several different ways throughout the book.She even shares about the Irish poet W.B. Yeats once telling an admirer of his work, “If what I say resonates with you, it’s merely because we are both branches on the same tree.” And such is the gift of what the book does for readers. We all want the same thing – we learn truths about ourselves – we push past our comfort zones – we admire others for their accomplishments, too. The author felt that “transformation is a slow process.” That if we are patient, we can recognize that the buried treasure lies within. This book allows readers to contemplate many issues we as readers may not be used to thinking about. It is a process of personal discovery. Something to take time with. Self-discovery does take time, and that is what I did with this book. I read each chapter over a period of time and I journaled along with it. And I asked myself lots of deep questions along the way. A couple of questions that stood out for me were:If I died tonight, what would I regret not having done today? Say it then. I love you. I forgive you. I’m sorry.Is there one small action that I can take to nurture my new dreams toward their fruition? Put it at the top of my To Do List. The key for anyone taking on a deep dive self-help journey is to be willing to do the personal work. And to trust the guide. And this author was an excellent guide.The work was plentiful but the results were amazing. I met my husband 4 months later.

Cannery Row Review here: https://www.goodreads.com//show...Steinbeck returns readers to the scene of Cannery Row after WWII, to most the same characters - junk heaps, flop houses, and trying to pick up and regain life again. It is about the common bonds of humanity and love which make goodness and happiness possible. To a point.Although this novel sparkles at times, it is obvious that this Cannery Row has been degraded, and there is a feeling that Steinbeck is working a bit hard to re-capture a wit and vigor from the past, almost to the point of self-parody. The good news is that the drinking is toned down. The poverty is less grinding. The characters seem eccentric in order to keep up with the change. And Doc's role has certainly changed. Is this good? Does it make the novel more engaging? Do we want love for him in this way? Not sure.It still is Steinbeck...maybe, a little less interesting. 3.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,not set,"Jun 08, 2023","Apr 14, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/56077.Sweet_Thursday

About this book…This book felt like an intense journey. Considered a YA novel, I still felt as an adult, that I could be engaged in the story. (But...there was a glitch, and I will explain that later.)Premise: Our main character, the narrator, asks us to call him Zits. He is a 15-year-old, half-Native American, half-Irish boy with an identity crisis and low self-esteem, struggling from the death of his mother and the absence of his father. Zits is in the foster care system. Justice, an older kid, in the system, easily manipulates him. He tells him that if he kills people, his parents will come back. So, Zits decides to enter a bank with guns to do just that. While in the act of the crime, his imagination begins a journey through history. And as a reader, at this point I got confused. (My glitch!)Was he in his imagination, or in history? Was his mind time-traveling? And while he was “time-traveling” he now was becoming all these different characters through time. His last character embodiment is his father.And then...I got it. I figured it out. Zits realizes that all these characters that he has ""imagined"" or ""time traveled into"" have been involved in some form of violent act. And by being in their ""presence"" they have helped him understand that violence is unjust. This lesson sits well with him, because no one has ever taught him right from wrong. Once I got over my confusion, and realized there was a lesson to all of this, I could appreciate the grief that Zits was experiencing and the poor decisions he was making that led him to that moment in the bank. Now, having shared all this, I don't think I have spoiled the story - I think the story is in the ""time travel"" sequencing that occurs. It will be important for readers to experience this for themselves to understand the lessons that Zits goes through to understand the conclusions I am coming to as a reader. For all I know, anybody can come to their own thoughts about what they believe happens with Zits - which is the beauty of any book!Which is why...This book creates...Many great opportunities for thoughtful discussion....more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,not set,"Jul 08, 2023","Apr 14, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/52872.Flight

And...This is all it takes for Juliet to set sail and change her life. Do you feel the romance of it already? To me this story was enchanting, and delightful, and sad, and heartbreaking, and glorious, tender, and warm. I was in love. I wanted to be Juliet. So...

Little did we know at the time, that there would be controversy surrounding this story. In 2011, CBS 60 minutes broadcast a damaging segment on the author alleging that many of the stories were exaggerated or outright fabrications. They also questioned the financial practices of the author’s charity, the Central Asia Institute. This was devastating. Especially when author, Jon Krakauer, said in that interview, “It’s a beautiful story and it’s a lie.” So, the credibility of the story, and all that occurred, and anything subsequent since then, made it difficult to trust what occurred. Although Krakauer still felt the work that Mortenson did do, was good work. Eventually, Mortenson agreed to pay $1 million to the charity following the investigation. It was determined that he had misspent approximately $6 million dollars. No criminal charges were filed. Which leads me to this.After learning of the dark history, it is hard for me in good conscience to recommend this book. It may have started off as a humanitarian effort, but how it ended is unfortunate. I personally am disheartened. ...more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,not set,"Jun 30, 2023","Apr 14, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/49436.Three_Cups_of_Tea

This is an amazingly well written autobiography that shares…well everything – it does not hold back. We see all that shaped the life of Obama. He is open and honest. He shares about his family – especially about his father, and bridging that gap of that side of his family and life. This book was published in 1995 when he was first starting to explore the political world. Before that time, he was already establishing quite a resume. He was the first African-American President of the Harvard Law Review. The book was re-released in 2004 when he won the Illinois Senate seat. The fact that the book precedes his presidency makes it rather poignant. The story feels like a conversation he is having with his readers. He is articulate. There are no political intentions. It feels like he is just sitting at a table with his readers sharing his viewpoints. And we are happy listeners. (I felt similarly with Michelle’s book, Becoming https://www.goodreads.com//show....)

I was a book clubber. “Is this a funny take on people in one?” I wondered. We are meeting Marie, a seasoned woman on the eve of her 60th birthday who is making decisions of what she is deciding to give up, like post-menopausal sex, and dinner parties. And she definitely has no interest in joining a book club. She feels this is her opportunity to just let go and be free of expected standards. And yet…She is still looking for love and sex in all the wrong places. Until…Childhood friend, and widower Archie shows up. Maybe he can take the snark out of Marie?To be honest, by this point, I didn’t care, and I will tell you why. Marie felt it was time, at age 60 to let go of dreams of love, forget about plans, and basically just exist. Bottom line: she was looking at age 60 as old. I found her attitude rather depressing and old fashioned. And considering that age 60 is the new 40, I was disappointed that the author would even suggest 60 as being old/over-the-hill, done. And because of this attitude, I felt the book became rather tedious, and somewhat difficult having to read the ramblings of a rather self-absorbed, unremarkable narrator.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,35,1,not set,Jul 2023,"Apr 14, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3015207-no-i-don-t-want-to-join-a-book-club

Which meant that we were all reading and discussing this book at the same time. Several programs were also taking place for several months with themes relevant to the book’s points, prior to the author coming to speak about his book. Because it was part of the public library system, our Library Book Discussion group discussed the book. I am now bringing my  to Goodreads.At the time this was published it was 1995. We discussed the book in the early 2000’s. It is now 2023. I wanted to say these years out-loud because I think it is important to put what was shared in the book, and where we are now, in perspective. We can all draw our own conclusions as to how we are feeling about how well we have progressed about these ideas since publication of Putnam’s book. Putnam is a political scientist and professor of public policy at Harvard University. In this book, one of those controversial issues he brought up was a simple but compelling explanation for low voter turnout in American elections. He felt that too many Americans are keeping to themselves. He believed that social bonds and community ties were breaking down. He believed that people had stopped participating in local civic group activities like bowling leagues, and that had huge implications on voter turnout. He felt that by choosing to engage in activities individually rather than communally, we were putting at risk America’s capacity to build social capital and thus, we were contributing to the undermining of our national character. Phew. That is a lot to consider. Right?Why would voter participation be important?Think about what is happening today. How many rights have been taken away. Think of how the courts have been changed. This is what happens when people do not vote. Putnam believed that voter participation demonstrated political interest and knowledge that served as a necessary precondition for other forms of civic involvement. Other areas of concern that he discussed covered church participation, volunteering and socializing within the community. And then there is this…How will the internet enhance social presence – or detract from it?Certainly, Putnam’s original concerns of civic atrophy deserves some credit for subsequent bursts of civic renewal. I’d like to believe that we have figured out ways since this book was published to connect with one another – despite the pandemic or polarizing politics. But I do believe he opened up a wonderful set of questions and concerns at the time, that deserved attention. Still deserves our attention. 4.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Jun 27, 2023","Apr 14, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/478.Bowling_Alone

The ""story"" of Cannery Row follows the adventures of Mack and the boys, a group of unemployed, yet resourceful men who inhabit a converted fish-meal shack on the edge of a vacant lot down on the Row in Monterey, CA in the 1940's.As readers we have the opportunity to watch the characters interact through business deals and random conversations and unbalanced bargains. One thing that is interesting, is that Steinbeck's writing doesn't age well. He uses racial terms that would not be acceptable today (i.e., Wops and Chinamen and Polaks). At the time, most likely acceptable. We intuitively know he isn't being derogatory, but reading it as a contemporary, it does make one wince. Still, there is still something to appreciate about the way he writes. Just the everyday life of people living at the time. The visuals are so easy to appreciate.Follow-up with Sweet Thursday here: https://www.goodreads.com//show......more",Notes are private!,2,39,1,not set,"Jun 08, 2023","Apr 14, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4799.Cannery_Row

He is a man of high characteHenry Scobie is an assistant police commissioner stationed in a British controlled West African coastal town during WWII. He is a man of high character, scruples, integrity, but also very reserved. He is also an outsider amongst the other British settlers. At the beginning of the novel he learns he has been passed over for promotion. Even though he is disappointed, his wife Louse sees this as the final humiliation. She hates living where they do - and feels the past 15 years in this horrible place isn't worth being here any longer. She wants to go back to England. Either that, or take a holiday to South Africa. This is the beginning of all Scobie's problems. Because he wants to please her. And in so doing, he makes some very bad decisions. As a reader, our first reaction is to feel pity for Scobie. But, if you read any past interviews with Greene about his intentions for this novel, he says his purpose was to illustrate the ""disastrous effect on human beings of pity."" In other words, Greene sees pity as an egotistical trait deriving from an abundance of pride rather than true compassion for the welfare of others. Thus, he makes pity the fatal flaw that brings Scobie down. This leads to a crisis of conscience and ultimately to ""spiritual damnation."" This was another novel taken on by our Library Book Discussion group, so you can imagine the lively discussion that ensued. We saw this as a superb study of a man in turmoil.

Of course, Joe doesn't realize he is not the father, and Victor wants him to know. Mordeen tries to convince him not to tell Joe, because she wants to please her husband, and doesn't want him to know the extent she went to, to give him this child. Bottom line it does not end happily for any of the characters. The problem with this novella/play is the stilted dialogue. It does not sound natural - real, or like anything anybody would actually say. The scenes are also off. What the characters do is off. Do we care about the characters as readers?As off as this story was, it was a great discussion selection, because there was so much ambiguity. So what can any reader do? Exit stage left. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jun 09, 2023","Apr 14, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/287241.Burning_Bright

I am now bringing this  to Goodreads.This was the beginning of my relaI read and discussed this years ago in our library book discussion group. I am now bringing this  to Goodreads.This was the beginning of my relationship with Barbara Kingsolver. I say that as if I personally know her. But this was my first book of hers - and her first published book. This book didn't make her famous, it would take The Poisonwood Bible for her to gain recognition. But, this book, I thought really was a beautiful literary novel. Premise: Missy-turned-Taylor Greer is neither running from a killer nor from the law. She's a part Cherokee, twenty-something, down-home Kentucky girl who never quite stood still. The fact that she witnessed a boy commit suicide, well, that was enough for her to need a new life. As readers, we find her quite the character - and not impossible to love. We are anxious for her future, and ready to take the drive with her west. Her plans change when along the way, a woman drops a toddler in her front seat and begs her to take the little girl with her. When Taylor realizes this little girl has been the victim of horrific abuse, she agrees to do so. So now, Turtle (her new name) is along for the journey. Away they go to the next destination.Taylor and Turtle soon meet Mattie who owns a garage which gives Taylor a new purpose in Tuscon, Arizona. Kingsolver has this skill of creating unique, lovable-yet-flawed characters. They stay with you like old friends, who when they call you after several years, the conversation continues as if no time has passed by. This is how I feel about this book. The minute I began to write this , all the memories flooded back. Biggest message...There is humanity in here. Sometimes we need to see this and know it exists in this world. If you haven't read this book, do so. If you want to re-read this, do so. Her first book, may be even her best one....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,not set,"May 26, 2023","Apr 14, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/30868.The_Bean_Trees

I am now bringing this  to Goodreads.Premise: An old man fights to keep his driver's license well past the point at which he has become a menace on the road. Interestingly enough, the author had shared that this story came to her, as she was fighting with her own father to try and keep him from wanting to continue to drive. Even as I write this , I am reminded of the day when I had to talk my mother out of driving when it became clear that her dementia was overcoming her objective sense of reality. Even as I share this memory, and I am consumed with the sadness of her declining self at that time, this book, as the author had intended it, was filled with joyful humor. And I can smile at that.Bryant said, ""looking back from two decades' distance, some of the scenes in this book seem so absurd that 'The Test' may be, in a dark way, my funniest book.""

We also hosted a guest speaker a week later who was an expert on Herman Melville and had taught at our local university. It was actually quite the event for both weeks. And quite the discussion. I am constantly amazed what we can learn from these old classic tales. Moby-Dick is an epic piece of literature. Rich in language and structure. As well as character and story. It is about a man against a whale. And we can dissect the story philosophically all we want - and of course when we are in a book discussion group, we took our job seriously. We have a sea voyage. The long, long, long search for Moby Dick, and then the adrenaline-fueled final days of the chase and fight. Man against creature? Man against nature?Some of the themes of discussion that emerged:*Human confronting the unanswerable question of existence. *Grappling with the question of why bad things happen to good people. *Why there is suffering in the world. *Betrayal against One's body - even against himself.

As an adult, she moves in with her brother in Florida. He happens to be researching lightning strikes, which makes her consider what it might be like for her to be struck by lightning. Lo and behold what should happen to her?A lightning strikes, and, her life is forever changed, physically and spiritually. “It was the oddest thing.

At its heart this is a novel about fairytales – perhaps it is even a fairytale, too. But…It is about the differences between what we see and what we believe – according to how we read it and how we choose to believe it – the fantasy of it – and the magic of it. The nameless character wanted to believe so much – so she chose to seek things out – or wish things on herself – and all these things became cause and effect.So… Just for your own safety…Be cautious…And…Beware of lightning. ...more",Notes are private!,4,34,1,not set,"Sep 05, 2023","Apr 14, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/177515.The_Ice_Queen

Although she has many friends, Ann is her soulmate. Her loyalty is unshakable. She stands by her as she loses so much of her physical self to the disease. She even bears witness to her friend's affairs and her divorce from her husband Eric, a self-absorbed lawyer who goes on to marry another woman. This novel probes the rewards and challenges of friendship in a death watch setting which is heightened by emotions and shifting moods. Ruth's character has an appetite for life which under the circumstances makes one grateful to be alive in this moment. Ann is a reflective and intense person who matches Ruth's energy. It is wonderful to see a story about friendship that accentuates the love and intimacy that can exist between women caring and supporting one another through anything.

To be honest, it was not an easy discussion, and to even discuss it in this , I am reminded of the various people sitting around the table feeling somewhat sullen, upset, outraged at times, frustrated, and mixed about this disturbing story. The book's narrator is 14-year-old murder victim Susie. Raped and killed by her neighbor, Susie ascends to heaven, where she observes how her death has affected those around her. Her father who suspects the killer's identity, is grief-ridden. Her mother, who never really wanted children, withdraws and acts out. Susie's sister, fears the kids will see her only as the kid with the dead sister. Her little brother struggles with death. The second half is a ghost story. Susie sees her family aging, their lives playing out. I guess as readers we are somewhat like Susie. We are watching her family heal. Or hoping that is what they are doing. But, at the same time, we are also wanting justice. Like her father is trying to achieve for his daughter. But, as things went on, it got more frustrating, because when justice wasn't coming, I got more frustrated. Because that is what happens to me. I don't know about you - but, I just don't like seeing someone get away with something. It's like watching a real life cold case, and knowing who the murderer is, and knowing he is getting away with it. Here we are...again. There isn't a happy ending. Am I okay with it? No. Does that mean I am going to take a star away from this book? Yes. Is that fair? Probably not.

I didn't know how many people would show up for our first group. As it turned out, only one other person showed up at the first hour, and 2 other people showed up in the second hour, not realizing that we had started an hour earlier. We found a way to help them feel included. Fortunately, that first time did not dissuade me from realizing this was going to be a special experience. After that, we typically had anywhere from 15-20+ come each week, and during local author visits the room was always packed. But, this first time, was this book. And I will always remember it, because, well...to be honest, I did not like it. This is the story of 82 year old Iris Chase Griffen looking back at her sister's death 50 years ago. Iris is writing down what happened. Recounting her memory in an attempt to explain it to her granddaughter. This story is told in first person narrative. Flashing back we learn about Iris, and her sister, Laura. Rivals. What we also gather is in this story, it is not so much Iris' memoir, but Iris' fiction of what she remembers. The story is deliberately trashy. It is a fight against time and convention. But, what holds the story together? There is some beautiful imagery - rocks - trees - water - sky - the thunderstorms and snowstorms - the sunsets. The author is descriptive. The backdrop of WWI and WWII. There is a lot of historical references throughout. Time, character and plot are all shifting sands in this story, but nothing is to be trusted, and everyone betrays each other. And I think because of this complexity, I could not connect to the characters or feel empathy, compassion or sympathy. No matter how pretty the scenery was. But I do remember being in that room, for the first time, being nervous and excited at the same time starting the Library Book Discussion group.

It seemed the group wanted to read as many of her books as we could. Could you blame them? She is an amazing storyteller. This one is about Codi who returns to her hometown of Grace after 15 years away. She has come back to take care of her father who is suffering from Alzheimer’s. Hallie, her younger sister has gone off to Nicaragua to help the local people learn farming. Most of her story was told “off screen.”Now back in Grace, Codi is a science teacher at a local high school, living with an old friend, Emelina who has 5 young sons. Codi reconnects with an old high school love, Loyd. Together they explore some of her past, including what she saw the day her mother died, since her memory seems to have been lost to her. They are also fighting some developers who want to dam the river and kill off the surrounding orchards which are part of Grace’s main livelihood. We are told the story in first person by Codi, and third person from her father’s perspective. Codi has always seen her father as cold and distant – not understanding her or Callie. With the father’s section we can see how much he loved his daughters, but we can also see how his illness is affecting his memories. Codi is a deeply flawed character. An outsider looking in. Sometimes making more problems for herself than are truly there – thus making it hard to empathize with her character, at times. The father is easy to like, as are a lot of the supporting characters. Kingsolver is a descriptive writer, so it could be slow at times. But still beautiful. Ending… moving, but predictable. Wonderful book discussion selection.

My focus in academics was on leadership and peer counseling. My free-time reading were typically mysteries. Any classics that I read, usually, were during high school or college. So...Doing my due diligence as a book discussion facilitator, I always asked what the group wanted to read, and I was open to their suggestions before setting up the reading lists. And, that is how I began my reading experience late in life into a lot of classics, like My Antonia. Premise: Jim was an orphan living with his grandparents in Nebraska. Antonia was a young girl, of Bohemian immigrants living nearby. Jim was enlisted to teach Antonia English so she could help her family acclimate to the community. This is the story of their friendship. We experience the beauty of the Nebraska prairie, as well as a woman of strength and joy in her life in the character of Antonia. One senses she could have spent her life with Jim, had he pursued her beyond friendship. As readers, had we hoped for more?I think had it been a modern novel a romance probably would have been written, but that probably would have destroyed the beauty of the story - and certainly the life long friendship which I believes engages us as readers. (Side note: My Antonia was originally published in 1918.) Sometimes it is nice to see friendship that honors boundaries. This was a great book discussion selection.

Her story.So many people who were attracted to coming to our library book discussion group in the early years (probably throughout if I am being honest) were in their 70’s-90’s. Yes, I am not joking!

So, I always planned books accordingly – especially knowing that our library book group brought in visitors from all over the country. And what I appreciated most about those who would attend, was how engaged they all were. Their minds were active and alive and their discussion was full of spunk!In those early years, of leading the group, this book, was fitting. And it was exciting to talk about this amazing woman whose intention was to spread her interest in campaign finance reform. And even if the book touched on the topic in some detail, mostly it was about her, and the walk, and the challenges of the walk, and the people she met along the way. And how many actually would walk with her on this trek. Most interesting, she was aware of the power of her voice and she reflected on this often. The most refreshing part of this reading experience, is the reassurance of reading about someone who had a strong conviction about doing something out of the ordinary, wanted to do it, and summoned the courage to carry it out.

The question is, will they be able to figure out in time who he or she is before it is too late, or he/she gets them first? I use to love James Patterson, and couldn’t wait to read anything he wrote into my hands. But then I found his stories carried the same formula and I grew bored – hence the term formulaic author. But then he started a trend – he began to team up with other authors to create storylines. This seemed to be his way to back away and give other authors a chance to make a name for themselves by letting them take the writing lead (it was my take on it), but also a process perhaps to move away from his formula story line. However, when it comes to this book, I’m not sure whether it succeeded. It felt like another old formula losing steam. Like a re-tell of a story we’ve read before – the characters we know (love and hate) – bad guys hidden among the good guys – the worst of the worst – and we as readers are racing through time, just like the main characters to capture him or her. Of course, let the authors throw in a side story to complicate things, too. I’m just not sure adding a second author is going to save James Patterson any longer. What do you think?

This book professes to be a hidden chapter in FDR's White House. As a historical fiction novel, White Houses by Amy Bloom explores what really could have happened behind closed doors between Eleanor Roosevelt, First Lady, and her ""friend"" Lorena Hickok. Thousands of letters, preserved at Hyde Park, attest to their passionate connection, and historians now are certain their relationship was physical. (In 2016, the two women were the subject of the non-fiction book Eleanor and Hick: The Love Affair That Shaped a First Lady by Susan Quinn, which expanded on revelations in Blanche Wiesen Cook’s 1999 biography of Eleanor.) Bloom convincingly weaves tender romance with hard-boiled reality. At its heart, however, White Houses feels true.

It really is because of RealitySteve.com’s spoilers each season, that I am able to keep myself engaged with this crazy show/franchise. So when I became aware of this book through Reality Steve’s podcast, I had to read it. Amy Kaufman did her homework well, and made this a truly entertaining read! Amy Kaufman's unauthorized, behind-the-scenes tell all book lets us in on the ridiculous world of the Bachelor Nation that manufactures those tears for our entertainment. The iconic reality television show's reach and influence is undeniable. Bestselling writers and famous actors live tweet about it. Die-hard fans--dubbed ""Bachelor Nation""--come together every week during each season to participate in fantasy leagues and viewing parties. If you think about it you can only conclude that The Bachelor franchise is a stage - one in which we viewers sit back and watch wondering what train wreck will occur next. Kaufman also explores what our fascination means, culturally: what the show says about the way we view so-called ideal suitors, our subconscious yearning for fairy-tale romance, and how this enduring television show has shaped society's feelings about love, marriage, and feminism.Former basketball great Kareem Abdul-Jabbar suggested that the book contained ""all the dirty secrets about how the sausage is made. It doesn't make the sausage any less delicious or addicting, but it does, if you think about it too much, roil the stomach."" What I came to realize and understand was that People love to hate-watch The Bachelor. I guess that described me as well. Now I just read the spoilers.

The way the author left the first book, you would expect that it would be all about…well, I’m not going to say, because then I could spoil the first book, and possibly this one. This book, actually has the same main characters, Lily and Henry Kimball. Even so, it adds some more new characters, and brings in a little bit more evil in those particular new characters, and well maybe as readers we may want to know how they are going to relate to the original characters. And that is where the fun begins. Do I like this book as much as I liked the first book? No. But, I still enjoyed reading it. If that makes sense. Probably because this writer knows how to engage his readers, and that to me is what really counts, just as much as whether the story has something to tell us. 3.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,not set,"Mar 24, 2023","Mar 24, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/61246273-the-kind-worth-saving

In a way, it is a hybrid between a coming of age in difficult times and pure fantasy delight, full of fractured fairy tales and real problems to be dealt with… A perfect example of young adult fiction for all ages. Still, let me tell you that this is not something for the faint of heart. Some passages were definitely scary or just plain twisted, so, I would caution the reader.

So that is what he set out to do with the help of his long-time friend and collaborator, Stewart Stern. His intention was to bare his soul and be real in ways that expose his truth – his life, and thus he could feel right that he left his story the way he needed it to be said. Mostly for his children. And then for those who cared to read it, too. And in this way, we would learn about the man, the actor, his flaws, his imperfections, and the realness of him. As well as all the people that surrounded his life. And many had something to say, who also shared commentary throughout his story. This was a painstaking collaboration that took his recorded conversations, and translated them into a well-coordinated readable, reasonable sized book.

You watch the kids grow up. The relationships ups and downs. The Ruth Galloway series is a different sort of police procedural with forensic archaeology, because Ruth (our main protagonist) is an archaeologist. She is an academic who is now head of her university department. She has been consulting with the police whenever bones are found. She also has an “interesting” relationship with officer, DCI Nelson – who also happens to be her daughter’s father, another major character. Ruth has also written successful books and made television appearances. In this book, we see not only another cold case that needs to be addressed, but the possibility of Ruth’s department being closed down, and some resolution with her relationship with Nelson (considering he has been married on and off with his wife Michelle). What makes this book even more “emotional” for us die-hard followers, is understanding that the author has intended that this book, “The Last Remains” is to be the last in her series of Ruth Galloway mysteries. Which means, walking in to it, we already know that whatever happens to the characters that we have been reading through the years…this will be the last time we will probably be turning these pages for – so whatever happens, we can only hope –– 1) she doesn’t kill them off,2) she won’t give them an unhappy ending, Or… 3) she provides us readers with something we can be satisfied with for each of the characters. I do believe, the author does justice, furthering the stories not only of Ruth and Nelson, but also Kate, Cathbad, Judy, Cloughie, Tanya…and even a surprise character from an earlier story (Kleenex, may be needed). But, I won’t tell you how. I think as readers, that is your adventure to enjoy. Regardless of the case, we can appreciate that it was a very satisfying finale indeed.
