Rin Usami captures the insularity and obsessive nature of ""stan culture"" with aplomb, and if you've spent time in any sort of online fandom over the years, there's a lot you'll recognize in here. (If you haven't... I think you might get a little lost reading this book, if I'm being honest—let the layman beware.)But where it shines in its portrayal of the more toxic aspects of fandom culture, the narrative itself leaves something to be desired. The whole concept that this novella is supposedly predicated on—a girl coming to terms with her favorite pop idol maybe having assaulted a woman—isn't ever really the focus, and I understand why this detail is included in the book's summary, but the reality of the way this narrative transpires is much more mundane than fraught. This isn't a story about a girl being torn apart and forced to question everything she's believed in; it's more of a portrait of the insidious nature of obsession, and the ways in which it can lead you to become disconnected from reality. And of course, there's nothing wrong with that at all; I just think this could have been a more interesting project had there been a bit more tension and more of a shift within Akari's character throughout the story.It's short and it's worth reading and Rin Usami is one to watch for sure, but I ultimately did want more from this.Thank you to Netgalley and HarperVia for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"May 03, 2022","May 06, 2022","Apr 28, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60470072-idol-burning

I'm a modern woman, and I don't have to fit into some outdated mould.(This seems to be a theme with a lot of my recent reading, doesn't it: liking the idea of a story more than I like the prose.)As this only takes about an hour to read, I have no hesitation in recommending it if this is a premise or period of history that particularly interests you, but unfortunately I don't think this was as brilliant as it had the potential to be.Thank you to Netgalley and Fairlight for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jan 22, 2022","Jan 29, 2022","Jan 22, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58374758-voting-day

If I hated it, it would have validated how strongly I disliked Fates and Furies and how staunchly I have been avoiding Groff’s books ever since then; if I loved it, it would have been amusing for that same reason. Regrettably I thought it was just fine.Matrix is an interesting project. Groff fictionalizes the life of Marie de France, a figure we know very little about, and discards the details we do know in favor of creating her own version of history. Matrix is more of a feminist fantasy of medieval life than it is an effort to accurately recreate historical detail. Groff isn't interested in humanizing Marie as much as girlbossifying her, assigning conflicts to the narrative only as minor hurdles for Marie to overcome. I thought this book’s main strength was in its depiction of the abbey as an institution; underscoring that institutions are run by people and not by divine intervention. The tension between Marie's relative faithlessness and her competence at leading the abbey from poverty to prosperity is where this relatively meandering novel feels the most focused. What this did affirm for me is that I just don't get on with Groff's writing on a sentence-by-sentence level; I find her prose very labored and there's just no momentum for me. This was a bit of a chore to get through, honestly, which is odd to say as it's such a slim tome. I largely admired what Groff was trying to do with this book, but found the execution lacking more often than not. ...more",Notes are private!,0,59,1,"Jan 09, 2022","Jan 15, 2022","Jan 09, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57185348-matrix

Set at the fictional River Valley School for the Deaf, True Biz is effectively a love letter to deaf culture, couched in a coming of age narrative mostly focusing on the budding relationship between two teenage students, Austin and Charlie. Austin comes from generations-old deaf family, whereas Charlie is the first deaf member of her own family; she was never taught sign language and was forced to grow up having very little communicative ability as her cochlear implant is barely functional. The novel also follows February, the school's headmistress, dealing with her failing relationship, her mom's poor health, and the potential imminent closure of the school. The novel's prologue also introduces the fact that three of the students at the school have just gone missing; we then go back in time six months to see the factors that led up to this event.So, naturally, there's a lot going on in this book, and where it succeeds is in the thorough immersion it provides in deaf culture (Nović herself is a deaf author). This book informs and engages in equal measure; it's a crash course in deafness for those of us who are lacking in knowledge of deaf culture and history, but none of it feels rushed or underexamined or patronizing. (It's not for me to decide, but I can imagine that this book will be as much of a joy for deaf readers as it is for hearing readers.) That said, Nović's dedication to giving the reader the most thorough portrait of deaf culture possible was often to the novel's disadvantage; it resulted in a few unfortunate side effects, one of which was a Black character only receiving one single point of view chapter, which existed solely for the benefit of giving the reader a quick lesson on BASL (Black American Sign Language). The differences between ASL and BASL and the stigmas attached to the latter are fascinating, but it felt really shoehorned in, in an attempt to leave no stone unturned—I ultimately just wished that that character had more of a role in the narrative. This novel isn't plot heavy, and for the most part, that works well. The quieter approach to depicting daily life at the school suits Nović's aims with this novel perfectly. That's why it's unfortunate that the decision was made to use the framing device which positions this book as some kind of mystery. I'll just say right now that the reality behind the disappearance of the three students is very anticlimactic, and I'm guessing the end of this book wouldn't have felt like such a whimper if we weren't told from the beginning that the whole novel was building to this event. But critiques aside, I actually did really enjoy spending time with this book and I do think it's going to be a big hit when it publishes. Its characters are mostly complex, its style is compulsively readable, and its depiction of deaf culture is multifaceted and warm and unlike any other book I've read on the subject. Thank you to Netgalley and Random House for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Jan 22, 2022","Jan 27, 2022","Dec 08, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58395049-true-biz

It follows Frank Mackey, an undercover agent who gets a call from his younger sister—the only person he still speaks to from his poor, inner city Dublin family that he cut out of his life decades ago. A suitcase has been discovered, which belongs to Rosie Daly, the girl Frank had been in love with as a teenager. The two were planning on running off to England together, but Rosie never showed up that night, and Frank found a note from her which made it sound like she was going off on her own. He had never spoken to her again, assuming she had made her own way to England—but the discovery of her suitcase overturns his assumption that she had managed to make it out at all.What I liked about this book is what I like about all of French’s books: solid mystery, distinct character voice (I’d actually describe French’s writing style as less “lyrical” in this book than in the first two in this series—which suited Frank to a T), the ability to get to the heart of her characters and connect the reader to what drives them.What I disliked about this book was everything else. This book was overwhelmingly domestic, to a degree that was just never going to work to my personal taste. The biggest thing at stake here is Frank’s personal relationships: with his daughter, with his ex-wife, and with his estranged family. Any time I see the words marriage, divorce, parenthood, etc., in a thriller summary, I click swiftly away, so this is the sort of thing I never would have picked up if it hadn’t been a part of this series, and I can’t exactly fault a book for not being everything I personally wished it would be.That said, I do think this is a notably weaker offering than the first two books in this series. Frank’s belligerence gets tiresome very quickly, and all of the conflicts in this book get very repetitive. I also found the whole setup very stereotypical: poor Irish family has too many kids and an alcoholic, abusive father—shocking! (I know French herself is Irish, and I don’t mean to imply that the family dynamic was handled insensitively—just that I thought there were opportunities for a fresher dynamic that French could have taken but did not.) I definitely didn’t mind reading this, but I’m hoping for more exciting things from the three remaining titles in this series I still have to read....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Nov 20, 2021","Nov 27, 2021","Nov 20, 2021",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/45053088-faithful-place

Let’s get the absurd premise out of the way: before working on the Murder Squad, Cassie used to be an undercover agent, and in one of her old cases, she went by the alias Lexie Madison. Cut to the present: a dead body shows up, and the victim is not only identical to Cassie, but she had Lexie Madison’s ID on her when she died. In order to investigate the case, Cassie is sent back undercover, posing as Lexie and living with Lexie’s housemates, a group of university students.Like I said, it’s absurd. But that’s okay. Fiction is fiction for a reason. What I actually found mildly irritating toward the beginning was just how much time was spent on French trying to justify this premise to the reader, by means of Cassie trying to justify her decision to take this ridiculous case to herself and to anyone else who would listen. Nothing about this is realistic and we could have all saved ourselves 100 pages if everyone just accepted that from the start.That said, I really adored this book. With traces of The Secret History, The Likeness depicts with aplomb the insularity of academic and the fiercely obsessive quality of close friendship. Once Cassie gets into the house, this book—unlike Cassie—never takes a false step. The characters are all brilliantly rendered on their own, but as a group, their dynamic sings in a way that I find it particularly challenging for authors to capture in an organic, convincing way.This book is just fun and indulgent and moving and sad, and it keeps you guessing from start to finish.

If you haven’t read much Christie, I wouldn’t recommend this as a place to start, as it feels somewhat distinct from everything else that I’ve read by her, and I don’t think it gives the most accurate indication of her usual style.

Michael Rogers is possibly my all-time favorite Christie protagonist: he’s an insufferably pretentious young man with delusions of grandeur, but his voice is so convincing and engaging, and there’s something so authentically insecure at the heart of his character, that he pretty much embodies that type of character that you love to hate or hate to love.Despite its slow beginning, I couldn’t put this book down from the very first page. What Endless Night lacks in plot it makes up for in its sinister, Gothic setting, its genius foreshadowing, its expert characterization, and its subtle integration of the supernatural. This isn’t going to be for everyone; specifically, this isn’t for the reader who needs their mysteries to be chock-full of twists and turns, but if you’re a Christie fan, this is a brilliant hidden gem that you need to check out asap. The problem with mysteries (at least for me) is that once you know the reveal there isn’t a whole lot of motivation to ever go back and reread the book, good as it may have been, but I know this is one that I’m going to want to revisit again and again. I loved it so, so much....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Oct 15, 2021","Oct 18, 2021","Oct 15, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16366.Endless_Night

I really admired St. James's The Broken Girls and was hoping for a similarly gripping paranormal thriller here, but I thought The Book of Cold Cases was largely a slog. The first half of the book drags, the twist is revealed early on and it's easy to guess even earlier on, the paranormal element doesn't dovetail with the mystery well enough to really justify its inclusion, and the whole premise is predicated on detectives having overlooked a painfully obvious link during a very high-profile murder case. And where I thought that Shea was a well constructed character, I felt that the way her trauma and eventual recovery was rendered was a bit overly simplistic. Anyway, if you like your paranormal thrillers heavy on tedious domestic drama, for whatever reason, this will be the book for you; otherwise, it's just a bit of a flop.

For one, I didn’t think there was anything particularly interesting or evocative about the setting, which I had assumed was going to be one of the book’s strongest assets, and for another, this marks the first Agatha Christie I’ve read where I actually guessed the ending pretty early in, so this one went out with more of a whimper than a bang.That said, Christie sunk her claws into me with this one. This is the first of her novels that I’ve read in a couple of years, and I was reminded of what’s so special about her. Her character work is thoroughly unmatched within this genre, and even when the ending doesn’t bowl you over, there’s something inarguably suspenseful and propulsive about each of her books.

Split into four sections—each of which could conceivably stand alone as a short story—Love in the Big City first introduces the friendship between Park Young and Jaehee, a fellow student who, like Young, spends most of her free time drinking and hooking up with random men. The two move in together, sharing everything, and the platonic love between them is palpable; Young keeps Jaehee’s favorite Marlboro cigarettes stocked and Jaehee buys him his favorite frozen blueberries. When Jaehee uncharacteristically decides to settle down and get married after years of the two sharing their young and free lifestyle, Young feels betrayed and unmoored, which leads to a series of inauspicious romantic trysts.You can read my full  HERE on BookBrowse and a piece I wrote about contemporary Korean literature in translation HERE....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Dec 11, 2021","Dec 12, 2021","Sep 15, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57500766-love-in-the-big-city

Roughly tracing the outlines of the Apollo and Daphne myth, The Latinist follows Oxford classics scholar Tessa, who discovers that her supervisor, the renowned scholar and Head of Department Chris Eccles, is sabotaging her career. This novel’s main strength lies in this conceit—Prins does an eerily brilliant job at capturing the quiet horror of finding yourself trapped in a situation where you’re entirely dependent on another person, who you’re slowly realizing does not have your best interests at heart. Certain passages of this novel cut me to my core, made me feel physically ill with recognition. Unfortunately, Prins is determined to undermine his own fantastic setup by indulging the urge to humanize Chris in ways that I felt pulled against the novel’s main objectives. At first, I didn’t mind reading the passages from Chris’s perspective, as they initially just serve to corroborate how disturbing his behavior is; it seemed like a harmless if unnecessary addition. But then there’s a whole subplot involving his dying mother that ultimately doesn’t go anywhere worthwhile, that I was just itching to cut out of the manuscript altogether. What is even accomplished by reiterating to the reader that Chris is a fallible human? We know that from the start, and having that point belabored just feels patronizing. I have a few other complaints—for whatever reason Prins likes to throw in a mini-flashback on every other page, telling the reader about a scene that had happened two days prior, rather than just showing that scene to the reader in real-time; there’s also an anthropological discovery made partway through that hinges on such an enormous assumption that it was rather maddening that none of the characters seemed to question it—but on the whole, I can’t say I didn’t enjoy reading this. Prins’s writing is sharp and readable, Tessa is a fantastically written character, and certain passages that deal with obsession and power really sing. It just feels a bit aimless and rushed in places and I think really would have benefited thematically from keeping its narrative focus on Tessa.Thank you to Netgalley and W.W.

It tells the story of Bill Furlong, a man born to a single mother in a small Irish town in the 1940s, who now in the 1980s runs his own coal and timber business, and who, in the weeks leading up to Christmas, meets a girl at a Magdalen Laundry whose physical state and predicament concerns him. With shades of A Christmas Carol, Small Things Like These is the story of a man wrestling with his own morality when doing the right thing means going against the Catholic Church, which has a stranglehold over his town. What I found so affecting about this book was Keegan’s deft touch — her prose reads effortlessly and the horrors of the Magdalen Laundries are elucidated not through graphic, violent descriptions, but in the harrowing small moments of abuse captured. Character and setting are rendered with impressive detail given the scarcity of pages, and I found this to be a great place to start with Keegan, whose backlist I’m keen to explore now.Thank you to Netgalley and Grove Atlantic for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Sep 12, 2021","Sep 13, 2021","Sep 12, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56943582-small-things-like-these

Jack and Flo get drawn into the town’s mysteries almost immediately as a strange series of events begins to unfold, and Jack also has secrets of her own, because she’s a thriller protagonist so of course she does.I mostly had a fun time reading The Burning Girls, but the whole thing fell apart for me at the end. This is a book that’s trying to do so many things and fully committing to none of them; I was rooting for it to all come together but it just didn’t. Threads are left open, subplots are left underdeveloped, the inclusion of certain details remains incomprehensible. I guessed the main twist out of left field very early on, so the whole time I had my eye on ‘evidence’ that would prove it, and I ultimately felt that it was so poorly executed it could hardly justify itself.I also found the representation in this book incredibly concerning. The only Black characters are unhinged abusers committing welfare fraud, the only character with depression is a domestic abuser, the only gay character is closeted and self-loathing, and the less said about the character with dystonia, the better. None of these stereotypes are presented to be subverted or challenged or compensated with good representation elsewhere; it’s just a concerning blend of harmful tropes to absolutely no end.Anyway, I’m not sure where to go from here with CJ Tudor -- this is my third book of hers, and I’ve yet to give any of them higher than a 3-star rating, but I guess there’s something that keeps drawing me back to her. I should probably just accept that I enjoy her settings and premises more than I enjoy her writing (which I found especially corny here)....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Sep 07, 2021","Sep 09, 2021","Sep 07, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53387949-the-burning-girls

Though she is derailed from her objective, the events of Batuman’s first novel take Selin on an odyssey through the Hungarian countryside in the summer between her freshman and sophomore years as she chases the affections of an aloof older student, Ivan, who has just graduated and is about to move to California.You can read my full  HERE on BookBrowse and a piece I wrote about Søren Kierkegaard HERE....more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"Apr 24, 2022",May 2022,"Sep 03, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58890783-either-or

I did actually like The Dangers of Smoking in Bed much better (in spite of the fact that I’m giving these two collections the same star rating, lol), but it took a while to get going and fair amount of the stories fell into that same trap for me, where I felt like Enríquez was prioritizing shock value over something more organically unsettling. Highlights for me were Meat, a sinister story about two teenage girls idolizing a recently-deceased pop star; Where Are You, Dear Heart?, about a woman attempting to satiate her sexual desire for the human heart; and Back When We Talked to the Dead, the collection’s final story which ends it on a deliciously spooky note.The least successful for me were Angelita Unearthed, the first story which actually caused me to DNF this book two months ago as it suggested to me that this collection would be everything I didn’t like about Things We Lost in the Fire — though I evidently decided to come back to it and give the rest of the book a shot; Kids Who Come Back, a promising concept literalizing the horrors of Argentina’s disappeared children which meanders and ultimately goes nowhere; and The Dangers of Smoking in Bed, the titular story which I couldn’t tell you a single thing about as it fell so flat for me.So even though this didn’t completely work to my tastes, there’s something about Enríquez that I keep finding myself drawn back to. I love her creativity, I love the way she brings different areas of Argentina to life so distinctly, and when her stories strike that eerie, unsettling chord, they work beautifully for me. I’ll probably keep reading her books as they get translated into English, though I’m unsure whether I’ll end up loving any of them or whether they’ll remain in this murky promising-but-unsatisfying territory for me....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Aug 04, 2021","Aug 23, 2021","Aug 04, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53215250-the-dangers-of-smoking-in-bed

A few chapters in, the main (female) character, on her first night in a brand new town, is feeling restless and unsettled and can’t shake the feeling that someone’s watching her. She decides to clear her head by… going for a walk. At night. In the pitch black. By herself. This is why I don’t read thrillers by men.Anyway, this was fine. I thought the premise was brilliant: in the 1980s, Una, a young teacher from Reykjavik, takes a post teaching two students in a small Icelandic town called Skálar which is so remote only ten people live there. (Skálar was a real town, but Jónasson explains in a forward that he took artistic liberties as it hasn’t been occupied since the 1950s.) Una receives a less than warm welcome and can’t shake the feeling that even though this teaching position was advertised, none of the locals want her there.I had a lot of problems with this book but I’ll stick to my two main criticisms. The way Una’s ‘alcoholism’ is treated is absolutely laughable; this woman will drink a single bottle of wine in a week and the whole town will be whispering about how she must be an alcoholic, the ridiculous nature of which isn’t remotely addressed; it’s like the reader is also meant to question Una’s credibility, seeing as Una herself starts to after a while (which leads to a moment which is just ridiculously outlandish if you can’t buy that Una actually believes her sanity is slipping away — which, sorry, I couldn’t!). For one thing, is there anything more tired than alcoholic narrators in thrillers, and for another, if you’re going to use that trope, at least… do it convincingly? There are also chapters interspersed throughout Una’s story, each about two pages long and fully italicized, from the perspective of an unknown character. Again, this isn’t a convention that I’m ever particularly wild about, but I’m not sure that I’ve ever seen it executed in a way where there was LESS payoff than there was in this book. As in, these passages could have been cut out and not a single thing would change about this book’s resolution.What Jónasson does well is create Skálar’s atmosphere, so if you like eerie, slightly spooky books set in remote Icelandic villages, it’s worth a read, but mystery fans are bound to feel a bit underwhelmed by this one....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Jul 14, 2021","Jul 17, 2021","Jul 14, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54860498-the-girl-who-died

And I am sure that I will be met with backlash, but this is a subjective Goodreads . My opinion on this book quite literally does not matter. Please keep scrolling if this offends your Austenite sensibilities. But I do want everyone to know that I think Emma is garbage.However, what I will also own is the fact that I didn’t choose a particularly prudent moment in my life to read this book. I am going through a situation that made being asked to sympathize with a privileged, entitled, manipulative protagonist feel like having teeth pulled. I know that these qualities objectively make Emma Woodhouse a more interesting character — but I quite literally could not care less! There is nothing on earth I would have resented reading about more in that moment.Anyway, personal baggage aside, I found this book to be tremendously bloated and self-indulgent. I know that Austen novels aren’t exactly page turners on the best of days, but my god, there was not a single thing here that managed to earn my investment. When I wasn’t irrationally furious about the way Emma was treating Harriet (ok, fine, maybe my personal baggage isn’t totally aside), I was bored out of my mind. I can imagine that a lot of readers are compelled by the fact that Emma doesn’t need to marry in the way that other Austen heroines do, but I found that that took away the very limited intrigue that Austen novels hold for me.I should also confess that I just don’t really *get* that famous Austenian wit that readers find so endearing, and which seems to be a huge draw for Emma in particular. I just didn’t find this book particularly charming or funny or lively and if that element is taken away, what on earth is even left?The one thing I will hand this book is that the narration is executed very well, but that doesn’t justify there being 500 pages of it. And make no mistake, the length IS the problem. I felt that a similar length was warranted in Mansfield Park which used those pages to develop theme and social commentary; Emma, in contrast, unfolds like a very straightforward parable, whose trajectory and moral can be summed up in a single sentence, and I have very little patience for this kind of book, where I feel like I get the point about 20 pages in and am then made to suffer through an agonizingly slow pantomime acted out by dull, lifeless, and/or irritating characters.I should probably give Emma a second chance at some point in my life but I can fairly confidently say that I do not want to, so, here we are.

But, however you'd classify it and whatever it did or didn't do to earn its spot on the longlist, I honestly really enjoyed it.The War of the Poor focuses on Thomas Müntzer, a controversial theologian at the heart of the Protestant Reformation, and I'd say that having some kind of interest in that period of history is a baseline requirement to getting anything out of this. This book reads, as some have noted, like a Wikipedia entry on Müntzer's life and death and all the revolts in between, but I also think that comparison minimizes its efficacy. I think Vuillard's writing is riveting and this is a much more thematically coherent project than its Wikipedia counterpart, and I also enjoyed the meta commentary on the ways in which we engage with history.

But I still went ahead and read through all of them this year, and a few months after having finished this project, the one that stands out to me head and shoulders above the rest is Mansfield Park. This is the only Austen novel I actively enjoyed reading; the only one I thought about when I put it down; the only one that I actually think will be worth revisiting. I’m sure some of you will think I’m being a contrarian just for the sake of it, given that this is widely regarded as her worst novel, but hopefully I can convince you of some of its merits by the end of this (highly anticipated????) .One thing that I tend to look for in books, strictly as a personal preference, is high stakes, which are something that’s conspicuously lacking from most Austen novels. This isn’t a criticism; I can’t fault her for something she isn’t trying to do. But it’s the reason I can’t really get into romance narratives; I need there to be something bigger going on than ‘will x and y end up together’. (This isn’t confined solely to the romance genre; it’s the reason Much Ado About Nothing is one of my least favorite Shakespeare plays. Sorry.)Mansfield Park just had that elevated je ne sais quoi that I was looking for. Unlike most of Austen’s heroines, Fanny Price is poor, with little to no prospects in her life, until she’s plucked from obscurity at age 11 to live with her wealthy cousins at the titular Mansfield Park, who give her quite the Cinderella treatment, with the exception of her cousin Edmund, who actually dares to pay her the time of day. Consequently, Fanny is nothing like the brash Emma Woodhouse or the self-assured Lizzy Bennet or any of the other bold, brazen Austen heroines that are so universally adored — and it’s because she quite literally cannot afford to be. That Fanny’s social status is so precarious added a layer of intrigue for me — the stakes may not be sky high, but suddenly there’s something darker and more sinister at play. Fanny herself is, you guessed it!, my favorite heroine for similar reasons. It’s easy to dismiss Fanny for being dull, quiet, and submissive, but the context of her upbringing can’t be ignored. In her rousing defense of Fanny Price from a 2014 Paris Review essay, Tara Isabella Burton writes:“The qualities of your typical Austen heroine—charming, forward, quick at learning—are rooted in privilege […] And so Fanny is never given the chance to exhibit the qualities of a “good” Austen heroine; she’s told from childhood that she is dull, stupid, and inadequate until she herself internalizes “my situation—my foolishness and awkwardness.” […] In wanting Fanny to be cleverer, bolder, sexier than she is—in wanting her to be more like Mary—we become complicit in the world of Mansfield Park, and in the politics of exclusion through which Mansfield thrives.”This is what I find so dismaying about the way a lot of people talk about Mansfield Park. To be bored by the novel is one thing, fair enough; but to hate Fanny for her timidity when she is a poor, neglected, emotionally abused child living under the thumb of her cruel and capricious family who expect her to perform nothing but gratitude while failing to allow her a seat at their table is something I can’t quite understand. I also can’t imagine reading a passage like this and not being moved, or maybe this just hit too hard when I think back on the experience of being a Shy Kid who used to live in the background of other people’s stories:“She could not equal them in their warmth. Her spirits sank under the glow of theirs, and she felt herself becoming too nearly nothing to both, to have any comfort in having been sought by either.”When Fanny stands up for herself by denying a wealthy suitor that everyone in her life wants her to accept, that moment hits all the harder for the fact that you know exactly what this moment of defiance is costing her. For me, that moment is the boldest display of strength that any Austen character shows.Choosing to frame this story around Fanny in the first place is also a choice worth examining; her foil, Mary Crawford, an interesting character in her own right, has more in common with Austen’s other heroines than Fanny does. This book isn’t interested in selling the reader a romantic fantasy of living in Regency England, a narrative which could have been achieved quite easily by telling this story through Mary’s eyes — more than in any other work, the social commentary takes center stage, and it was this too that compelled me.I’ve heard some people say that this book is more intriguing than it is enjoyable, but I have to disagree there too. The sequence of chapters leading up to the play is the most tension I have personally experienced in any Austen novel; I flew through those pages. Say what you will about Edmund and how much or little you personally would want to date him, but I felt Fanny’s love for Edmund in a way that I couldn’t personally feel in a single other Austen novel. I’m not saying that her other heroines weren’t actually in love; just that their love wasn’t communicated to me in a deeper way than simply reading the words on a page. Fanny felt like a real person to me in a way her characters often do not.This is easily Austen’s most didactic and most conservative work, and my enjoyment of it isn’t meant to be taken as a tacit endorsement of every idea she espouses here about Christian virtue and class and social status. In fact, I agree with almost none of it. But I don’t enjoy books for being a series of observations on life and society that I happen to agree with; I enjoy them for compelling me, moving me, challenging me, and making me think. Mansfield Park achieved all of that and none of Austen’s other novels did, and for that it is my favorite, and one that I wish more people would spend some time with....more",Notes are private!,0,41,1,"Apr 04, 2021","Apr 30, 2021","Apr 04, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/45032.Mansfield_Park

I read it in under 24 hours, though it's almost difficult to explain why: it's not (ostensibly) a page-turner and there's really no plot to speak of. But once I started reading I couldn't stop; I found Gyasi's prose so inviting and mesmerising and before I knew it I'd read the whole thing and it had utterly wrecked me.The thing about Transcendent Kingdom is that it has no business working as well as it does. Gyasi tackles grief, siblinghood, loneliness, immigration, racism, science, religion, and opioid addiction, and it feels almost too ambitious for a book under 300 pages. Often when authors try to balance this many disparate threads, some get lost in the shuffle; it's challenging to navigate each topic with the weight and respect they deserve, but that's exactly what Gyasi does here--everything coheres seamlessly.It's a difficult book to , though, because I've probably just made it sound like it's a novel full of ideas and nothing else. But the most impressive thing Gyasi does is perform her thorough thematic excavation without sacrificing the narrative. Again, it's not a plot-heavy book, but it's effectively character-driven, and Gifty, a neuroscientist coping with the death of her brother and her difficult relationship with her mother, is a brilliant, vibrant, believable protagonist.

While they were once inseparable in childhood, as adults they take very different paths – they move away from Mallard at a young age and Desiree has a daughter with a Black man, while Stella passes as white to take a secretary job, then cuts off contact from her family and spends the rest of her life hiding her true heritage from her husband and child (until, of course, a surprise encounter brings everything to a head). I think this book does a laudable job at its commentary on racial identity; the problem is, I don’t think it really has anything else going for it. The characters felt underdeveloped, the writing itself was mediocre, huge plot points often hinged on coincidences in a way that didn’t feel sufficiently self-conscious (the coincidences were acknowledged by the narrative, but in a way that felt to me less like ‘I am playing with fate as a deliberate thematic construct’ and more like ‘haha whoops this coincidence is a bit silly, I’m going to comment on how silly it is before anyone else can’), and every time you finally got settled into a particular narrative, the book would lurch ahead in time at nonsensical moments. I just got the impression that Bennett was trying to do too much – I think that if you isolate this novel’s core conceit, it could have made for a stunning novella or short story. For a novel, it was juggling too many elements and dropping balls left and right. For example, Desiree’s daughter has a trans partner, and while I assume that this detail was included to frame this story through different axes of oppression, his particular story and identity ultimately felt rather under-examined. When I compare this to something like its fellow Women’s Prize shortlister Transcendent Kingdom which tackles a broad spectrum of topics and coheres them into a single narrative with finesse, The Vanishing Half just feels like a flimsy shadow of what it’s trying to be.All that said, I think this book absolutely does deserve its large readership, as it examines race through the very specific lens of colorism which I think is largely underrepresented in literature, and I’m glad to have read this. I’m glad that it has touched so many readers. I can’t really bring myself to give it a rating under 3 stars, because I don’t think it deserves that – and I do think its thoughtful approach to racial identity is worth a lot.

So much I thought this book was brilliant but as I was reading, I found myself a little dismayed at the way I've heard a lot of people talk about it. So much has been made of the fact that this is a book in ""two halves""--the first is an irreverent stream-of-consciousness-style series of pithy observations that mimics the experience of scrolling through Twitter, and the second is much more serious, focusing on a family tragedy. The temptation to explain this division away by describing the first half as Online and the second half as Real Life is understandable, but I think it does a disservice to what Lockwood has actually attempted and achieved here.I don't think it's about the division of Online/Real Life as much as it is a commentary on the inextricable fusion of the two. The narrator's framework for viewing the world through a heavily Online lens is established in the first half, and then the second half shows that in times of grief and hardship, she's still existing within that same framework even while being forced to participate in ""Real Life"" with more immediacy than she had been used to. While I certainly agree that this is structurally a book made up of two halves, I thought the second half of the book was such a natural continuation of the first that I really admired how Lockwood managed to achieve such a natural coherence of two completely disparate narratives. And as an Extremely Online Person myself, I loved how much nuance Lockwood brought to this commentary. I feel like so many books and articles and essays about The Internet fall into one of two traps, either extreme reverence or utter condemnation. The reality is so much more nebulous--The Internet is this bizarre world that we all live in separate to our real lives but an intrinsic part of our real lives and I thought Lockwood captured that beautifully. This is absolutely not a book that I'd recommend to everyone (frankly if you aren't interested in Online Culture, stay away), but it really struck a chord with me and I admired it so much more than I had expected to....more",Notes are private!,0,112,1,"Apr 26, 2021","Apr 27, 2021","Mar 15, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53733106-no-one-is-talking-about-this

It’s a gritty, unapologetic excavation of the wealth divide in a small Caribbean tourist destination, cleverly juxtaposing idyllic tourism with the locals’ reality of violence and poverty.

I also quickly grew weary of how relentlessly bleak it was. I don’t usually do this, but I made the mistake of reading my friend Marchpane’s  in the middle of writing this one and I cannot get over how succinctly she summarized my issues with this book, and anything I write in my own words about this would only be a pale imitation, so I am going to take the lazy route and just quote from her  (and I suggest you go read the whole thing):""This book’s traumas are so relentless—incest; viscerally brutal beatings; an incident you might call infanticide via neglect. There is really no light with the shade here, not that you necessarily need light and shade to tell a sad story. The never letting up is precisely the point this novel is making. And I have no doubt this is (tragically) true-to-life for many women out there.But in a work of fiction, this has the effect of flattening everything about the characters to this aspect of their experience. I was never less than 100% conscious that I was reading about invented people, sketches on a page who only exist in order to show me this violence. It was a barrier between me and the characters that only grew, brick by brick, as each awful, violent incident unfolded.""To me, this is solidly the weakest offering on the Women’s Prize shortlist. It showcases an important cultural commentary, but lacks the literary craft to justify its accolades as a work of fiction. I think it’s a promising debut and hope that Jones will master the finesse needed to weave narrative and social commentary together in future works, but personally, I disliked this book’s style so strongly (a personal hangup, I’ll readily admit) that I’m not sure I’ll be following her career with much interest.

I’m not going to say anything about the plot, because reading the summary gives away a good chunk of the book, which I found sort of odd. It does take quite a while for Annabel Lyon to get to ‘the point,’ so to speak, but to summarize what happens at 20% is to do a huge disservice to the preamble, which, far from being irrelevant, is a wonderfully mesmerizing and offbeat introduction into these characters’ lives. This was one of the most pleasurable books I’ve read in ages; Lyon’s writing goes down easy but there’s also something acerbic just below the surface. The story itself twists and turns, but it’s still more literary than thriller; the mystery aspects are almost window dressing to the darker, weirder thing living at this book’s center. I can imagine what the critiques of this book look like: unfocused, joyless, slow, unresolved, odd. It’s not for everyone. It has no interest in answering the reader’s questions. But still it’s a striking, affecting examination of obligation and shame and guilt.

Reclaiming women's voices in fiction is an exercise that appeals to me so much in theory, and I've certainly read quite a few standouts in this subgenre, but so often these stories just hit the exact same exact narrative beats, examine the exact same themes which can be summarized, in brief, as: history has not been kind to women, isn't that sad. I mean, yes, of course, but I don't need a novel-length project to tell me what can be summed up in a sentence.Learwife isn't quite a retelling, as it begins right where King Lear leaves off. I have to say right away that I was never fully on board with this premise: the ending of Lear feels so apocalyptic that extending the story feels fundamentally incompatible with the text in a way that I struggled with. (Also, in case you don't know this about me: hi, my name is Rachel and King Lear is my favorite Shakespeare play and literally one of my favorite pieces of literature of all time and I have read it more times than I can count and I'm afraid that I can't divorce myself from my love of this play when evaluating retellings.) In Learwife, JR Thorp accounts for the conspicuous absence of Lear's wife in the original story by positing that she was banished to an abbey shortly following the birth of Cordelia, the couple's youngest daughter. Learwife begins with Lear's wife receiving the news of Lear and her children's death—and then the novel just spins its wheels for several hundred pages, with Lear's wife at the abbey, considering visiting the place where Lear and her daughters died, but instead navigating nunnery politics while treating the reader to the odd flashback to her life at court.The thing about Learwife that I struggled so much with was the fact that it didn't engage with the original story in any kind of worthwhile way. The mystery of why Lear's wife was banished is a lukewarm attempt at holding the reader's interest; the reveal is not only boring, but I also think it crumbles under a single ounce of scrutiny if you hold it up next to King Lear—it just isn't compatible with events and characters in a way that I think Thorp intends for it to be. But even if she didn't: for a novel which proposes to answer the age-old question of what happened to Lear's wife, I guess I was just hoping for that answer to be something that could realistically supplement the original play. A few quotes from Shakespeare are scattered throughout Learwife, like the following—I honestly just found the result a bit corny and try-hard:Is that my name? I seem to lose it. I reach for it sometimes and there is nothing. Hands empty; hands full of water, of girls' hair. I smile. Well, it does not matter. Nothing will come of nothing. I wish I felt like this was achieving something, but it honestly just leaves me with the impression that Thorp is sitting there patting herself on the back for shoehorning one of Lear's most recognizable lines in there. Nothing in this book does any work to augment or enrich the original play's events or themes. But even putting that aside, even just attempting to evaluate this on its own merits and not contrast it to Shakespeare, I guess I just don't understand what the point of this book was. It's repetitious and thematically anemic; the abbey scenes are dull and the flashbacks of court are silly anecdotes that do nothing to craft a novel that stands on its own. This whole book feels like it serves no purpose except to construct the identity of a woman who remains elusive even after reading hundreds of pages of her stream-of-consciousness narration. Also, a brief detour: in this book, Learwife had had a first husband, named Michael, of all things, and I just found that so silly and incongruous that it's worth mentioning. Also, the name Michael, as I understand it, has been used in England since the twelfth century; the legend of Lear, or Leir, would have taken place around the eighth century BCE. A friend did my homework for me and listened to a podcast with Thorp where she talked about deliberately transposing the play's setting to follow the advent of Christianity, as she was particularly interested in the religious tension in medieval England; a theme that I didn't think was given enough weight here to justify the change in setting. And speaking of changes: Lear is canonically eighty; here she makes him much younger, around fifty, a choice that chafes with the original text and doesn't really give the reader anything new to chew on.Perhaps if I loved King Lear less I could have loved Learwife more, but I also found the prose style overwrought and tedious so at the end of the day I don't think I was ever going to get on with this book. It seems to have been mostly well-received (Jane Smiley, the author of my favorite King Lear retelling, gave it a mostly favorable ; and just anecdotally, none of my Goodreads friends has given this under a 4-star rating) so I'm not sure that I can in good conscience tell you to avoid if it appeals to you, but wow, literally nothing about this book worked for me. It didn't prompt me to think about the original play in a new way and it didn't give me enough to enjoy it as a story in its own right and I'm mostly just annoyed that I wasted my time with it....more",Notes are private!,0,55,1,"Jan 16, 2022","Jan 28, 2022","Mar 09, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56897686-learwife

(I thought Circe was just okay--definitely not my favorite style Greek myth retelling; I prefer them to be a little more offbeat and literary.)Though to be fair, I actually enjoyed Ariadne more than Circe; where I felt a distinct lack of tension throughout Circe which made for a somewhat bland reading experience, I felt that Jennifer Saint did an excellent job at maintaining high stakes, even when the characters were living through periods of mundanity. But still, there’s something at the heart of these two books that inextricably links them for me; both novels aim to subvert the original tale, but the execution is done in such a quiet, subtle way that you’re basically following along a well-trodden narrative trajectory, the subversion living more internally for these characters in their narration than externally in events of the plot. So this quiet tale of Ariadne falling in love with Theseus before being marooned on a beach in Naxos and meeting the alluring god Dionysus certainly didn’t blow my socks off, but I found it to be an easy, thoughtful read that I ultimately did enjoy spending time with.

Even though I don't particularly like YA and didn't have the highest of hopes that these stories would engage with the plays in particularly interesting ways. Still, there were some pleasant surprises here.That Way Madness Lies is a YA anthology by a handful of noted writers, each retelling a different Shakespeare play. The selection of plays itself is very good--there are the crowd pleasers as well as a couple of unexpected ones. The organization of this anthology bothered me on a couple of levels--first off, why is The Winter's Tale placed in the Late Romances category but not The Tempest? We're also frequently treated to 1-page author's notes after stories, all of the same tenor; ""this is why the original play was problematic and here's how I decided to fix it"". Which, aside from being jarring and downright annoying, showed such a blatant disregard for Shakespearean scholarship that I had to laugh--yes, of course this is a commercial anthology intended for a young audience but my god, patting yourself on the back for being brave enough to consider The Merchant of Venice through Shylock's perspective as if scholars, directors, actors, and audiences haven't been doing exactly that for centuries is solipsistic to the extreme. Anyway, as always with anthologies, it's a mixed bag. Some of these stories are unexpected and brilliant and others fall spectacularly flat. So, let's do this.Comedies""Severe Weather Warning"" by Austin Siegemund-Broka and Emily Wibberley (The Tempest) - 4 starsA nice and melancholy snapshot into sibling rivalry as a storm rages outside, delaying Prosper's sister's flight to a prestigious internship that she effectively stole from her sister. Really enjoyed this one and felt that it was one of the most successful stories in accessing the original play's themes even as a nonliteral reimagining. ""Shipwrecked"" by Mark Oshiro (Twelfth Night) - 3 starsTwelfth Night meets high school prom--we've got some love and heartbreak coupled with mistaken identity shenanigans as one twin has recently come out as nonbinary and has started to resemble their brother. It's a bit corny but mostly harmless. ""King of the Fairies"" by Anna-Marie McLemore (A Midsummer Night's Dream) - 1 starMidsummer from the perspective of the ""Indian"" child abducted by Oberon and Titania. Hands down one of my least favorites from this collection; it couldn't be more heavy-handed and patronizing if it tried. If you like McLemore's writing you'll probably like this story; I simply do not.""Taming of the Soulmate"" by K. Ancrum (The Taming of the Shrew) - 3 starsA soulmate AU where Katherine doesn't see color until she meets Petrucio at her sister Bianca's party; rather an inconvenience for her 5-year plan. I take umbrage at a modern retelling framing Petruchio as the Reasonable One, but I grudgingly ended up appreciating where this story arrived.""We Have Seen Better Days"" by Lily Anderson (As You Like It) - 2 starsI found this story perplexing. As You Like It, as far as I'm concerned, is fertile ground for a reimagining that focuses on gender identity (a topic otherwise omnipresent in this anthology)--and instead we get... a story about summer camp nostalgia and daddy issues? Anyway, I'd be happy to put my expectations aside about what this had the potential to be if it were any good at all, but it was objectively one of the weakest in the collection. ""Some Other Metal"" by Amy Rose Capetta and Cory McCarthy (Much Ado About Nothing) - 1 starI kind of hate Much Ado so I was probably never going to like this very much but... yeah, it was bad. It follows two actors, Tegan and Taron, who play Beatrice and Benedick on stage, and off-stage have an antagonistic relationship, but they’re trying to be set up by their director. The meta narrative was painfully obvious and would be more fun if you enjoyed Beatrice and Benedick's dynamic in the slightest which I can't say I do. This story is also set in outer space for reasons that are of absolutely no consequence? ""I Bleed"" by Dahlia Adler (The Merchant of Venice) - 5 starsAnnoying author's note aside I honestly adored this. The Merchant of Venice + high school doesn't seem like a match made in heaven--right down to Antonio's occupation being declared in the title, this is an inarguably adult work. Part of the fun, then, becomes seeing how deftly Adler adapts this story's mature moving parts to a context which shouldn't work at all... but somehow does, brilliantly. It's a very literal adaptation which otherwise isn't my favorite approach in this collection, but I found this one very successful. A Sonnet""His Invitation"" by Brittany Cavallaro (Sonnet 147) - 4 starsA couple take a road trip to California in the only story in this collection that tackles a sonnet. I have to say, this one didn't make a huge impression on me as I was reading (part of it due to being the shortest story in this collection), but interestingly it's really the only one I'm still thinking about after having finished. Tragedies""Partying is Such Sweet Sorrow"" by Kiersten White (Romeo and Juliet) - 4 stars Yes, the title is stupid, but let’s move on. White actually does a remarkable job at capturing the simultaneous foolishness and lovability of the titular protagonists. This story is told entirely in text speak which admittedly is not my favorite, but it makes for fast, feverish reading, which is probably the effect that White intended. This story I felt was one of the most successful at transporting the emotional landscape of Shakespeare to a much smaller and more modern setting, and hands down the most effective story in the tragedy section. ""Dreaming of the Dark"" by Lindsay Smith (Julius Caesar) - 2 starsJulius Caesar meets a private girl’s school and dark magic. The context of this one was so utterly contrived (Briony and Cassie have just killed Julia as a sacrifice to a dark god; Annamaria wants revenge) I couldn’t really take it seriously. ""The Tragedy of Cory Lanez"" by Tochi Onyebuchi (Coriolanus) - 2 stars This one is probably better than I'm giving it credit for. Cameron Marcus, known by stage name Cory Lanez, is a rapper who was recently stabbed to death; this story tackles family, sexuality, and LA gang violence. Unfortunately it's also told as an oral history, and it's that format that I couldn't really get past--I don't think it works at all in short story form; the author hasn't earned the reader's investment in the character that we're mourning and the result is tedium. Which is kind of fitting for Coriolanus to be fair.""Elsinore"" by Patrice Caldwell (Hamlet) - 3 stars Hamlet retold as a penny dreadful--we're in Victorian England, and Claudius is a vampire. Anne (Hamlet) and Camilla (Ophelia) team up to take him down. This will work for a lot of readers better than it worked for me, it simply wasn't to my taste.""Out of the Storm"" by Joy McCullough (King Lear) - 1 starOh boy, HERE WE GO. I was already approaching this with trepidation after despising McCullough's bestselling Blood Water Paint, but I think my mind was as open as it could have been under the circumstances. Anyway, I remain unconvinced that McCullough has read anything more than the wikipedia summary for Lear as this really failed to engage with it on... any level deeper than 'three sisters whose names start with G, R, C.' Written like a play script, it's a snapshot piece where we see Gabi and Cora at their dying father's bedside at the hospital; Rowan, the middle daughter, bursts in and we discover that she's absented herself from the family to get out from under their strict minister father's thumb. Arguments ensue; Rowan is accused of being selfish, she retaliates that she had the fortitude to escape, etc., that kind of thing. Look, I'm sympathetic to the fact that Lear is one of the hardest plays to retell and I'm happy for a reimagining to be nonliteral, as long as it accesses some of the original play's themes, which this just didn't, at all. Ample meditation on truth, power, aging, justice, human nature, and cosmic inevitability to draw from and you opt for... three sisters with an over-controlling father? (The play script format was insufferable as well; if this were a real play it would be peak 'family arguing at the dinner table' theatre.)""We Fail"" by Samantha Mabry (Macbeth) - 1 star Just dreadful. Drea, a high school senior, has recently suffered a miscarriage, and her fiancé, Mateo, has been passed over for a football scholarship. When the two get in a car crash and their friend Duncan is pinned beneath the car, Drea convinces Mateo to wait before calling for help, so Duncan will die and Mateo can take his scholarship; and also because she's still mourning the loss of her child and needs to take control of their future. I really despise Macbeth retellings that have a hyperfixation on Lady Macbeth's fertility, and for that narrative to be given to a high schooler made it all the more perplexing and oddly melodramatic in a way that didn't show a similar self-awareness as the Romeo and Juliet story. This was too rushed as well; maybe it could have done something interesting as a longer story, but hurtling through the events of Macbeth at breakneck speed just didn't work.Late Romance""Lost Girl"" by Melissa Bashardoust (The Winter's Tale) - 4 stars This was a lovely story about Perdita who recently discovered the identity of her absent father, trying to cope with that as her new relationship with classics student Zal blossoms. It's short and sweet and a nice note to end on.Thank you to Netgalley and Flatiron for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,44,1,"Feb 15, 2021","Feb 18, 2021","Feb 15, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51260768-that-way-madness-lies

It starts off as a faithful adaptation (think Lear but with magic)--the titular King is abdicating the throne, and he makes a shocking choice to split the crown equally between his three daughters, provided that they pass the test he sets out for them: to each declare that they love him more than their sisters. Goneril (Gaela, in Gratton's novel) and Regan (still Regan), manipulative and self-serving, both pass his test, but his youngest and most loyal daughter, Cordelia (Elia), refuses to participate and is banished.To say I love this play is an understatement (hi, if you're new here, King Lear is my favorite play) and I'm finding it nearly impossible to untangle my thoughts on how I feel about this as a novel from how I feel about it as a retelling, so we're just going to go into an aggressive amount of detail and hope something coherent materializes. Mild spoilers forthcoming (mostly about the narrative roles of the characters within the novel, not about specific plot points).Tonally and thematically, Tessa Gratton accesses a lot of what makes Lear so special and I found that I mostly enjoyed my reading experience for that alone. I always say that Lear is a simultaneously cosmic and intimate play, concerned both with Nature and human nature, and the way Gratton literalizes these themes into her magic system and her worldbuilding is done tremendously well. The writing too has a rich, indulgent quality that suits the tone of the book; it's slowly paced and thoughtful, which felt appropriate to the story, though I imagine others may get bored early on without a love of Lear driving you forward.Though, that love of Lear (along with how intimately well I know this play) did end up being a double-edged sword. Gratton had my investment from the very first page without really needing to earn it, and that certainly helped me devour this 600 page book in a little over a week. But on the other hand, I started to become more and more frustrated with the ways in which Gratton engaged with this play.First is a rather specific annoyance, that luckily only occurred four or five times, but it was jarring enough that I have to mention it. The first half or two thirds of this novel follow the plot of Lear very closely, to the point where entire scenes from the play were acted out in this book. In theory that's not something that bothers me; what does bother me is Gratton taking word-for-word dialogue from the play and modernizing it so I felt like I was reading No Fear Shakespeare. Here are a couple of direct side-by-side comparisons so you can see what I mean. Gratton's sentences are first, Shakespeare's are second:""He has always loved Astore rather more than Connley.""""I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall."" ""Nothing will come from nothing. Try again, daughter.""""Nothing can come of nothing. Speak again.""""I cannot heave my heart into my mouth, Father. I love you... as I should love you, being your daughter, and always have. You know this.""""Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave/ My heart into my mouth. I love your Majesty/ According to my bond; no more nor less."" ""It is only a note from my brother, and I've not finished reading it. What I've read so far makes me think it's not fit for you to see."" ""I beseech you sir, pardon me. It is a letter from my brother that I have not all o'er-read; and for so much as I have perus'd, I find it not fit for your o'erlooking."" It's this but it would go on for entire conversations. Here’s the thing: this is pointless and distracting and when you go up against Shakespeare on a sentence by sentence level, you’re going to lose every time. Now, let's get into the characters, because that's where my real problem with this book lies.I found Gratton's portrayal of the Edmund character (Ban) endlessly frustrating. You could see her bending over backward to humanize Edmund, making these minor, pointless adjustments (Ban being older than his legitimate brother rather than younger, meaning his bastardy is the only thing standing in the way of his inheritance; Gloucester [Errigal] insisting that Edgar [Rory] inherit even after his alleged betrayal of his father) to amp up the reader's sympathy, but frankly, a lot of Edmund's charm was lost in the process. Edmund is my favorite character and I know I'm not alone in holding that opinion: the reason people love Edmund is because of his complexity and contradictions; he's already deeply human in the play and I felt that Gratton flattened that out of him in an attempt to make his transgressions to come from a play of moral purity. The parallel/inversion between Edmund and Cordelia in the play is fascinating to me--both youngest children, both loved by their fathers, one good, one evil, their fates intertwined in a chilling way. That Gratton chose to explore this connection was an exciting choice for me, but I felt that turning it into a romance added nothing, and in fact lost quite a bit, especially when it came at the narrative expense of what I think a lot of readers find to be a much more compelling dynamic; that between Ban and Morimaros (the King of France figure). (That's another thing. This book had every opportunity to be explicitly queer, but there were only ever hints and whispers of queerness on the page, which I found frustrating.) If I were to detail every single character-related annoyance I had we'd be here for a while, so here are some other highlights: I felt that Edgar (Rory) was underutilized and misrepresented when he was on the page. Aefa is the single most pointless character I have read in anything, ever, and the fact that her POV chapters weren't cut suggests to me that the editor just gave up. The old generation characters were all incredibly one-note; if you want to write a retelling focusing on the younger generation, that's fine, but King Lear himself shouldn't need to have a POV chapter to be a complex and interesting character. But we're getting rather nitpicky now so let's zoom back out. This book was marketed as a ""feminist King Lear retelling"" and a word that I've seen a lot of people use to talk about it is ""subversive."" But my issue is that it was not, at all. As I mentioned above, the first half of the book follows Lear with dogged faithfulness, and after that, things start to go off the rails. Which is fine, fun, exactly what I'm here for! If I wanted to read King Lear I'd just read King Lear. But when Gratton started taking control of the narrative, her choices, to me, started to become more and more unwieldy. Nothing she did felt to me like a direct, deliberate subversion of the play; it felt like she had more interest in telling her own story with these characters than doing so as a means to engage with the original text, and that's something that I think makes for an unsuccessful retelling. I don't think you need to have complete and utter reverence for the original, but I think a love for the play coupled with a clear vision for how to engage with it is necessary. I felt--especially after reading an interview with Gratton--that her aim here was as nebulous as 'King Lear but with better female characters', and as a staunch Lear fan, I was rooting for this book but it really let me down in the end.But I will end on a positive note (sort of): while I felt that Elia was as stiff and uninteresting as cardboard, I thought Gratton succeeded in doing some very interesting things with Gaela and Regan; Gaela particularly. The ways in which Gratton played with gender in Gaela's chapters were dynamic and exciting and I think that along with the aforementioned magic system, Gaela's character is this novel's primary strength. This is already the longest  I've written in ages and I'm not sure how to end it. Bottom line, do I recommend this book? While I appreciate you sticking with me for this long, probably in hopes of me answering that question, I'm sorry to say that I really don't know. I think you should be interested in Lear but not love Lear, maybe that's the key to unlocking the optimal reading experience. ...more",Notes are private!,0,35,1,"Jan 05, 2021","Jan 13, 2021","Jan 05, 2021",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/29982722-the-queens-of-innis-lear

I could not for a million dollars tell you why I clicked on that article, having no emotional investment in either of these people, but here we are. I was struck by two things: how resonant I found the way Cazzie talks about anxiety, and the fact that she's open about having emetophobia, something I've struggled with since the age of eight. So that alone was enough to pique my curiosity about this essay collection. The thing about this book is that you need to accept what it's trying to do and read it in good faith. Would this have been published if Cazzie weren't Larry David's daughter, of course not, but is she trying to join the ranks of great modern essayists like Jia Tolentino? Not in the slightest. These essays are self-indulgent, tone deaf, and solipsistic, but if you dwell on any of these things I promise you are taking this collection much more seriously than Cazzie is. So let’s focus on the good, because I unabashedly loved this book. Cazzie’s writing won’t win any literary awards but she’s surprisingly incisive, especially when it comes to talking about anxiety and her fear of mortality. Another thing is, the more neurotypical you are, the less this book is going to resonate with you (not that you're necessarily neurotypical if you didn't like it). Cazzie makes absolutely no effort to be likable; she paints a portrait of what it's like to be fully in thrall of anxiety and the insidious ways it tears you apart from the inside out, affecting both your self-worth and your relationships. She makes comments like this, that are on one level dismissive and alienating (yes, some people simply ""get really bad anxiety"" and it's still a bitch for them to live with), and on another level were like looking into a mirror:""I never understood social media posts advising people that ""it's okay to not feel good all the time!"" Who said that wasn't okay? Who is so okay to the point where they need to be reminded that it's okay when they don't feel okay?! When people ""reveal"" they ""get really bad anxiety,"" I'm dumbfounded, because I've never not been anxious long enough to ""get"" anxiety. It doesn't leave. Not ever.""She’s also funny as hell. You’ll either get her humor or you won’t, and you’ll know by the end of the first essay which side you're on. But--surprisingly, for the fact that you're spending 300+ pages inside the head of an extremely unhappy person--this collection is fun. It's self-deprecating, it's clever, and above all else, it's an entertaining way to spend an afternoon.This isn't for everyone (clearly), but I just really 'got' this book; I got what Cazzie was trying to do with it and I also got Cazzie as a person, and it made me feel slightly less alone in the world whenever I picked it up.

I can’t sit here and say that Nightbitch is an entirely unsuccessful project, because I think it does in fact accomplish exactly what it sets out to do — I just found my patience for it wearing thin the longer I spent with it. I’ve expressed my personal disinterest in books about motherhood before, so I always knew this book was going to be a bit of a gamble for me, but I had hopes that it would be a bit more “disaster woman who happens to be a mother,” rather than “mother who happens to be a disaster.” That wasn’t a problem, in and of itself — when it became clear to me how little my own vision for this novel overlapped with Rachel Yoder’s, I course-corrected my expectations as best I could. And I actually came to appreciate the relentless, brutally honest depiction of a young woman’s inability to cope with the demands of motherhood. This book is visceral and furious, and Yoder gets her claws into the reader.But the longer it goes on, and the more the magical realism slant starts to take over, the more its impact starts to wane. For something so graphic and carnal, this book ironically has very little meat on its bones; it never justifies its length, its metaphors all wear themselves out — it says absolutely everything it has to say, and then it keeps going. And going. And going. It’s not even a very long book, only around 250 pages, but it isn’t able to sustain even that. Any appreciation I had for this book’s themes became eclipsed by my frustration at Yoder’s insistence at presenting this to the world as a novel, instead of what I think could have been a punchy and memorable piece of short fiction.

He then descends into a sort of madness as thoughts of loyalty and cowardice torment him, along with the futility of the racist pantomime he’s forced to take part in — the French would utilize racist stereotypes of African soldiers, arming them with machetes to scare off the Germans — an identity which Alfa both rejects and internalizes. This book is violent and graphic and visceral but it’s also sublime. Anna Moschovakis’s translation is stunning and Diop’s writing thrums with a rhythm that can only be described as mesmerizing — reading this book is like being in a trance that you can’t snap out of. The repetition might be an annoyance to some readers, but it was really an asset for me and I felt that it drove home both the monotony of trench warfare and the cyclical nature of Ndiaye’s thoughts as his mental state deteriorates. I read this book a couple of months back and to be honest with you I can’t remember why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5; probably more of a gut feeling than anything, as looking back I can’t think of a single thing it did wrong.

Set at a fictional competitive publishing house in New York, Wagner, whose toxic work environment is captured with aplomb, it follows Nella, an editorial assistant and the only Black employee who is thrilled when a new Black girl is hired in a role similar to her own. But shortly after, Nella starts receiving cryptic messages begging her to leave Wagner, and she doesn’t know who she can trust.Where this fails as a thriller, it succeeds as literary fiction: the pace is practically glacial, but not for nothing; Zakiya Dalila Harris uses that time to wholly develop her characters and depict the toxic insularity of workplace microaggressions. There’s a lot of sharp, biting commentary in here about what it means to be Black in a white office, and what it takes to get ahead in the publishing industry; it’s an incisive read in that regard and I would happily have read an entire novel devoted solely to this element. But then the day-to-day office drudgery starts to fade into the background when the mystery element comes to the forefront.Where this fails as literary fiction, it succeeds as a thriller: the writing itself is engaging but otherwise nothing special, there’s a weird, quasi-speculative twist that comes out of nowhere, there are random POV chapters interspersed from other women embroiled in the bigger picture thing that’s going on that don’t further the story in any way, but which I assume are there to add tension and intrigue. But the tension and intrigue are never fully there because the pacing is so uneven.You could certainly laud this book, as many have, for being a sort of ‘genre-defying’ creation, but for me, this was just an overly ambitious project, especially for a debut. Its refusal to fit staunchly into a ‘literary’ or ‘genre’ box isn’t the issue; it’s that we end up with a book that’s half scathing social commentary of racism in corporate America, half a Get Out-style thriller, and it didn’t fully execute either of those aims as well as it could have. That said, even though this never came together in the way I was hoping for, I certainly did enjoy reading it — it’s unexpected, it’s original, it’s sharp, it’s funny — and I think Zakiya Dalila Harris is an author to watch out for....more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,"Jun 10, 2021","Jun 12, 2021","Dec 03, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55711688-the-other-black-girl

I loved the premise: Jeanie and Julius are 51-year-old twins living with their mother in rural England who drops dead one day and suddenly Jeanie and Julius are forced to navigate a world they don't fully understand. It's different and interesting but it just really fell flat for me.The problem with Unsettled Ground is that there's just no momentum. And I don't mean that in the sense that it would have worked better as a page-turner murder mystery or anything like that; I'm an advocate of the literary-thriller hybrid genre and I think Fuller nails that tone here--there is a bit of a central mystery but it's mostly a vehicle to explore the themes that she's interested in interrogating. That's all fine and well. But on a sentence-by-sentence level, this book dragged. There's no sense that it's moving forward toward anything, it just feels like it's spinning its wheels and I did not at any point find myself compelled to pick it up.Like I said, I did enjoy some of the thematic threads that Fuller explored in this novel and I don't have an overwhelmingly negative feeling toward it; I just couldn't bring myself to get invested at any point and I think this would be an incredibly lackluster addition to the Women's Prize shortlist. Thank you to Netgalley and Tin House for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,"Apr 09, 2021","Apr 25, 2021","Dec 03, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55678463-unsettled-ground

I adored McLaughlin’s writing: it's clear-eyed and pacy and this is, on the whole, a fairly enjoyable read. I'm also a sucker for anything having to do with art or art history or museums, so I loved the plot thread involving a woman turning up out of nowhere and claiming to have been responsible for a sculpture supposed to have been created by the late, famous artist Robert Locke. Where I felt this novel fell short of its potential was in its domestic storyline: it follows art historian Nessa's failing marriage (her husband has recently cheated on her and they're trying to get past it for the sake of their teenage daughter), and it also introduces a figure from Nessa's past who holds a secret about her. For one thing, the two threads (Nessa's work at the museum and her home life) don't dovetail in a way that I find satisfying or realistic (Luke's hyperfixation on the statue was something I found almost absurd in how it was so transparently shoehorned in there). And for another thing, the secret about Nessa's past revealed something that shone rather a different light on her husband's cheating, which I felt could have added so much depth and complexity to that dynamic but which instead ended up feeling rather underexplored. On the whole this wasn't bad but I also don't think it quite showcases what Danielle McLaughlin is capable of.Thank you to Netgalley for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,Mar 2021,"Mar 21, 2021","Dec 03, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50155660-the-art-of-falling

Years have gone by and now we follow Cat, who’s estranged from her sister and living in Los Angeles, until she gets a call from El’s husband, Ross, begging her to return to Edinburgh as El has gone missing, which involves returning to the house they grew up in, as Ross and El are now living there.That this is the author’s debut novel is very apparent; most of the problems are with its poor pacing and its inexpert synthesis of the mystery and childhood trauma narratives. Flashback passages are shoehorned into the present-day narrative with an abruptness that almost feels deliberate, almost feels like a commentary on trauma, but which mostly ends up feeling poorly written. These flashbacks were so detailed and so repetitive that I mostly found myself skimming them as they failed to advance the characterization or the present-day narrative in any way; they did, ultimately, contain clues that tied into the mystery, but I ended up guessing most of the twists anyway, even without giving large segments of this book my full attention. I’m struggling a bit to rate this one as I weirdly did enjoy reading parts of it — once it really got its momentum up, around 50-60% in, I couldn’t put it down — but the negatives far outweigh the positives of this reading experience.

(Something like Transcendent Kingdom is the exception, where the mother/daughter relationship is one thread among many.)I was finding something salvageable in the first half of Burnt Sugar, but the second half just lost me. While I tend to enjoy 'unlikable' protagonists, Antara was often too much for me--I found her to be deliberately belligerent toward the reader in a way that I didn't think was particularly interesting or well-executed. I think this book does have a lot going for it in terms of its chilly depiction of a strained mother/daughter relationship, but Antara herself staunchly refused to do any of the heavy lifting to earn my investment. I just didn't find her believable or her actions comprehensible; this book is written in the first person and still I struggled to discern some of Antara's motivations (this isn't helped by the book's awkward structure, flitting between the past and the present in a way that was occasionally challenging to follow and which I didn't think ultimately did it any favors). Avni Doshi's prose also failed to impress me, but, like most of my criticisms here, I feel that might just be a matter of personal taste.

At the college’s ride board (this is set in the 1990s, pre-the sort of technology that we’d use today for this kind of arrangement), she meets Josh Baxter, also heading in that direction, so she gratefully accepts the ride. The only snag: Charlie’s roommate and best friend was recently murdered by a serial killer. The longer Charlie and Josh spend in the car and the more they get chatting, the more Charlie starts realizing that certain details in Josh’s story aren’t adding up, and she starts to wonder if she’s trapped in the car of her roommate’s murderer.I read this in a single sitting — I think it’s Sager’s most successful page-turner to date, which seems almost counterintuitive; you’d think that a girl being trapped in a car wouldn’t exactly make for the most gripping of reads, but this might be his most tense, terrifying work yet.

I'm inherently skeptical of second-person narration; I find it particularly tricky to do effectively and with real purpose, so when I started reading it was with a slight apprehension, but Azumah Nelson won my trust effortlessly. His writing is absorbing and gorgeous, the bond between character and reader sealed by the author's choice to frame reader as protagonist, a choice that has the potential to fall flat but which instead is elevated by Azumah Nelson's sharp commentary on sight and observation. This probably sounds like an off the wall comparison but Open Water is a bit like James Baldwin meets Sally Rooney. It has that tender, push-and-pull, will-they-won't-they quality of Normal People but it's also heavier; the stakes are higher; it's not a book generically about young love but instead specifically about young Black love, and the cost of systemic racism on Black love and Black bodies. It's a gentle, supple story, joyous and heart-rending and intimate.26-year-old Caleb Azumah Nelson is an author to watch.

In some ways it's a melancholic, heavy story, but there's also a playfulness to it, and I found that tone so refreshing that I was sure that Filthy Animals was going to end up as one of my favorite books of the year. Instead, this book is unendingly bleak. Anne of Cleves offers a brief respite from the misery, but it's otherwise a weightier collection than I had expected. Every alternating story in this collection follows the same narrative: a depressed Black man named Lionel has just met a white couple at a party, Charles and Sophie, who are in an open relationship; he hooks up with Charles and then gets drawn into their lives. I loved the choice to anchor the collection to a single narrative, and without fail these stories were my favorites and the ones where Taylor most succeeded at accessing the characters' complex emotional landscapes. The other stories left less of an impression on me, and I think it's because we just don't spend enough time with the characters to fully earn the emotional impact that Taylor is aiming for, and that he nails so well with Wallace's story in Real Life. I finished this a week ago and Lionel's story is really the only one that has stuck in my mind since then.I still really enjoyed reading this--a discussed, I love Taylor's writing--and I would wholeheartedly recommend it. It's a skillful exploration of the intersection of loneliness, trauma, and intimacy--it just wasn't entirely what I needed it to be. But that is a-okay!

Usually when I read YA my overriding feeling is ‘this wasn’t written for me,’ but I actually didn’t feel that so much; this largely felt like an adult thriller when I was reading.  Yes, it contains Teenagers Experiencing Emotions, but that isn't something I have an issue with; there was this sort of cool detachment to the writing that I felt worked in its favor and it was a fantastically paced, cleverly structured book that wasn't weighed down by the protagonist's navel gazing.  And yes, there’s The Twist—it didn’t blow my socks off because it ended up being something I’ve seen done in other books, but I actually thought the execution here was really fantastic and it was definitely worth the wait.  I did feel like the whole thing came together successfully, and it's hard to talk about without giving anything away, but suffice to say this book was just delightful escapism if you prefer your beach reads to have a sharp edge. ...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Nov 29, 2020",Dec 2020,"Nov 08, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/16143347-we-were-liars

It's told through the eyes of Ginny, the eldest daughter and Goneril figure, who lives on their father's thousand acre farm with her husband in a house adjacent to her sister Rose's (Regan)--the youngest sister, Caroline (Cordelia) has moved away and works as a lawyer. When their aging father announces his retirement and intention to turn the farm over to his three daughters, Caroline admits skepticism and is turned away; Ginny and Rose are then left to battle his cruelty and deterioration into drunkenness while keeping the farm afloat.While the premise sounds literally transposed from the Shakespeare play, enough details are reinvented to assure the reader that literality is not Smiley's intention. Rose has cancer, and she has two daughters; Ginny has had five miscarriages and desperately wants a child; Loren (Edgar), in my opinion one of the smartest characters in the original play, is here an afterthought and a bit of a sycophantic idiot; Pete (Cornwall) is a recovering abusive husband, his relationship with Rose unhappy and volatile, while Ginny's marriage to Ty (Albany) is placid in comparison; the Fool is omitted; Jess (Edmund) is not a scheming mastermind, but instead an unmoored drifter whose interruption of Ginny's life is unplanned, haphazard. And as someone who's read King Lear about a million times and has spent countless hours thinking about these characters, if I am actively choosing to spend my time reading King Lear retellings, I can't allow myself to get mired in the details, or else reading retellings just becomes a self-defeating exercise. Half of what I just wrote, what Smiley decided to do with these characters, I don't agree with; it doesn't fit my own idea of what a picture-perfect retelling should look like. So I'm much less interested in the details and more interested in the author's vision, in the ways in which they interact with the original play even--especially--when they choose to deviate. This is where The Queens of Innis Lear, a high fantasy Lear retelling, fell spectacularly short for me, and this is where Smiley succeeded.Each of Smiley's characters is tremendously well-drawn, none more-so than the narrator Ginny. Ginny is obedient and self-effacing, the modest counterpart to her sister Rose who blows through the story like a hurricane. The dynamic between these two sisters, united against the obdurate front that is their father, yet more severed than either of them realizes, is what makes this book so memorable and horribly devastating. This is a bleak, stark, humorless work, which accesses the tragic inevitability of the original play and refocuses it. This isn't the tragedy of Lear as much as it is the tragedy of Goneril, the long-suffering eldest daughter, and in turning this into Ginny's story, part of the cosmic scale is lost, but the calamity and the creeping dread is recaptured on a smaller, more intimate scale. This is an engrossing, quietly devastating book that deftly examines power, corruption, and betrayal through a melancholic, reflective lens, and I found the result both beautiful and heart-rending. I prefer to write my s without spoilers, but in this case, the spoiler is also a huge trigger, so I do want to talk about that before we go. (view spoiler)[Trigger warning for sexual assault of a minor. The reveal that the Lear figure had raped Ginny and Rose when they were teenagers didn't sit well with me at first; for one thing, I tend to take the opinion that books should not introduce sexual assault as a plot point if sexual assault is not their primary focus; for another, it felt to me like a lazy shortcut to giving Ginny and Rose permission to defy their father, an unnecessary addition when the justification for their behavior is already built into the framework of the story. What I did find interesting, though, was how this related to Ginny and Rose's relationship to Caroline; it was refreshing to see a Lear retelling finally do something interesting with Cordelia, turning her from the archetype of the perfect woman to a stubborn, ungrateful child, choosing not to see the full picture of what Ginny and Rose shielded her from. There's a line toward the end where Ginny is about to tell Caroline the full truth, and Caroline turns away and refuses to hear it; there's an acknowledgement that truth can't be delivered without it being asked for, a shocking subversion from Cordelia's role in the original play that I found tremendously effective.

Set at the fictional Scottish all girMamma mia where do I begin.Despite having a deliciously enticing premise, Madam fails on just about every level. Set at the fictional Scottish all girls’ boarding school Caldonbrae Hall, Madam introduces Rose, a bright young ingenue of a teacher who gets a job as the head of Caldonbrae’s Classics department — notably and oddly, she’s the school’s first outside hire in over a decade. She arrives at Caldonbrae and quickly discerns that there is fuckery afoot. The entire function of Rose’s character is to unearth the fuckery. There is so little interiority to her character that there is never a sense that she is a real person living this experience; she is transparently a thriller protagonist bumbling around chasing clues, and she does an agonizingly terrible job at it. Every time a character starts to reveal something and then realizes they’ve said too much, Rose lets it go — quite the impressive regard for boundaries, given the fact that when she isn’t walking away from people mid-conversation, she’s asking everyone and their mother impertinent questions that go nowhere. This is, quite literally, the entire book. The fuckery is, of course, eventually unearthed, and yes, it was indeed the most obvious explanation that you guessed by page 50, but anyway, what happens at this point in the book? Rose actually takes the fate of her students into her own hands? She allies with someone to bring about systemic change? She realizes resistance is futile and makes a plan to get the hell out of Dodge? No, she basically just… asks more questions. More specific questions, this time around, to be fair to her.Anyway, I mentioned briefly that Rose is a Classics teacher, so let’s go back to that. Having been raised by a second-wave feminist, Rose has internalized a lot of her mother’s values (she wouldn’t go as far as to call herself a feminist though, heaven forfend! Sidebar: I’m not sure that in 2021 we still need novels that spoon-feed feminist ideology to the reader by adding a spoonful of sugar to the medicine, holding our hand and reassuring us that “women are people too” isn’t a radical, scary notion, but… Phoebe Wynne disagrees, I guess). Anyway, Rose is drawn to female characters and historical figures from Greek and Roman mythology and history, and spotlights a handful of them — Antigone, Dido, Medea, Lucretia, et al. — in her classes. The integration of classics into this novel is so ham-fisted, so unsubtle, so unnecessary, it bears asking why it had to be the classics at all. The Secret History (a very different project with very different aims that I am not attempting to compare to Madam on a deeper level, to be clear) would not be The Secret History if it were about a group of chemical engineering students — the classics are so integral to that novel’s themes and framework that it would crumble without that element. If We Were Villains would not be If We Were Villains if the students were studying Jane Austen instead of Shakespeare. This isn’t a criticism; it shows how deliberately constructed those novels are. In Madam, the classics are merely an arbitrary addition that could have been substituted with impactful women from any period of literature or history and netted the exact same result: a half-baked commentary on how History Has Not Been Kind To Women.Aside from being thematically careless, this book was just poorly written on a sentence-by-sentence level. Inexplicably, most scenes are recounted in the pluperfect tense:“Earlier that morning she’d knotted her unruly hair into a thick plait[…]” “Rose had gazed at the delightful picture they all made, touching her own blazer with a tinge of shame.”“She’d stopped by Anthony’s office on Friday to see if he wanted to go for a walk together over the weekend.”Why? Why are we being narrated scenes that already happened rather than just… being shown those scenes? The whole thing takes on a very tell-don’t-show style, which I believe can work in certain circumstances, but this ain’t it. Also, the details in this book are all in the wrong places. It’s set at a boarding school, and the school itself is barely described — we are usually up to date on the state of Rose’s hair, though. I also think it should be a cardinal sin for a book to start with a journey (in this case: Rose on the train to Caldonbrae), end the chapter when they arrive, and start the following chapter the next morning. We don’t see Rose settling into her flat, we don’t see her walking around the school, we don’t see any of it. The exposition is just terrible. Characters are also introduced at such a lightning speed that I couldn’t keep track of who anyone was and I had no sense of how many students or teachers were at this school.Changing gears now: as other ers have noted, the white saviorism and the tokenistic portrayal of a group of Japanese students is downright shameful. Diversity does not need to serve a narrative function, and indeed, it’s often better when it does not, especially in the hands of a white author writing about non-white characters. Here, the function is both extant and obvious: it’s to illustrate by comparison how progressive Rose is. And I quote:“The general spread of white faces made Rose uncomfortable despite the small handful of Asian girls, who seemed to group together. This lack of diversity leaked across the staff, too — not at all appropriate or modern for the nineties, she thought.” Speaking of diversity and representation, I’m not sure why some people are calling this book queer? It’s not. There is one (1) lesbian character, not the protagonist, and she’s a self-loathing alcoholic, so… not sure why that’s something to celebrate, but whatever.Anyway, back to the above quote, gross depiction of Japanese students aside — this book is set in the 1990s. That sweet spot for dark academia novels, where authors have the convenience of writing virtually about the present-day, but where the characters don’t have cell phones and laptops which would destroy both the atmosphere and undermine the characters’ work at solving the mystery. That’s all fine and well, but if you take out all the references to Queen and Batman Begins, this book feels like something out of the 1800s. You will hear no disputes from me about the fact that misogyny is alive and well and that certain individuals and institutions hold antiquated values, but those conservative values are satirized to such an extreme here that they start to feel utterly absurd. And the problem is that this book is not trying to be satire. I’m supposed to take it at face value, even when it’s pushing my suspension of disbelief further and further past its breaking point.Which brings us to The Fuckery. As discussed, I found it very obvious, but that is honestly the least of my damn concerns. The details here were just… so, so ridiculous, trying so hard to be provocative. The “Worship” scene (if you know you know) is the most unintentionally funny thing I have read in my entire life. This was supposed to be a horrifying scene and I just couldn’t stop laughing at the fact that someone actually greenlit this garbage. I could practically see Phoebe Wynne rubbing her hands together in glee for having shocked the reader with something so DARING and TABOO when it actually just served to undermine the impact of whatever psychological abuse was going on here by turning the whole thing into a dark, fucked up cartoonish pantomime. This was just an incoherent, poorly-constructed project that had no ardor, no artistic integrity, and no intrigue. It was bizarrely terrible and did not have a single redeeming quality and it made me feel cynical about my profession (I’m an editor) and if you take anything from this  let it be this: read literally any other book! Please! I don’t care how good the summary is! I suffered so you don’t have to!!!Thank you to Netgalley and St. Martin’s Press for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,56,1,"Sep 04, 2021","Sep 06, 2021","Oct 09, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54860174-madam

An interest in Shakespeare, whether you've read all of his plays or only read one, is really the only requirement to picking this up. Smith doesn't give broad strokes overviews of the plays, but instead she zeroes in on details that stick out to her in each one, which start to tie into one another with the more essays you read.

I found the preponderance of stories about BDSM started to get a little boring after a while, but this was otherwise a refreshing collection that I enjoyed spending time with.I felt the stories that were the most successful were the ones that contextualized the characters’ kinks—I don’t mean that in a ‘every kink comes from a fucked up childhood’ kind of way; I mean that your life and your sex life are part of the same whole and some of these stories were more interested in interrogating that intersection than others. The two absolute stand-outs were Brandon Taylor's Oh, Youth (tender, devastating) and Carmen Maria Machado's The Lost Performance of the High Priestess of the Temple of Horror (weird, sensual)--incidentally the two longest stories in the collection. The other surprising highlight for me was Trust by Larissa Pham, an author I'd never heard of, whose Vermont-set story I found evocative and effectively moving. The less said about Roxane Gay's Reach the better, and a handful of other stories fell flat too, mostly the ones that lacked interiority of any kind. You could tell that a lot of these authors wanted to forgo character and dive straight into Commentary About Desire, and I always found that much less effective.(Also, anyone looking forward to new Garth Greenwell should know that his story, Gospodar, is a chapter taken straight from Cleanness--I ended up skipping it when I realized I recognized what I was reading as I hadn't particularly enjoyed that chapter the first time.)Bottom line is that it's honestly worth the price of admission for Taylor and Machado, but otherwise it didn't totally reach its promising potential.Thank you to Netgalley and Simon & Schuster for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,44,1,"Jan 07, 2021","Jan 21, 2021","Jul 30, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/54304256-kink

A baseline familiarity with the Plantagenets I think is a strong asset in approaching this book—its function isn’t didactic and as such I can imagine it’s easy to get a bit lost in the historical narrative, which is presented coherently, but without much interest in the broader historical context.But as someone already deeply invested in this particular period of English history, this read like a dream. The characters are all so well-drawn and Ruth Diver’s translation is stunning. Dupont-Monod manages to imbue this period of history with a vibrancy and heightened emotional landscape that does border on the anachronistic, but this isn’t the sort of historical fiction that aims for perfect historical accuracy—these figures are more of a vehicle for Dupont-Monod to explore the bigger ideas that preoccupy us today when we look back at the Plantagenets. The complex and thorny relationships within that family are a never ending source of fascination, and here those relationships are excavated alongside a potent commentary on familial love and power.

And Iago is undeniably a brilliant character; his masterclass in manipulation is mesmerizing to watch. But it was also a particularly interesting play to read amidst the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement, as discussions about Black representation in the media are currently in our cultural foreground.There’s a contradiction at the heart of Othello that makes for unsettling reading: Iago, while ostensibly the villain to Othello’s tragic hero, is also the character that the audience has the strongest connection with through a series of prominent soliloquies (that Othello himself is denied); Iago is also a flagrant racist. Reconciling these two truths about Iago is a challenge, and no matter which way you look at it, it doesn’t sit comfortably as we circle the ‘is this play racist’ question.On the one hand it’s easy to argue that because Othello is the hero and Iago is the villain, the play itself has (what we would call in our contemporary terminology) anti-racist intentions. But I also think that largely discounts the shocking, brutally violent act that Othello commits on stage in (spoiler) killing his white wife Desdemona, the archetype of the waify ingenue. Even if you know it’s coming, the optics of this scene are shocking and hard to stomach. In the 1990s British-Ghanaian RSC actor Hugh Quarshie actually argued that Othello is the one Shakespeare role that should never be played by a Black actor; he then surprisingly went on to play Othello in 2015 (incidentally in the first RSC production to cast a Black actor as Iago as well), stating “Only by black actors playing the role can we address some of the racist traditions and assumptions that the play is based on.”If there are any hard and fast conclusions to be drawn here regarding Othello and representation, they’re certainly not meant to be drawn by me as a white person. This was just on my mind as I read and I’d find it disingenuous to pretend my overall feelings on the play weren’t at all affected by considering this question and its implications.However, on an entirely separate note: one thing I don’t love about this play is how utterly ambivalent I am to the characters’ inner lives. I do think there’s depth to be added to these characters by good actors and good directors, but I also think a lot of that depth is not necessarily present in the text itself. What’s compelling about this play is the interpersonal dynamics, not the characters individually. I almost feel like everyone’s character is inextricably tied to the events of the play, in a way that feels almost the antithesis of Hamlet or King Lear, where all of the characters’ inner lives and motives are so intricate.But, as I said, the interpersonal really shines here. Othello and Iago positioned as mirrors to one another’s jealousy is done expertly. And Emilia is a fascinating character to me as well as she relates to Iago and Desdemona, with the apparent contradiction in her actions and loyalties. Anyway to say I have mixed feelings on Othello is an understatement, but that’s not to say that I don’t enjoy it or haven’t enjoyed the time I’ve spent wrestling with it....more",Notes are private!,0,41,1,"Jul 15, 2020","Jul 17, 2020","Jul 15, 2020",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12996.Othello

Thompson, each of which navigates issues of racism and trauma as they particularly pertain to the Black middle class.  Each play is distinct both in style and subject, but all thematically cohere into a sharp, savvy collection that makes for fantastic reading, though I imagine seeing any of these come to life on the stage with the right actors would be an even more entrancing experience. Underground - 5 starsOriginally performed in 2017, Underground is the standout play from this collection, which focuses on the tension between two friends, two middle-aged, middle class Black men who had both been activists for the Black Panther movement, but who have drifted apart in life and in ideologies.  This play is razor-sharp and startlingly prescient; reading it amid the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement was a rather humbling experience, to be reminded so starkly that the movement's catalysts have been decades, centuries in the making.  This exchange in particular drove home a relevant piece of discourse that's been in the news a lot lately:MASON: Wait. This is not just sensational journalism. They are out here bombing shit, man. KYLE: Things. Not people. Statues of long dead white men can’t die again. Monroe - 5 starsSet in 1940s Lousiana, Monroe follows the impact of a lynching on a small-town community, including one young woman, the victim's sister, who believes herself to be pregnant like the Virgin Mary.  Monroe has a sort of mystical, fable-like quality to it which makes it stand apart from the other two plays in this collection, but it's all the more resonant for its examination of the timelessness of anti-Black violence in America. The Mamalogues - 2 starsThis one's tricky, because here's the thing; I was never going to like this play.  I don't like books (and films, and plays, and stories, more broadly) about motherhood and that's what this is.  Three Black middle class single mothers compare their lived experiences in this sort of vignette-style play.  When you're already disinterested in motherhood as a theme and there's no actual narrative to sustain the play, it's not fun reading.  But that criticism is very much on me so I won't hold it against this collection too much.  Lisa B. Thompson is a brilliant writer and this is worth the price of admission for the first two plays alone.Thank you to Netgalley and Northwestern University Press for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Jun 20, 2020",Jul 2020,"Jun 20, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/48587624-underground-monroe-and-the-mamalogues

Pandemics (this last one evoking existential dread more than nausea but do I find reading about them almost as painful as living through one). This book has all three, so, it’s a testament to how much I like Emma Donoghue’s writing that I: a. Made it through this book, and b. Actually enjoyed it. Set in a maternity ward in 1918 Dublin over the course of three days, The Pull of the Stars follows Julia Power, a nurse attending to expectant mothers who are sick with the flu.  It's a fast-paced, frantic novel that contrasts the hectic episodes on the ward with the tender, budding friendship between Julia and her new volunteer helper, an uneducated girl named Bridie Sweeney.This book is thoroughly engrossing--it immerses you in a borderline excessive amount of detail, but Donoghue manages it in a way so that it pulls the reader in rather than alienating them.  Full disclosure, I had to skip entire paragraphs of this book that were too gruesome for me, but it was entirely with regret that I did so--there's something so transfixing about Donoghue's storytelling, and I've felt this about all three of her books that I've read.  She also nails the evocation of this Irish hospital in a city under siege by a deadly virus. With obvious parallels to 2020 in a lot of ways, this still felt firmly fixed in its historical setting, which was a positive for me.I did find The Pull of the Stars rather heavy-handed at times (notably in its treatment of Irish political history; it felt very transparent that Donoghue was framing Julia as an outsider to the rebellion in order to spoon feed the reader about how maybe the British empire aren't the good guys after all!--though I will concede I probably read more of these narratives than most), but that was my only real complaint.  On the whole I thought this was a compelling, moving read, though I must caution that you need either a strong stomach or a strong conviction to make it through.

(The irony is lost on none of us that we're essentially reenacting Station Eleven.) A group of us divvied up parts and read A Midsummer Night's Dream, which, incidentally, is the play in which I made my acting debut as Mustardseed the fairy when I was 11. I was angling for Puck so that casting decision came as quite the blow. It felt redemptive to read as Hippolyta last night, a slightly meatier role.Anyway, all silliness aside, times are tough right now and I know a lot of us are having difficulties concentrating on our usual sorts of escapism, which for most of us includes reading. This virtual Shakespeare production amongst a group of friends was such a fun distraction that we're going to make it a weekly thing, proceeding with The Tempest next weekend. If you have a friend group who'd be down for this kind of thing (it doesn't have to be Shakespeare - you could do any play or movie script), I HIGHLY recommend it. It's the only 2 hours this week that I've felt truly switched off from the constant news stream and existential dread that's been eating away at me. That's why I thought I'd share - there's so much discourse floating around about how you need to Make The Most of this quarantine to clean your house and learn a new language and write the next great American novel, but I think what we really need are lower-stakes, delightfully distracting and unproductive projects like reading Shakespeare with your friends around the globe with a glass of wine.Hope you all are staying safe and healthy!...more",Notes are private!,0,41,1,"Mar 21, 2020","Mar 21, 2020","Mar 21, 2020",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1622.A_Midsummer_Night_s_Dream

They will turn you out,' her voice ugly and spiteful.'I have a baby,' I said, thinking it wiser to tell her.'A baby!'  She was aghast.  It was all she wanted.There's a lot more that didn't work for me: the pace of the first half of the novel hurtled by at breakneck speed as if it were running through a checklist of every horror imaginable, and the second half slowed to such a standstill all momentum was lost.  I felt emotionally numb reading this, which is particularly noteworthy given how graphic it is (trigger warnings for everything imaginable apply).  The exploration of trauma only ever felt surface-level; all I ever really learned about Maryam was about her identity as a mother; the more I read the less I understood O'Brien's aims with this book. Ultimately well-intentioned but too unfocused to make a huge impact....more",Notes are private!,0,134,1,"Mar 07, 2020","Mar 09, 2020","Mar 02, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43565316-girl

It felt to me like Angie Cruz was so determined to Capture the Immigrant Experience that she crammed in as many details as possible to further this goal while following through on none of them.  The historical details felt shoehorned in to remind the reader of historical context (Malcolm X is assassinated right outside Ana's door, conveniently) while lacking sufficient commentary; none of the characters' motives are really explored outside of Ana's and therefore everyone feels like a caricature or a plot device; the way Cruz attempted to balance Ana's first-person narration in New York with updates from back home was... perplexing.  The result is a disjointed mess.The one thing I thought Angie Cruz did well was capture Ana's loneliness and alienation in the United States, but even the strength of this element began to wane once Ana met César.  Ultimately I hated reading this, and how it earned its way onto the Women's Prize longlist is beyond me....more",Notes are private!,0,92,1,"Mar 02, 2020","Mar 06, 2020","Mar 02, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43263696-dominicana

Big Girl, Small Town follows Majella, a fast food worker on the autism spectrum in the fictional town of Aghybogey, Northern Ireland. Like most post-Troubles lit this deals with lingering tensions between Protestants and Catholics, the unresolved and unstable social climate narratively underscored by the disappearance of Majella's father, who went missing during the Troubles. I can't quite put my finger on what didn't work for me, beyond feeling sort of vaguely unconvinced by Majella who felt to me very much like a character in a novel and not an actual person. This felt like it was desperately trying to be quirky but didn't quite have the finesse needed to pull it off; it comes off as rather prosaic and muted. I didn't mind reading this--it's a short book--but I also found it so unnoteworthy that I can't come up with anything else to say about it.

When I started reading, I was immediately turned off by the writing, which I thought was overwrought and stylized to a frankly annoying degree — but I pushed through and I actually found that the writing mellowed out after the first chapter; the prose does have a distinct lyrical flair throughout, but there was almost an air of desperation to the first chapter that the rest of the book was mercifully lacking. (It reminded me of this phenomenon that you sometimes see where it is very transparent that the author workshopped the hell out of chapter 1 to submit to agents, and then settled into a more organic style after that. I can’t say for sure that that’s what happened here, but that was the impression I got.)Migrations is set in a version of the near-future where almost all animal life has died out, and it tells the story of Franny, a woman determined to follow a species of bird called the Arctic tern on their final migration from Greenland to Antarctica. Because she doesn’t have any funding for this expedition, the only way to make it is to join a fishing vessel and convince the captain to reroute the boat. Obviously she succeeds, or there wouldn’t be a book, but the novel is less about the journey itself and more about Franny’s past, and the trauma that led her to undertake such a dangerous expedition. Large swathes of this book are downright implausible, let’s just get that out of the way. If you have a particular interest in environmentalism specifically through a scientific lens, I cannot in good faith recommend this book. It takes liberties, it gets facts wrong, its worldbuilding is under-developed. Personally, nature writing is one of my very least favorite things and the less time spent on it the better, so this catered to my personal tastes quite nicely, but there’s every chance you’ll find this element silly and distracting. Regardless, I ended up loving this. Migrations has been compared a lot to Station Eleven and I found that actually rang true for me — there’s something in the character work that felt really similar and familiar. McConaghy’s characters, like Mandel’s, are brilliantly drawn — even the most minor characters feel like they have an entire story hidden in them. It’s honestly challenging to describe this book’s strengths when its weaknesses are so evident and tangible; the strengths are a lot more slippery and understated. I think where this worked for me is in its depiction of a very flawed person searching for atonement in all the wrong places. It’s a deeply human, deeply sad work, and it ended up being one of the most emotionally affecting books I’ve read in a long time. Definitely recommended more from a character-driven angle than a dystopian one.Thank you to Flatiron for the free copy....more",Notes are private!,0,31,2,"Jul 18, 2021not set","Jul 18, 2021not set","Jan 09, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42121525-migrations

Within a few pages idyll turns to tragedy as the 18-year-old daughter of the Thomas family, Alison, goes missing, and days later turns up dead. Two men are charged with her murder, but both are acquitted, and the mystery goes unsolved. Years later, we follow Alison's younger sister, Claire, who was only seven years old at the time of Alison's death. Now living in New York, Claire has a chance encounter that brings her into contact with Clive Richardson, one of the two men that had been charged with killing Alison. Believing their encounter to be an act of fate, Claire latches onto her connection with Clive in an attempt to discover what really happened to her sister.You can read my full  HERE, and a piece I wrote about Caribbean immigration to the US HERE....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Feb 12, 2020","Feb 16, 2020","Jan 03, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43782399-saint-x

For what it is, I think it succeeds: it’s gripping, has one of the best and most complex female friendships I’ve ever read in YA, has a surprisingly progressive focus on mental health, and is framed in a really unique way (it uses The Chosen One trope but tells the story from the pov of The Chosen One’s friend, who happens to be an infinitely more interesting character).  The unrepentant slut-shaming is its most egregious offense, and what dates it the most (I'd find its regressive attitudes toward female sexuality more disturbing had it been published in 2019, but for over a decade ago, it's less surprising).  But all in all, a fun, mostly harmless read; I may even reach for the sequel if I get bored....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Dec 12, 2019","Dec 15, 2019","Dec 12, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18660669-vampire-academy

Shown through the eyes of an Irish expat living in Hong Kong, Exciting Times essentially focuses on a love triangle between narrator Ava and two individuals who in many ways are polar opposites - the rich, tactless English banker Julian and the elegant, clever Hong Kong native Edith.  Each is distinctly compelling, though the love triangle itself isn't what moves the narrative so much as Ava navigating her own boundaries and ethics and evolving perspective on relationships.  Irish identity is another theme that takes center stage; Ava is an English teacher and finds herself tempering her natural speech patterns so that she teaches 'correct' English to her students.  It's a thoughtful, clever, meditative book from a number of angles.Dolan's prose is this novel's shining jewel; she has such a compact, witty, dry voice - it won't be for everyone and I can see where others might find that it grows wearisome as the novel chugs along, but I found it consistently charming.  '""Anything strange?"" said Mam on the phone.  She really said it, ""antin strange,"" but if Brits spelled Glosster as Gloucester then I supposed Mam deserved similar leeway.'Exciting Times is definitely this year's Normal People while also being very much its own thing, and I recommend it very highly.Thank you to Netgalley and Ecco for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,96,1,"Mar 15, 2020","May 26, 2020","Dec 03, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50175419-exciting-times

Through the eyes of a nurse working the night shift, we learn that inside the hospital, Su Lan is abandoned by her husband, while outside, the violence of the June 4th Tiananmen Square Massacre erupts around her. The narrative then skips forward 17 years to Su Lan’s death.The novel unfolds in a non-linear fashion; in the opening chapters we’re introduced to a shadow of the woman that Su Lan becomes—a distant, hardworking single mother—before we delve into the past and begin to reconstruct her character.You can read the rest of my  HERE on BookBrowse, and you can read a piece I wrote about the Tienanmen Square Massacre HERE....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Jan 02, 2020","Jan 20, 2020","Nov 23, 2019",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/43386055-little-gods

I thought Real Life was tremendous. It follows Wallace, a Black student in a predominantly white biochemistry master's program at a midwestern university. Brandon Taylor captures two things with unerring precision: the first being the microaggressions that Wallace faces at the hands of his friends, mentors, and colleagues. There's an infuriating scene toward the end where Wallace is in a situation where he's been falsely accused of something, and rather than standing up for himself he quietly accepts his punishment. What's infuriating isn't that Wallace doesn't speak up, but rather, that the reader knows exactly why he doesn't, because Taylor has shown the reader that systemic dismissal, belittlement, and scorn does more than infuriate: it wears you down.The second thing Taylor captures beautifully is academia as a suspension of reality, an almost liminal space between young adulthood and adulthood that exists somehow within the real world while following its own set of logic and social norms. Campus novels often glorify this lifestyle in a way that can be fun and deliciously indulgent, but Taylor leans into the opposite--digging into the way some people use academia as a crutch, accepting all of its quiet, mundane horrors in an effort to avoid 'real life'.I guess the prose in Real Life is very love-it-or-hate-it; I've seen a lot of people refer to it as labored and overwrought, and as someone who frequently cites overwrought prose as an offense, I don't really see where that argument is coming from. The language is often poetic but to me 'overwrought' implies a certain lack of control over word choice and sentence structure; Taylor's writing is on the other hand rather exact.

I wouldn't describe it as a page-turner.  It's definitely a slow-burner, and it takes its time setting the stage for its central mystery, instead focusing brilliantly on establishing the setting and the atmosphere of some of Philadelphia's poorer neighborhoods; but there's something so engrossing about it from the onset that it's hard to put it down.What drew me to Long Bright River, aside from my fondness for thrillers, is the focus on the opioid crisis, and this Moore handled spectacularly.  First off, if you haven't read Dopesick by Beth Macy, what are you waiting for; second of all, I'm always so drawn to books which humanize drug addicts and treat their stories with respect and sensitivity (recommendations welcome!); Moore achieves this while also keeping up the momentum of the narrative. Moore's prose is another strength; this is the first novel of hers that I've read, but I'm definitely more likely to pick up something off her backlist now.  This book's one failing for me is something that I find myself frequently lamenting in thrillers; a too-quick denouement and a too-neat resolution of character arcs.  But still, my opinion of Long Bright River is mostly favorable, and I think it's very deserving of all the hype....more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,"Jan 26, 2020","Feb 02, 2020","Nov 12, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/43834909-long-bright-river

So, here we are. Let’s see if I can come up with a few sentences. I’ve read all of Sager’s books now and this isn’t one of my favorites from him; I’d put it second to last, with only The Last Time I Lied below it.Meaning: I still liked it quite a lot.Set in a decaying Victorian estate in Vermont (can’t go wrong there), Home Before Dark is a sufficiently eerie and unsettling haunted house horror story which indulges a lot of genre’s tropes, but which doesn’t ultimately subvert them in a very interesting way. I think I had more problems with this novel’s resolution than any of his others, but still, Sager is the absolute master of gripping, pacy thrillers, and this one is no exception; definitely recommended if it catches your eye....more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Jul 27, 2020","Jul 29, 2020","Oct 21, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50833559-home-before-dark

It opens with an epigraph from the poem ""Adonais"" by Percy Bysshe Shelley:""Go thou to Rome—at once the Paradise,The grave, the city, and the wilderness.""The plot begins in 2015 with a section titled ""The Wilderness,"" which introduces us to Tom, an American field biologist studying a group of crustaceans called ostracods. Though still married, Tom spends his days alone while his wife is back in California with their daughter, and reflects on the failed state of their marriage. This novel is dense at times, and Tom's sections offer little reprieve; the crumbling marriage and allure of an enigmatic Italian woman a sort of clichéd setup that doesn't feel like it quite earns its length, or the reader's investment.

There are a lot of painfully on the nose declarations throughout, like “It struck me how little my name meant to me, how absurd it was in its attempt to contain me.” It was just lacking the sort of finesse that its comparison authors are able to achieve more effortlessly. There’s also Jedrowski’s penchant for similes that started to drive me mad after about five pages:“I ran and started to shiver all over, like a child who’s broken through ice and fallen into a lake and only just managed to crawl out.” “A pair of panties. White and lacy, discarded like someone’s fantasy.” “Your ass was powerful, like two great smooth rocks sculpted by the sea.”“Winter came early that year. Every week pulled us deeper into its gloom, every day shorter than the last, as if time was running out.”If you don’t mind that sort of thing this obviously won’t be an issue for you, but it wasn’t really for me and was definitely an insurmountable hurdle when it came to loving this book as much as I had hoped to.Still, I enjoyed my time with it well enough. It’s a fiercely political coming-of-age story about two gay students in 1980s Poland, both educative and entertaining in equal measure. The Giovanni’s Room commentary is well-employed, the historical detail is immersive, the novel’s structure is impeccable. It’s an intimate, sad, moving story; its characters are vibrant and life-like, and the feeling of loss throughout is palpable.

Turner’s case gained notoriety after his sentencing where he received only 6 months of prison time – he only served 3 – and Miller’s victim impact statement was published to Buzzfeed, receiving millions of hits and sparking conversations about sexual assault on college campuses, as well as the lenient sentences that privileged young men receive. In September 2019, Miller finally broke her anonymity, appearing on 60 Minutes and publishing this memoir.Miller’s memoir isn’t only extraordinary for the fact that, for female victims, putting yourself out there necessarily means abuse, dismissal, and violated privacy; it’s extraordinary because it is a damn good book. It’s clear-eyed while still being pointed and righteously furious; it’s razor-sharp and compassionate in equal measure; it’s deeply personal and macrocosmic all at once. This memoir highlights the impact and recovery process for sexual assault, with Miller stressing that it isn’t a simple road with a happy ending. That said, she wants to make it clear that she writes for victims above all others, hoping her honesty will touch others who have lived through similar horrors. Know My Name is an accomplished, impressively self-aware piece of writing that I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend to everyone who can stomach the subject matter. (I listened to the audiobook which Miller herself narrates, and I cannot recommend that highly enough.)...more",Notes are private!,0,56,1,"Oct 22, 2019","Nov 12, 2019","Oct 10, 2019",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/50196744-know-my-name

I can't recommend this author/translator team enough to anyone who likes their fantasy light on plot and heavy on the sort of ideas that won't leave you alone long after you put the book down.Thank you to Harper Voyager for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,46,1,"Jan 12, 2020","Jan 30, 2020","Sep 13, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45730152-daughter-from-the-dark

The culprit was caught with damning evidence, but now, 20 years later, a series of murders is starting up that bear a startling resemblance to those committed by 'The Whisper Man,' who is still incarcerated. I think there are two types of successful thrillers: one where the delight comes from the reader feeling involved in the whodunnit, where there are so many potential suspects you’re bound to be wrong no matter who you guess; and one where guessing the identity of the murderer isn’t really the point, but there are still so many twists and turns that you enjoy the ride anyway. The Whisper Man manages to fall in neither category. This neither had a thrilling murderer reveal, nor much momentum on the way there. Instead it hinges on family dynamics and the theme of fatherhood, which I suppose is done well, though it appears to have been at the detriment of... literally everything else.I've seen others describe this book as creepy, scary, etc., and I have to wonder if I just missed something. Aside from a few moments that hinted at the possibility of something paranormal at play, I just found the atmosphere in this book conspicuously absent. In fact, the whole book felt muted, like it was being held back from achieving the real dread or terror that it was obviously striving for. The plot was likewise uninspired and straightforward; I'm just not sure what this book's hook was supposed to be, once the promising exposition is out of the way. We just sort of amble through a rather aimless narrative about serial killers and creepy children - it's like Alex North put a bunch of horror tropes into a blender and mixed them until they lost their flavor. There was just nothing unique or potent or memorable about this book.Contrary to everything I've just written, I might recommend this to readers who are new-ish to thrillers (I will concede that a few of my ‘that was so obvious’ moments come from too much familiarity with the genre) but my overwhelming feeling about this book is one of anticlimax. If you're looking for a safe, tame option in the genre, give it a shot; if you need something a bit more dark and twisted, definitely keep looking....more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,"Oct 09, 2019","Oct 11, 2019","Sep 11, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41940236-the-whisper-man

This seems to be pitched as a book about the Korean beauty industry, which it is and it isn't; plastic surgery and makeup mostly litter the background of a couple of the narratives, as Cha focuses instead on the women who are actively harmed by cruel and unrealistic beauty standards. This book's main asset has to be the characters: it's also been a while since I've read anything with characters this convincing.  Of the five protagonists, four of them alternate first person point-of-view chapters, and each of their voices is so distinctive I never had trouble remembering whose head I was inhabiting, which tends to be a common pitfall of similarly structured fiction.  Narratively, this falls a bit short; it wraps up rather quickly and at the point where it ends, you feel like it could keep going for at least another 150 pages.  One of the characters' arcs felt unfinished to me.  And a few of the book's key events feel rushed, even before the end.  But despite that, my impression of this book is largely favorable.  I don't think I'll forget this in a hurry, and I can't wait for whatever Frances Cha does next.Thank you to Netgalley and Ballantine for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,65,1,"Dec 19, 2019","Dec 31, 2019","Sep 05, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52696537-if-i-had-your-face

I have obviously read quite a few Greek mythology retellings in my day, but still, I was a little worried that I had the best time reading this book. I have obviously read quite a few Greek mythology retellings in my day, but still, I was a little worried that this wasn’t going to work for me just because YA is usually not my thing and I tend to prefer my retellings on the more literary side. But it turns out this was a totally different beast from commercial adult retellings like Circe — and it turns out I enjoyed what Claire M. Andrews was doing much better.Daughter of Sparta is a zippy, action-packed reimagining of the story of Daphne and Apollo. Throw what you know about the original out the window because it bears very little relevance to Andrews’s narrative — though kernels of other related myths are very self-consciously strewn throughout the novel — instead, Andrews confidently takes the reins and pulls the story in a completely different direction. Her Daphne isn’t a helpless maiden at the mercy of Apollo’s whims; she’s the agent of her own story, and also the only one who can save Greece from impending ruin.This feels very much like a road trip narrative — not literally, of course, as it’s set in Ancient Greece — but it’s that kind of story, nevertheless: two people (or one person and one god, in this case) traveling and facing hurdles together, their own dynamic shifting as the pages turn. What I loved about this was that it felt nothing like all the other million adaptations I’ve read, while still taking place in the original setting (nothing against modern adaptations, which I also quite like; I was just losing faith that true innovation was even possible without moving the setting). This book is just feels very off the beaten path, which is only a compliment in such a saturated subgenre.All said, Daughter of Sparta is a tremendously fun, self-assured, pacy debut — definitely skewed toward younger readers (as most young adult novels tend to be), which I just want to stress as my blog and Goodreads audience does skew older, and I don’t want to mislead — but if that sounds good to you, this is a fantastically fun romp. I’m highly anticipating the sequel. NB. Claire M. Andrews is a friend of mine.

Isolde is a delightful, sparse, and sad book set in early twentieth century France, where fourteen-year-old Liza and her brother Nikolai are essentially left to their own devices by an extremely neglectful mother who insists on pretending in public (and often even in private) that she is their older cousin. On holiday in Biarritz, Liza meets a slightly older boy, Cromwell, who becomes enchanted by her and declares that her new name will be Isolde. The story then follows this trio - Liza, Cromwell, and Nikolai - back to Paris, where they're abandoned altogether by their mother, with disastrous results.As explained in the introduction, Odoevtseva herself was Russian and living in exile at the time of writing Isolde, and these circumstances are reflected in her narrative. The absence of Liza and Nikolai's home country plays heavily on their imaginations - a naive, idealistic image of Russia only grows when abandoned by their mother in Paris. After some head hopping, the focus of the novel ultimately zeroes in on Liza, whose burgeoning sexuality, parental neglect, and nebulous national identity all shape the story which is driven less by a coherent plot and more by snapshots of Liza's adolescence. I found this thoroughly enjoyable, at times quite dark, and altogether unexpectedly modern. Not overly modern in language - the translation by Brian Karetnyk and Irina Steinberg was excellent - but in terms of content; there's a focus on Liza's autonomy over her sexuality, and it rather subverts expectations in more ways than one. (There's also a rather inconsequential scene where a character is talking about how she's kissed other girls but she can't imagine kissing a man.) It's a really solid gem of a book and I'm looking forward to checking out more by Irina Odoevtseva, as well as more from Pushkin's modern classics series.Thank you to Netgalley and Pushkin for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,"Aug 21, 2019","Aug 27, 2019","Aug 08, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/50189569-isolde

[…] Jiyoung's abnormal behavior was first detected on 8 September.""So begins Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982, Cho Nam-Joo's daring excavation of a young woman crumbling under the strain of unrelenting misogyny, which has sold over a million copies in its native South Korea. Jiyoung (the Korean naming convention places a person's family name before their given name), an average, unremarkable woman, one day begins to imitate the voices of other women she has known throughout her life—a phenomenon neither she nor her husband can explain, which prompts them to visit a psychiatrist.You can read my full  HERE on BookBrowse, and a piece I wrote about feminist movements in South Korea HERE....more",Notes are private!,0,35,1,"Apr 20, 2020","Apr 21, 2020","Aug 06, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/46041199-kim-jiyoung-born-1982

It isn’t historical enough, it isn’t weird enough, it isn’t feminist enough.  The premise - girls at a boarding school who fall prey to a mysterious illness - sounds like it's going to make for a positively entrancing book, but I could not have been more bored while reading this.  It never felt grounded enough in its setting to really provide much commentary about the time period (which historical fiction is wont to do) - not to mention that about a quarter of the way through the book I had to ask a friend who was also reading it if it was set in the U.S. or the U.K.There's a recurring motif of red birds throughout the novel - strange red birds have flocked to the school for reasons no one knows.  This was an intriguing thread that proved to be, like everything else in this book, utterly inconsequential; it's empty symbolism shoehorned in in order to imbue this book with some kind of meaning that wasn't actually there.As for the girls falling ill: this plot point is relegated to the latter half of the book (what happens before that, I don't think I could tell you), and I was frustrated and a little sick at the way their invasive treatment was narratively handled.  This book does contain an element of rape, which is never given the depth or breadth it deserves; instead it seems like it's there for shock value in the eleventh hour, not offering near enough insight to justify its inclusion. On the whole, I found this book incredibly anemic and unsatisfying.  I finished this a few weeks ago and I think, at the time, there was a reason I opted for 2 stars instead of 1, but I may need to downgrade my rating because I cannot think of a single thing I liked about this.Thank you to Netgalley and Doubleday for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,66,1,"Jan 20, 2020","Feb 16, 2020","Aug 04, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45015676-the-illness-lesson

We meet Kimiâ Sadr in the waiting room of a fertility clinic in Paris, and the pages that follow tell the story of her family’s history, unfolding in a nonlinear fashion and focusing largely on her father, journalist and radical activist Darius Sadr.This is a complex book both in terms of structure and subject, but Djavadi manages to navigate it with finesse, making this an unexpectedly smooth reading experience. I’m firmly of the belief that it’s not an author’s responsibility to educate the reader about their country’s history and culture, and I’m not sure what Djavadi’s intentions were with this novel, whether she envisioned it primarily in the hands of international readers, but as someone who knows shamefully little about Iranian history, I never felt out of my depth and I appreciated the level of detail — informative but not overwhelming.

I think it’s best to approach this book while knowing as little as possible about it, so I’m not really going to talk about the plot. Instead I’ll just say that this book is like Penelope’s tapestry; Levy weaves a brilliant tale in the first act, only to unweave it halfway through and then stitch it back together, and she does it carefully without sacrificing either the details or the big picture.It’s arguably easier to talk about this book’s themes than its actual plot, but I don’t want to suggest that my interpretation is the be all end all, because this is the sort of book that lends itself to discussions and contradictions. Above all else this is book is about memory – are we more than our memories, or are our memories all we are – but what also stuck out to me was Levy’s deft meditation on what it means to age, what it means to live as a foreigner abroad, what it means to love, what it means to be a part of a culture’s shifting landscape. It seems like a tall order to balance all of this in just under 200 pages while also prioritizing structural innovation, but this book is a case of form and content coming together perfectly. I wouldn’t change a single page – a single sentence – of this book, and I cannot say that often.That said, I understand why this hasn’t worked for some readers, especially those who err on the side of more traditional storytelling, but for anyone who’s willing to take a risk, and willing to stumble blindly through the dark at times, you can rest easy with the confidence that Levy knows exactly what she is doing here. I can say with absolute confidence that I am going to reread this at some point, and I’m sure I’ll find it even more revelatory when I do....more",Notes are private!,0,64,1,"Nov 09, 2019","Nov 09, 2019","Jul 24, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42972048-the-man-who-saw-everything

I found the premise A few months back, I asked on Twitter what everyone’s favorite short story collections were, and Through the Woods came up a lot. I found the premise enticing (I love horror, and I hadn’t ever read a short story collection in graphic novel form), so I decided to give it go, which ended up being a good decision.Ultimately: 3 stars for the stories and 5 stars for the artwork. These short stories had moments of creepiness, but they were only ever moments; on the whole they were a bit on the perfunctory side and usually ended all too abruptly. Some of the ambiguity worked; some just left me wanting, and not in the good way. I did enjoy reading them in the moment, but I don’t think any are going to stay with me, and I wouldn’t have minded a bit more bone-chilling terror.The artwork, on the other hand, was nothing short of breathtaking. A Lady’s Hands Are Cold just about knocked my socks off on a strictly visual level – the color palette in this story in particular is incredibly striking. I buy a lot of books that I haven’t read yet and I rarely keep the ones that I don’t love or don’t plan on rereading, but I think I’m going to hang onto this one just so I can flip through and look at the art on occasion. But maybe I’ll reread it next year around Halloween; these stories are all very light on text and you can easily read this in under half an hour so why not.

I also thought Maren and Ursa were fantastic protagonists, each with a distinctive narrative voice.

Safe together in the violet dark and yet already there are spaces beginning to open between us. I am wet and glistening like a beetroot pulsing in soil. Fasting and gulping. There are wounds in your belly and welts around your nipples, puffy and purpling.""So begins Saltwater, a generic coming-of-age tale that flits around between the key events in the protagonist Lucy's life, growing up in Sunderland and Donegal before moving to London for university.  With a focus on Lucy's relationship with her mother, there are chapters interspersed throughout the narrative where Lucy narrates directly to her mother from various stages in her life, beginning with this... colorful passage describing her own birth.  (Why do authors do this.)So quite literally from page one I wasn't getting on with this book.  I don't necessarily believe there's such a thing as 'good writing' or 'bad writing' - taste is subjective.  You may read these passages and be drawn to them and that is perfectly all right, but from my perspective, Andrews' prose was labored and contrived and overwrought and I hated every minute of it.  Here are just a few passages I highlighted that had me rolling my eyes:""Redness cracking. Fissures forming.  You are falling towards us, rich and syrup-soft. Flesh roiling. Bones shifting. Tongues over bellies and fingers in wet places.""""My father is passed out in a chair and I am dozing on his lap in a mushroom of white lace.""""The sunsets are crisp and smell of cardigans.""""He smelled of leather, superglue and love.""""Sludge horrible delicious between my toes.""(I sent a couple of these select quotes to a friend who asked if the book was written by a random word generator.  I thought that was so spot-on I told him I was going to steal that line for my .)But it wasn't just Andrews'... questionable word choices that bothered me; it was how she felt the need to bash the reader over the head with what she considered to be the book's salient themes:""Bridges are in-between spaces and I was in between, too.""[regarding how Lucy would use the Shard as a landmark to orient herself in the city] ""I feel an affinity with the Shard, even though it is a symbol of the wealth and status I am so far removed from.""Everything was just so painfully on the nose.  There already isn't a whole lot of thematic variance amongst this sort of bildungsroman, so the need to shove these incredibly basic concepts down the reader's throat struck me as beyond unnecessary. Anyway, moving past the atrocious writing, another thing that grated is the cruelly stereotypical portrayal of the Irish - regarding the narrator's grandfather's childhood in Ireland, after establishing that he slept in his aunt's barn, this paragraph is, quite literally, the only information we receive about that period in his life:""Auntie Kitty rationed the hot water and made anyone who entered the house throw holy sand over their left shoulder, To Keep Away The Devil.  Her husband was in the IRA and they housed radical members of Sinn Féin in their attic."" Poverty, religious fanaticism, and the IRA - there's only one stereotype missing here; oh, wait:""I have noticed that many of the young men in Donegal have shaking hands. [...] I ask my mother what it is that makes them shake. 'It'll be the drink,' she says, sagely.""This wouldn't be a problem if it weren't the extent of Andrews' portrayal of Ireland, but there truly is nothing else there, despite Lucy spending long periods of her life in Donegal.And therein lies the main problem: this is a book about carving out your identity in relation to the places you live, but the book itself has no sense of place.  It jumped around a lot in chronology, which in and of itself wasn't a problem, but I would quickly lose track of whether Lucy was in Donegal or London or Sunderland, because the depictions of each felt the exact same. I've never read another book about place that's so devoid of atmosphere. Finally (sorry, I bet you thought I was done) - Lucy's younger brother is deaf as a child, and then has a cochlear implant to restore his hearing.  I already found this to be a bit of an odd narrative choice given the dearth of deafness representation in literature; I was hoping there would later be a bit of nuance to explain this decision by the author, but instead this subplot is pretty much dropped, barring an incredibly sloppy few pages in which she describes his transition from sign language to verbal speech:""He wanted to dance to music and to enjoy the delicate nuance of spoken language. He learned the way that putting feelings into words and out into the world could ease the pressure inside, like letting air out of a balloon.""So... sign language isn't 'putting feelings into words and out into the world'?  Ok then.I started and finished this on January 1 and I'm predicting it's going to be my least favorite book of the year.  Watch this space in 12 months.Thank you to Netgalley and FSG for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest .  All quotes are taken from the ARC, not a finished copy, and are subject to change....more",Notes are private!,1,70,1,Jan 2020,Jan 2020,"Jun 17, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/45892272-saltwater

After I read the first 30%, I was convinced that this was going to be my favorite book of the year. Ultimately it did lose a bit of steam and I can't help but to mourn for the exceptional book that it could have been, but nevertheless, I still enjoyed this so much and recommend it wholehearted to the right reader.Milk Fed, Broder's sophomore novel following her sensational debut The Pisces, follows Rachel, a lapsed Jewish woman who works at a talent agency in LA and spends every waking hour of her days counting calories and fixating on her diet. Her therapist recommends a detox from her emotionally abusive mother, who Rachel usually calls every day. Mid-detox, she meets Miriam, an Orthodox woman who works at Rachel's local frozen yogurt place, who Rachel becomes fixated on, leading to a breakdown of her carefully constructed food rituals. Broder's books are messy, piercing, gritty, and deeply, deeply funny--it's a recipe that works perfectly to my tastes. (Also, if you're familiar with LA and/or into bougie LA culture... her books are such a treat.) Rachel is a character whose head I bizarrely enjoyed inhabiting, in spite of or perhaps because of the sheer level of toxicity. Rachel was so convincing and well-crafted that I felt like I knew her intimately after only a few pages. Melissa Broder really excels at sharp and specific characterization where a lot of books in the 'disaster woman' genre tend to opt for a more 'generic millennial every-woman' approach (which I've certainly seen done well, but which I think I may be a bit burnt out on). Where this book falters is in its introduction of Miriam and her family--the pace slows, the focus shifts, Rachel's behavior becomes slightly less intelligible. Still, while I ultimately felt that Broder could have used a defter hand in editing to get it up to the high standard she set for herself in The Pisces, I honestly loved spending time with this book. It's not for everyone, but if you gravitate toward the slightly fucked up and absurd, you'll probably love this too.Massive trigger warning for eating disorders.

Lara Prior-Palmer’s underdog story couldn’t have been any more pitch-perfect if it were scripted: she entered the Mongol Derby on a complete whim, underestimated its difficulty, was dismissed by the other competitors early on, but still rallied to become the first woman to win the race and the youngest person ever to finish. But it’s far from the conventional sports memoir, as winning is never really the point, or even the goal, for Lara, whose motivation for entering the race is hazy even to herself.This book’s greatest strength is something that often irritates me in memoirs: that Lara doesn’t have much distance from the experience she’s writing about (she won the race in 2013, her memoir was published in 2019). Had she waited 15 or 20 years to tell this story, it could have been more polished, more articulate, but that sophistication would have come at the detriment of its charm, its passion, its frenetic energy. Perhaps the most successful thing about this book is that due to her lack of emotional distance from it, Lara doesn’t place her own character development front and center; instead she takes us through the race step by agonizing step, showing us rather than telling us about the physical and psychological toll it was taking. This entire memoir cleverly circles the question ‘is naked ambition in and of itself a virtue or a vice?’ (a character trait she sees reflected in her main competitor, Devan) – and the few moments where Lara zeroes in on it have the emotional punch they’ve earned.“Our pace slowed. I began imagining Clare and Kirsten catching us. Nothing is swift as thought—I felt it jumping through me. But riding in a big group just wasn’t efficient. It was a simple thought, and when it came, I knew the race had me.”And then, shortly after:“What if I wanted to win for myself, without wanting to beat Devan or please Charles or any other audience? It’s a lonely thought; I wish I were strong enough for it.”All that said, this book isn’t the easiest to settle into; Lara Prior-Palmer’s prose is almost a perfect reflection of her flighty, restless nature – she jumps from one thought to another with no preamble, she constructs an elaborate metaphor unnecessarily and follows it a bit too long. But there were also lines that I adored, that I found especially resonant (more than enough to compensate for the more awkward passages), like:“I’m just so used to swallowing myself as I speak that I can’t help seeing self-assuredness as indulgent.”So while I don’t think this was a perfect book (not that anything is a perfect book), I do think it was a really special one that I enjoyed reading immensely, that filled me with anxiety and excitement in equal measure. Lara Prior-Palmer is a fascinating, sympathetic, strong and vulnerable person who doesn’t spare herself for a second on the page, making this story as personal as it is informative about the Mongol Derby. I’d highly recommend Rough Magic if you like horses, coming of age stories, underdogs, memoirs about young women, or any combination of the above....more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"Jul 10, 2019","Jul 14, 2019","Jun 11, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41810276-rough-magic

Where The Pisces excels, in my opinion, is in its refusal to sensationalize its explicit subject matter; Permission, on the other hand, never successfully avoids that trap.Permission focuses on a young woman, Echo, who finds solace in the BDSM community after the sudden death of her father, when she befriends her neighbor Orly who happens to be a dominatrix. But what begins as a promising examination of sex as escapism from grief never really manages to take off. Echo, like her mythological namesake, is pretty much voiceless in this narrative, but in this case I don't think it was deliberate: this book is just one of those character studies that centers on a character who's drawn so anemically she may as well not exist at all. This goes for the other characters as well: there's an interesting passage where Echo reflects on the fact that she's been projecting onto Orly without fully realizing that she's a human being in her own right, but then nothing is really done with this revelation, and Orly too remains unknowable. Rather than using sex and BDSM as a vehicle to explore Echo's loneliness (I think that was supposed to be the point), sex remains the focus in the shallow kind of way that I think could have been avoided if this story had a bit more depth and detail. I did enjoy Saskia Vogel's prose and there were undoubtedly moments of poignancy here, but on the whole I was underwhelmed.

The first of the two concepts is the story of ‘the death girls,’ three Swarthmore freshman who are each obsessed with a different female poet who died by suicide (Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton, and an invented poet, Lucy Ascher). The novel introduces the three girls with the striking opening sentence ‘They talked about death as if it were a country in Europe’ and the prologue continues on to explain their strange friendship, predicated on a similar reverence for death—but then this conceit falls away completely. Naomi and Laura, two of the death girls, barely factor into this novel at all—this is the story of Claire, coming to terms with the death of her brother as well as the death of her favorite poet; her story is shared only by the parents of Lucy Ascher, who have fallen apart in the years since their daughter died. Enter the second concept: an unsentimental excavation of the many faces of grief. In spite of the obvious thematic parallels between these two narratives that Wolitzer thought up, she is unable to integrate them into one another in a way that doesn’t feel forced and unnatural. The ‘death girl’ setup (as well as the introduction to Claire's narratively pointless boyfriend, Julian) is ultimately the framework for the novel’s real aims, but it’s flimsy and unconvincing and honestly a bit of a letdown to anyone who approaches this looking for a Secret History-esque campus novel about close-knit friendships. (The bulk of the novel takes place off campus, to add insult to injury.) But that’s all okay—again, it’s a debut by an author who’s been working for 40 years, so it’s hard not to give Wolitzer the benefit of the doubt. And in spite of all the aforementioned clumsiness, I really enjoyed reading this book. Wolitzer's meditations on death and grief are surprisingly fresh and insightful, and though the other death girls don't leave much of an impression, Claire is a remarkably well-drawn character. This was actually my first Wolitzer, and I'm interested to see how her style has evolved through the years. ...more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Feb 07, 2022","Feb 12, 2022","Apr 14, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18722771-sleepwalking

It all sounds like a rather standard female-centric historical fiction novel, but Cathy's journey and Dunmore's psychological insights took on a hard edge that subverted all of my expectations and then some.I don't think this is the kind of book that people intensely hate - I think it's more of a 'it was fine, nothing special' for a lot of readers. So again, it's hard to recommend this enthusiastically knowing that it's bound to fall flat for a lot of people who find themselves disappointed by the (anticlimactic?) direction it takes. But I was so utterly enchanted and riveted by this book, and I cannot wait to see what else Dunmore has to offer....more",Notes are private!,0,40,1,"Sep 22, 2019","Sep 28, 2019","Apr 10, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/17664830-a-spell-of-winter

Debut novelist Yara Rodrigues Fowler comes out of the gate strong with this book, which is an offbeat piece of auto-fiction that blends poetry and prose (think Eimear McBride, but more accessible) to tell the story of a young British-Brazilian woman growing up in South London. This is one of the more 'fresh' and stylistically interesting things I've read in while; its challenge of structure feels authentic rather than arbitrary and the overall effect serves to put you in the head of the nameless protagonist. The one theme that is executed to perfection in this book is the exploration of what it's like to grow up between two cultures, which Rodrigues Fowler portrays with heart-rending authenticity on both micro- and macro-cosmic levels.But I do wonder if Rodrigues Fowler was maybe a bit too ambitious; there were a number of other themes that were introduced without ample exploration (and it's to her credit that I do have to wonder if this was the point - after all, what woman in her early 20s has sex and sexuality completely figured out; but there were still a few scenes whose inclusion I do have to wonder at). I also was less enamored with the passages that left our protagonist and focused on her parents and her aunt; I think the idea was to give a more complete picture of this family's history, but again, I don't think these scenes were developed as well as they could have been in order to justify their inclusion.Ultimately though I did think this was an incredibly striking debut. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys 'millennial fiction' and contemporary literary fiction that features young women trying to find their place in the world.

Valerie falls into the latter category to an extreme.  Sara Stridsberg in her forward admits that this is not an attempt to recreate the details of Valerie Solanas's life; it's more of a 'literary fantasy' where she loosely spins together fragments of Valerie's life and ideologies, while deliberately skewing facts (changing Valerie's birthplace from Ventnor to Ventor; moving it from New Jersey to a desert in Georgia).  It just... didn't work for me.This is a book of ideas with nothing to ground them; the narrative threads are too few and far between for me to have anything to really grasp onto.  I didn't understand for the longest time why Stridsberg was bothering to disguise this fragmented, meandering, awkward novel as the story of Valerie Solanas, and while I did feel like that question was eventually answered, it was too little too late for me.  I read this entire book thinking 'I don't care, I should probably care, why don't I care, does the author care at all about how disengaged I am?'But I do feel the need to remind everyone that I use the star rating system subjectively and I use my s to explain why I react to books in a certain way; I don't think this is a 'bad book' and I would dissuade no one who's interested in it from giving it a shot.  It just did nothing for me.  Though the US cover is one of the prettiest I've seen in a while, so there's that.Thank you to Netgalley and FSG for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Aug 08, 2019","Sep 22, 2019","Mar 12, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/42850426-valerie

DMuch like Swan Song's subject, Truman Capote, Kelleigh Greenberg-Jephcott's novel is at times charming, at times vicious, and at times insufferable. Despite the fact that it took me over a month to get through this and I was complaining about it for a lot of that time, Swan Song actually does have a lot to recommend it. Its first person plural narration is particularly well done as Greenberg-Jephcott attempts to reclaim the voices of the women whose social lives Truman Capote effectively destroyed with the publication of his salacious story La Cote Basque 1965 (the first chapter of Answered Prayers, which was eventually published unfinished, posthumously). In stealing the real life stories of his close circle of friends for his planned novel, Capote faced extensive backlash and was unable to repair his lost friendships, which ultimately haunted him until he died. It could have been a gripping tale of betrayal and a searing commentary on the kind of symbiotic relationship with high society that both made and destroyed Capote's career, but while it had its moments, it sadly falls short. My first issue with Swan Song is how ungodly long it is, which naturally leads to all of my other criticisms, being that this book overstays its welcome in every conceivable way. All of Greenberg-Jephcott's party tricks wear thin after not very long, the worst offense probably being Capote's characterization - he's constantly infantilized and reduced to a caricature in a way that starts to feel more spiteful than constructive after not very long. He's referred to as 'the boy' even as a grown man, his height and voice are incessantly referenced, he's described as 'elfin' or even more derogatory synonyms on just about every page, and after a while it's like... what's the point of any of this? The bottom line is established early: Truman Capote was capable of extreme kindness and extreme cruelty. This book just revels in the latter in a way that never convincingly dovetails with the voices that are purportedly being reclaimed with this retelling.Because that's the other issue at the heart of this: I love the concept of reframing a traditionally male-dominated narrative by using women's voices - it's a concept that's carried through many of my favorite Greek mythology retellings quite soundly - but here it falls flat, because Greenberg-Jephcott never makes a convincing case for why this is a story that need reclaiming. A bunch of high society women have affairs and sail around on yachts and they're betrayed by their close friend but... so what? This books feels like an elaborate revenge fantasy that's so mired in gossip and cattiness that it loses its thematic heft.But, like I said, it's not all bad: Greenberg-Jephcott's writing is lively and charming, the style is inventive (elements of poetry and screenwriting are incorporated), the research is admirable, and maybe it'll appeal more to a different kind of reader, but I'm afraid I just struggled to care....more",Notes are private!,0,47,1,"Mar 21, 2019","May 08, 2019","Mar 03, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36203384-swan-song

I say 'aggressively' because you're confronted with this mediocrity on practically every page; the prose is simultaneously lifeless and overwritten, the characters are poorly drawn caricatures, the plot meanders, and this book just never manages to hit any of the emotional beats that it strives for. It's basically an emotionally hollow melodrama.Not to fully absolve Lillian Li of all of these issues, but I do believe that a lot of this could have been solved with tighter editing. Because what works about this book are its bare bones: a dysfunctional Chinese-American family struggles to run a Chinese restaurant, with inter-generational tension providing the main conflict: how does one balance a family legacy with their own plans for the future? It's a great concept, and I wanted to root for this book; I wanted to root for the Han family, but it all just fails in execution. Certain plot threads are examined and re-examined through different perspectives ad nauseum; others are abandoned after a brief mention. This book is over-saturated with details, but it doesn't pause to imbue key moments with any kind of emotional weight. When Jimmy Han's family's restaurant is set on fire, we learn the particulars of the fire-setting from about four different perspectives, but what about the aftermath? Jimmy, relying on insurance money to come through, quickly starts a new restaurant and hires staff and creates a new menu and this all happens off the page, we get from point A to point B so easily that it's a wonder we should care at all, with characters overcoming obstacles this easily.This could have been good but it just wasn't.

I think this is objectively a very good book. Valeria Luiselli sets out to do something incredibly ambitious, mixing media forms and offering a wealth of commentary on migration and displacement. But all that said, it left me feeling rather uninspired.This book and its main narrator are unapologetically aloof, and I think that was the main problem for me. Luiselli leans heavily on intertextuality to spin this story, and I was reminded of two other books I've read recently: The Friend by Sigrid Nunez and Where Reasons End by Yiyun Li. Incidentally, the female narrators in all three of these novels are nameless, and all three of their narratives are mired in literary references. But I felt like Nunez's and Li's narrators were using these references to cultivate a sense of self - I felt like I was gaining an understanding of who they were through this technique. In contrast, I never got a sense of who the narrator of Lost Children Archive was supposed to be - the intertextuality here read as generic and often soulless intellectualism. And it's frustrating because at one point the narrator says ""reading others' words, inhabiting their minds for a while, has always been an entry point to my own thoughts,"" which really resonated with me as a reader, but I ultimately found her own thoughts to pale next to those of the authors she quoted.But none of this is to say that Luiselli isn't a good writer. Her prose is incredibly well-crafted, and it's hard not to admire her technical skill. And thematically, this book is quite the feat: Luiselli examines the U.S.'s current border crisis through the eyes of a family taking a cross-country road trip, whose marriage is disintegrating due to the husband and wife engaging in two passion projects whose ideologies and practicalities conflict.About three-quarters of the way through the novel, the perspective shifts to the narrator's son, and while I preferred this section (as this is where the plot actually started advancing), I wasn't convinced by his mature narrative voice, and at this point the weird mythologizing of the 'lost children' started grating. This is largely a narrative about voicelessness, which doesn't attempt to give voice to the migrant children as much as highlight their absence in the narrative, and while I respected what Luiselli was trying to do, it fell a bit flat for me.So ultimately, a mixed bag. I'm glad I read this, I think it deserves to be longlisted for the Women's Prize and I won't be upset when it probably makes the shortlist, but while I admired it and found it punctuated by moments of utter brilliance, on the whole it was a bit of a chore to get through....more",Notes are private!,0,113,1,"Apr 05, 2019","Apr 11, 2019","Mar 03, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40245130-lost-children-archive

I had been saving this book for last in my Women’s Prize longlist read through, hoping to end the list on a high, but that sure didn’t go as planned. To be honest I don’t even have a great reason for disliking Remembered as much as I did, because objectively, I think this book is perfectly fine, it’s just… not much more than that.I have to first express my annoyance at this book’s marketing, which I’m certainly not holding against Yvonne Battle-Felton, but it was frustrating nonetheless to be expecting a book about 1910 Philadelphia and ending up with a book about US Civil War era slavery, which isn’t even mentioned in any professional summaries that I’ve read of this book. What begins as a story about an African American man driving a streetcar into a shop window quickly devolves into an extended flashback of the family’s history, and though we return briefly to 1910 a few times, that narrative thread is only really picked back up in the last 5 pages. So, just know what exactly you’re signing up for.But the fact that this book ended up being about slavery isn’t the problem, at all, it’s just that the execution comes up short of what it’s trying to achieve. At a slim 288 pages, this book is lacking the heft needed to successfully pull off the multi-generational family saga formula. The flashbacks just zip along without landing on any kind of emotional resonance, and the newer generation’s narrative doesn’t really thematically dovetail into the backstory beyond a very bare-bones parallel. Everything about this was disjointed and poorly paced, and I didn’t find myself emotionally affected by any of it in the way I arguably should have.

Obviously I'd prefer my endings on the satisfying and hard-hitting side, but if a book is strong enough, I'm not usually going to fault it for a slightly lackluster conclusion. This is why I rarely write s with spoiler tags - I don't have any problem talking about a book in general terms of what worked for me and what didn't.Praise Song for the Butterflies is the exception. Because for the most part, I really, really enjoyed this book. The characters were on the thin side and their motivations were at times difficult to discern, but that was my only note in what was otherwise proving to be a captivating story... maybe a bit simply told, but if anything, I thought McFadden's pared down prose style suited this story which could have easily veered into melodrama with overly flowery writing. And it certainly was every bit as horrifying as it's meant to be, but I couldn't bring myself to look away - granted, it's short, but I still read the whole thing in two sittings. So all things considered, it was going well.And then it ended. (view spoiler)[The problem isn't just the abysmal final scene, but we'll get to that in a minute. The bigger problem is that what was shaping up to be a moving story of resilience very, very quickly devolved into a narrative about how a traumatized woman finds healing in a man; how having a pleasurable romantic and sexual relationship is the pinnacle of what humankind can achieve. And I get it, I understand that love is validating and even curative at times, I understand that it can be cathartic to read about characters who have suffered finding happiness, but what I don't understand is the drastic shift from harrowing survival story to soppy, sensationalist drivel. And what I also don't understand is how anyone could read this utterly vile ''romantic'' declaration and find it moving or poignant or comforting or any of the things it's supposed to be:""But if that is the road God had you travel in order for our paths to cross, then we have no choice but to accept the purpose it has served and be grateful for it.""So let me get this straight: Abeo is raped from ages 11 to 21, she gives birth to a child, she watches the child drown, and is so traumatized that she becomes catatonic for months even after she's rescued... but wait, she finds a guy who doesn't see her as damaged goods and suddenly she's supposed to be grateful?! Again, I understand the intent here. But my god did this ever fail in execution. And then we get to the final scene, the one that completely undoes the entire premise that ensnared the reader to begin with. Because in the prologue, Abeo kills the man who raped and tormented her; it's a bold, shocking scene, and even knowing that event was coming added a layer of suspense and intrigue to the entire reading experience. But then it turns out to be -- wait for it -- a dream. And -- wait for it -- because she was able to kill this man in her dream, she can finally be at peace. Fin. What an utter cop-out. This book could have been an exploration of the lasting impact of trauma, it could have given its heroine a compassionate ending without compromising its exposition, but because of the last few chapters, a solidly captivating and eye-opening novel became a trite and forgettable one. Failing to live up to potential lends itself to a particularly potent kind of disappointment.

Diana Evans answers that question over the course of this slow paced yet incisive story that chronicles two disintegrating relationships in 2008 London. We follow two couples: Melissa and Michael, and Damian and Stephanie; one couple is married and one is not, though both have children and are each struggling in their own way with their domestic lives which have become increasingly loveless over the years.At its core, Ordinary People is concerned with the question of how children fundamentally alter a relationship. ""How much of yourself do you get to keep?"" Melissa asks Stephanie in an exchange where the self-proclaimed feminist and the content housewife confront one another about their conflicting ideologies. Melissa, stifled by the mere thought of marriage, equates domesticity with failure, and she struggles more and more as she ages to submit to her role as a sort-of-wife and mother. Through some especially well-executed third person omniscient narration we do hear the thoughts and concerns of each of these four characters, but Melissa's voice remains the most central; her burdens feel the most salient. The tension between Melissa and Michael is rendered brilliantly; Michael's anxieties as a black man assimilating to the corporate world are significant, but Melissa's perception of Michael as a representation of the patriarchy looms even larger. ""... women and men, we've all been given this old script and don't know how to let go of it. It seems indestructible, almost. We're stuck. We're all stuck. We haven't moved forwards at all in some ways. Society makes patriarchs of decent men."" There's an ambiguously supernatural thread that runs through the novel as well, as Melissa believes that her and Michael's house is haunted, and that the presence is destroying their daughter (it's not insignificant that their son remains unaffected). Whether this element is metaphorical or literal is a balancing act that Evans plays with throughout the novel, and I ultimately found its thematic resonance satisfying. This is a quiet, internal book, and the supernatural element is no different - this isn't the sort of book you should pick up if you're expecting fireworks; it just kind of simmers and cools toward the end, but not in an anticlimactic way.I only picked this up as it was longlisted for the Women's Prize, and it naturally compares itself to two other books on the list: An American Marriage and Normal People. All three novels focus on modern-day relationships, and each of them has a political backdrop that mainly serves to contextualize the characters' struggles. I found Evans' prose style more comparable to Rooney's than Jones' - both Evans and Rooney have a style that feels smooth and simple on the surface while also providing an impressive amount of insight into the characters' interior lives. Though Ordinary People and An American Marriage are obviously united in focusing on black protagonists and black relationships, giving each novel a sort of heft that Normal People arguably lacks (though it is my favorite of the three). But I wouldn't say any of these novels stands head and shoulders above the others; indeed, it's rather interesting to read them all in conversation with one another, for their similar and disparate commentaries on the way love can change over time....more",Notes are private!,0,79,1,"Mar 26, 2019",Apr 2019,"Mar 03, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38212139-ordinary-people

It tells the story of Alina, a young woman living in 1970s communist Romania, whose family comes under surveillance when her brother-in-law defects to the west. Blending a quotidian story with elements of Romanian folklore, this book is a unique, magical creation that I think will satisfy a lot of readers despite its brevity.But while I was particularly intrigued by its ‘novella-in-flash’ premise, it turned out that the whole flash thing kind of ruined it for me. Each of these chapters is brief – some are a few sentences, some are two or three pages – and each jumps the narrative ahead several weeks or months with no preamble. I hadn’t realized just how much I appreciate a consistent pace and flow in storytelling, but I guess it makes sense, because I’ve noticed over the years that my reading speed gradually increases the further into a book I get; at the very beginning, before I’ve been pulled into the narrative, my mind wanders easily and I find myself rereading the same passages over and over. That’s what kept happening to me with this book – it’s only 190 pages, and rather tiny pages at that, but it took me probably six or seven sittings to get through it, because the jolting pace made it particularly difficult for me to care about any of it.But anyway, all of that has more to do with me as a reader than what this book does or does not offer. I think it offers a lot: it’s a perceptive commentary about a young woman living under an oppressive governmental regime, an interesting counterpart to Milkman on the Women’s Prize longlist (though I think Milkman is the stronger novel in just about every conceivable way). And I did find its unique style both paradoxically stimulating and distracting; hopefully it will fall more toward the stimulating end of the spectrum for a lot of readers. Finally, I know that everyone who knows me was worried about my reception to this book as soon as the words ‘magical realism’ entered the summary, but I actually didn’t mind that element – I’m not sure it added anything that couldn’t have been achieved with more literal storytelling, but it was an interesting way to comment on the lengths one goes to in order to escape an oppressive government.

Which I'm not saying to be Like most books compared to The Secret History, We Went to the Woods isn't as good, so let's just get that out of the way. Which I'm not saying to be spiteful, I just genuinely don't want to see this book flop because of unrealistically high expectations. Yes, it follows a group of friends who isolate themselves and end up propelled inevitably into tragedy, and yes, it reads like a train wreck in the best kind of way, so it's an understandable comparison. But it's also a deeply aggravating book, and I say that as someone who thoroughly enjoyed it.We Went to the Woods focuses on Mack, a grad school dropout who, fleeing some kind of messy event in her past (more on that in a second), joins a group of idealistic young people who essentially endeavor to live in a modern-day socialist commune. That's basically the plot: many pages of gardening and rivalries and sexual tension and social activism ensue.My biggest issue with this book was the way Mack's backstory was handled: what should have been presented to the reader on page one was nonsensically withheld for a lame kind of 'gotcha!' moment halfway through the book that added nothing to the narrative or the suspense. When Mack finally tells her story, it feels like a stranger reciting it rather than the narrator whose head we'd been inhabiting for several hundred pages - so little does the event actually impact her thoughts or actions (other than providing the incentive she needed to abandon her life and join this project).My other main issue is pace: though I found this compelling, mostly due to Caite Dolan-Leach's elegant and clever writing, I imagine that for a lot of readers, it's probably going to drag. With a cover and title like this it's easy to imagine that you're in for some kind of thriller, but like We Went to the Woods' predecessor, Dead Letters, I fear that this book is going to suffer from 'marketed as a thriller, gets bad s because it's actually literary fiction' syndrome. However, where Dead Letters (an underrated gem, in my opinion) is the kind of book where a single word isn't out of place, We Went to the Woods languishes, unnecessarily so. I can only hope a few hundred more redundant words are chopped before its publication date.But to be honest, the only reason I'm dwelling so much on the negatives is because I did enjoy it so much - it's the kind of book that fully earned my investment and therefore frustrated me all the more in the areas where it fell short. That said, there's so much to recommend it. This book is a contemporary zeitgeist, taking a premise that seems to belong in the 60s and modernizing it with urgency. In a scene where the characters learn the results of the 2016 election, their reactions are almost painfully recognizable, and the book's main themes and social commentary dovetail again and again, always asking the same question: how important is activism in late-stage capitalism; is it better to try something that turns out to be futile or not try anything at all? Though the characters do quite a bit of moralizing, Dolan-Leach doesn't, as she recognizes the complexity of the book's central conceit. And on top of all that, I found it incredibly entertaining. Slow pace aside, I was so drawn into this story and couldn't wait to find out what happened next. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who needs their protagonists to be likable, but if you enjoy character studies about twisted, flawed individuals, this is a pretty good one.Thank you to Netgalley and Random House for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,40,1,"Jun 06, 2019","Jun 13, 2019","Feb 26, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42179785-we-went-to-the-woods

Ginny and Mark are an unhappily married couple, Samara is a young woman coping with the recent death of her mother, and Cass is a young mom who's had to sacrifice her academic ambitions for motherhood. Gradually the novel introduces the possibility of parallel realities which have begun to overlap, as each character starts to see visions of an alternate version of themselves. Throughout the course of the short novel we study each of these characters and unearth the decisions each of them made which prevented their other self's reality from coming to fruition. While I enjoyed this from start to finish and found the ending in particular to be utterly brilliant, I ultimately think I was hoping for more from this novel's speculative angle. Suburban life is chronicled convincingly, and each character is constructed carefully, but I don't think this digs deep enough to be the kind of character-driven novel it's trying to be. This could have been offset by the concept of parallel realities playing a larger role, but instead, that element is more of a vehicle used by the author to explore the novel's central concept: if I had done this instead of that, then what would have happened as a result? Still, it's a quick and thought-provoking read, and though it's underdeveloped in places I think some of the ideas it raises are interesting enough to make up for that. 3.5 stars.Thank you to Netgalley and Random House for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,"Mar 07, 2019","Mar 10, 2019","Feb 14, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40641074-if-then

But that’s not Like most short story collections, Friday Black has its highs and its lows, and on the whole I’d say it lands somewhere in the middle. But that’s not to dismiss Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah’s skill at dark, grotesque speculative fiction, which is on full display in a number of these stories, from the harrowing opener The Finkelstein 5 (a man brutally murders 5 black children with a chainsaw and claims self-defense) to the devastating Zimmer Land (a Westworld-style themepark where participants play out fantasies in which they defend their families by murdering intruders).However, from an opening that promised thematic cohesion (at least where the first three stories were concerned – all playing with the tension between inward identity and outward emotion), it started to flounder a bit. The Hospital Where introduces huge ideas and never really follows through. Three stories make the exact same point about consumerism, begging the question of why they were all necessary to include. The final story, Through the Flash, drags on and on while getting less interesting the further it goes.My average rating for these 12 stories is 3.25, so 3 stars it is, but I do want to stress that I did enjoy this collection. I think Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah is one of the most exciting, daring new voices I’ve read in fiction all year. This is a searing, unapologetic collection about violence and black identity and capitalism, and how inextricable those themes are.

I ultimately decidedI thought Persuasion was brilliant and when I finished I briefly flirted with the idea that it might be my favorite Austen novel. I ultimately decided that I was downplaying my feelings for Mansfield Park in favor of what I feel might be a technically better book, but I can no longer deny that Mansfield Park touched me in a way that Persuasion did not. Still, this is a damn good book. Decidedly more mature and melancholy than most of Austen’s works, Persuasion is probably the slowest of all of Austen’s slow burns, but I felt that the pacing was so deliberate and the setup so juicy that I couldn’t fault it for that. (Plus, it’s 200 pages shorter than Emma.)Continuing on in my love for Austen’s more reserved heroines, I found Anne Elliot to be a brilliant creation. Having once been persuaded by her family to refuse the proposal of naval officer Frederick Wentworth, Anne finds herself eight years later confronted with Wentworth once again and is forced to face the feelings for him that she thought she had long buried. Interestingly, not a whole lot of interaction between Anne and Wentworth ensues (and there isn’t much plot to speak of beyond a secondary character having a traumatic head injury) — but still Anne and Wentworth’s relationship is one of my favorite things Austen has written. This is an unfalteringly internal work, and Austen chronicles the growth in Anne with such convincing subtlety that this novel’s realism can’t help but to be marveled at.Some might fault this book for being less witty and humorous than her others, but I think her wit shines through in her piercing observations about class and the shifting social hierarchy. It’s certainly a less lively novel than any of her earlier works, but that’s what I admire so much about it: that Austen was able to create such a compelling and insular story that’s captivating not for its sarcasm and banter, but for its earnest and reflective depiction of two people finding their way back into each other’s lives at the right moment....more",Notes are private!,0,55,1,"Jun 21, 2021","Jun 26, 2021","Feb 05, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13646335-persuasion

Translated beautifully from the French by Molly Ringwald (yes, that Molly Ringwald), Lie With Me tells the story of a love affair between two teenage boys in 1984 rural France, narrated years later by Philippe with the kind of mature perception that only time can bring.Nothing about this story is new; homophobia, class disparity, and shame all chart the course for this short novel, whose inherent tragedy makes itself apparent to the reader in an exchange between Philippe and Thomas, the latter of whom lays their dynamic out plainly the very first time they speak (“you will leave and we will stay”) – but it felt immeasurably fresh nonetheless. Probably most interesting is the sharp contrast between Philippe, whose candid narration reads as more of a confession than a monologue, and Thomas, who remains largely unknown except for the parts of himself that he allows Philippe to see. The character work is deceptively impressive, and Besson’s unrelenting attention to these characters’ similar and disparate vulnerabilities effectively cultivates an atmosphere of longing and regret and anxiety.There’s something I can’t quite put my finger on that’s holding me back from the full 5 stars (maybe I should have read this in one sitting, I think that might be it), but this is a very strong 4.5, and one of the more accomplished novels that I’ve read recently. Ultimately it’s an intimate, erotic, sparse yet hard-hitting read that ends with one of the saddest sentences that I think I’ve ever read, and if that doesn’t make you want to rush out and read this 160 page book immediately, I don’t know what will.Thank you to Netgalley and Scribner for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Apr 13, 2019","Apr 25, 2019","Feb 04, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40539136-lie-with-me

But, nonetheless, this is my reigning book of 2019. And it ended up being one of those rare cases when the book turned out so differently from what I expected, but I ended up liking it all the more for that. From the blurb I got the impression that this was going to focus on the disappearance of a woman called Jean McConville, with details about the Troubles setting the background context, but instead it's primarily a narrative account of the Troubles which occasionally, haltingly zeroes in on McConville's story. So it's less true crime than it is historical nonfiction, but the final product is focused and compelling.Say Nothing, whose title comes from a line from a Seamus Heaney poem which examines the treacherous precedent of speaking plainly about the Troubles, paints a comprehensive picture of twentieth century Belfast and introduces us to a few of the main players responsible for much of the devastation caused by the IRA - Brendan Hughes, Gerry Adams, Dolours and Marian Price, et al. Radden Keefe explores the lives and family histories and philosophies and interpersonal dynamics of these individuals and I found it refreshing that he didn't have an interest in moralizing in his approach to this story; while I think true objectivity is probably impossible, this is about as multifaceted as it gets. Driven primarily by an interest in the human cost of the conflict, Radden Keefe turns four years of research into a richly detailed account of Northern Ireland's fraught history, particularly examining how difficult it is to cultivate a historical record when different accounts contain conflicting information, and when everyone is afraid to speak openly about a conflict that's officially been resolved, but is a strong force in cumulative living memory. (If you loved Milkman, or if you didn't understand Milkman, this is such a valuable nonfiction supplement.) Certain anecdotes and images in this book were just arresting, and I think it's telling that the two stories that affected me the most had victims on opposite sides of the conflict. The first was about an IRA man who ordered a hit on another IRA man, whose wife he was having an affair with; the first man was sentenced to death, and Dolours Price, driving him to his execution, was struck with the thought that she could let him go, or that he could attack her and escape, but neither of those possibilities was going to happen because they both wholly accepted their devotion to the cause. The chapter ends with the flat and haunting lines ""'I'll be seeing you Joe,' Price said. But she knew that she wouldn't be, and she cried the whole way home."" The second story that got under my skin was about two young British soldiers who had accidentally found themselves in the middle of an IRA funeral; because of a recent attack by loyalists, their presence was met with suspicion and they were dragged from their car and beaten, and eventually taken across the road and shot. A Catholic priest ran over and when he noticed that one of the men was still breathing, asked if anyone knew CPR, but he was met with silence from the crowd, and a photograph was captured of him kneeling over this soldier's body and staring into the camera, his lips bloody from trying to resuscitate him.As for the significance of Jean McConville, the mother of ten who went missing in 1972, and whose body wasn't recovered until her bones were found on a beach in 2003: at first I did worry that this element was being shoehorned as a bizarre piece of human interest (I say 'bizarre' due to the little attention that's paid to McConville and her children throughout). However, I needn't have worried, as everything does eventually dovetail in a way that fully justifies this book's premise. Running alongside the historical account of the Troubles, Radden Keefe introduces the reader to something called the Boston College Tapes, an aborted project in which heads of the college's Irish History department endeavored to curate an oral history of the Troubles, to be accessed by the college's students in future generations. Due to the fact that discussing past paramilitary activity is an incriminating act, participants in the project were granted a sort of amnesty and promised that the tapes would not be released until after the participant's death. This promise was violated in the form of a lengthy legal battle between BC and the UK government, and ended up playing a key role in getting to the bottom of McConville's disappearance.While I'd first and foremost recommend Say Nothing to those with an interest in Irish history and wouldn't dream of selling this as a true crime book, I don't want to downplay how enthralling this was. Granted, its focus is something I already had an interest in, but what Radden Keefe brought to this narrative was a fiercely human angle, and I found this as deeply moving as it was informative.Thank you to Netgalley and Doubleday for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,272,1,"Feb 25, 2019","Feb 27, 2019","Jan 20, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40163119-say-nothing

The unnamed narrator (modeled after Li herself whose 16-year-old son died by suicide in 2017) is a writer, who deals with her loss by writing out a series of dialogues with her son Nikolai - not his real name, but as good as any.This entire book is essentially an exercise in whether or not it's possible to take linguistic ownership over one's grief. The narrator and her son engage in a series of verbal sparring matches, challenging aphorisms and the kind of common language that surrounds mourning. But as well as bemoaning the limitations of language, the narrator also celebrates what words are capable of. ""Words fall short, yes, but sometimes their shadows can reach the unspeakable."" The narrator doesn't attempt to reckon with the question of why this tragedy occurred, and she isn't interested in eulogizing her son in these pages; instead it's a candid attempt to come to terms with her loss without losing her identity as a writer and a mother.""I was a generic parent grieving a generic child lost to an inexplicable tragedy. Already there were three clichés. I could wage my personal war against each one of them. Grieve from Latin gravare, to burden, and gravis, grave, heavy. What kind of mother would consider it a burden to live in a vacancy left behind by a child? Explicate from Latin ex (out) + plicare (fold), to unfold. But calling Nikolai’s actions inexplicable was like calling a migrant bird on a new continent lost. Who can say that the vagrant doesn’t have a reason to change the course of its flight. Nothing inexplicable for me, only I didn’t want to explain: A mother’s job is to enfold not to unfold. Tragedy now that is an inexplicable word. What was a goat song, after all, which is what tragedy seemed to mean originally?""Where Reasons End simply would not work if Yiyun Li didn't have the superb command of language that she does. For whatever reason, this is the passage that I kept coming back to: ""How do you compare sadness that takes over like an erupted volcano to sadness that stays inside one, still as a stillborn baby? People talk about grief coming and going like waves, but I am not a breakwater, I am not a boat, I am not a statue left on a rocky shore, tested for its endurance."" But this is the kind of book where you could highlight the entire thing if you're looking for sharp and incisive yet sparse prose.I will say: this requires a certain amount of mental and emotional investment from the reader; you need to meet Li halfway and you need to want to engage with what you're reading. I don't think I was in the perfect headspace for this novel, hence the 4 stars rather than 5, but it's undeniably brilliant and it's a book that I can see myself revisiting some day....more",Notes are private!,0,55,1,"Apr 02, 2019","Apr 07, 2019","Jan 18, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40147915-where-reasons-end

I usually cross-post from Goodreads to my blog, not the other way around, so that is very odd. Anyway.Constellations is the debut memoirist essay collection by noted Irish arts critic Sinéad Gleeson, and it’s a collection that appears to have been years in the making. It’s unsurprising then that the result is as masterful as it is – I inhaled this utterly marvelous book in one day and could not stop thinking about it after I finished.Gleeson puts her own body at the front and center of these essays; she writes of hip replacements, leukemia, arthritis, and childbirth, deftly tying in her own stories with broader observations about the politicization of women’s bodies. These essays are at their best when they’re the most personal, I think, because Gleeson has the remarkable ability to express vulnerability without self-pity, but there isn’t a single essay in this collection that isn’t in its own way thought-provoking and memorable.This is perfect for fans of Maggie O’Farrell’s I Am, I Am, I Am: Seventeen Brushes with Death, though I consider Constellations to be (perhaps ironically) more thematically coherent. ‘Blue Hills and Chalk Bones’ opens the collection with a story about a school trip to France and coming to terms with her body’s limitations, a moving opening that segues into the more widely accessible ‘Hair,’ which interrogates the relationship between hair and identity. I don’t think I’ve ever read anything that captures the utter senselessness and cruelty of death better than ‘Our Mutual Friend,’ far and away the collection’s standout, but even though that emotional crescendo comes early, the essays that follow continue to hold their own and deliver the occasional gut-punch while meditating on themes of illness, death, motherhood, and the interplay between art and health.All said, this collection is essentially a reminder of the importance of bodily autonomy (which Gleeson fights for most ardently in her essay in which she reflects on Ireland’s notoriously harsh abortion policies). But despite the relentlessly heavy subject matter, this is the kind of book that you feel lighter having read, because it isn’t weighed down by the kind of hopelessness and despair that Gleeson has been fighting through ever since her first health diagnosis. As a self-proclaimed lover of all things macabre I tend to shudder at the word ‘uplifting’ so I’m trying to avoid using it, but suffice to say that this is a beautiful book that works through a number of difficult subjects to a consequential and impactful end.

I picked up The Parting Glass partially on a whim, but it captivated me practically from the first page. It tells the stoWhat a lush and lovely book. I picked up The Parting Glass partially on a whim, but it captivated me practically from the first page. It tells the story of lady's maid Maire O'Farren, alias Mary Ballard, an Irish immigrant employed by the beautiful young mistress Charlotte Walden in 19th century New York. Maire is captivated by Charlotte to the point of obsession, but Charlotte is having an affair with the stable groom, who happens to be Maire's twin brother. Through this awkward love triangle of sorts, The Parting Glass explores passion and obsession and sexuality and corruption and social unrest in a turbulent period of American and Irish history, and it does so with a gripping, pacy story that I could not put down.One thing I loved about this book was its rich historical detail. In the afterward you can get a sense of the amount of research that Gina Marie Guadagnino put into this novel, and it really does show the whole way through. Though she never pulls the historical context to the forefront in a distracting way, she still firmly establishes the setting, which she could have easily downplayed in favor of the various romantic subplots. Instead, this is actually an impressive piece of historical fiction that focuses on the reception of Irish immigrants to America in the 19th century - not exactly untread territory, but it's handled in a way that feels relevant and immediate.The other huge strength of this book for me was Maire's relationship with her brother Seanin. With a mother who died in childbirth and a father who died when they were young, growing up in Ireland Maire and Seanin were inseparable, and it's not until they move to the US that cracks in their relationship begin to form, Charlotte only acting as a catalyst for a rift that runs much deeper. I thought it was a fantastic depiction of a close, intense relationship that can easily flip the switch from love to hate. While Maire and Seanin's characterization was brilliant, I would have liked to have seen a bit more of Charlotte, though I'm wondering if her character was kept deliberately hazy as a reflection of Maire's idolization. I will say, to anyone picking this up because of its Fingersmith comparison, don't expect Sarah Waters' quality of prose (I haven't read Fingersmith, but I have read Waters before). Though I do think Guadagnino has a fantastic command of language, this isn't quite on that same literary level, which I point out only because I imagine that's going to be the main criticism held against this novel. It almost feels overly dismissive to call this a beach read for Waters fans, but there may be some truth to that; it's certainly a clever book, but not half as dense as Waters. But I'd recommend you just ignore that comparison and enjoy it for what it is - a gem of lesbian historical fiction with compelling characters and a well-developed political backdrop.Thank you to Edelweiss and Atria for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Feb 18, 2019","Feb 23, 2019","Jan 08, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40539137-the-parting-glass

This is the second book I’ve read by Jennifer McMahon (the other being The Night Sister) and honestly I feel similarly about both: I have a soft spot for McMahon and her spooky Vermont ghost stories and I would recommend them wholeheartedly to anyone looking for a quick and entertaining read, but they’re not without their significant issues.The biggest problem with The Invited is that it takes an agonizingly long time to get going. Once it hits its stride it’s juicy enough, but for the first hundred or so pages, you will be inundated with more construction talk than is strictly necessary, and a parallel storyline following 14-year-old Olive failed to come to life for me (mostly because I never really believed Olive’s voice and found her sections a little tonally inconsistent).What I did thoroughly enjoy though was the central mystery surrounding Helen’s haunted land and the ghost of Hattie Breckenridge.

(My one-word Goodreads  before I finishing gathering my thoughts was just 'Perfection'.) Let's get this out of the way: Serbian performance artist Marina Abramović is a controversial figure, and much as I'd love to shove her ghostwritten memoir into everyone's hands, I must admit that there are plenty of people who will remain thoroughly unmoved by it, and that's completely fine. But I also want to clarify that I don't think it's essential for a reader to love or understand or even be familiar with her art in order to appreciate this. The best thing to be while picking up this book is open-minded.Personally I love contemporary art, I love performance art, and I love Marina Abramović, so this was always going to work for me. But it still managed to exceed my expectations; I think I was anticipating entertaining and instead I got revelatory. I did study Art History in college and am hardly a stranger to thinking critically about what art is, so I wasn't expecting my perception of that question to be so shaken by Abramović's perspective. Art and life are fundamentally inextricable concepts to her, which she explores throughout her career in a series of daring, unconventional performance pieces, which are chronicled in this book with vividly descriptive imagery. This book, as well as Marina's career, is a testament to her unbelievable ability to push her body to its limits, and using her own physicality to connect with her audience. The way her performances build upon and interact with one another is delineated here with clarity: I genuinely feel enriched from this new understanding I have of her work and what she has tried, and has succeeded, to achieve. Even outside of her art (though she would probably frown upon making this distinction), Marina's life is a constant source of fascination. This reads more like autobiography than memoir, as it's heavy on fact and chronology and light on emotional analysis, but this isn't a criticism. Marina is presented in this book as an open, vulnerable figure, her methods and ideology made accessible through a thorough excavation of her life, from childhood to present day. If you're interested in Marina Abramović but aren't a big nonfiction reader, the novel The Museum of Modern Love by Heather Rose is a brilliant depiction of her 2010 show The Artist is Present. Otherwise, I really couldn't recommend Walk Through Walls: A Memoir highly enough. ...more",Notes are private!,0,154,1,"Jul 03, 2019","Jul 07, 2019","Dec 26, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28814918-walk-through-walls

But it wasn’t, as is often the case for me, because I never felt like listening to it; I would start playing this book constantly and only be able to listen for a couple of minutes because I felt like my skin was crawling. Which is, of course, exactly what a book like this should be, so, no complaints, only apologies that it took me this long to be able to stomach it.In No Visible Bruises, journalist Rachel Louise Snyder investigates the state of domestic violence (also known as intimate partner violence) in the U.S. She anchors her thesis to a Montana woman, Michelle Monson Mosure, whose husband Rocky shot and killed Michelle and her two children in 2001, before killing himself. This tragedy was not out of the blue; Rocky had a long history of violence and Michelle had known that he was capable of killing her. When Rocky was briefly incarcerated for breaking and entering into Michelle’s family home, Michelle worked up the courage to file a restraining order — which she then quickly recanted as soon as Rocky was bailed out. Michelle reached out for help and failed to receive it, and Snyder tells her story not only in order to upend common misconceptions about intimate partner violence (the most notable and infuriating of which being, “why didn’t she just leave?”), but also to examine the ways in which her and her children’s deaths could have been prevented.The focus of the book then turns to the many government-funded programs that have been launched over the years to address intimate partner violence, to varying degrees of success. Snyder puts a huge emphasis in her research on rehabilitation, speaking to perpetrators directly and attending group rehab sessions. It’s a jarring transition, this shift in focus from victim to perpetrator, but it’s a necessary one. The function of this book isn’t merely to dismiss fallacies about intimate partner violence, it’s to address the issue head on and provide insight into what has actually been successful at reducing the crime. Snyder also addresses shelters and police intervention — two commonly cited paths to safety for victims, and she explains the shortcomings of both solutions. The point that she drives home throughout this book is that intimate partner violence doesn’t exist in isolation; it’s caused and influenced by a myriad of social factors which all need to be addressed in their own way, which ultimately involves providing intervention and assistance to perpetrators as well as victims. This book is absolutely harrowing but it’s skillfully researched and necessary. There is one thing I’d like to point out though before recommending it — Snyder doesn’t tackle the issue of intimate partner violence within the LGBTQ community specifically, and she often gives she/her pronouns to victims and he/him pronouns to perpetrators when speaking generally. She addresses this in her forward, acknowledging that it’s a generalization based on statistics that she is aware does not encapsulate every instance of intimate partner violence. As it isn’t the aim of this particular project to delve into queer intimate partner violence or to highlight specific instances of women assaulting their male partners, I can’t fault Snyder for not doing that, but it’s worth noting that this is probably the book’s most notable weak area. I do recommend this very highly unless queer intimate partner violence is specifically what you are seeking to learn about....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Mar 05, 2021","Aug 31, 2021","Dec 20, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33786693-no-visible-bruises

But I suppose Mother Winter is less of a mother book than it is a daughter book, centered on the irreconcilable grief that Sophia Shalmiyev incurred by growing up motherless. This is a sharp, focused, achingly tender and highly literary memoir that reads like a constant gut-punch. Growing up in Leningrad in the 1980s, Shalmiyev had very little contact with her alcoholic mother, who she was forced to leave behind altogether when her father decided to emigrate in 1989. Shalmiyev spends the rest of her childhood and then adolescence and then adulthood unable to contact her mother, without any means of finding out if she's even alive or dead. Her experimental memoir (which will undoubtedly appeal to fans of Maggie Nelson) fuses her unique experience of loss with themes of exile, grief, sexuality, displacement, and feminism; she often looks to iconic feminist women as stand-in maternal figures, as she relentlessly interrogates the lacuna that comes to define her.Shalmiyev's prose is vivid and searing. In this passage she's talking about a dream she has where her mother is a statue at the bottom of the sea, and the imagery and emotional honesty on display here is rather emblematic of the rest of the book:When you're fished out, you will go to your proper place in a museum to be admired by me only. I will polish your bronze name plaque, and I will be writing the small paragraph, printed on heavy card stock in a tastefully solemn font, about you as a priceless relic, a found shard, degraded, a puzzling piece of history. A head lost, bust found somewhere, a battered woman with blank eyes, erected by those who had infinite worship in their hearts.My one criticism is the overly abrupt ending, which leaves the reader with question after unanswered question. I obviously have to ask myself if that was indeed the point, which is certainly a possibility, but this is one of those books that seems so mired in the past that there isn't much consideration for the future, and I'm left wondering what Shalmiyev intends to do after the final pages of this book. But, perhaps she does not owe us that explanation, or perhaps we will have to wait until she writes another book. Which I certainly hope she will.Thank you to Netgalley and Simon & Schuster for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest .

When she The Stranger Inside has a pretty enticing premise: Kimber Hannon returns home from a week away only to find herself locked out of her house. When she notices someone inside she calls the police, who get him to open the door; he produces the paperwork complete with Kimber's forged signature and insists that he's renting the house for six months. Overcome with frustration, Kimber rushes inside her house, only to have the man grab her and whisper in her ear 'I saw what you did.'So that was a great opening, but it's all downhill from there, I'm afraid. Which was more of a mess, the plot or the characters? Let's start with the latter: Kimber has to win some kind of award for being the most insufferable protagonist in literary history. I truly do not believe that a protagonist needs to be 'likable,' but they sure as hell need to be interesting or sympathetic or something to hook the reader, especially in a thriller. I could not have cared less about Kimber: she's selfish, remorseless, and emotionally immature, and why should I care that it all stems from a troubled adolescence when none of it is satisfactorily examined. At one point she befriends the wife of a man she had an affair with just because she thinks it would be funny to get back at him, without a second thought about the wife's feelings, and we're supposed to sympathize with her when she starts to realize this woman is actually a person? I really did not get the impression that Kimber was deliberately constructed to be a compelling antiheroine; I think she was supposed to be a flawed person who still deserved our sympathy, after everything. It didn't work.The plot itself was all kinds of ridiculous, with varying degrees of success; at times it was ridiculous and fun but at other times it was just ridiculous and boring. There were just too many convenient plot devices and moments that demanded suspension of disbelief. The pace at which information was revealed was haphazard at best, and it was a shame, because even the moments that should have been shocking were neutered by weak storytelling.Now I'm going to end this  by going into spoiler territory, which I don't often do, so that just goes to show how much the ending pissed me off. (view spoiler)[Regarding the twist that Kimber didn't actually kill Michelle: Why does Kimber deserve this narrative absolution?! She hasn't displayed an OUNCE of guilt throughout the entire book; at one point when she's accused of being a murderer, this is Kimber's reaction: ""[S]he has never imagined her sister's death to be a murder, herself an actual murderer. In her head it's always I killed Michelle or I accidentally killed Michelle or I took my sister's life."" ... how does that make it ok?! You literally pushed your sister off a cliff?!?! I'm pretty sure if I killed my (nonexistent) sister I'd be eaten up with guilt, regardless of how 'accidental' it was? Maybe the potential emotional impact of this ending could have been earned if there were even a hint of a possibility that Kimber cared anything for Michelle, but it felt like (literally) handing a get out of jail free card to a person you desperately want to see go to jail. Not even remotely satisfying. Also, love that the mentally ill character turns out to be evil. Real original, that!!

First, that the world is stacked in favor of men, yes, in a way that is so widely understood as to be boring, invisible, just life.But more deeply, it was a reminder of how easily we can see in men -- even in the bad ones -- talent. Brilliance. Complexity. Humanity. We manage to look past their flaws and sexual violations to what value they bring to the world. It is the direct opposite, in many ways, of how we view women, whose successes can still be blithely attributed to the fact that the boss wanted to fuck them.""Good and Mad is probably the best contemporary feminist text I've read. Smart, biting, and unapologetic, Traister meditates on the post-2016 election state of affairs in America - Trump, Weinstein, #MeToo, school shootings, police brutality - and contextualizes all of this into a coherent narrative, the root of which is (not so surprisingly) white supremacy and patriarchal infrastructures. As an American who's been sad and disheartened and yes, angry, every day since the election, who's overwhelmed daily by the constant stream of depressing state of world affairs on Twitter, it was nice to read a refreshingly intersectional analysis of the times we're living in that doesn't write off the potential of the numerous female-led protests and movements that have arisen in recent years. Traister's central thesis is that female anger is good, healthy, constructive; she cites numerous examples of women, often women of color, who have refused to be silenced by the sociopolitical structures that have endeavored to dismiss their anger as irrational. This was at times frustrating to read because sometimes it feels like the sexism and racism in US politics is an unassailable force, but Traister herself has no interest in that kind of cynicism, ending this book on a note that succeeds in inspiring.

Set in modern-day East BelfFor whatever reason I never tire of reading about the Troubles, but The Fire Starters is not your average 'Troubles book.' Set in modern-day East Belfast, Jan Carson imagines a series of fires that break out throughout the city, initiated by an enigmatic figure referred to as the Fire Starter, who revels in the blood lust that his havoc causes. Amidst this violence we have two fathers, Sammy Agnew, an old man and former paramilitary, and Jonathan Murray, a socially awkward new father, both of whom fear their own children, as Sammy begins to suspect that his son is the cause of the Tall Fires, and Jonathan begins to suspect that his newborn daughter is a Siren.This is a singular, inventive, tragic, and wildly funny book about the legacy of violence and the lasting scars it leaves on a community. The novel's central conceit is reminiscent of Milkman, and of other quintessential Northern Irish lit - that terror begins at home, that trust cannot automatically be extended to one's own family - but Jan Carson's interpretation of this theme is far more abstract than any I've seen before. I'll be honest, I'm so relieved that I didn't know there was going to be a magical realism element to this book before picking it up, because as I'm sure you all know by now, magical realism almost never works for me - but fortunately, Carson shows us how it's done. This book quite literally mythologizes the Troubles as the threat of Sophie the maybe-Siren looms large over Jonathan, but her narrative role is more ambiguous; is Jonathan merely appropriating the grandiosity of the cultural narrative he was raised into, or is Sophie actually a danger to society? As Jonathan fears for the future, Sammy reminisces on the past and the violent role he played in the conflict in the 1970s; he fears that he can never wash his hands clean, and that his actions have irrevocably damaged his son. As I'm sure you can tell, I loved this.

Well,Every time I've read a thriller recently I've been left with the thought 'do I actually like thrillers or am I just reading these out of habit.' Well, it turns out I do still like them! I just wish they were all on Olivia Kiernan's level - her Frankie Sheehan series is shaping up to be one of my favorites... which is odd as I really dislike police procedurals most of the time. So more power to Kiernan for being able to hook me on a formula that I'm not wild about.And while I enjoyed Kiernan's debut, Too Close to Breathe, I think its sequel The Killer in Me is superior in just about every way. More intricate plotting, more sophisticated writing, and more of that 'can't put it down' factor. So while it's always fun to go into a sequel being familiar with the characters, you could easily read The Killer in Me as a standalone. There are five murders at the heart of this novel, though two took place 17 years ago, as Seán Hennessey has just been released from prison where he served a sentence for murdering his parents, though he continues to profess his innocence. But when a series of eerily similar murders begins to occur, naturally Seán is the number one suspect. It's a great premise, and Kiernan manages to expertly balance her various subplots so that it's difficult to predict exactly what it's all building up to.Incidentally, I did have the exact same complaint about The Killer in Me as I did about Too Close to Breathe, which is that Frankie tends to make leaps the size of the Grand Canyon while doing a psychological profile on the killer(s), which invariably turn out to be accurate. So that's a bit annoying, but you can't have everything. All things considered, I think Olivia Kiernan is a brilliant new voice in the Irish crime genre, and if you like your thrillers on the dark and psychologically distressing side, you won't want to miss this series.Thanks so much to Dutton for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Mar 23, 2019","Mar 25, 2019","Dec 10, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41802885-the-killer-in-me

Énard draws on the historically verified premise that Michelangelo was invited in 1506 to Constantinople by the Sultan Bayezid II, who wished to commission the design for a bridge over the Golden Horn, having already rejected a design proposed by Leonardo da Vinci. Wishing to surpass his elder and seduced by promises of eternal glory, Énard's Michelangelo makes the excursion, fleeing from Pope Julius II and an unfinished commission in Rome.What this slim book lacks in word count it makes up for in atmosphere: lush and evocative, Énard's writing propels the reader into the past with a tonal confidence and authority that blurs the line between fact and fiction - and even after reading Énard's note at the end, you would be forgiven for still not knowing which is which. Even the physicality of the pages makes you feel like you're reading a historical document; with sparse, short chapters, occasional sketches, and an abundance of blank space, Énard easily earns his reader's trust and convincingly brings the past to life. While I imagine that Énard is a tremendously gifted writer in French, Charlotte Mandell's translation is stunning and sensual. The novella opens with the following paragraph:“Night does not communicate with the day. It burns up in it. Night is carried to the stake at dawn. And its people along with it—the drinkers, the poets, the lovers. We are a people of the banished, of the condemned. I do not know you. I know your Turkish friend; he is one of ours. Little by little he is vanishing from the world, swallowed up by the shadows and their mirages; we are brothers. I don't know what pain or what pleasure propelled him to us, to stardust, maybe opium, maybe wine, maybe love; maybe some obscure wound of the soul deep-hidden in the folds of memory.”These words are narrated by an Andalusian singer that Michelangelo spends the night with, whose perspective occasionally resurfaces throughout the book. These chapters were consistently my favorites, but the chapters which focused on Michelangelo's time in Constantinople and his fraught relationship with the gay poet Mesihi I found almost equally as thrilling.'Thrilling' almost feels like an inappropriate word to use while trying to sell a relatively plotless book, but it feels like an accurate way to describe the constant emotional and intellectual engagement I felt with this story. In only 144 pages, Énard tells a propulsive tale of art, ambition, and a clashing of two cultures that don't actually meet in a significant artistic way in 1506 - this book instead hinges on the glorious 'what if?' It's also a bracing portrayal of one of history's greatest artists - genius though he is, Énard's Michelangelo fears the carnal as much as he reveres the aesthetic of it, and this contradiction is navigated here with grace and tragedy. Make no mistake: this is very much my kind of book. I'm sure a lot of readers will find it serviceable or even dull, but everything came together for me for the perfectly enchanting and emotionally satisfying read. I can't recommend it highly enough... but only if the premise intrigues you.

Kate, a young woman living in New York City in the early 2000s, believes she's one such person, as she has dreams which propel her into a past timeline where she lives as a mistress in Elizabethan England. When she wakes up, she begins to notice that details about her life have changed overnight, and as she becomes increasingly convinced that her dreams are affecting her reality, her boyfriend Ben becomes concerned about her mental health.It's particularly difficult to talk about the plot of this book when it's ever-shifting. At the start of the novel Kate and Ben live in a New York that resembles our own, except that we aren't at war and we've elected a green party president named Chen, until one day she wakes up and is informed by her concerned friends that Gore is president, and has been president all along, doesn't she remember? Newman excels at playing with this inherently tenuous atmosphere; whether it's Kate's mental stability or the fabric of the universe that's really on the verge of collapse, there's a palpable fragility at play while you turn these pages, never sure which details are going to shift from one page to the next.But despite its clever construction, this doesn't completely work from start to finish. Kate's dream narrative is noticeably weaker than that of the present, and the depiction of 1590s England feels almost caricaturish. It also plays with many different lofty ideas and doesn't always follow through with seamless execution; certain plot threads feel abandoned and under-examined, and I thought the resolution undermined a lot of what came before it. But, I haven't completely made up my mind about this book and I'm sure to be mulling it over for days to come, so I'm very curious to see how others will receive this wildly unconventional tale of love and fate and time travel.Thank you to Netgalley and Grove Atlantic for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,83,1,"Feb 08, 2019","Feb 14, 2019","Dec 05, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40642331-the-heavens

Ailsa Calder, a young woman living in London, finds herself inheriting half of an old Scottish manor when her mother dies. Though she initially wants nothing to do with it, she’s unable to sell it unless the joint owner agrees; the problem being that the other half belongs to her father, who disappeared without a trace twenty-seven years ago. So Ailsa moves into the manor with her half-sister, and from the very first night, she can’t shake the suspicion that something is deeply wrong with the house.The atmosphere in this book, as I’m sure you can imagine, was pitch-perfect, and that’s really the main reason I’d recommend it. The setting of a creepy old house in the Scottish Highlands is hard to mess up, and Lexie Elliott mercifully uses it to its potential. The potentially supernatural element (is the house actually haunted?) is mostly kept ambiguous until the conclusion, which is how I prefer it when a supernatural element encroaches on a thriller; it’s always interesting to me when characters feel like they’re losing their grip on reality.The problem with this book for me was that it was severely under-edited. This is a very slow-building mystery, which is fine, but when your book is a slow burn, you still need something to propel it forward; instead I felt like The Missing Years was just spinning its wheels for about two-hundred pages. I felt like I was slowly being driven mad by the sheer amount of repetition here – I wasn’t sure I could take another instance of Aisla anthropomorphizing the house without losing the last shred of my own sanity. I’m not kidding, there is barely a page where Aisla doesn’t reflect on the feeling that the house is watching her, which I thought was a rather ham-fisted addition to what was otherwise a fantastically rendered setting.I still mostly enjoyed reading this, and I’d suggest picking it up if the setting appeals to you, but if you prefer your thrillers on the fast paced side, it’s probably best to skip this one.Thank you to Berkley for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Apr 13, 2019","Apr 21, 2019","Dec 04, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40953912-the-missing-years

This is a YA collection in adult clothing, and I think it’s a shame that it wasn’t edited with a young adult audience in mind (characters are all adults but feel like teenagers, and a few passing references to sex are clearly made to age it up; it doesn’t work). Anyway, it leaves me in this awkward place where I don't like to criticize YA books for being YA (they just weren't written for me, and that is a-okay!), but this book was explicitly marketed as adult and I did go into it expecting that it had been written for me so here we are.I pretty much knew I wasn't going to get on with this from the author's forward, which ends with the words: ‘Turn the page. I have miracles to offer you.’ If that isn't the most self-aggrandizing way to begin a book, I don't know what is. I was just at odds with Kat Howard's style prose style the whole time, with lines like that as well as 'There had been a woman, Madeleine, he thought her name was, who smelled of paper and stories.'This whole collection can pretty much be summed up in this line, from the story The Green Knight's Wife (hey, I like Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, maybe that story will finally be the one for me... never mind):He feels more comfortable in a place that is like him: forest, secret, overgrown. No one ever asked me what my comforts were[...]This collection is just a mindless chorus of similar female voices lamenting being overshadowed by men; a theme I can absolutely love when done well, but here it isn't executed with particular craft or purpose. I could pretty much hear Howard's internal monologue as she was writing: ""What if The Green Knight... but feminist? What if Orpheus and Eurydice... but feminist? What if Macbeth (kind of)... but feminist?"" Like... ok, great, good start—and then what? Feminism is just an idea, an ideology, not a fully-constructed narrative. Each story just felt like a rough sketch of something and each ended in an anticlimax.Thankfully the story that I enjoyed the most was the longest one—the novella-length Once, Future, a meta retelling of Le Morte D’Arthur. I thought this one was fun, at least: I think Howard's strength is plot, which is why it was frustrating to see so little of it across these stories. I don't think she excels at theme, atmosphere, or descriptive writing, and that's pretty much all these stories purportedly have going for them.This just wasn't at all what I expected it to be. It clearly works well for the right reader, so if it interests you at all I'd absolutely encourage you to read a sample and see what you make of the writing style, but I just didn't get on with it at all and I hope Marija forgives me....more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"Jan 09, 2022","Jan 29, 2022","Dec 03, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36144557-a-cathedral-of-myth-and-bone

Mercifully it was nothing of the sort, and it was in fact nothing at all like I was expecting, but I was utterly enchanted by it.The Friend follows an unnamed narrator whose best friend has just committed suicide, and in the midst of processing her own grief she's entreated to look after her friend's dog, a massive Great Dane. Animals aren't allowed in her rent controlled Manhattan apartment, but she feels a certain loyalty to this dog which won't allow her to give him up. But the plot itself is never really the focus; this is instead a philosophical book that mainly uses its premise as backdrop for its thematic conceits, and admittedly I understand why that doesn't work for a lot of readers, and why The Friend has been a divisive read, but my god did I love it.This book is filled with beautifully crafted sentences (more understated than lyrical) that meditate on certain questions about grief and loss and friendship and writing that plague the narrator. Unable to make sense of her friend's sudden death, she's encouraged by her therapist to write about it (does writing actually help us process grief - another question interrogated by the narrator throughout the novel), and the result is the book that the reader is holding. At times I had to keep reminding myself this wasn't a memoir; the verisimilitude of the narrative voice was eerie, she'd mention a certain article she once wrote and I'd think 'that sounds interesting, I'll have to look that up' before remembering this was all fictional. The integration of literary allusions, another element that I think may vex certain readers with its frequency, I thought was done in a wonderfully authentic way, and the various writers mentioned gave me a good sense of how this character interacted with the world. I just thoroughly loved this, and though it brought me to tears at one point, it certainly isn't a 'weepy dog book,' so if that's what's been keeping you away from this one I'd highly encourage you to give it a try - provided that you don't mind your novels heavier on philosophy than plot. There's also an ingeniously executed twist(?) in the penultimate chapter that allows you to read the entire book in one of two ways, and ambiguous endings (when done well) are always my favorites.

She is eventually confronted by this stranger, who entreats Sasha to wake up at 4 am every morning, go to the beach, take off all her clothes, and swim to a buoy and back. She reluctantly agrees to this strange task, and as soon as she's back on shore that first morning, she starts to vomit gold coins.Thus begins the wildly unconventional journey that the Dyachenkos take the reader on in Vita Nostra, which has safely earned its distinction as the most unorthodox book I have ever read. This doesn't follow any kind of narrative formula that will be familiar to many western readers - it's bizarrely lacking in conflict, resolution, plot twists, and structure. But it's also the most singular and enchanting and darkly horrifying book I have ever read.Honestly, the marketing team has my sympathy for this one, because I don't think I've ever read another book that so staunchly defies categorization. There are recognizable elements from traditional coming of age novels, but it isn't a bildungsroman; there are hints and whispers of magic but it isn't really fantasy; there are some classic Magical School tropes but it isn't remotely comparable to Harry Potter; and it's filled to the brim with philosophical references but its maddeningly esoteric approach is strangely alienating even to readers who are interested in its central themes. A large part of this book is just stumbling blindly alongside Sasha and waiting for everything to be made clear, which it never really is. It's proving to be quite the challenge to explain what the appeal exactly is of a book like this, and I fully accept that this isn't going to be for everyone. This isn't really for readers who need to be entertained by plot or readers who need to be invested in complex character dynamics. This is more for the readers drawn equally to a compelling atmosphere and big ideas; readers who are both thrilled and terrified at the idea that their own worldview is more limited than they ever could have imagined. This book mesmerized me from the very first page and proved to be the most unexpected reading experience I've ever had. At times it's frustrating and incomprehensible but never for a single moment does it fail to stimulate.

Gregory Blake On the whole I was so impressed by The Maze at Windermere that I can't help but to forgive the moments where it failed to captivate me. Gregory Blake Smith has created something that's an absolute masterclass of storytelling - he weaves together seemingly unrelated plotlines (all centered in Newport Rhode Island) from 2011, 1896, 1863, 1778 and 1692 in ways both subtle and forthright, and the precision with which he manages this is feat is undeniable.But the stories themselves from each timeline vary in the level of engagement they offer. To my surprise, I fell head over heels in love with the 2011 plot, which follows the strange friendship between a nearly retired tennis pro, Sandy, and an heiress with cerebral palsy. This unconventional socialite, Alice, has to be one of the most vivid characters I have ever read; I couldn't get her out of my head when I was reading this book and I still can't now that I've finished. I loved everything about their odd dynamic and tumultuous, melodramatic, tragic relationship. This motivations of a secondary character in this storyline also provides the book with one of its greatest sources of intrigue which goes on to feed into a positively spectacular ambiguous ending that I can't talk about without spoiling. But, it was perfection. Unfortunately, all of the past timelines paled in comparison. 1896 follows a gay man who's attempting to marry into high society; 1863 follows a fictionalization of Henry James, an overt nod to the thematic parallels to Daisy Miller that litter the different narratives; 1778 follows a British officer during the American Revolution (I found him the most tiresome); and 1692 follows a newly orphaned Quaker girl. Each of these narratives had moments of searing brilliance, but at the same time, none of them was able to offer the same emotional draw as the present-day storyline.That said, the structure of this book is nothing short of a delight for readers who enjoy riddles and puzzles and similar literary exercises. I'm almost definitely going to want to re-read this at some point after I've read Daisy Miller, because I feel like I've only barely scratched the surface. ...more",Notes are private!,0,40,1,"Dec 10, 2018","Dec 30, 2018","Nov 12, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34962936-the-maze-at-windermere

From the fact that every paragraph ends in some kind of pithy aphorism of the author's making, Tom McAllister clearly thinks he has something to say in this novel. Unfortunately that 'something' rarely amounted to anything more than ""The idea of hiding underground for a few years until everything got better was appealing. That's why groundhogs looked so happy.""The central concept is a salient one and one that hits close to home - that you're never truly safe in a society with lax gun restrictions, and suffice to say that as an American living in 2018, gun control is something I feel extremely strongly about. But there is nothing worthwhile in this book that actively contributes to that conversation, this has nothing to offer aside from being topical. This reads as a 200-something page indictment of modern gun laws; no plot, no character development, no commentary that actually forces the reader to consider anything in a new light. No comedy that actually hits its mark, no hard-hitting moments to punctuate the tedium. I'm sure you all know by now that unlikable characters (unlikable female characters in particular) make for some of my all-time favorite protagonists, but it's like the character of Anna was constructed just to be as abhorrent as possible with no other goal in mind. I also found the constant commentary on womanhood to be incredibly disingenuous coming from a male author, when half of the statements rang false anyway. I'm just not sure why McAllister purports to have the authority to let us know that ""Women can wound each other in ways men can never imagine.""Also, full disclosure here - I listened to the audiobook which is never my favorite format, and the narrator sounding like a telephone operator didn't help matters.

What a beautiful book.The End of Loneliness, translated from the German by Charlotte Collins, follows three siblings growing up in Munich, whose parents die in a car accident, leaving them orphaned and forced to attend boarding school. The focus is on Jules, the youngest sibling, who's more of an observer than a participant in his own life; after his parents' death he turns inward and fixates on a parallel narrative that he's crafted of what his life would have been like had they survived. At boarding school he meets Alva, another loner who he's able to connect with as he and his siblings grow apart, but after school they lose touch and Jules is once more on his own.With a focus on the complex dynamics between the three siblings, Benedict Wells deftly explores the ripple effect of loss and grief. He also plays with the fallibility of memory in a way that recalls Kazuo Ishiguro, as Jules is recounting events from his childhood years later, and eventually certain cracks begin to form in his carefully curated narrative that suggest he may have chosen to remember certain events in a way that was convenient to him. This is a deeply melancholy book that gives little respite in its misery, but I found its emotional honesty refreshing. And with Jules' retrospective narration, the grief discussed feels more like a bruise than an open wound (it's a painful book to read, but not as visceral as something like A Little Life). It did bring me to tears at one point, but it wasn't the kind of painful that I lost sleep over; it's more of a quiet kind of haunting that slowly seeps under your skin.My one criticism is that the end gets a bit twee and Wells insists on wrapping everything up a bit too neatly; maybe he's playing with the idea that one of the characters floats around, that life is a zero-sum game; maybe he thinks his characters have all suffered enough to have earned a neat ending. But as a reader I ironically feel less fulfilled with the more closure I get, so I would have preferred things to end on a slightly more somber note. 4.5 stars - rounded down for now but maybe I'll change it depending on how this stays with me.Also - my advice going into this book is to avoid reading the Goodreads summary if possible (or maybe just read the first paragraph), as it essentially gives a paint by numbers account of the entire plot. It's not that I felt spoiled while reading - it's more driven by character than plot anyway - but it's just unnecessary to give that much away when the book is less than 300 pages to begin with.Thank you to Netgalley and Penguin Books for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,57,1,"Jan 05, 2019","Jan 09, 2019","Nov 07, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40265079-the-end-of-loneliness

Fans of Laura Purcell and Sarah Waters, get on this! Correct me if I’m wrong but I don’t think this book ever got a US publisher; it’s a shame, as there is certainly a huge market for this kind of atmospheric British historical fiction over here — a market that is indeed so oversaturated that it’s only natural for some real gems like this to slip through the cracks.Sort of a slow burn coming of age story à la Jane Eyre meets a modernized Gothic horror novel like The Silent Companions, House of Glass follows Clara, a young woman with osteogenesis imperfecta living in London with her stepfather in the wake of her mother’s death in 1914. She becomes entranced with gardening and is eventually summoned to a manor in Gloucestershire with the task of curating a private greenhouse for the eccentric, frequently absent owner. This is the first time Clara has really left home or done anything on her own given the limitations that her disorder has caused in her life, so it’s partially a novel about Clara finding her way in the world; and it’s also partially a Gothic mystery as Clara attempts to uncover the secrets of Shadowbrook manor.Again, this novel is quite the slow burn; the mystery element isn’t even introduced until partway through; you do spend quite a bit of time on Clara’s childhood and background. But I do think that ultimately serves the themes of the story quite nicely so I don’t think that’s a negative at all; I just want to firmly clarify that this is a mystery novel much more than it is any kind of thriller.Susan Fletcher’s writing is strong, her characters are brilliantly crafted, and she interacts with tropes and archetypes from the classics — Jane Eyre, Rebecca, Northanger Abbey — in such a deliberate way, I was really won over by how cleverly constructed this book was. It’s certainly a fun and gripping read on the one hand, but its literary merit shouldn’t be underestimated.

As long as these individuals can receive medical care and be fed intravenously they are in no immediate danger, but the more people who fall prey to the highly contagious sickness, the more difficult it becomes to look after the sick. This is a mesmerizing character-driven novel. Station Eleven is going to be brought up frequently in conversation with The Dreamers, and I know that comparing books to other books can get tedious but in this case it's with good reason. Emily St. John Mandel's influence can clearly be seen on the construction of The Dreamers, with its omniscient narration flitting between a panoply of characters who are all affected by the sickness all in different ways, their narratives occasionally intersecting but each with its own distinct arc. But Karen Thompson Walker's novel is not without its own unique spin - the disease is much more contained than the one that devastates civilization in Station Eleven, and consequently this isn't so much a survival novel as it is a novel interested in examining its central concept - sleeping, dreaming - through lenses of disparate psychologies and philosophies and sciences, which all come together to tell a story that's as thought-provoking as it is readable.The only reason I'm dropping this to 4 stars is that there was a bit too much 'isn't childbirth miraculous aren't babies astonishing' in a few of the characters' narratives and it got to be a bit much for me, but that's strictly a personal preference. Everything else I adored. Karen Thompson Walker's writing is both assured and understated in the best possible way, and the way she builds tension is just spectacular. I could not put this book down.

But the similarities to Station Eleven or Bird Box end there, because what Ling Ma does with Severance is fuse the post-apocalyptic survival genre with anti-capitalist satire, and it works almost startlingly well.Both wry and meditative, Severance offers a positively haunting commentary on corporate greed and what that means for the individual, and that awful paradox of being trapped inside a system that you feel guilty having any part of. The fictional Shen Fever was pretty awful; rather than offering a quick death it would essentially turn people into zombies who performed rote tasks ad infinitum - it's heavy-handed but it works - but the most horrifying part of this novel was probably how much of the directionless millennial narrative resonated, and the amount of decisions these characters had to make at the detriment of their happiness just to survive, both before and after.I did think the book's structure could have been more cohesive as a whole, and I felt like Ling Ma didn't really know what she wanted to do with the ending, but ultimately I loved this strong and unexpected debut.

MichaeCountry is the most literal Iliad retelling I’ve ever read, which came as a surprise given that its premise is worlds away from Ancient Greece. Michael Hughes’s interpretation is set in 1990s Northern Ireland, twenty-five years into the conflict known as the Troubles, and yet despite the wildly different setting it hits all the same beats as Homer’s tale, each scene and character a perfect mirror to the original story, and easy to identify with names like Achill (Achilles), Nellie (Helen), Henry (Hector), and Pat (Patroclus).This level of faithfulness was a double-edged sword for me: it led to moments of brilliance and moments that were a little too on the nose. Mostly brilliance, so let's start there: the decision to adapt the Iliad to the Troubles was an inspired one, a pairing linked by the tragedy of lives lost needlessly to a cause whose rhetoric is shrouded in talk of honor, but whose reality is starker and more senseless. This passage in particular as the Hector figure, a war-weary SAS man, is on the verge of death called to mind a passage from the Iliad that hits home its driving thematic conceit:""The fucking spooks, the fucking politicians. Moving the pieces on the board, doling out life or death with a flick of the wrist. Not one of them was in harm's way. Not one of them could ever die this death. He was charged to defend their will, their country's honour, but all he could ever defend was his own life. It wasn't their blood on the road. It never would be. They didn't understand.No. They understood. They didn't care.""- Michael Hughes, Country""So the immortals spun our lives that we, we wretched men live on to bear such torments—the gods live free of sorrows.""- Homer, The Iliad, translated by Robert FaglesUsed as a pawn by gods in one case and government and/or paramilitary leaders in the other, the individual lives affected amidst the brutality are the focus of both texts, and Hughes capitalizes on the opportunity to tell this story with the abject tragedy it deserves.And overarching themes aside, the level of detail here is just delightful for Homer fans: the SAS base is called Illiam because the W fell off the William Castle sign; the IRA pub is referred to as 'The Ships' in reference to the Greeks' camp outside the walls of Troy.However, there were some bits that didn’t translate perfectly: Achill’s widely accepted irreplaceability felt shoehorned in - the role of the individual in modern-day warfare just isn’t perfectly equitable with ancient battle. And a few scenes felt like they were only there in the name of keeping the structure as close to the Iliad as possible - I wouldn't have minded, for example, the omission of a few scenes like the funeral games (which went into a level of detail that was admirably authentic but frankly excessive) in favor of adding a bit more heft to the weightier scenes like Achill's confrontation with the Priam character. I was very cognizant as I was reading that this wasn’t going to be an easy book to recommend; it’s not, so to speak, baby’s first Troubles book. You don’t exactly need a PhD in Irish History to be able to follow this, but I do want to be clear that almost none of the dialect (which Hughes renders beautifully) or cultural references are explained or contextualized (read Say Nothing first!). I'd actually stress that an interest in the Iliad is much less essential to get something out of this than knowing a bit about the Troubles. Still, for the right reader this is a sharp and cleverly written retelling whose literality is an asset more often than not. Though it did strike me that I may, ironically, be a bit too familiar with the Iliad to be this book's ideal reader....more",Notes are private!,1,46,1,"Jun 03, 2019","Jun 16, 2019","Oct 31, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40378225-country

(I think the less you know going into this book the better, so I'll just leave it there.) I imagine that Lock Every Door's pace will be the main drawback for some - our protagonist Jules does play amateur detective to no avail for about half the book - but with the way Sager writes, she probably could have been playing a game of chess and I'd have been equally as thrilled.And no spoilers, but I loved that ending. I imagine it's also going to divide opinions, as it's not the most... conventional thriller resolution, but I thought it hit that perfect sweet spot of 'I really should have thought of that, but I never would have thought of that.' In my opinion this isn't as strong as Sager's debut Final Girls (which is pretty hard to beat), but I liked it a lot better than his follow-up effort The Last Time I Lied. I found Lock Every Door to be creepier and more original, and its protagonist more convincing. I do think Final Girls and The Last Time I Lied are more traditional crowd-pleasers, so maybe stick to one of those for an introduction to Sager, but I loved this; this is the most fun I've had with a thriller in ages....more",Notes are private!,0,45,1,"Jul 17, 2019","Jul 17, 2019","Oct 31, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42368604-lock-every-door

I wouldn’t say there’s anything ostensibly wrong with this book, and it’s not exactly a radical departure from the rest of See’s historical fiction: it follows a friendship between two women against the backdrop of a turbulent period in East Asian history (though here the setting is the Korean Jeju Island instead of See’s usual China).But despite the tried and true blueprint whose familiarity should have been comforting, I really struggled to get invested in The Island of Sea Women. I think my main issue was with the protagonist, Young-sook (whose name I just had to look up even though I finished this book only two days ago, so that’s never a good sign). Young-sook and her best friend Mi-ja are haenyeo – female divers – and See’s exploration of this culture is as thorough as ever. However, Young-sook herself makes no particular impression, and I think it’s mostly down to how anemically drawn her character is: she’s a model haenyeo, so she loves being a haenyeo; she’s meant to desire marriage and children, so she desires marriage and children; she’s meant to honor her family, so she honors her family. She’s a collection of cultural values rather than a distinct person – a pitfall that I think See gracefully avoids with the protagonists of each of her other novels that I’ve read. I don’t ordinarily feel that she needs to sacrifice character development to establish historical context, but sadly I did here.About 60% through the book, during a scene of a horrifying and brutal massacre, See’s decision to tell this story through Young-sook’s eyes finally, finally made narrative sense to me, but up until that point, I had been wondering why the focus hadn’t been on Mi-ja – an infinitely more interesting character for the ways in which she didn’t fit as neatly into the society in which she was raised. Their friendship is competently portrayed, but it’s missing a spark for me that I felt in so many of her other books, notably Snow Flower and the Secret Fan and Shanghai Girls.And I think that’s the word I keep coming back to when I think about this book: it’s competent. It’s a great crash course in Jeju history for those of us who weren’t already familiar with the island. It’s an occasionally heart-wrenching story about loss and the inability to forgive. It’s just not spectacular, and it never quite gains the momentum needed for the most brutal scene to make as much of an impact as it should have.All said, I liked this book but I didn’t love it, but I undoubtedly should have pushed myself through the rocky beginning rather than dragging this reading experience out for three months; and everyone else seems to adore it, so I’d encourage you to give it a shot if it interests you. But if you’re looking for somewhere to start with Lisa See, Snow Flower and the Secret Fan and Shanghai Girls remain my go-to recommendations.Thank you to Netgalley and Scribner for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,2,68,1,"Feb 25, 2019","Jun 28, 2019","Oct 27, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40538657-the-island-of-sea-women

So it was with optimism that I approached her short story collection Homesick for Another World - I was looking forward to more delightfully awful antiheroines and sardonic humor and a heightened awareness of the mundane. Be careful what you wish for, I guess?What made Eileen's titular protagonist and My Year of Rest and Relaxation's unnamed narrator so fascinating wasn't just the fact that they weren't particularly likable people; their thorny exteriors were a result of two distinct tragic backstories, whose ramifications Moshfegh deftly explored throughout the course of each novel. It turns out that bite-sized stories about awful characters doing awful things and thinking awful thoughts are so much less interesting when their behavior isn't rationalized or contextualized in that same way. Reading story after story about humanity's capacity for cruelty starts to feel like a shtick after a while, like a party trick that's worn out its welcome. It's easy to become desensitized when you feel like the author's main objective is to shock you.Two stories stood out to me: The Beach Boy follows an older married couple returning from an island vacation, only for the wife to die unexpectedly as soon as they arrive home. Unpalatable as this couple may be, like all of Moshfegh's protagonists, we actually are able to get invested in them before the story takes a turn for the macabre. And A Better Place ends the collection on a positively eerie note, telling the story of two young twins who are convinced that they weren't born on earth, and to get back to that other place, they need to either die or kill someone. I think it speaks volumes that the best story in the collection is the one that's least like the others; A Better Place is wildly inventive and not quite as grounded in gritty realism as the others, but still dark and twisted and more haunting than the rest of the stories combined.That's two out of fourteen that made an impression on me. The rest honestly just blend together. Moshfegh has such a unique voice as a writer that shines through all of the stories in this collection, but rather than bringing me the same kind of offbeat joy as her two novels, this collection just started to make me miserable after a while. Apparently my average rating for all these stories was 2.7 stars, but I'm rounding down due to the dread I felt about picking this back up when I wasn't reading it. I'm still going to read everything Moshfegh writes... I'm just hoping for more novels from now on....more",Notes are private!,0,59,1,Jan 2019,"Jan 16, 2019","Oct 24, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/32726388-homesick-for-another-world

The main word I'd use to describe this deceptively short book is tedious - though Vonnegut hits his mark with the humor more often than not, the meandering, repetitive style gets old, and even the once-funny jokes start to become stale. It's also the kind of classic that hasn't aged well, at all; jokes about dwarfism and sexist remarks abound - it's inevitably going to induce more than a few cringes from the modern reader.So, why 4 stars? Because it's fascinating and smart as hell. This novel is filled to the brim with intriguing, relevant, timeless ideas: how religion adapts to suit the needs of the people, conceptions of social identity and what it means to belong to a group, the paradoxical role of science in how it's used by humanity - both for medicine and for warfare. The interplay between science and religion in this novel is done so well, as is the bizarre fusion of absurdity and realism. This was my first Vonnegut, and I can't help but to think I would have enjoyed his work a bit more if I'd read it when I was a teenager, but it was every bit as thought-provoking as I'd been led to believe and I'll certainly be looking into reading more of his works at some point. ...more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,"Oct 22, 2018","Oct 31, 2018","Oct 22, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/386411.Cat_s_Cradle

Instead, The Housekeeper and the Professor is utterly and unapologetically charming.It focuses on the relationship between a housekeeper, her son, and a man whose house she's assigned to by her agency, who she refers to only as 'the Professor.' The Professor has a condition which prevents him from creating new memories - his memory lasts only 80 minutes. He is nevertheless a brilliant man, and the likewise unnamed protagonist becomes increasingly spellbound by his unsolicited mathematical lectures.There are any number of reasons why this book shouldn't have worked for me; it's sweet in tone, it's about math, it's about baseball. I don't like any of these things. However, this book's passion is positively infectious; this was like listening to a friend tell a story about something they love which you don't particularly care about - sometimes regardless of the content, the enthusiasm itself is contagious. Also, I will say that this book helped me understand the sentiment that 'math is like poetry,' that I've heard a few times throughout my life, better than anything else ever has. No matter how many times I've witnessed an individual's passion for math, it's always seemed to me like this cold and rigid thing, but The Professor's perspective on the relationship between numbers, and the solace he takes in their familiarity, really moved me.But beyond the math and baseball, what makes this quirky book near-universally appealing is the unconventional, infinitely touching relationship between the two titular characters. The Housekeeper and the Professor is about empathy; it's a testament to the unexpected possibilities of human connection. I just found this book to be a joy to read - quiet and subtle and nostalgic and affecting.

I never reach for celebrity memoirs, less out of literary snobbery and more because the celebrities I'm invested in do not usually write memoirs. But I am a fan of Busy Philipps so I thought why not, let's give it a try.Busy states early on in her book that she's a natural-born storyteller, that she knows when to embellish and when to omit details to keep her audience compelled, and I have to agree. What this book lacks (which I'll get to in a moment), she makes up for with an immense skill at honing in on what exactly makes an anecdote worth sharing. Whether it was dislocating her knee after being trampled at a school concert by eighth grade boys moshing to Nirvana, or confronting the creator of Modern Family years after he made a rude comment about Busy winning a Critics Choice Award for Cougar Town, she knows how to keep her reader hooked. As I've talked about before, I'm not the best audiobook listener, but I don't think my mind wandered once while listening to this, and I managed to finish it in a week (which is probably a record for me with audiobooks). Even the least exciting of anecdotes were far from boring, because Busy manages to convince you that the stakes are always much, much higher than they actually are (with an occasional tongue-in-cheek acknowledgement that maybe she was a bit melodramatic given the circumstances, but in the moment the minor calamity did feel like the end of the world).But the introspection didn't go much further than that, which is my biggest issue with this book. The writing itself wasn't great but I assume that's par for the course with this kind of memoir, so I won't dwell on that. What bothered me more was the constant self-absorption and how it was never met with adequate reflection. Though she certainly faced hardships and I don't want to dismiss that, for the most part Busy Philipps has lived a rather privileged life, which she really only acknowledges once toward the end of the book, when she wonders why she's dreading going on a paid Disney cruise that her mother arranged when so many people would kill for that opportunity. There's a weird kind of dissonance between the persona that Busy has crafted on Instagram (being down to earth and relatable) and the extravagant life that she lives in Hollywood, and it's never really addressed. I mean, of course celebrities aren't our friends, of course the lives of the rich and famous are never going to be perfect reflections of our own; it's just the lack of awareness of that fact throughout this memoir that grated. I don't think for a second that Busy is ungrateful for the life she leads, but I do think her gratitude is something that never fully translated to this text. Ultimately I'd really only recommend this one to fans of Busy, or to anyone who really enjoys celebrity memoirs in general. I don't see this book winning Busy many fans who hadn't already been familiar with her work and her persona, but for those of us who enjoy her, it certainly didn't fail to entertain. It just... didn't do much else. And though I consistently enjoyed it, I ended it feeling vaguely dissatisfied as its anecdotal nature left many questions unanswered (did Busy stay close to Michelle after Heath's death, how is her relationship with Marc after counseling, did Busy look back on her teenage abortion when she was pregnant with her daughters, how did the people and the stories she talked about early on come to shape her later in life). But it was a fun, entertaining read, and sometimes that's all you can ask of a book. 3.5 stars...more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Jan 18, 2019","Jan 25, 2019","Oct 18, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40598936-this-will-only-hurt-a-little

Probably because, as my friend Hannah so aptly put it in her own , this book was not written for me. But that's what was so admirable about it. Kiese Laymon states clearly in the prologue to his memoir that he has no intention of writing a sanitized, palatable version of events; it's almost painful in its honesty but it's for this reason that I think this book is so crucial and necessary (especially for non-black readers).Heavy is Laymon's visceral and fearless attempt at reckoning with a number of issues that have plagued him his entire life - his relationship with his mother whose uncompromising expectations for her son often resulted in abuse, his fraught relationship with his own body, addiction, trauma, poverty, education, masculinity, and ultimately what it means to be black in America. The honesty and nuance with which he examines anecdotes from his childhood, even more than the anecdotes themselves, make this an unforgettable read.(4 stars instead of 5 because ratings are subjective and I never ever end up connecting with audiobooks as well as when I'm reading printed text, which isn't to say that Kiese Laymon did a bad job with the narration - on the contrary he was a joy to listen to - but I'm just not an auditory person.

Janice Galloway seamlessly depicts the virtual impossibility of functioning while grieving; how it creeps into every facet of your life and renders you a shell of yourself. But at the same time, this story quickly graduates past its initial premise: it's clear that the ironically named Joy was never really fine, that the existential dread she's experiencing was always there beneath the surface, that her lover's death only served to unearth it.It's hard to believe this is a debut novel, as Galloway's prose is so accomplished and her insights so sharp. It's also a rather experimental novel, especially for 1989, playing with fonts types and sizes and margins, its stream of consciousness style taken to stylistic extremes.

However, it was still a 5 star read for me ( here), and with Kuang's assertions on Twitter that The Dragon Republic was an objectively superior book, I was still cautiously optimistic about the sequel. And I didn't hate it, but I'm disappointed.Pacing is an issue in both of these books; in The Poppy War, things happen too fast; it feels like two books crammed into one. But I really didn't mind that - I read a lot of literary fiction, so when I venture into genre fiction it's with entirely different expectations and needs to be met - I like a bit of nonstop action in my fantasy as long as it doesn't get too overwhelming, which I don't think it did. But with The Dragon Republic the issue is the exact opposite. Nothing - and I cannot stress this enough - happens for the first three quarters of this book. Where The Poppy War feels like two books for the price of one, The Dragon Republic feels like a novella stretched out thin across 500 pages. Things of course do happen, technically, but there is so much filler. Stakes feel low (a problem that The Poppy War certainly did not have), because for the major part of this book, it feels like you're spinning your wheels and still waiting for the main players to enter the ring.But let's talk about what I did like: the characters and the setting are some of my favorites from any fantasy series that I have ever read. The returning characters are as complex, endearing, and frustrating as ever, and the new characters shine as well - Vaisra in particular is a brilliant creation. And if The Dragon Republic has one thing that's superior to The Poppy War, it's the world building and the magic system, which is infinitely more fleshed out here with some truly fascinating developments. It took me three months to read this, but I want to stress that every time I did pick it up, I enjoyed it. The issue is that I just seldom reached for it. I really hope this is just second book syndrome, and I do think one thing that Kuang was able to achieve with this book was laying a really solid foundation for whatever is to come next (and with that ending, I can promise you that the third book is going to destroy me). But even though I would still recommend this series wholeheartedly, this just wasn't as good as The Poppy War, much as it pains me to say it.Thank you to Netgalley and Harper Voyager for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,"May 16, 2019","Aug 07, 2019","Oct 05, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41118857-the-dragon-republic

One day in Havana she thinks she sees her husband standing outside a museum and she decides to follow him. Much surrealism and existential angst ensues.I think my biggest issue with The Third Hotel was that I did not feel the slightest emotional connection to this story. I really don't need to feel an emotional pull to every single thing I read - I am happy for something to appeal to me on a more intellectual level if that's what the author is trying to achieve - but when a book is about something as intensely personal as grief, I want to feel... something? Sad or unsettled or moved in some way? Anything other than bored.But this book's darkly sardonic and disaffected tone just left me cold, and didn't give me enough to chew on that I put it down feeling intellectually stimulated enough to compensate for the emotional hollowness. Laura van den Berg certainly has some interesting ideas, but unfortunately none of them are developed past their infancy. The ruminations on the role of the traveler and the tension between the internal and external selves in particular had the potential to be intriguing - and I also liked the commentary on horror films - but I'm sorry to say that for the most part this was just tedious and lacking in focus....more",Notes are private!,0,41,1,"Nov 27, 2018","Dec 05, 2018","Oct 03, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36348514-the-third-hotel

It is not often the case that I look at glowing s and think 'did we read the same book?!' but here we are... I was Oh man, this is a tough one. It is not often the case that I look at glowing s and think 'did we read the same book?!' but here we are... I was convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that I was going to love this, too! When All Is Said is a contemporary Irish novel about an old man named Maurice who's looking back at his life and giving a toast to the five people who had the greatest influence on him, most of whom are already dead. So it's a premise that promises nostalgia and regret and heartache, but I never really felt any of it.My main issue with this book was Maurice's first-person narration - I just wasn't convinced by his voice. Forgive me, but you know how sometimes you read a female character and think 'yep, a man wrote this book' - I felt the opposite here. (Which is more of a gut feeling and probably a baseless one that's impossible to quantify, so I'm just going to move on.) It's established early on in this book that Maurice has dyslexia which led him to quit schooling at a very early age and develop a lifelong antipathy for literature; instead he fills his days with farming and various other business ventures. So while Maurice is clearly an intelligent man, and I have no qualms with that intelligence being on display, I'm not sure why Anne Griffin wanted us to believe he was a poetic one? Lines like this:But her story is like the wind under the front door, whistling its way through the crevices, getting through the cracks in my skin.and this:There was a love but of the Irish kind, reserved and embarrassed by its own humanity.pulled me out of the story again and again, because why would this 84 year old farmer use that simile, why would he have that sophisticated emotional vocabulary? I guess this goes hand in hand, but what also grated on me was the fact that we were essentially spoon-fed the ways in which the love and loss of these five characters shaped Maurice. Take this passage from the first chapter, where Maurice describes the death of his older brother Tony:It's so hard to lose your best friend at any time, but to do so at such a young age was pure cruel. At sixteen I was heading into my life. Having travelled those precious years with Tony by my side, I now had to venture forth into the most significant of them alone. Without his guidance, his cajoling, his slagging. It didn't feel possible.It's too articulate, it's too on the nose. Funny that this is called 'When All Is Said,' because that was exactly my problem: nothing is left unsaid. There is no room for the reader to think or feel anything organically, because we are told exactly how we should think and feel about Maurice's story. This was missing tension, nuance, thematic complexity. I'll concede that Maurice is a well-constructed character, and that Anne Griffin makes a real effort to weave together moments of joy with moments of sorrow to paint a three-dimensional picture of this character's life, I just felt utterly empty while reading this.Thanks to Netgalley and Thomas Dunne Books for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest .

So, the reason I requested this book is because its summary reminded me of a This has to be one of the most bizarrely terrible things I've ever read. So, the reason I requested this book is because its summary reminded me of a film I like, The Riot Club, which is based off a play I like, Posh by Laura Wade. It's an ugly story, one that examines the kind of privilege and entitlement and classism and toxic masculinity inherent to elite dining clubs. These are all themes that interest me, and I suppose they must also interest Takis Wurger, but they couldn't have been presented in a more shallow or superficial way in this book if he tried. Characters are caricatures, conflict is nonexistent, the writing is dreadful and perfunctory, the point of view shifts are awkward, and the treatment of its subject matter is appalling. So, let's begin!The Club follows Hans, a German orphan whose aunt Alex contacts him out of the blue when he turns 18 and promises to secure him a place at Cambridge, where she works as a professor in art history, but in return he has to investigate the Pitt Club, an all-male dining club who have committed some kind of crime. There will be some spoilers in the rest of this , which I try to avoid but frankly I don't care because I wouldn't wish this book on anyone else, but if you don't want to spoiled, quit this  while you're ahead. So, it's revealed about halfway through that the crime being investigated is rape, and this is handled... about as crudely as humanly possible (also, trigger warnings for the rest of this  as well as for the book). Aside from the fact that Hans' main source of internal conflict comes from whether he should betray the rapists who have become his friends (my heart goes out to you dude, must be real tough), and culminates in a positively absurd scene where Hans is debating whether or not he should allow a drugged girl to be raped in order to obtain damning evidence of the club before overcoming his moral quandary by scooping her up and running out the door with her (never mind the other girls who have been left behind at that party?!), we also have an utterly senseless relationship between Hans and Charlotte, one of the Pitt Club's former victims, which is treated with all the nuance and sensitivity that this sentence would suggest: ""I couldn't stop thinking about how wounded she had seemed when she told me about being raped. I wondered what it meant for us."" Yes, seriously. And even if we can look past the fact that the entire premise hinges on a man getting justice for a woman being raped, which is a narrative that just... needs to end, period, the way it's handled is so clumsy. Like, at one point, Hans grabs Charlotte's arm and she tells him off because she'd promised herself she'd never let a man touch her without her permission again... good! But then later, she apologizes to him for that?! Wurger goes to great pains to remind us that poor orphaned Hans is the real victim in all this.And aside from all that, it's just... bad? It's mostly told from Hans' perspective, but other POVs are thrown in and not a single one of them furthers the narrative. We hear from other members of the club who talk like... well, like this: ""Basically, I was living proof that money, a place at Cambridge, and a big dick don't make you happy. Fuck."" We hear from Alex, who just... weirdly rehashes conversations that we'd JUST read from Hans' perspective. We hear from Charlotte, who you'd think had accidentally slammed her finger in a car door for all the impact a traumatic assault had on her. We hear from a Chinese student named Peter who's obsessed with gaining entry to the club at all costs, and I guess he was also friends with Charlotte at one point but I'm not sure why that detail was included as it's never mentioned again? None of it amounts to anything - some of these characters have arcs, others do not, but nothing is resolved except for the mystery of who raped Charlotte, which is never really a mystery at all (I'll give you a hint: he has a big dick and he's unhappy).And even Hans is a generic non-entity of a character. This is the kind of insight that Hans would regularly treat us to: ""I didn't listen to music; I jogged without music, boxed without music. There'd been music at my parents' funeral."" There'd been music at his parents' funeral so he could never listen to music again????? There'd also been clothes as his parents' funeral, I'd assume?! (Also, his parents didn't die at the same time, meaning they would have had multiple funerals, but I'm hoping that was just a typo.) And also: ""Charlotte fell asleep on my elbow. After my parents' death I'd thought I could never love again, because the fear of losing someone was too great. I had grown cold inside. Now here was this woman, lying on my arm."" Cliche after cliche after cliche. This book just... has nothing at all to say. It wants to be edgy and groundbreaking and enlightening but it is just so painfully vapid in every conceivable way.I mean, it's quick and readable, I'll give it that, but my god, at what cost.

I think this Purge was my introduction to Sofi Oksanen and, in fact, my introduction to Finnish lit in general (Oksanen herself is Finnish-Estonian). I think this is a fascinating, flawed, and surprising book; it both delivers what it claims to on the blurb, and also takes the story in a direction that I was not at all expecting. Set in twentieth century Estonia, Purge follows the lives of two women, Aliide and Zara; Aliide is an older woman living alone in a remote Estonian village, and Zara is a young sex trafficking victim who shows up on her doorstep one day. The novel explores the relationship and the secret connection between the two women - this much I was expecting from the summary - but their relationship is almost backdrop to Oksanen's unflinching examination of Soviet occupation.If Purge has one major flaw, it has to be its momentum, or lack thereof. The first hundred pages which chronicle Aliide discovering Zara on her doorstep are almost entirely unnecessary (and I found the coda rather excessive as well). It's only in Part 2 when the story makes a radical time jump backward to Aliide's childhood do the wheels really start turning. But even then, a rather baffling and almost Victor Hugo-esque inclusion of chapter titles insists on neutering the impact of several key moments by announcing their arrival before you even begin the chapter. I won't include examples so as to not spoil anything, but while I appreciated the effect at first, it grew wearisome. I do wonder if this is a convention of Finnish publishing or an offbeat choice on Oksanen's part.But all that said, once you get into the meat of this book, it has a lot to offer. Aliide is a brilliantly crafted character - shades of Atonement litter her narrative, though Purge is an altogether messier affair - and the relentless description of Soviet occupation in Estonia strongly evokes a time and a place that I previously knew almost nothing of. And it's less a story about these two women - Aliide and Zara - coming together, than a commentary on the unending injustices faced by women in modern history. It's a stark, bleak book that won't have much to offer to anyone who needs levity or a protagonist to root for, but I found it very striking - I doubt it's a book I will be forgetting in a hurry....more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,"Aug 14, 2019","Aug 20, 2019","Aug 27, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7029668-purge

This is what I was hoping Educated was going to be; the difference for me is that Maude Julien seems to have an appropriate amount of distance and perspective from her horrifying past, whereas Tara Westover's story still felt too close to allow for much analysis. The Only Girl in the World certainly is description-heavy, and it's not until you head into the home stretch that you see the ways in which her childhood impacted the person she was to become, but it's well worth the wait, especially in seeing how her feelings toward her mother shift over time.

Apparently my average rating for these 34 stories was 3.35 stars, but it still feels like a 4-star collection to me, because it absolutely got its job done: introducing me to a number of authors whose work I'm interested in exploring further.Curated by Jay Rubin and introduced by Murakami, this collection is arranged thematically rather than chronologically: there's a section on natural and man-made disasters, a section whose stories are unified by the theme of dread, and a section on the values of Japanese soldiers, among others. Jay Rubin writes in his forward that he wanted this collection to reflect his personal taste rather than serving as a more generic primer to Japanese lit, and for better or worse I think that shows: I didn't understand why every single one of these stories was chosen, but I did feel like I got a clear sense of Rubin as a reader, and why shouldn't an anthology say something about its editor?There were three main standouts for me:(1) Dreams of Love, Etc by Kawakami Mieko: A woman is invited into her neighbor's house, and her neighbor confesses that although she loves playing the piano, she's unable to play a certain piece straight through when someone is watching, and she entreats the protagonist to sit with her until she's able to play the piece perfectly. Compelling, sensual, and subtle, but still rewarding.(2) Hell Screen by Akutagawa Ryunosuke: The talented but contemptible painter Yoshihide is commissioned to create a folding screen that depicts Buddhist hell. As he's unable to paint an image that he hasn't seen firsthand, he inflicts torture on his apprentices. The climax, though it's easy to see it coming from a mile away, still somehow manages to shock, with horrifying imagery that isn't easily forgotten. (3) Insects by Seirai Yuichi: Set against the backdrop of the bombing of Nagasaki, Insects follows an elderly woman whose lifelong love had died fifteen years ago, after having been married to another woman. Brutal and tender all at once. There are a handful of other noteworthy stories worth mentioning. The story that opens the collection, Tanizaki Jun'ichiro's The Story of Tomoda and Matsunaga reads like a film noir mystery but ultimately takes a philosophical turn, ruminating on the conflicting values of the East and the West. Factory Town by Betsayaku Minoru is wry and clever and achieves a lot with its brevity. American Hijiki by Nasaka Akiyuki provides a frighteningly honest look at Japanese post-war psychology. And of course, Mishima Yukio's Patriotism and its graphic, visceral depiction of seppuku will probably haunt me to my dying day.But I have two main criticisms of this collection: one about its composition and one about its selection. While I enjoyed the thematic arrangement, why oh why weren't the stories' publication dates readily accessible?! All the dates were listed somewhere in Murakami's introduction, but it took a lot of flipping back and forth and I would have liked the date listed alongside the title, author, and translator. The second and larger criticism is that only 9 of these 34 stories are by women, so needless to say we can do better than a mere 26%.Still, I found this to be a really solid introductory collection for anyone looking to expand their horizons and discover some new favorite Japanese writers, some seminal and some more obscure.

The format takes some getting used to - it's a series of interviews woven together from members of a Fleetwood Mac-inspired fictional band, and as such the entire novel is essentially told in dialogue. I'm not sure every reader will be able to get over that hurdle and settle into the novel's rhythm, but I ended up really enjoying this.I do have a few qualms, so let's get those out of the way. While I thought the interview format was ultimately the right choice for this story, it led to a few awkward passages, as the only descriptions of setting we got were from the characters themselves, and there were some moments that felt wildly inauthentic to me - someone remembering exactly what a character was wearing 30 years ago, or describing a perfectly ordinary occurrence with a kind of poetic language that didn't ring true for the circumstances in which the interview was being conducted. I know that Taylor Jenkins Reid probably had to take some poetic license here lest her dialogue come across as flat and stilted, but it didn't always work for me.I also wasn't terribly impressed with the construction of the supporting characters; all of the male characters were essentially interchangeable, and I found myself frustrated with Camila's portrayal as this utter paragon of goodness (I'm glad Taylor Jenkins Reid didn't want to pigeonhole her into the 'jealous wife' role, but I think she overcompensated too much in the other direction - she was just unrealistically stolid).Sorry, that was a lot of negativity for a book I ultimately enjoyed. Let's get to the good stuff. This is a glorious portrayal of the 70s rock scene in LA; not to fall back on a cliche and say that this book is all about sex, drugs, and rock and roll, but it kind of is, in a way that felt both nuanced and convincing. No one does atmosphere quite like Taylor Jenkins Reid - in both of her novels that I've read I've just been so immersed into a period of twentieth century history that I didn't think I cared all that much about, only to be riveted by her ability to evoke time and place, and use the setting to explore such brilliant character dynamics.Which brings us to the other wonderful thing about this book. The chemistry between the band's two leads, Daisy and Billy, leaps off the page - if you aren't forcibly drawn into their thorny dynamic I don't even know what to tell you. And one last note: Karen! I cannot even explain how delighted I was to see a female character who knows she does not want children and knows her own mind enough that she's never questioned it. I feel like narratives about women not wanting children are often fraught with self-doubt, and it's not that I think these narratives are unrealistic, but they don't speak for every woman who decides to remain childless, and I just have never been happier with a portrayal of this than in this book.So all in all, a mixed bag, but the good really did outweigh the bad for me, and I ultimately thought this was fun and quietly tragic all at once.Thank you to Netgalley and Ballantine for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,76,1,"Feb 27, 2019","Mar 02, 2019","Aug 13, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40554142-daisy-jones-the-six

It's easy to see why There There has been one of 2018's most beloved books - it provides a much-needed look at the urban Native American experience, which Orange takes pains to remind us is a rich and varied culture that has endured unspeakable violence and hardship, and which our contemporary American society is still ready to stereotype and dismiss. The sheer breadth of voices here speaks to Orange's vision with this novel, as do the flawlessly written prologue and interlude, which provide the reader with a brief but succinct idea of the cultural context in which Orange is writing.But the tapestry of perspectives that Orange attempts to weave doesn't fully come together for me - I think there were a few too many POVs shoehorned in at the detriment of plot and character development. Keeping track of the threads between the characters became a bit of a chore - apparently a character needs only be mentioned once for them to have a significant role in the narrative that we should remember 75 pages down the line - and the ways in which some of their stories converged was beyond contrived. I would have been happier to read about ten different characters' disparate lives in a sort of thematically connected short story collection and been spared the awkward attempt to braid their lives together. For example, one character finds out that he has fathered not one but TWO children he hadn't known about, and these two individuals happen to be friends with one another... I'm happy for a novel to employ this sort of narrative device when fate is being used as a prominent theme, but in There There it just felt like unnecessary coincidence. And I unapologetically love a bit of melodrama, so the novel's conclusion didn't bother me for its theatricality as much as the fact that it felt like a rather hastily drawn attempt to tie up a bunch of narratives that hadn't organically run their course. Maybe that was the point, I don't know. But I think this should have been longer - its denouement could have used some more room to breathe. Nonetheless, it's an impressive debut. Orange ruminates with a surprising amount of depth not only on Native identity, but also on themes like alcoholism, domestic violence, and sexual assault. It's a short book that packs a powerful punch and I'll definitely be interested in reading whatever Tommy Orange writes next.

This isn’t always the case, of course; some stories are more universal than others, and some books do a better job of contextualizing the relevant sociopolitical elements. But in Notes of a Crocodile, a book about a group of queer students in Taiwan in the late 80s, I felt desperately out of my depth, and I felt like so many of my attempts to engage with this book were met with stony silence on Qiu Miaojin’s part. But I want to stress that this isn’t a fault of the book itself. I can imagine for the right reader that a book like this would be sensational. Personally I felt like I was missing references and subtleties that a Taiwanese reader (and especially a queer Taiwanese reader) would easily pick up on. I'm glad to have read this book and grappled with it as best I could, but this wasn't the easiest or most comfortable reading experience for me.Narrated by a nameless protagonist, nicknamed Lazi, Notes of a Crocodile chronicles the trials of a group of queer students living in late 1980s Taipei. It's also punctuated by a series of interludes which imagine that the country have been invaded by humanlike crocodiles; a clear metaphor for a society that sees queerness as an epidemic. (The homophobic obsession of early 1990s Taiwanese media with homosexuality is explained in a little more detail in this LA Review of Books  by Ari Larissa Heinrich, who has translated Miaojin in the past.) This book is light on plot, and whatever plot does happen usually happens off-page and is narrated to the reader much later; instead the focus is on the internal. To me Lazi felt more like an embodiment of what it means to be queer in Taiwan than an established character in her own right - while we learn almost nothing about her past or her personhood, pages and pages are devoted to philosophizing about what it means to be a woman who loves other women; what it means for your sexuality to be interpreted as a political statement. To me the philosophy ranged from stimulating to repetitive, occasionally too mired in intertextuality to drive any particular point home. This result is a rather rambling meditation that again, I tried to engage with - occasionally successfully, occasionally not.My other main takeaway from this is is that I think I would have appreciated this book more if I'd read it in my early twenties; I hate to sound callous but the sheer amount of self-destruction in these pages did become tiresome after a while. This book never lets up from its relentless angst and self-absorption, and the whole thing is of course shadowed by the tragedy of Qiu Miaojin's suicide at age 26. I ultimately think this is worth a read, but I think I find Qiu Miaojin herself more intriguing than this particular book....more",Notes are private!,1,71,1,"Aug 03, 2019","Aug 17, 2019","Aug 07, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/31395589-notes-of-a-crocodile

The premise was really fantastic, but David Joy didn't exactly sell me on its execution.The thing that most struck me about this book was a noticeable lack of tension in Joy's writing. Moments of horror and extreme violence were unable to hit any emotional beats as Joy's prose was so lifeless and perfunctory. At one point there was a paragraph about how a man parked his car down the street rather than parking it in front of someone's house, which laid out these reasons in unnecessary detail before concluding helpfully: '... and that's why Calvin had driven past and parked up the road.' Thanks, I couldn't have deduced that myself.The lack of suspense unfortunately extended from the writing to the plot, which unfolded as inevitably as you'd expect from the onset. But I do think some writers can pull this off spectacularly, writing a novel which feels like an inevitable train wreck that you're unable to interfere with or look away from, and therein lies the tragedy. I think this tried to be one of those novels, but without any sort of momentum or tension to drive it forward, it failed miserably.And then there's the treatment of the sole female character, who has no personality whatsoever but that doesn't matter anyway, because her pregnancy quickly becomes her entire identity. ""You're going to get out of here for this child, she thought, the world having taken on a singular meaning. Nothing mattered outside of what she carried."" (I'll have to remember that the next time I'm kidnapped: as long as I'm not pregnant, there's nothing to worry about.) I mean, I understand the sentiment he's going for, but women having no purpose in their lives until they become mothers is a trope that should have died 50 years ago.Anyway, for all that, I didn't hate this book - it was very quick and readable (despite the fact that I prolonged it for over a month, but that says more about my lack of free time than it does about the quality), and I know I'm in the minority in not thinking this was brilliant.

The pWriting this  hurts me a little because this was easily one of my most anticipated books of 2019, but I'm sorry, this was pretty terrible. The premise was genius: it's the story of the Greek mythological figure Cassandra retold and set at Hanford, the research facility in the U.S. that developed the atomic bomb during WWII. But I had four main problems with The Cassandra that I just couldn't get over: characters, plot, themes, and its success (or failure rather) as an adaptation, so let's get straight into it.Every single character in this book was one-dimensional. Within seconds of meeting Mildred (the Cassandra figure), her inexplicably awful mother and sister, her wise and worldly best friend Beth, the charming but cruel Gordon, and the pathetic but well-intentioned Tom Cat, you know what each one of their roles in this story is going to be (which has nothing to do with the myth at the heart of the narrative - more on that in a minute). Every single one of these characters is just pitifully one-note. None of their painfully obvious characterization is developed or explored or subverted, they all just exist comfortably as conduits for the story to advance where it needs to go.Which brings us to the next problem, how the plot drives the characters and not the other way around. The book starts with Mildred relaying to the reader that she's had a vision which tells her that she needs to go to Hanford, so that's exactly what she does. She gets on the bus to head to the facility and she meets Beth, who shakes her hand and promptly declares that the two of them are going to be best friends, and that's exactly what happens. We're informed that Tom Cat falls in love with Mildred, because he just does, apparently; we don't get to see anything develop in a natural or organic way. There's no rhyme or reason to be found, the story just kind of zips along and you're meant to accept that the characters' actions makes sense even when there's no basis to any of it.And this would all be somewhat okay if the themes were sufficiently rich and engaging, but they just weren't. Mildred starts having visions that 'the product' being developed at Hanford will wreak havoc and destroy innocent lives, but when she tries to warn the researchers, her concerns are ignored. Mildred then has to grapple with her own role in working for the facility that's developing this weapon: even as a secretary, does she hold some kind of responsibility? There's not... a whole lot of thematic depth to engage with there, despite very obvious present-day parallels, but this conflict is the main driving force in the story. And at another point, about 70% through the book, Mildred is brutally raped (as in, seriously brutal, do not enter into this book lightly), and Shields comes close to making some kind of point about how not believing Mildred about her visions has parallels to not believing women who are assaulted, but not much is really done with that opportunity.And finally, this has to be one of the laziest myth adaptations I have ever read. There are two recognizable elements from the original story: that Cassandra can see the future and no one believes her prophecies, and that she's raped. One of my favorite things about reading retellings is trying to discern which characters played which role in the original, and of course as a contemporary writer playing with an established story you should be allowed to invent characters and subvert character types and put your own unique stamp on the story, because otherwise what's the point? But in this case, the original myth was such a rudimentary blueprint that it felt like the author wanted to use the myth only as an excuse to incorporate visions into the story without the reader questioning it too much. Mildred is Cassandra, of course (but why does Mildred get these visions in the first place? there's no backstory involving an Apollo figure to rationalize this, it's just another thing we're meant to accept), and the person who rapes Cassandra is obviously Ajax the Lesser, but do not expect many other elements from the original myth to come into play. I certainly admired Shields' research into the Hanford facility, but maybe she should have cracked open a copy of the The Oresteia while she was at it.So, all things considered this was a pretty big disappointment. If you're looking for a contemporary reimagining of a mythological story I'd suggest Home Fire by Kamila Shamsie or Everything Under by Daisy Johnson, or if you're looking for feminist mythology there's The Silence of the Girls by Pat Barker or Circe by Madeline Miller. With so many fantastic mythological retellings published in the last few years, I think you can safely skip this one without missing much.Thank you to Netgalley and Henry Holt for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest  - sorry this didn't work for me! :(...more",Notes are private!,0,63,1,"Feb 04, 2019","Feb 07, 2019","Aug 06, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40046064-the-cassandra

She excels at crafting female characters who are sympathetic enough to warrant investment but abhorrent enough to shatter the conception that even the most contentious of antiheroines must above all else be likable. There's nothing sexy or pleasant or charming about our titular Eileen, and it's a breath of fresh air. The novel follows Eileen Dunlop, a 24-year-old friendless young woman living in rural Massachusetts in the 1960s, working at a boys' prison she calls Moorehead by day and caring for her cruel alcoholic father by night. She daydreams of escaping the monotony of her everyday existence, until one day the alluring Rebecca takes a position as a counselor at Moorehead and Eileen finds herself with a new fixation. In contrast to the richly textured Eileen, her foil Rebecca is drawn rather simply, but with precision. She's beautiful and she wears all the right clothes and says all the right things. Eileen doesn't allow herself to consider that Rebecca is anything less than perfect or that her intentions are anything less than noble, but as these events are being narrated to us by a much older Eileen, the reader is painfully aware that certain limitations in young-Eileen's perspective are going to lead inexorably to a tragic conclusion. But we also know that both Eileen and Rebecca make it out alive, so the question becomes how their dynamic is able to culminate in catastrophe that spares them both.Moshfegh rises to the challenge, as the whole thing slowly builds toward a chilling and mesmerizing climax, as dark as it is unexpected. My only hangup with this novel is the repetition in its descriptions of Eileen's home life. Maybe it's meant to reflect the tedium that Eileen herself feels, or maybe it's an indication that this would have worked better as a short story, as others have suggested.

But the fact of the matter is, I picked up Ghost Wall without terribly high expectations, despite the fact that I'd been eager to read Sarah Moss for a while now. More fool me - this book blew me away.It follows Silvie, a teenager from northern England whose family joins an anthropology course on an excursion to Northumberland, living for a few weeks as Iron Age Britons once did. From the very start, tensions arise between Silvie's survivalist father who idealizes ancient Britain, driven by nationalism and a yearning to belong to a society where he would be accepted, and the less stringent students who are only participating in the course for college credit. And as the line between reality and play-acting begins to blur, the constant threat of her father's violence draws ever nearer to Silvie, leading to a harrowing climax.Not a word is out of place in this novel; Sarah Moss knows how to command language to navigate the themes of imperialism, violence, class, and gender roles that are all central to this narrative. Tension builds with unerring precision in just about every facet of this story; between the individual and their environment, between modern and primitive life, between Silvie's father and the rest of the group, and between Silvie and Molly, an older girl raised with feminist values who Silvie is drawn to, despite feeling that Molly is overly dismissive of Silvie's own rural upbringing. I'm not sure what else to say, other than: read this book. Ghost Wall is subtle and shocking and absolutely masterful.

Dopesick is a comprehensive account of America's opioid crisis that has plagued disparate rural areas throughout the country, though Beth Macy mainly narrows down her research to her local Appalachia. She pieces together interviews with doctors, advocates, addicts, and individuals who have lost family members to the drug, to weave some kind of narrative out of the onslaught of factors which have contributed to the epidemic.While the reality of the opioid crisis was not lost on me before this (a friend of mine from high school died of an overdose about a year ago, which spurred my interest in this subject in the first place), Dopesick fills in the disturbing details. How Purdue Pharma saturated the market with Oxycontin in the 90s and continuously shifted blame from the addictive nature of the drug to the addicts themselves; how doctors have been made to prescribe these highly addictive painkillers at the drop of a hat (mainly to white patients, due to racial stereotyping that they are less likely to get addicted, which is why the opioid epidemic has hit white communities the hardest); how the government has essentially turned a blind eye and continues to deny adequate funding to address this issue; how MAT (medication-assisted treatment) has been stigmatized to the extent that many rehab programs require patients to be clean before checking in; and how feeling 'dopesick' is so miserable that addicts will do anything to quell the incredibly painful withdrawal symptoms.Beth Macy fuses thorough research with unfailingly compassionate anecdotes shared with her by mothers who have lost children to the drug. Their individual stories litter Macy's larger narrative, most of them following the exact same trajectory: being prescribed oxycodone for a minor injury, developing a dependency, being cut off from their supply, turning to illegal means of obtaining the drug, trying to get clean, failing to get clean, overdosing. There's one statistic that Macy repeats a few times throughout this book that stayed with me - on average it takes an addicted person eight years of recovery before they've gone a full year without relapsing. That is how impossible it is to quit this drug. Since this crisis isn't going anywhere any time soon, between a lack of funding, the refusal to acknowledge MAT as a legitimate rehabilitation technique, and incarceration of drug users and dealers as the primary tool being used by the government as a band-aid solution, Dopesick is well worth reading as a starting point, for anyone wondering how this crisis has reached such a critical state with so little government intervention....more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,"Oct 08, 2018","Oct 19, 2018","Aug 01, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/37486540-dopesick

I wanted to be able to say that I was so struck by Powers' genius that I was able to forgive the periods of abject tedium that characterized my reading experience, but that would be a lie. This is undoubtedly a fantastic book, but I don't think I was the right reader for it.Here I have to echo a sentiment that I expressed in my  of Lab Girl by Hope Jahren: there are only so many loving descriptions of trees a person can take after a while. What I'm interested in when I read is conflict and human interest and interpersonal dynamics, and when none of that is at the forefront of a book, I'm inevitably going to struggle with it.While Richard Powers did create a host of distinct characters in The Overstory - the first section of the novel is eight different short stories, one following each of the main characters through defining moments in their early lives - it soon becomes apparent that their stories aren't the ones that Powers is interested in telling. I had more than a few moments when I had to wonder why Powers chose to write this as a novel at all, when it would have arguably served its purpose just as well as a treatise on environmental activism. Powers is a hell of a writer though, I'll give him that. I can't bear to go lower than 3 stars in my final rating because I can't deny the admiration I feel toward Powers' craft. On a sentence-by-sentence level, I lost track of the amount of times I paused and reread a particularly striking passage, and the amount of detail that Powers is able to pack into every page is incredibly impressive. And on a larger level, the thematic complexity that Powers is able to achieve with his anthropomorphic symbolism and thorough examination of disparate disciplines and philosophies is undeniable. When words like 'epic' and 'masterpiece' are being thrown around in conversation with this novel, it's not difficult to understand why.But at the same time, I'm just not convinced that it was all necessary. I don't believe that this book is able to justify its length of 500 (very long) pages. It's punishingly dense and bloated; I found certain characters to be extraneous and a lot of the detail to be superfluous. But it's also punctuated by moments of such beauty that make it a worthwhile read, and I wouldn't be surprised at all if this wins the Man Booker, but on a personal level, I can't say this was my favorite reading experience I've ever had....more",Notes are private!,3,377,1,"Sep 21, 2018","Oct 04, 2018","Jul 30, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35187203-the-overstory

So with that said, I guess I did enjoy this more than I expected to... just not enough to really understand its inclusion on the Booker shortlist over more structurally innovative and intellectually stimulating titles.This book's greatest asset ironically ended up being a detriment for me, and that was the fact that it's incredibly well-written. The thing that immediately struck me about this book was how incongruously poised its first person narration is. Though the character Washington does show a natural intelligence throughout the story, one does have to question where an uneducated boy born into slavery picked up vocabulary words like unconscionable, inviolate, incandescence, leadenly, and disconsolate (these are only a portion of the ones I highlighted which jumped out at me, and I wasn't even including dialogue from other characters). So while I would describe the prose as smart and pleasurable to read, and while I'd seek out more books by Edugyan in the future for this factor alone, I don't think it suited this particular book.But my bigger problem with Washington Black is the way that the plot seemed to drive the characters throughout the narrative, and not the other way around. To describe this premise and execution as contrived is an understatement. As I was reading, I felt like I could constantly see Edugyan's hand manipulating these characters into the situations that they found themselves in, and this never ended up feeling like anything other than outlandish fiction. I have no problem with coincidences and fate being used by an author deliberately and thematically (see: The Heart's Invisible Furies), but it's a fine line to walk, and if this is what Edugyan was attempting, I'm afraid her efforts ended up seeming to me more like plot devices than divine intervention.It's a pacey and readable book from beginning to end (especially the end - I loved the last few chapters quite a lot), but the narrative structure of 'character zips along from place to place, encountering quirky characters who quickly come and go' will never be my favorite formula, and though there's occasionally incisive commentary on the relationship between white abolitionists and freed slaves in the nineteenth century, none of it is really groundbreaking enough that I feel terribly enriched for having read this. I could have forgiven it a lot for being an entertaining story through and through, but despite the fact that I breezed through it in two days, it was a thoroughly lukewarm reading experience that I doubt will stay with me in any kind of significant way. ...more",Notes are private!,0,88,1,"Oct 04, 2018","Oct 07, 2018","Jul 30, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38140077-washington-black

The Mars Room fell into the latter category. But this is exactly what I love about literary prizes, because I never would have picked this book up ordinarily, and I ended up loving it.The Mars Room is an incisive and unsentimental look at the US prison system, through the eyes of Romy, a young mother who finds herself at the beginning of two life sentences. Kushner then explores this narrative from numerous vantage points - the socioeconomic factors that lead to incarceration; the brutal realities of prison life; what it means on a psychological level to be confronted with a life sentence.While I felt Kushner's political agenda in writing this book was clear, it was actually rendered much more subtly than I had been expecting, which I appreciated. Romy was a thoroughly convincing protagonist, and it never felt like she had an unrealistic understanding of the political structures at play in her own story; she simply relayed her own reality to the reader, and Kushner was able to expertly tie that into the larger context. I think I'd describe this book as first and foremost a novel about humanity. These characters have all done terrible things, and Kushner makes no effort to excuse or glorify or sensationalize any of it. But she still treats each of their stories with compassion, and is interested in the question of when a person stops being a victim (of abuse, of poverty, of systemic violence) and is able to be classified as a villain.The interplay between the natural and the artificial is another element that I found intriguing, and I thought it came together beautifully in the novel's conclusion, but I did think the execution of this element could have been stronger on the whole. I guess this ties into my biggest criticism of this book, which is that Kushner isn't quite able to justify the chorus of voices in which her novel is narrated. Alongside Romy, we have chapters narrated by other inmates, by one of Romy's teachers who works in the prison, by the man who used to stalk Romy (which led to the altercation which landed her in prison). We also have excerpts from the diaries of Ted Kaczynski, more commonly known as the Unabomber, which is the element that eludes me the most when I think about how this novel is structured. I think this may have been an attempt to draw parallels to Kaczynski's self-imposed primitive lifestyle and the manufactured and inhumane law and order of the prison system, but Kushner seems to expect her reader to do most of the legwork with this comparison, scattering Kaczynski's diary entries throughout the narrative in a haphazard fashion. The perspective from an unrelated male inmate in a separate prison likewise struck me as superfluous, or else not integrated into the narrative in a way that ever justifies its inclusion.But mostly I found this to be a very intelligent and quietly thought-provoking read, and though it isn't exactly a pretty book, I wouldn't describe it as gratuitous, either. Kushner elucidates harsh realities and it results in a dismal and disturbing narrative at times, but it's never without compassion for the individuals whose stories she's telling....more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Aug 08, 2018","Aug 12, 2018","Jul 26, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36373648-the-mars-room

This was not a good book, but I don't think it's over between me and Ondaatje. More on that in a minute.Warlight was almost unbearably boring. I'm sorry, I know that 'boring' is the kind of pedestrian critique that we try to stay away from while ing, but I'm not sure I've ever read a book that felt this utterly pointless. There's no conflict, no character development, no intrigue, no payoff. This book meandered through the narrator's recollections of his youth in post-war London, halting all too briefly on defining moments, claiming to imbue them with weight but never willing to properly examine them in any kind of broader context. The nonlinear chronology could have been used effectively, but it served only to create such a distance between present-day-Nathaniel and past-Nathaniel that the chapters about his childhood lacked any sort of spark or passion or urgency. The one question that Ondaatje never seems interested in answering is why the reader should care about any of it.The one saving grace for me was the prose. Ondaatje's writing struck me as both elegant and effortless. There is no question that this book is well-written, and I found myself pausing at certain sentences, impressed by their construction and insight:You return to that earlier time armed with the present, and no matter how dark that world was, you do not leave it unlit. You take your adult self with you. It is not to be a reliving, but a rewitnessing.But despite these flickers of profundity in the sentence-by-sentence writing, there isn't a whole lot of emotional depth to this novel on the whole. For a novel purportedly about memory and perception and unearthing the truth, far too much remains unexhumed. The whole thing is bizarrely perfunctory and passionless, and there is no doubt in my mind that Warlight's inclusion on the Booker longlist is an homage to Ondaatje's illustrious career more than a reflection of the quality of this particular novel.

It's a simple story about motherhood told from the perspective of a newly single woman coming to terms with the failure of her marriage - it's a quiet, meditative work that was originally published in Japanese in 1979, and while I felt that this story's cultural context was readily apparent as I was reading, it does have an introspective universality in its depiction of isolation that I think will resonate with a lot of modern, non-Japanese readers.I will say, one thing about the fragmented narration started to grate on me - though this takes place over the course of a year and we are theoretically seeing events unfold in real time, the narrator would often say something like 'just two weeks ago, I got a call from my daughter's daycare,' and then we would rewind two weeks and she would tell us the daycare story... even though we were technically with the narrator at the time those events happened? It fractures the chronology in a way that doesn't totally make sense to me and adds an unnecessary level of telling rather than showing.But still, I thought this was a good introduction to Yuko Tsushima, and I'll definitely look into reading more from her.Thank you to Netgalley and FSG for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,56,1,"Dec 30, 2018","Dec 31, 2018","Jul 24, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40121930-territory-of-light

There's a lot of content packed into this little book, but while I found myself impressed by many aspects of it, there was also something a bit empty about the whole thing.So much of this endeavor is just very on the nose.

By the characters narrating the ways in which the modernization of Los Angeles is negatively affecting their community. I think I just wanted this to be longer and more nuanced. There's so much going on in this book, but it's all there for you to see right on the surface.This is ordinarily the sort of book I'd want to reflect on for a day or two before writing a , but with the Booker announcement tomorrow I'm racing against time, so I will admit up front here that my thoughts on this may evolve over time, for better or worse.

Everything Under is a retelling of a Greek myth (more on that in a second), set in the English countryside, which follows Gretel, a lexicographer, who's recently tracked down her estranged mother Sarah. It's a tricky plot to summarize as it unfolds with a nonlinear chronology, but it ultimately pieces together the fractured narrative that connects Gretel, Sarah, and a boy named Marcus who stayed with them on their riverboat for a month when Gretel was thirteen, before disappearing.Daisy Johnson's prose is accomplished and lyrical; of the Man Booker longlisters I've read so far, I'd say she's only behind Donal Ryan in terms of prose quality, which is an incredible feat. This book is stunningly atmospheric; the water beneath Gretel and Sarah's riverboat feels like a living, breathing entity, and the whole novel has a tone that's both vibrant and feral. It can be difficult to rework Greek mythology into a contemporary setting, but I felt that Johnson achieved this with aplomb, turning the ordinary into something almost mythical, which perfectly suited the kind of heightened drama that inevitably must unfold in a story like this.I'm not really sure what's going on with the marketing of this novel, because in some promos I've seen reference made to the myth it's retelling, and in others I haven't. I did know which myth it was going into it, and rather than hampering my experience with the novel I think it enhanced it. But I have seen others say they wished they hadn't known this information ahead of time as the knowledge does naturally give away quite a few plot points. But I don't think it's a novel which endeavors to shock the reader with its twists and turns, and with fate and free-will at its thematic center, I don't think it's difficult to figure out where the story is headed, even quite early on. So, I guess it's up to you whether you want to look up the myth it's retelling, but if you're a Greek mythology lover, I think you'll enjoy knowing ahead of time so you can properly appreciate Johnson's positively masterful foreshadowing and symbolism.The reason I've dropped it down to 4 stars from 5, which I thought it would be for most of the time I was reading, was that I wasn't very enamored with certain elements of the ending. I have to quote my friend Hannah's  where she talks about the last 20% of the novel: ""Here Johnson makes quite a lot of the subtext text"" - this was my main issue as well. The stunning subtlety that I had so admired about the first three quarters of this book was sacrificed for a very literal manifestation of one of the novel's themes, adding a sort of fantastical element that I didn't think was necessary. What can I say, I just don't like magical realism.But ultimately I did think this was an incredibly strong debut (!!) novel. Johnson's prose was incredible, and the amount of thematic depth here really took me by surprise. Johnson provides us with a thorough meditation on fate, agency, breaking and mending familial ties, the role of language in shaping us.

Set in London over the course of two dIn Our Mad and Furious City is a frenetic and imperfect but unforgettable feat from debut writer Guy Gunaratne. Set in London over the course of two days, it tells the story of three boys and two of their parents, against the backdrop of an incipient riot caused by a local boy killing a British soldier. Yusuf, Selvon, and Ardan are three friends who live in or around a Neasden housing estate, trying to make a future for themselves in a city fraught with violence and extremism.This book is a defiant look at the classism, racial tensions, and anti-immigration sentiment that plague not only post-Brexit Britain, but also the previous generation's Britain; it deals in the enduring and intractable nature of violence and the ways in which that ties into national identity for the second-generation immigrants whose voices propel the novel forward. The violence in this novel isn't specifically tied to one race or religion - one of the older characters reflects on fleeing Northern Ireland during the Troubles; another remembers arriving in London from the Caribbean only to find himself confronted with the Keep Britain White movement in the 1950s. Gunaratne's depiction of the cyclical and relentless nature of violence can be disheartening, but this novel is more about the choices the characters make, the strength it requires to turn away from brutality and not engage with it.Written entirely in different dialects whose cadences and vocabularies vary depending on whose point of view chapter it is (one family is from Ireland, another from Montserrat, another from Pakistan), Gunaratne's prose is gritty and colloquial but also elevated to the level you'd expect from a literary novel (something that Sebastian Barry failed to do convincingly in Days Without End, I thought, but which Gunaratnre manages with aplomb here - I was simultaneously convinced by the authenticity of the narration and impressed by the prose).So here it all is, this London. A place that you can love, make rhymes out of pyres and a romance of the colours, talk gladly of the changes and the flux and the rise and the fall without feeling its storm rain on your skin and its bone-scarring winds, a city that won't love you back unless you become insoluble to the fury, the madness of bound and unbound peoples and the immovables of the place.But, as I mentioned above, I don't think it's a perfect novel; the frantic pace leads a few unwieldy moments, like the awkward inclusion of a sixth point of view character for only a single chapter, or Gunaratne not giving the novel's climax much room to breathe. I couldn't help but to think it could have been improved by another 50 or so pages, but at the same time, it's such a snapshot piece that in a way I admire all Gunaratne was able to achieve with its brevity.Only halfway through the Booker list, but this one feels like a winner....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Sep 05, 2018","Sep 08, 2018","Jul 23, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35212538-in-our-mad-and-furious-city

And I'm writing my  without having settled on a star rating, so, we'll see what happens with that. I really, really enjoyed this, but I have a few too many nagging criticisms to say that I loved it.Sabrina doesn't really follow its titular character, as she goes missing by the tenth page; instead it mostly follows Calvin who works for the U.S. Air Force, whose childhood friend Teddy comes to live with him. Teddy is Sabrina's boyfriend, and he's utterly broken up about her disappearance. We then follow an array of characters - Calvin, Teddy, Sabrina's sister - all trying to come to terms with their loss, all while being confronted with wild conspiracy theories about Sabrina's disappearance.What this book excels at is creating an atmosphere thick with paranoia, in the most terrifying portrait of our modern society that I think I've ever seen in fiction. Littered throughout the background of Sabrina as contemporary set pieces are news articles and internet forums; there's talk of mass shootings, conspiracy theories, fake news. The characters are so inundated to this constant and aggressive stream of tragic news that infiltrates their lives, that the stark contrast of their simply drawn, blank expressions is recognizable and haunting. This probably got under my skin more than anything else I've read recently; this is not a comfortable book on any level.What I didn't love about Sabrina was that there is just so much going on, and it doesn't all come together in a completely satisfying way. This is one of those books that builds and builds tension, but rather than culminating in a brilliant resolution it kind of just ends. After I put it down I wanted to give it 3 stars as I felt so dissatisfied with the ending, but upon some further reflection I do think this was so effective in achieving what it set out to do that I can't help but to commend it for that.Now, onto the Booker situation, because we clearly can't end this  without touching on that. My feelings on this have run the gamut from 'graphic novels are a form of novel and therefore should be eligible' to 'how can you compare graphic novels with literary fiction when they're so substantively different and rely on fundamentally disparate storytelling conventions' and you know what, I still don't know where I stand on this. I understand both sides of the argument completely. At this very moment, I think I'm leaning toward the idea that graphic novels shouldn't be eligible - not as a gatekeeping, elitist thing, because I absolutely do think that the merit of graphic novels has been dismissed for far too long; I'm just not sure how you can judge something like this against something like The Overstory. Judging is always going to be inherently subjective, but it really is an apples and oranges situation. And with Sabrina, the only text is in the dialogue and glimpses of emails and articles; there's no prose outside that, which makes its inclusion on a literary award particularly perplexing. But, at any rate, I'm glad I took a chance on this one.

So well deserved; congrats, Anna Burns!I loved Milkman, but it's so painfully niche I can't think of anyone I'd personally recommend it to. Set in an unnamed city that's probably Belfast in the 1970s, Milkman follows an unnamed narrator who's believed by her community to be having an affair with a man known only as 'the milkman,' who isn't actually a milkman. Told in stream-of-consciousness prose and set against the backdrop of the Troubles, Milkman doesn't offer much of a plot, but it does provide a perceptive and intelligent look at a community under duress and constant surveillance. It also starts with these stellar opening lines:""The day Somebody McSomebody put a gun to my breast and called me a cat and threatened to shoot me was the same day the milkman died. He had been shot by one of the state hit squads and I did not care about the shooting of this man. Others did care though, and some were those who, in the parlance, ‘knew me to see but not to speak to’ and I was being talked about because there was a rumour started by them, or more likely by first brother-in-law, that I had been having an affair with this milkman and that I was eighteen and he was forty-one.""But this book is hard work, I will readily admit that. Though I loved the narrator's sharp observational commentary, even I found the narrative style painfully long-winded at times. Paragraphs go on for pages; chapters go on for hours; the kind of concentration it takes to really immerse yourself in this novel can be draining. This is not what anyone would describe as an easy read, and I think it's the kind of book that's going to fall under the category of 'I appreciated it but I didn't like it' for a lot of people. This line of thought actually made me reflect on what it means to 'like' a book, because I wouldn't describe my reading experience as 'fun,' necessarily, but despite that, I found Milkman incredibly rewarding. Anna Burns deftly crafts a living, breathing community, and paints a portrait of the realities of living in a city torn apart by civil unrest. Rumors and false perceptions dog these characters, and our narrator in particular, who's considered an oddity, a 'beyond-the-pale,' due to the fact that she often reads while walking. In order to fit in in a society like this, every time you leave the house you have to bury a part of yourself, and Milkman incisively and comprehensively examines the toll that takes. I don't know if I've ever read another novel that so expertly evokes the kind of anxiety that comes from the inability to trust your neighbor or even your own family. Characters in this novel operate under a veil of formality that you as a reader want to peel back to reveal their genuine hopes and fears and aspirations, but of course all you're able to do is mutely watch them navigate social situations while unable to truly express themselves. This book can be infuriating because of that, but it's supposed to be. There's also an undeniably feminist undercurrent to the whole thing, as the narrator laments the difficulties unique to women during this time, though it remains a subtle element throughout. Though it’s ultimately more of a psychological story than a historical one, drawing obvious parallels to any number of totalitarian regimes across history, Milkman does feel firmly rooted in its Northern Irish setting. This is a recognizably Irish novel, from its stream-of-consciousness prose to its pitch-black humor, and there's no question that that played a huge role in my ultimate enjoyment of it, so above all else I think I'd recommend this to anyone who loves Irish lit and Irish history, but who can tolerate a lack of plot and likes their novels a bit on the philosophical side. Personally, I'll be thrilled if this is shortlisted for the Booker, but I also doubt that likelihood as it's not the kind of novel that's destined to reach a wide audience - not that the Booker necessarily prioritizes accessibility, but I would just find it unlikely if all five judges are in complete agreement about this one's merits enough to advance it. But who knows. This had already been on my radar before the longlist announcement, but I'm very happy that it pushed me to read it sooner than I otherwise would have.EDIT on 10/15: I changed my mind.

I've talked before about the near-impossibility of divorcing your experience with a book from the context in which you read it; who knows how I would have reacted to this if I'd approached it as a guilty-pleasure thriller and not as a Man Booker nominee, but I did read it as a Man Booker nominee, and I'm at a loss as to how this run-of-the-mill, anticlimactic, bland thriller was able to hoodwink five judges into thinking it's anything more than a supremely underwhelming contribution to the genre (Val McDermid's influence aside).But I'll start with the positives, because Snap did scrape by with two whole stars from me. It's undoubtedly pacey and gripping, with a fantastic concept: a woman leaves her children in her broken-down car to go get help, and she's found murdered a week later. It kept me reading and kept me wanting to know what was going to happen. I know that seems like it should be a given for a thriller, but having read many which fall flat on their faces in this regard, it is nice to read a proper page-turner. I liked the setting as well; for some reason crime novels set in small town England have a vibe that really works for me and this was no exception. Now everything else.Screw utmost serenity! She had to tell Adam! She had to tell the police!The writing in this book was so dreadfully awful. I can only implore you not to participate in a drinking game where you take a sip every time you see an exclamation point, because you would be unconscious by page 20. For some reason, Bauer doesn't believe that emphasis or gravitas can be achieved without embellishing her sentences with excessive punctuation, italics, or some combination of the two. It only serves to undermine the book's darker themes as it's written with the dramatic flair of a novelized soap opera.At a glance the plot itself seems intricate as there are so many different characters who play some kind of key role, but when you start to examine it more closely you begin to realize how unconvincing it all is. There are just so many plot holes (a very unique and distinctive knife is used to commit a murder and the police never think to look into the sale of that knife?!) and coincidences (a boy just happens to burgle a random house and look in a man's hiking boot to uncover the missing key to his dead mother's murder investigation?!). Interestingly Bauer attempts to write herself a get out of jail free card on this account, as a character remarks: He’d never worked a case where coincidence hadn’t played a part, either in the commission of the crime or the solving of it. ... which is undoubtedly true to life in a certain way, but it's also a bit insulting to your reader, to pile coincidence on top of coincidence and try to pass that off as a well-crafted mystery. Some of these coincidences ended up being utterly inconsequential, too, like the fact that one of the investigating officers lives right next door to the family at the heart of the crime without even realizing it. It just didn't add anything to the story except for a VERY flimsy moment toward the end where we're informed by a ham-fisted plot point that their proximity actually did matter! (It didn't.)But the most insufferable thing about this book - aside from the exclamation points - was the fact that Bauer just shows her hand too early. The only subversive thing about this novel ends up being the fact that there really is no twist, no shocking reveal, just a resolution that plateaus far too early to make the payoff feel remotely rewarding. Watching police try to prove what the reader already knows is just as thrilling as it sounds.And I can't end this  without commenting again on this book's inclusion on the Man Booker longlist, which in itself caused quite a stir, raising the age-old question of whether genre fiction belongs in a literary prize. When the list was first announced, I was excited by the fact that there was some variety, that we weren't seeing the same names that are nominated year after year. And I'm still an advocate of genre fiction having a place in the Man Booker and other literary awards... provided that it's really exemplary genre fiction. I see no reason why a superb crime novel shouldn't be longlisted. The problem is, this wasn't a superb crime novel. Not even close. And I'm frustrated that the Booker wasted an opportunity to expand literary readers' horizons on this rather pointless and ill-constructed novel....more",Notes are private!,0,69,1,"Aug 12, 2018","Aug 17, 2018","Jul 23, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/35687802-snap

It was at times gripping, laughable, chilling, confusing, and dull, so I'm not having the easiest time gathering my thoughts and deciding on a rating.To be honest I'm not exactly sure what the main mystery here was supposed to be so I'll spare you from too many plot details, but basically, when Joe Thorne was a teenager his sister Annie died, following a period where she went missing for 48 hours before turning up again. Now Joe is a teacher at his old school and he has reason to believe that whatever happened to Annie is happening again. That doesn't give you a good sense of just how convoluted this was, but I guess that's the gist.So that's criticism number one: there are too many plot threads. Half of them are unnecessary and half of them are left unresolved. There's also a supernatural element that is only halfheartedly integrated into the story, and the lack of answers we receive about this felt to me like Tudor didn't have any of the answers herself and fell back on the lazy excuse of 'well it's supernatural, I don't need to explain it.' Since so much went unexplained, the ending was all kinds of anticlimactic, and the 'final showdown,' if we can call it that, was probably one of the worst thriller scenes I've ever read. But hey, at least Joe has no illusions to the contrary about what kind of book he's in. ""And then, feeling very much like a character in a bad thriller, I say: 'I think we should talk.'""And that's another problem, the desperate attempts to overcompensate for dull moments with humor that doesn't land. In the first half of this book in particular you could hardly go a page without cringing due to something like this:""Never go back. That's what people always tell you. Things will have changed. They won't be the way you remembered. Leave the past in the past. Of course, the last one is easier said than done. The past has a habit of repeating on you. Like bad curry.""... which was frustrating when the strongest thing about this book is its atmosphere. When your book manages to be as creepy and downright terrifying as this one can be at times, you shouldn't sacrifice the tone for these silly throwaway lines. And the thing is, this book was properly brilliant at times. Certain scenes, particularly the flashbacks, were tense and vivid and gripping, and I had plenty of moments of not being able to put this book down because I needed to know what happened next. So in that way, it was one of the more fun reading experiences I've had recently. Unfortunately I was rewarded for racing through it with an altogether terrible ending. So on the whole, where this is good, I actually think it's better than The Chalk Man. Where it's bad, it's worse by far. The Hiding Place is certainly more ambitious, but The Chalk Man is more consistent.

As this book ends up being so much more than the sum of its parts it's particularly difficult to summarize, but basically, it's a sort-of-love-story about Connell and Marianne, two young people growing up in small town Ireland together, who both move to Dublin for university in 2011.There isn't much going on in this book aside from Connell and Marianne's 'will they/won't they' relationship, but I wouldn't describe this as a romance novel as much as a novel about being human. Sally Rooney highlights with razor-sharp precision the oddities and intricacies that complicate interpersonal interactions, even between two people who love one another. This book is about miscommunication, but not miscommunication as a plot device; miscommunication as an intrinsic part of the human experience, naturally calling into question the possibility of truly knowing another person. Connell and Marianne's inability to open up to one another is so much bigger than these two individual characters; it's about gender roles and socioeconomic differences and power dynamics and social status and preconceived notions and projections and misinterpretations, and Rooney examines it all minutely through the lens of this one ill-fated sort-of-couple. She also has the uncanny ability to cut to the emotional core of a scene without sensationalizing, and I think that's what strikes me as the most accomplished element of this novel.I think this book is inevitably going to be underestimated by some because of its premise, and because of all the hyperbolic claims that Rooney is the definitive voice of her generation. But it's a deceptively clever book; it's perceptive where it could easily be vapid, it's clear-eyed where it could be melodramatic, and it has more intellectual and emotional depth than anything else I've read recently. A bit of an unconventional choice for the Booker longlist, but it fully earned its spot in my opinion, and I'd love to see it shortlisted....more",Notes are private!,0,191,1,"Sep 16, 2018","Sep 18, 2018","Jul 13, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/37539457-normal-people

My Year of Rest and Relaxation is exactly what its title advertises - our unnamed narrator decides that all she wants out of life is to sleep for a year straight. But not just 8 hour a night sleep - she wants to pass an entire year mostly unconscious, which she attempts to achieve with the help of a cocktail of pharmaceuticals prescribed by the least qualified psychiatrist of all time who she happened to find in the yellow pages. I'm having a hard time putting my finger on what it is I liked so much about this book, when the interesting thing about it is that it makes no effort whatsoever to be likable. The narrator is a selfish twenty-something with no sense of responsibility toward anything or anyone in her life. The circumstances of her life are probably difficult for most readers to relate to - she's rich, she's thin, she's pretty, she lives in the Upper East Side in an apartment paid for by her inheritance - and she neither needs nor wants our pity. But at the same time, this candid and frank style has its own kind of charm and dark humor (it reminded me a bit of The Idiot in tone), and I found the overall effect to be both intriguing and a bit unsettling.And, as with all good unlikable protagonists, there's definitely more to our narrator than she wants us to see. Her (borderline?) abusive relationship with her now dead parents certainly plays into the fact that she holds everyone - including us, including herself - at an arm's length. She resists accessing her emotions to such an extent that at first you wonder if she might actually be heartless, but throughout the book you start to notice certain cracks in her carefully constructed facade. She tells the reader ad nauseum that she doesn't care about her friend Reva, but this statement is occasionally belied by her actions especially under the influence of drugs. It's an interesting look at repression as a coping mechanism, as well as the lengths we're willing to go to to avoid the things we don't want to face.Ironically, while the narrator's goal is laid out plainly from the first page - she wants to sleep for a year - Moshfegh's agenda with this novel is much more opaque. I will gladly admit to thinking on more than one occasion ""I don't get it, I don't get what Moghfegh is trying to achieve with this."" Because this book is just what it says on the tin: it's about a girl taking a lot of drugs and sleeping for a year. But even through those moments of doubt, I was engrossed. Moshfegh's prose is effortlessly engaging, and her rather unconventional exploration of mental health and ennui just really struck a chord with me. And the final page is like an emotional gut-punch. Having read this, I have a very good idea of why Ottessa Moshfegh seems to be such a polarizing writer, but if the rest of her books are this intriguing, I'm officially hooked....more",Notes are private!,0,49,1,"Jul 30, 2018","Aug 03, 2018","Jul 10, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36552920-my-year-of-rest-and-relaxation

It follows two seemingly disparate story lines; one centers on a mother, Beth, raising a sociopathic daughter in 1980s Cambridge, and one follows a young woman, Clara, in present-day London whose boyfriend has gone missing.I tend to be decent at figuring out twists in thrillers, but I have to admit that The Lies We Told kept me guessing practically up to the last page. I didn't have the faintest clue as to how the two plotlines were connected, which made for an entertaining ride, and I was very satisfied with the conclusion.The writing isn't anything spectacular and the character work leaves a lot to be desired (most characters are driven by a singular motivation and don't have much of a personality outside that), but in terms of intricate plotting, Camilla Way nails it. Interestingly, I rather thought the opposite of her other novel that I've read, Watching Edie - I thought the characterization was fantastic, but that there wasn't much of a plot holding the whole thing together up until the final reveal. The Lies We Told similarly hinges a lot of its payoff on a big twist, but unlike Watching Edie, it reveals information at a steady enough pace to keep you engaged from start to finish.

In only 200 pages it follows Will and Phoebe who meet in college; Will has recently lost his faith in God and latches onto Phoebe as a replacement, while Phoebe blames herself for the recent death of her mother and finds herself drawn into an extremist cult.The entire story is narrated from the perspective of Will, though chapters supposedly from the point of view of Phoebe and cult leader John Leal are also interspersed. But even through these chapters the reader remains in Will's head, as he imagines the thoughts and actions of these other two characters when their narratives diverge. Unpalatable as it is to read the thoughts of a female character through the eyes of a man, you have to trust that Kwon is employing this technique deliberately, as it does ultimately end up being a type of subversion. As Will attempts to fill in the gaps of Phoebe's story, certain limitations in his perspective become apparent, and his idealistic construction of Phoebe's character feels like a deliberate riff on similar narratives which use this device without the same awareness of it. This isn't handled seamlessly from start to finish, but I mostly appreciated what Kwon was trying to achieve with the perspective angle.My biggest issue with this book was the way in which Phoebe and Will's characters are both distilled down to a single element (Will's loss of faith, Phoebe's guilt), and John Leal is such a nonentity that he really only exists as a plot device. Kwon is able to accomplish a surprising amount in her examination of grief and faith, but it's necessarily achieved at the expense of multifaceted characters. The writing itself is poetic and energized and I flew through this book, but for me it did fall a bit short of its potential emotional impact. But I think Kwon shows so much promise for a debut writer and I'm very curious to see what she does next....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Nov 04, 2018","Nov 07, 2018","Jul 09, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36679056-the-incendiaries

Keiko takes solace in the routine and regularity of her job, and embraces the ways in which her identity is shaped by the corporate world.

Eden is a clear-eyed, engaging meditation on how the aftermath of trauma shapes the lives of two sisters who were kidnapped and held hostage for two days as teenagers. The story picks up twenty years after the event, and follows one of the sisters, Hope, as she navigates life in New York as a failing playwright, before she decides to finally get in touch with her sister Eden after years of estrangement. Andrea Kleine's writing is sharp and compelling; I never wanted to put this down when I was reading it. The plot is steady and engaging as it follows Hope's road trip where she confronts a series of figures from her past in an effort to track down her sister, but where this book really shines is in its nuanced exploration of trauma, and the ways in which we allow our past to shape our present. It all sounds a bit trite, but I thought this book was anything but. It's frank and candid, but the characters themselves are each layered and their relationship between the two sisters is both intriguing and painfully realistic.The only thing I didn't love about this book was some of the dialogue. It wasn't uncommon for a paragraph of dialogue to span several pages, since a lot of these characters seemed to speak only in monologues. It stretched my suspension of disbelief just a bit that so many unrelated characters would speak in such a similar manner. Obviously it was a stylistic decision from Kleine - having each of these characters confront Hope so directly once she's finally ready to dig into her past and the role each of them played - but the conversations themselves could have been executed more naturally, I felt.But I did love this, for its candid tone and surprisingly thorough exploration of difficult themes, and its delightfully ambiguous ending which I found both satisfying and thought-provoking.Thank you to Netgalley, Houghton Mifflin, and Andrea Kleine for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Aug 07, 2018","Aug 14, 2018","Jul 02, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35721129-eden

McNamara's empathy, drive, and detail-oriented intelligence shine through her investigation, and it was fascinating to track her progress of investigating the Golden State Killer - a moniker that McNamara herself coined after DNA testing proved that the East Area Rapist, the Original Night Stalker, and the Visalia Ransacker were all the same person. Though the Golden State Killer had not yet been caught at the time of this book's publication and therefore it lacks a neat and satisfying epilogue, it's an interesting investigative journey that's well worth reading.I do have to say that I sort of regret listening to the audiobook - not because it wasn't well-narrated, on the contrary I think the narrator does a brilliant job, but because I personally don't retain things as well audibly as I do visually. And for me, a huge joy of reading books like this is in the details - keeping firm track of the names of suspects and investigators and victims and locations in my head. After a while here they started to blend together because of their sheer volume, which was a bit frustrating as I'm quite good at names when reading and I don't enjoy the feeling that there are details out of my grasp. But that's just me - if you're more of an auditory learner than I am, the audiobook is a great choice. Either way, this is one that stands up to the hype and I'd highly recommend checking it out....more",Notes are private!,0,33,1,"Jul 02, 2018","Jul 13, 2018","Jun 29, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35271190-i-ll-be-gone-in-the-dark

And I'm so glad I decided to give it a try. Sadie is an absolute tour de force of a thriller, told in alternating perspectives - one in which Sadie tells her own story of the vigilante road trip she goes on to track down her sister Mattie's killer, and one from the host of a Serial-inspired radio show which is attempting to track down Sadie's whereabouts.This book doesn't have much of a mystery - the whole thing is pretty much spelled out for you early on - but that doesn't mean it isn't worth the ride Courtney Summers takes you on. This book is absolutely harrowing. It deals with some dark themes (notably sexual abuse and pedophilia) as well as others which aren't quite as viscerally painful to read about, but still important (drug addiction, class and poverty, being belittled for speaking with a stutter). It's all dealt with thoroughly but none of it is preachy - it's all navigated with a real authenticity and sensitivity.And Sadie is a phenomenal protagonist. From the very beginning she's intriguing and vulnerable, and the chapters from her point of view are consistently the highlight. But what was a pleasant surprise for me was just how brilliant all of the other characters ended up being. Summers would lull me into a sense of complacency where I felt like I had the full measure of a character early on, only for them to be so much more multifaceted than I'd anticipated. Probably the most noticeable case of this was with Claire, Sadie's drug addict mother who abandoned her two daughters and left them to the care of a family friend. When we finally get Claire's perspective, her actions are never pardoned, but the story is flavored with even more depth than what we began with.My only critique - and it really is minor compared to how much I loved the rest of this book - is that Sadie occasionally felt too competent and adroit at social situations which didn't ring true with the kind of isolated upbringing she'd had. It was made very clear that Sadie was forced to grow up to soon and consequently a lot of her resourcefulness did feel realistic, but when it came to navigating tricky social situations and gaining the upper hand with much older adults, it felt a bit like wish fulfillment that Sadie was so skilled (but I also think this is one of those YA commonalities where you just have to suspend your disbelief a bit - admittedly not my strong suit).But all things considered, I loved this book. It is on the very mature side of YA, so I'd still highly recommend it to those who mostly read adult lit.

It then weaves together the narratives of several fictional characters, all of whom attend the performance and become so captivated by it that they attempt to use Marina's art as a way to process the grief in their own lives.As someone who adores contemporary art and performance art, I find the highly controversial Marina Abramović to be a fascinating figure.

It's a speculative novel set in a near-fSuicide Club is a book full of brilliant concepts that never develop into a convincing or engaging narrative. It's a speculative novel set in a near-future New York society in which death is illegal and the pursuit of immortality is all-consuming. 100-year-old Lea Kirino is a model citizen; she has a high-level job on the New York exchange, which now deals in trading human organs, she has a genetically beautiful fiancé, and she's being considered for a promotion. But things change for Lea when she spots her estranged, fugitive father for the first time in 88 years, and she comes in contact with a group called the Suicide Club, which advocates for the right for everyone to live and die on their own terms.So it pretty much goes without saying that this is a fantastic premise; where Suicide Club falls apart is in the execution. It starts out on a promising enough note - the worldbuilding at first seems impressive, and Rachel Heng does a good job of integrating her new terminology into the narrative so that it doesn't overwhelm. It's not until you get a decent amount of the way in that numerous holes begin to develop - and it's not so much in the nitty-gritty details as it is in the overarching concept. If society is still comprised of so many ""sub-100s"" (people with a 'normal' lifespan), how has death become such a cultural taboo? And why don't these groups revolt against those in power to gain access to their technology? Why is Lea so closely monitored for a supposed suicide attempt after she's hit by a car; does no one ever have a genuine accident in this society? In some ways this reminded me of Felicia Yap's Yesterday, another underwhelming speculative novel whose premise falls to pieces if you look too closely.But the biggest problem with this book was the protagonist, Lea. I don't even know where to begin. I was sort of buddy reading this with my friend Hannah, who at one point said that the only logical explanation she would accept for Lea's behavior was if she were revealed to be an alien at the end of the book. Spoiler alert: she isn't. But I think that just about sums it up. Even though Lea has a lifespan of 200-300 years (so she's technically only middle aged), she's still 100-years-old, so you'd think we'd see some wisdom and life experience occasionally reflected in her behavior. Instead, she is the world's most wooden, immature, simple-minded character, who makes the most incomprehensible decisions and shows absolutely zero critical thinking skills. This would be convincing characterization for an 11-year-old girl; not a 100-year-old New York businesswoman. Her backstory too is laughably incongruous with her characterization, and her character development is hackneyed and unrealistic. Despite the questionable worldbuilding and positively dull narrative, I think this book could have been saved if we'd been focusing on someone other than Lea.Which brings my to my next point, which is that we follow another character for a few chapters, Anja, a Swedish immigrant living in New York with her mother who is being kept alive in a vegetative state. Anja is vulnerable, complex, sympathetic - everything I hoped Lea would be - and it makes no sense to me why we follow Lea's journey so closely at the expense of Anja's. The split between their chapters is probably 70/30 in Lea's favor, which makes me wonder how Lea can come across as so under-developed when she has more than twice the narrative that Anja has.So all in all, a disappointment. But it's worth noting that this is a debut novel, and a rather ambitious one at that. The writing itself was solid, and again, the premise was brilliant, so I think Rachel Heng shows promise. I'll be interested to see where she goes from here - though hopefully it's somewhere with a more convincing and sympathetic protagonist.Thank you to Netgalley, Henry Holt, and Rachel Heng for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,51,1,"Jun 29, 2018","Jul 08, 2018","Jun 22, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36434556-suicide-club

Set in early 20th century Italy, The Madonna of the Mountains follows a country girl, Maria Vittoria, through her marriage and birth of four children, chronicling the family's struggles against the backdrop of Fascist Italy during WWII.This is one of the more convincingly historical novels I've read recently. Valmorbida's characters are all distinctly of the time period; their trials and tribulations and character arcs are all expertly intertwined with the setting. After incidentally reading two other pieces of historical fiction set in Italy in the month of July, both of which were tonally anachronistic to the extreme (though in one case I believe it was intentional on the author's part, but I digress), The Madonna of the Mountains was a breath of fresh air. This is a thoroughly convincing account of a country girl hoping against hope that she isn't too old to marry at the age of twenty-five; a young wife struggling to keep her family fed when food rations are scarce; a mother trying to stave off the dishonor that one of her children has brought to her family. Valmorbida also infuses the narration with northern Italian dialect, and I always love foreign language integration into a novel, but being able to recognize where the dialect deviated from standard Italian was definitely part of the fun for me, and helped anchor me to these characters' culture.I will emphasize that unlike a lot of my favorite historical fiction, this is above all else a very quiet story. It concerns itself with the day to day of Maria's life, the very very subtle ways in which her attitudes start to shift over time. This is not a WWII novel, and the conflicts are recounted from Maria's very limited perspective (which isn't to say that it isn't well-researched; Valmorbida simply hides her research in the background rather than bringing it front and center). So while I did really, really enjoy this, it did lack a certain emotional punch that I've come to expect from historical family sagas which are steeped in unapologetic melodrama. But if you're looking for something a little more subdued, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this.Thank you to Netgalley, Spiegel & Grau, and Elise Valmorbida for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Jul 11, 2018","Jul 31, 2018","Jun 21, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35133924-the-madonna-of-the-mountains

So with that in mind, Assassin's Apprentice was pretty much what I thought it was going to be: at times maddeningly slow and expository, but a promising introduction to something that I believe has the potential to develop into a much stronger story.Assassin's Apprentice introduces us to a very generic medieval fantasy world, where we follow Fitz, the bastard son of a prince who retires in ignominy once it comes to light that he fathered Fitz out of wedlock. Though Fitz is raised at Buckkeep, the royal palace, he's reviled by most of the nobility from an early age, and he takes solace with his connection to animals, until one day he's approached by the King's royal assassin, who tells Fitz that he's to train him as an apprentice.So let's start with the one major downside: on a scale between fast paced and slow burn, this book scores off the charts on the slow side. Fitz is a relentlessly thorough narrator, who sees fit to inform us of every thought that enters his head between the ages of 6 and 14, and while I liked Fitz as a character and found him sympathetic, I wouldn't have minded a highlight reel of the first half of this book. I'm a little concerned about the fact that this book is half the length of the next two in this trilogy, as the consensus seems to be that it's only worth pushing through this series in order to get to the next one. I'm willing to persevere, but as it took me nearly three weeks to finish this book I'm a little apprehensive. But let's move onto the things I did like, the reasons why I am interested in continuing with these books: Robin Hobb's writing is just lovely. Sometimes it's detailed to a fault, but more often than not the detail does do wonders in bringing the setting to life. The world-building may not have been terribly thorough (which I actually don't mind, as world-building is one of the elements of fantasy that I'm least interested in), but the atmosphere of this book is immersive from start to finish. But what I liked even more was the character work, which was remarkably solid all around. Fitz was a compelling protagonist, and the background characters were all intriguing and well-crafted. Enough of their motivations remained hidden from the reader that this aspect dovetailed fantastically with the book's central theme of loyalty - Fitz's loyalties are laid bare for the reader from the beginning, but the question of which characters are loyal to Fitz in return remains nebulous throughout. This culminated in an uncharacteristically pacey last couple of chapters, which gave us a simply brilliant conclusion to the groundwork that Hobb had spent a few hundred pages laying. So overall, I'm pleased, I'm intrigued, I'm a little nervous about this book's slow pace continuing on in a 800-page sequel, but check back with me in a year and I think I'll have found a new favorite fantasy author in Robin Hobb....more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,Feb 2019,"Feb 17, 2019","Jun 15, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/21956219-assassin-s-apprentice

Her essay collection So Sad Today makes an interesting companion read, especially due to a main criticism you'll often hear of The Pisces: that Lucy (the main character) isn't 'likable' enough. I hadn't known much about Melissa Broder's personal life before reading So Sad Today, but I understandably came away from it with the strong impression that Broder modeled Lucy after herself; in which case, can we extend the same complaint to this book, and how much is likability tied to worth? Broder doesn't spare herself in these essays: she can be selfish, hypocritical, vain, needy, and emotionally distant, but I don't think she, or anyone, should have to sanitize themselves in an essay collection that focuses on the tension between being authentic to yourself and being accepted by others.As for the writing style itself, the essays that erred on the side of conversational were consistently my least favorites (I have never enjoyed reading other people's text message exchanges and I wasn't about to start here). But the more literary essays I thought were incisive and piercing; make no mistake, this isn't a scholarly, academic exploration of the many many themes that she introduces - loneliness, sex, mental illness, addiction - but instead it's a fiercely personal collection that will probably succeed in striking a chord with most readers at one point or another, despite the fact that the details of Broder's life may be difficult to relate to. For me it was the essay on depression and anxiety that hit the hardest, with lines like this particularly resonating: ""For someone with anxiety, dramatic situations are, in a way, more comfortable than the mundane. In dramatic situations the world rises to meet your anxiety. When there are no dramatic situations available, you turn the mundane into the dramatic.""Ultimately if you don't get on with crude, vulgar writing, you won't get on with this, though I wouldn't suggest that it's only crude for the sake of being crude. In both her novel and nonfiction, Broder excels at exploring the uglier sides of human behavior and examining the underlying neuroses and insecurities that propel us to act in unsavory ways. But I will say, if you have emetophobia, please for the love of god be smarter than I was and skip the essay about her vomit fetish. ...more",Notes are private!,0,44,1,"May 02, 2019","May 11, 2019","Jun 13, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25904473-so-sad-today

It's part thriller, part coming of age novel set in Northern Italy in 1978 and follows a sixteen-year-old boy Elia Furenti, whose father is suffering a mental breakdown after being laid off his job.I'm struggling to get my thoughts together on this book, and I think it's because it felt more like a first draft than a finished novel to me, and it's hard to critique something with such abundant potential. It's gripping and eerie and the setting of this small Northern Italian town is brilliantly realized, and the examination of mental health at a time when the vocabulary and resources for Elia's father's breakdown weren't readily available was handled very well.Interestingly, most of this book's tension came from a subplot whose climax is spelled out to us from the very beginning. Can You Hear Me? opens with Elia telling the reader that his father kidnaps a girl and drives her into the woods - and then in a series of chapters scattered through Elia's own narrative, he speculates on what exactly happened in his father's van, what the girl was thinking and feeling in those moments. There isn't much of a mystery here, but these chapters are filled with such a sense of foreboding that I found this technique - stating the resolution and then backtracking to hypothesize on the details - quite effective.Where this book fell short for me was the coming of age element, which was just so paint-by-numbers. Elia meets a boy his age, Stefano, and is drawn to Stefano's young mother, Anna, who, according to this book's summary, 'propels Elia to the edge of adulthood'. I mean, we can probably all fill in the blanks from there. There's also an undeniable sense of detachment from all of these characters, who all speak in abstract, fragmented sentences (this is where I'm wondering if I should have opted for the Italian text instead of the translation) and walk around all in varying states of apathy. Elia's teenage ennui just felt so generic to me - it was like Varvello took a handful of bildungsroman protagonists and put them in a blender to achieve peak indifference but then forgot to imbue her creation with any sort of personality of his own. And then multiply this vacuousness by ten and you get Anna.Varvello says in an afterward that Elia's father was loosely based on her own father, and this shows in how he is clearly the most intriguing figure in this novel. And while her decision to tell his story from the point of view of his teenage son clearly came from her own personal history, Elia's own narrative just never came to life in a satisfying way. This novel just felt too short and fragmented to pack a real emotional punch, and I think it could have benefited from fleshing out the majority of these characters. But I did race through this and find it sufficiently tense and engrossing.Thank you to Netgalley, Quercus, and Elena Varvello for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jun 20, 2018","Jun 23, 2018","May 21, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36342295-can-you-hear-me

Despite a childhood love of Harry Potter which has persevered into adulthood, I very rarely Well, this exceeded all of my expectations and then some. Despite a childhood love of Harry Potter which has persevered into adulthood, I very rarely get excited about fantasy. Even my 'favorite' fantasy novels tend to fall under the category of 'it was objectively very good even if it wasn't really my cup of tea.' But with absolutely zero reservations, I loved this.It helps that it's a very 'me' kind of book. It's darker than dark, it features an utterly merciless antiheroine who's sympathetic enough to root for, it fuses fantastical elements with Chinese history and culture - especially drawing from the Second Sino-Japanese War - in a positively brilliant way (I've always had a thing for Chinese historical fiction which is what drew me to this book to begin with), it features a magical military academy and so much political strategy, and it's so firmly rooted in compelling characters that the worldbuilding never overwhelms. In short: just about everything I could ever ask for.The Poppy War follows Rin, a war orphan determined to get out of an arranged marriage, who tests into Sinegard, the most prestigious military academy in her country of Nikan. It turns out acing the challenging test was the least of her worries; now Rin is mercilessly antagonized by her peers and some of her teachers for her dark skin and for the fact that she comes from one of the country's poorest provinces. Things finally start to turn around for Rin under the tutelage of her one of the school's more eccentric masters, but soon the students at Sinegard are thrown headfirst into a war that's ravaging Nikan. I didn't even feel like I was reading fantasy for the first couple of chapters; the fantastical elements are slowly introduced as you're drawn further and further into this nuanced magical system that Kuang has invented, which involves gods and shamans and a spirit world. I hate when a book is filled with fascinating concepts but they aren't presented in an approachable way: that is certainly not the case here. This is every bit as readable and engaging as it is complex and intelligent. But this isn't a perfect book. Others have mentioned the drastic tonal shift between the first and second halves, and I have to agree that it's rather dissonant. The first half feels a bit Harry Potter meets Chinese history, and admittedly the half of the novel that took place at Sinegard was the half I preferred. Then this book gets brutal - just about every trigger warning imaginable can be applied here - and while I was fully on board for that and understood how the violence depicted ultimately did serve the narrative, I don't blame others for being a bit taken aback. So it's more of a 4.5, but I'm rounding up because I really adored this - I found it so engaging that I dropped everything else I was reading this week so I could focus on this (which I rarely do - I usually jump around between multiple books when I read). But this is just a stunning and stimulating piece of fantasy that asks difficult questions about religion, power, imperialism, war, and violence, and takes the reader on such an unexpectedly dark and compelling journey, I just can't help but to love it. As someone who almost exclusively reads standalone novels I can't remember the last time I said this, but I cannot wait for the sequel!EDIT: Fellow non-Chinese readers, I highly encourage you to check out THIS  by Lily where she writes out a list of some of the more subtle Chinese historical and cultural references she picked up on.

It's not difficult to see why Educated has been so well received, and if Well, Tara Westover is certainly a remarkable woman with a remarkable story. It's not difficult to see why Educated has been so well received, and if you're interested in reading it I'd implore you to take my 3 stars with a grain of salt, as I mainly think I just wasn't the right reader for this book.Educated is Westover's memoir of growing up in a survivalist family in the mountains of Idaho. Though she was technically supposed to have been home-schooled, her lessons stopped when she was fairly young, and her sporadic self-teaching hardly was able to prepare her for setting foot in a classroom for the first time when she was accepted to BYU at 17. But we know from the blurb that she ends up getting a PhD from Cambridge, so from the beginning it's clear that Westover's memoir is in many ways going to be a success story. But it isn't a smooth journey, owing to the ongoing abuse that she suffered at the hands of her father and older brother, well into adulthood.The first half of this book chronicles Westover's childhood, and to me this was undoubtedly the weaker half of the story. The anecdotes selected, though extreme and shocking and therefore compelling in a morbid way, I think rely a bit too heavily on their shock value to engage the reader. I felt this fell into that trap of too much recall/not enough analysis. Though Westover expertly evoked the setting of her childhood with details like her father's rejection of hospitals and the sense of impending doom with which he navigated their survivalist life, the scene was set early on, and the sheer number of car crashes and burns and other accidents recounted actually served to bog down the narrative for me.The second half, which details Westover's experience with her education, improved the memoir in leaps and bounds. At this point in the story the self-reflection kicks into a higher gear, as Westover begins to reconcile her parents' view of the world with her own experiences. This particular kind of resilience I guess resonated with me more than the kind of strength it took Westover to survive her childhood - I'm not diminishing that in any way, just to clarify, but I can't deny that I found the second half of this memoir twice as stimulating as the first. I've been browsing some of the negative s for this book, and noticing that there's a common thread of not believing Westover's account of things. And I admittedly get that. I would describe myself as a rather gullible person, but even I started questioning certain details in her story - more having to do with the smooth trajectory of her education than with her childhood abuse. I actually found the eccentric and violent survivalist family much more believable than the fact that someone who didn't have a birth certificate for nearly a decade, who doesn't even know her own birthday, was able to seamlessly enroll in college and obtain a passport. But despite my conflicting feelings about this, I think when you choose to read a memoir, you're doing so with the knowledge that you only have the author's truth. Occasionally you'll hear stories about memoirs and nonfiction books being debunked, but for the most part, you're never going to find out the objective truth behind the story you just read. So rather than torture myself over this, I'm choosing to believe Tara Westover, and believe that perseverance and passion is sometimes all it takes to turn your life around, difficult as the challenges may be.

And it was a pretty good choice, for the most part - it's an interesting story about two friends, Edie and Heather, who were once close in high school but who drifted apart for reasons we don't find out about until later.I have a frequent issue with books (especially of the thriller variety) withholding information from the reader for too long; stories kind of meandering along without a hook until there's a last minute twist played for shock value. And that's kind of my issue here, but it's also not really the full extent of it. It's not that this story was dull; on the contrary it was consistently interesting in a quietly captivating way. But I feel like this book robbed itself of an inherent complexity that the reader should have been grappling with much sooner than 20 pages from the end, when the secret between Heather and Edie is finally revealed. This twist was harrowing, and nothing like what I’d been expecting. But what was the point in keeping it from the reader for so long? What was the point in writing a decently entertaining but ultimately mediocre story that culminates in this one huge ‘oh my god’ moment, when you could have shown that card much sooner, allowing it to flavor the narrative with depth and complexity as events unfold?Here's the impression I got from Watching Edie. I felt like Camilla Way wanted to write a psychologically driven character study about how one traumatic event shaped the lives of two friends. But then someone at some point told her 'there's no market for that, you should just make it a thriller.' So she had to backpedal away from the event that should be at the center of this story, and add all these extraneous details in order to create some sort of air of mystery. I mean, that's probably not what happened. This was probably conceived as a psychological thriller. But the psychology was done so well and the thriller aspect was so lackluster, it's hard not to wish she had just gone about telling this story in an entirely different way. That ending and that twist were incredibly hard-hitting and will stay with me, but it felt like Camilla Way just dropped a bomb and walked away, which just feels like a waste when I imagine she would have been so capable of handling the aftermath. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"May 06, 2018","May 20, 2018","May 06, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27833862-watching-edie

Anything shelved as both fantasy aI want to make this clear for those of you who get recommendations off me: The Pisces is not my usual kind of book. Anything shelved as both fantasy and romance would ordinarily get an automatic pass from me. But this wonderful  from Hannah piqued my curiosity, so against my better judgment I decided to request it and leave it up to the Netgalley gods to see whether or not I'd read it. I was approved approximately 2 minutes later, so that was that.Thankfully, The Pisces was pretty incredible, and it just reaffirmed my tendency to occasionally read outside my comfort zone. It's a sort of literary soft erotica story about a woman who falls in love with a merman, but I feel like that description sells it short. Broder's writing is smart and sharp, and her story goes a lot deeper than your average mermaid erotica (or maybe the mermaid erotica genre has hidden depths and I'm just over here showing off my ignorance for underestimating it).Anyway, a lot of that is down to our protagonist, Lucy. Lucy is 38 years old, has been working on her PhD thesis on Sappho for years and has since become disillusioned with it, and her love life is a disaster. She's also kind of awful. She's not a particularly nice person, and it's hard to root for her - but I still want to, through everything. This is Lucy's journey to accept herself and reconcile her obsession with love with her fear of intimacy, and what could be more human than that? Also, because of Lucy's studies on Sappho, her narration is fused with allusions to Greek mythology and the classics, so I guess this book wasn't 100% outside of my wheelhouse.And then there's the fantastical element. This was what I was worried about going in, but I ended up loving it. I feel like it's treated by the narrative with a certain amount of self-awareness toward its inherent absurdity, which makes it all the more endearing.This is not going to be for everyone. Don't read this if you can't stomach graphic sex scenes, or if you don't enjoy reading about unlikable characters, or if you're looking for something with the same sort of whimsical fairytale feel as The Shape of Water. The Pisces is both grittier and funnier, sexier and somehow less romantic. It's both a fun read and an unexpectedly hard-hitting one, and with its absolutely stunning conclusion, I'll probably be thinking about it for days to come.Thank you to Netgalley, Hogarth Press, and Melissa Broder for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,94,1,"Apr 28, 2018","May 04, 2018","Apr 25, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32871394-the-pisces

I absolutely understand why some readers have found it maddening. I can't recall the last book I read where less happened than it did here, which, considering that it's nearly a five-hundred page book, is kind of a triumph in its own right. But I got along with The Idiot splendidly.This is quiet, sparse, cerebral, philosophical, surprisingly humorous account of a Turkish-American girl's first year at Harvard. In one of her Russian classes she meets Ivan, an older Hungarian student, and she becomes inexorably drawn to him. This isn't a romantic book, necessarily, but it is one that ruminates on the nature of love. Selin's pursuit of love and pursuit of intellectualism run parallel, both stemming from a desire to understand and be understood, and this is something that Batuman explores deftly in these pages.The most noteworthy thing about this book is the brilliant protagonist that Batuman has created in Selin, and her striking narrative voice. Selin is first and foremost an observer. That's not to say that she isn't an active participant in her life, or that she doesn't make decisions, because she does, but often these decisions come more as reactions to the people and situations around her rather than from within herself. Selin observes the world in order to gain a deeper understanding of herself and where exactly she fits into the cosmic puzzle - and that's something I really connected with. I lost track of how many lines I highlighted because yes, that is me, that is my entire college experience encapsulated in a single phrase - but this one in particular stood out to me:Even though I had a deep conviction that I was good at writing, and that in some way I already was a writer, this conviction was completely independent of my having ever written anything, or being able to imagine ever writing anything, that I thought anyone would like to read.I will admit to flinching at this and some of the other truths that The Idiot elucidated for me.My only complaint is that it overstays its welcome by about a hundred pages... but I'm actually struggling to make up my mind about whether I think that's an objective fault, or if this feeling is due to the fact that I traveled halfway across the country halfway through reading this book and had to take a break for several days due to work things and eventually came back to it in a different (and more tired) frame of mind.Anyway, I can't think of many people I'd recommend this to, and I can think of several I would specifically not recommend this to (hi, Hadeer), but I thought it was brilliant. It's an easy, smooth read in some ways, but a difficult, dense read in others - Batuman doesn't rely on a flashy vocabulary to show off her intelligence, but it's on display on every single page. This isn't a book you read for escapism as much as one you read in order to gain a clearer picture of your own reality. For me, it was a resounding success in that regard....more",Notes are private!,0,70,1,"Apr 25, 2018","May 09, 2018","Apr 23, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30962053-the-idiot

Their narratives intersect rather early on, and the novel mostly follows their relationship over a rather meandering 500 pages.From the very first page, I wanted to love this book. I was struck instantly by Imogen Hermes Gowar's prose, which is some of the best I think I've ever read in a contemporary novel. It's poised, elegant, classical and lyrical all at once, with some of the most evocative setting descriptions I've ever read. Gowar brings the late 1700s to life in a way that I wouldn't dare to minimize as I go on to discuss this novel's flaws.But I would be remiss not to mention that the pace and plotting were downright maddening. This is one of those books where nothing happens for 450 pages, and then everything happens in the last 50. It's uneven, and for me, it wasn't engaging enough to hold my attention throughout. Characters and their motivations also remained at arm's length, with a questionable third person omniscient point of view which gave absolutely no rhyme or reason for its head hopping, following not only Jonah and Angelica, but a handful of other characters whose narratives were never fully developed. One of these characters in particular was Polly, a black courtesan whose storyline had absolutely no depth or insight or closure or anything remotely satisfying to read.Again, I don't want to downplay what an accomplishment Gowar's writing is. If your main draw to a novel is rich, gorgeous prose, then I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this. But if you're looking for tight plotting and compelling characters, I can't say that either of those is a real strength of this novel.Thank you to Harper and Imogen Hermes Gowar for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,35,1,"May 20, 2018","Jun 05, 2018","Apr 23, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/37678008-the-mermaid-and-mrs-hancock

All I have to say about Dot Hutchison's Collector series is: nothing gold can stay. Dark, twisted, and gripping, I thought The Butterfly Garden Well. All I have to say about Dot Hutchison's Collector series is: nothing gold can stay. Dark, twisted, and gripping, I thought The Butterfly Garden was altogether pretty brilliant. But Hutchison's followup novel, Roses of May, provided a starling (and in my opinion, utterly grating) tonal shift, abandoning a lot of the creepiness of the first novel and coming across as ultimately rather juvenile. I was hoping The Summer Children might bounce back and show a hint of The Butterfly Garden's greatness, but I'm afraid this had nothing to offer but more of that obnoxious fan-servicing cutesy humor that plagued Roses of May. I mean, in theory, The Summer Children should be dark. It follows FBI agent Mercedes Ramirez as she investigates a series of murders by someone who's attempting to 'rescue' children from abusive households by killing their parents. The last thing I should be thinking is 'why does this have to be so goddamn twee,' but here we are.This kind of goes hand in hand with my criticism of the book's tone, but what's so insufferable about Roses of May and The Summer Children is how obsessed Hutchison is with her own protagonists. Sure, they're all flawed (in super palatable ways), but they're also the most competent and considerate people in the universe, and we need to be reminded of it again. and. again. There are entire scenes that serve no narrative purpose but to self-congratulate. Is it not bad enough that we have to revisit Mercedes's proclivity toward being honest with the children she works with on about twenty separate occasions, do we really have to laud it each time?Maybe it's just me, but I like stories that dig into human imperfections - characters who say the wrong thing and can't take it back, characters who react inappropriately in dire situations, characters hurt the people they love by mistake. There is none of that here. Mercedes and her team can do no wrong, and we need to pat them on the backs every time they know exactly what someone needs at exactly the right time. And that's another thing - the found family trope is usually one of my favorites, but the way Hutchison writes it is so heavy-handed I spent most of this book cringing with secondhand embarrassment. Speaking of cringing - this is a passage I highlighted not only because of the corny writing, but because it was probably the fourteenth or fifteenth time the word 'scar' had jumped out at me in this book. ""Scars mean we survived something, even when the wounds still hurt."" Anyway, so I did a search on my Kindle, and do you know how many times the word 'scar' is used? Twenty-seven. Talk about being bashed over the head.Bottom line is that I was not the target audience here, and I ordinarily don't hold this kind of thing against the book as much as I am doing right now, but I can't help but to find it irritating that all the maturity of the first book sort of evaporated in the second two. I guess this can't technically be classified as YA as the protagonist is in her thirties, but trust me, if you do not enjoy YA, read The Butterfly Garden as a standalone and move on.Thank you to Netgalley, Thomas & Mercer, and Dot Hutchison for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"May 10, 2018","May 14, 2018","Apr 18, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35655156-the-summer-children

Though it's only being published today, This is the only time I can ever remember feeling like there’s something wrong with me for not loving a book. Though it's only being published today, A Place for Us is already near-universally adored, and it sounded like a book that was right up my alley: a sprawling portrait of a dysfunctional family is the blueprint for so many of my favorite books and I didn’t see any reason for A Place for Us to be an exception. And it’s undeniably a beautiful novel. It follows an Indian-American Muslim family living in California, who are gathered at the beginning of the novel for their eldest daughter Hadia's wedding. We find out that the entire family is estranged from their only son, Amar, and the rest of the novel explores the factors that led to this fracturing. The prose style is simple and elegant, and the nonlinear chronology is handled deftly, constructing a portrait of this family that comes together seamlessly by the end.Others have described this book as heart-wrenching and moving, and I see where it should have been both of those things. But the whole time I was reading I felt like there was a veil between me and these characters, who all felt to me more like constructs than real human beings. A Place for Us hits all the beats you'd expect it to from the very first page. This is a story that's so simple, so unsurprising, that it entirely hinges on its readers' emotional investment for there to be any payoff. And I hate to say it, but these characters just weren't interesting to me. Each of their trajectories practically wrote itself, and I started to find it tedious that such straightforward ideas were being communicated in such a circuitous manner. We could have easily shaved off 100 pages and essentially been left with the exact same book.But it's worth reiterating that I'm in the minority, and it's a sort of disorienting feeling to be left cold by a book which promises emotional resonance above all else. I'm glad that others have been able to connect with this book in a way that I did not. But if you're looking for a heartbreaking family saga, I would personally recommend Pachinko or East of Eden or Everything I Never Told You over A Place for Us in a heartbeat.Thank you to Netgalley, First to Read, SJP for Hogarth, and Fatima Farheen Mirza for an advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,131,1,"May 12, 2018","Jun 12, 2018","Apr 10, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36840397-a-place-for-us

It follows the story of Louise, a down on her luck aspiring writer in New York City who meets the rich and glamorous Lavinia, and the two form a sort of dysfunctional, obsessive friendship which is barreling toward tragedy, as we're told from the onset that Lavinia is going to end up dead.I don't think I've ever described a book as 'intoxicating' before (and in fact I tend to roll my eyes at that descriptor), but that's the word I keep coming back to with Social Creature. This book is intoxicating. Just like Louise, the reader is pulled into the glitz and glamour of Lavinia's carefree socialite lifestyle, ignoring the glaring warning signs about the unhealthy and obsessive road she's going down. With all the inevitability of a Greek tragedy, this is a story that ends terribly for absolutely everyone involved. But it's addicting and utterly impossible to look away.Social Creature doesn't have the same flawless prose or pervasive intellectualism as The Secret History, so maybe its vaguely pretentious tone is unearned, but it does have all the unlikable characters, and the same cautionary tale against indulging too heavily in the fairytale of living an impossibly elite lifestyle. On the surface Social Creature is a fun thriller and a rather addictive beachy read, but underneath it's rather bleak and sad and tragic. I think what haunts me the most about this book is how much I related to Louise at the beginning of it, and how harrowing it was to watch everything spiral out of control for her.

A Double Life just reinforced my appreciation of Berry's style. I can see where her books won't work for all thriller lovers, but they really work for me.Loosely based on the Lord Lucan case, A Double Life follows Claire, whose father murdered her nanny, beat her mother, and vanished without a trace when she was a child. Now Claire is a successful doctor in London, but each possible sighting of her father sends her into such a state of anxiety she finally decides to seek answers for herself.A Double Life is first and foremost a psychologically driven character study, which examines class and privilege and the role that plays in the crime that was committed. This kind of reminded me of something like The Secret History or Social Creature or The Riot Club, but instead of telling the story from an insular perspective that indulges in the fantasy of living that kind of possibly elite life, it's like if The Secret History had been narrated by Richard's mother, or someone else who was close enough to touch that lifestyle without actually living it. Consequently it's not quite as glitzy and glamorous as any of those other stories mentioned, but it gives us a protagonist who's easy to relate to and root for. The plot is gripping as well, though it's not particularly twisty - but that's fine as Berry's writing keeps you engaged throughout. Overall I have to say that I did prefer Under the Harrow to A Double Life since the former had more to offer in the way of atmosphere with its setting in the English countryside, but I did really enjoy this as well. If you prefer your thrillers to be character-driven and lean a bit more toward the literary side of things, I'd highly recommend giving Flynn Berry a try.Thank you to Netgalley, Viking, and Flynn Berry for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Jun 24, 2018","Jun 26, 2018","Apr 09, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33286623-a-double-life

I already forgot that I finished this book last night which I think speaks to how anticlimactic I found the ending, but otherwise, I just loved this. I don't know the first second or third thing about ballet so I'm afraid I can't comment on how accurate of a portrayal this was, but I'm inclined to believe that former professional ballet dancer Meg Howrey knows her stuff. The ballet scenes were electrifying to read at any rate.But the best thing about this book for me was its protagonist Kate - I probably went into this expecting to be more intrigued by Kate's sister Gwen, talented and tortured, who remains a sort of shadowy figure in the background throughout Kate's story, but it was actually Kate herself that was the heart and soul of this novel. Her narration is snarky, hard-edged, honest, and surprisingly vulnerable, and I found myself rationing my reading of this so I could spend more time with her. The pacing could have used a lot of work - about 100 pages could have been cut easily and never at any point could I figure out how much time was passing between chapters - but ultimately, for a character-driven novel it got the job done, because I was so invested in this character and in Howrey's candid portrayal of mental illness and its many manifestations. ...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Dec 02, 2018","Dec 14, 2018","Apr 08, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12975068-the-cranes-dance

Though it is a World War II novel (and I know most people's reactions to its inclusion on the Women's Prize longlist was 'oh no, another World War II novel'), it really doesn't feel like one. It takes place over the course of three days toward the beginning of the German occupation of Ukraine in 1941. Seiffert deftly captures the sense of confusion and uncertainty for these characters who are unknowingly on the precipice of this massive historical event. This is a quiet novel whose sparse, economical writing style suits its tone well. But the characters are forgettable and paper thin, the plot is nonexistent, the thematic resonance falls short, and the setting is rarely utilized to its full potential. I just don't quite understand what Rachel Seiffert was attempting with this. There's nothing terribly striking or unique or innovative or timely about this particular story that would recommend it over the sundry other Holocaust novels out there, or the exciting contemporary fiction that's being published every day.

The novel follows Maurice Swift, a young aspiring writer who desires success at all costs, and though he writes decently, he isn't able to come up with plots of his own. So he sets out to steal other people's stories, at higher and higher costs.I guess I'll start out with my main criticism, then - I expected (perhaps erroneously) that this book was going to be an examination of the heights you can reach if you're willing to sacrifice your soul, but in reality Maurice doesn't seem to have much of a soul to begin with. Though he's a well-constructed character, I did find that he was more of a flat-out villain than the antihero that I had been hoping for. This only became an issue for me in the final section, when some of his actions became almost unrealistically evil, and were never morally grappled with in a thorough enough way to warrant my own engagement or emotional investment in this character's arc.And I know that seems like a pretty big gripe, but despite the fact that A Ladder to the Sky is centered around Maurice, the majority of the book isn't told from his perspective. The novel begins with Erich Ackermann, an old and respected German novelist, who confides a secret in Maurice who then goes on to exploit this to further his own career. Each section unfolds similarly; a character recalls his or her own relationship with Maurice, and each story is in its own way horrifying and heart-wrenching. The section narrated by Erich did end up being my favorite, despite the fact (or perhaps because of the fact?) that Boyne recycles a character arc that anyone who's read The Absolutist will quickly recognize. I was still highly invested in Erich, and I did quickly become intrigued by Maurice, who, despite the aforementioned complaints, is a thoroughly captivating figure. I guess I just wanted to end up rooting for him, not against him. But I don't know what that says about me.Perhaps the most delightful element of this novel is the meta commentary on the publishing industry. There were moments that I found jaw dropping because I couldn't quite believe that Boyne was bold enough to publish something like this. I mean, of course it's fiction. But we all know that the kind of schmoozing and chronic ladder climbing you find in this novel are hardly artistic inventions. It was nice, though, to read something this honest (if embellished for fiction, of course). It was also a pretty drastic departure from The Heart's Invisible Furies, but I honestly think that's a good thing; one of my favorite things about Boyne is that he's not the kind of author to write the same book over and over.

Told primarily from the perspective of Briseis, a Trojan captive given to Achilles as a war prize, Pat Barker's novel endeavors to tell the unsung story of the female characters who litter the background of the Ancient Greek epic. And she does a pretty brilliant job.The pleasure I derive from reading retellings, and especially retellings of Homer, is twofold: I want to see the author's unique slant on the narrative and feel that they're contributing something new to the story, otherwise what's the point, but I also want to be reminded of my love of the original. On both fronts, The Silence of the Girls is a resounding success. Pat Barker captured the grandiosity of these characters and events in a way that really struck a chord with me; I felt constantly on the verge of tears reading parts of this novel because Homer's musings on fate and free will and grief and glory - in short, what makes the Iliad so epic and timeless - are all echoed in Briseis' narrative. But Barker also manages it all from the sidelines, zeroing in on the experiences of a war slave who has no choice but to watch events unfold around her with no personal agency. Briseis is fully aware that she is not the hero of her own story, that she's narrating these events as a spectator to her own life. You could argue that at times she almost has a bit too much awareness of this fact, but as she's narrating these events from years later, the time and perspective have clearly allowed her to form the big picture.I also felt these were some of the best depictions I've ever read of these characters, notably Achilles and Patroclus. I find that certain writers have a difficult time reconciling Achilles' brutality with his heroism, and likewise Patroclus' ruthless streak with his kindness. But Barker frankly addresses that, in times of war especially, these characteristics can easily coexist. I really felt that these characters had walked straight out of the pages of the Iliad into Barker's story, in a way that I haven't seen achieved by any other retelling I've read (except maybe Ransom by David Malouf, which until now has been my go-to recommendation for modern Iliad retellings). Briseis is a very minor character in the original, and as such, Barker had a lot more leeway with her protagonist, but I was also satisfied with the result; I was immediately invested in Briseis and I thought she added a much-needed and underrepresented perspective to the story.My biggest issue with this novel the unwieldy execution of the point of view shifts. Though this retelling focuses on Briseis, so much of the backdrop and what drives the characters' motivations hinges on the relationship between Achilles and Patroclus, and for Briseis to narrate that to us any more than she already does would verge too heavily into 'telling rather than showing' territory, so I really didn't mind the occasional inclusion of the male perspectives. But the first person/third person switch feels arbitrary and messy, especially since Briseis herself spends so much time observing and narrating Achilles's actions. I felt like Barker could have played with this a bit more; played up the uncertainty that maybe we aren't reading Achilles's thoughts, but rather, Briseis' interpretation of Achilles's thoughts.... but nothing is really made of this opportunity, as it's clear that we're supposed to be in Achilles' head, but rather unclear why we've switched over to his thoughts at any given moment.But aside from that, this book was pretty much everything I wanted it to be. It's subversive yet subtle; affecting yet understated. It captures the epic scale of the Iliad and the quiet moments of beauty in the story and everything in between. It's definitely a subtler feminist retelling than the likes of Circe and The Penelopiad, but I have to say I much, much preferred The Silence of the Girls - though I would readily recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the aforementioned novels. But for all my talk of retellings and Greek classics, I really don't think you need prior knowledge of any of that before starting Barker's novel - it's a stunning story that should stand on its own just fine.Thank you to Netgalley, Doubleday Books, and Pat Barker for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,1,140,1,"Aug 03, 2018","Aug 06, 2018","Mar 29, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/37969723-the-silence-of-the-girls

I could not believe the emotional torment he managed to put me through in the space of 200 bite-sized pages.On Chesil Beach is an almost-love story about Florence and Edward, two young lovers on their honeymoon on the coast of England in 1962. What should be a romantic weekend quickly devolves into something much sadder as an ocean of miscommunications piles up between the two characters. Florence is asexual, though the term asexual is never used because of the time period, and the lack of access to this concept and vocabulary has led Florence to believe that she's fundamentally broken. As she's unable to communicate this feeling to Edward, he imbues her actions with false meanings, drawing from his understanding of social conventions to fill in the blanks - she's shaking because she's terrified and repulsed and ashamed, but Edward assumes she's shaking because she's nervous and excited, because don't all young women act demure to mask a secret sensuality? There is no precedent for Florence falling outside this expected norm.McEwan also ties in Florence and Edward's story to the shifting social attitudes of the time - they're living in a Britain which hasn't quite normalized sexuality and celebrated youthful freedom. The two are inexperienced and unable to communicate their thoughts and feelings and desires and expectations to one another, because how do you even start a conversation about sex when it just feels like this abstract concept both to be revered and ashamed of?I wasn't prepared for how expansive this book was going to be - McEwan dexterously explores themes of class differences, propriety, love and sex and sexuality, all in economical prose that says so much in a book whose conflict ironically hinges on a lack of articulation on the part of both characters. And above all else this book is just bitterly sad. The final pages are like an emotional gut-punch.

His follow up novel is evThe Last Time I Lied is a perfectly worthy successor to Sager's Final Girls, which was one of my favorite thrillers of 2017. His follow up novel is every bit as fun and twisty as his first, and I read the bulk of it in one sitting. Sager returns to his tried and true cabin in the woods setting, this time following Emma, a painter who spent two weeks at a summer camp fifteen years ago which ended with the disappearance of three of her friends; now Emma is returning to Camp Nightingale as an art teacher, hoping to get to the bottom of the events of that first summer.But as gripping and addicting as it was, the criticisms kept piling up as I read. Emma was a notably bland narrator, who had no personality beyond her survivor's guilt about the girls' disappearances. And Sager's depiction of female friendships was frankly bizarre to me: Emma was unnaturally interested in describing and thinking about other girls' appearances, and Sager seemed obsessed with the idea of every single friend group having an 'alpha,' whatever that means (I mean, I know what it means, but how many friend groups have you been in that have an established alpha??? is that a thing that happens in real life???) And look, I'm not claiming that you can't write a sufficiently gripping drama set at an all-girls camp - of course teenage girls can be catty and mean to one another - but some of the social dynamics that Sager relied on to tell this story didn't quite ring true for me, and felt more like stereotypes than actual human behavior.But my biggest issue (which I won't get into very much to avoid spoilers) was that there were just so many coincidences and contrived plot points. Throughout the book clues essentially fell into Emma's lap, to an extent where it struck me as laughable that the police could have overlooked some of these things for fifteen years.That's not to say that I didn't enjoy the book, though. I had a lot of fun with this. But when I take a step back from the readability factor, I think the overall construction of The Last Time I Lied could have been stronger. But I still devoured it. And I think some people will take issue with the (outlandish?) final reveal, but personally I loved it - that was exactly the jaw-on-the-floor kind of shocking twist that I loved about Final Girls so much. Sager knows how to keep you hooked until the last page, that's for sure. If you're looking for a good and gripping beach read this summer, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this.Thank you to Netgalley, Dutton, and Riley Sager for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Jun 11, 2018","Jun 17, 2018","Mar 26, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36626748-the-last-time-i-lied

I actually expected to like it even more than Asking For It, as I prefer adult to YA for the most part. So I was surprised when it fell a bit short of Asking For It for me, but ultimately I did find it to be every bit as engrossing and incisive as I know Louise O'Neill is capable of.The striking thing about O'Neill's writing is the way she's able to elucidate these hard-hitting realities that are so common to the female experience, but so often underrepresented. The reason Sarah stays with Matthew in this book is one that I see so little in fiction and so much in real life. The reader has certain expectations from the beginning: this relationship is clearly terrible, so there must be a concrete reason that Sarah is putting herself through this. The sex must be amazing (it isn't), or Sarah gets something in return - money or social status (she doesn't), or it's clear that Sarah and Matthew love each other and their love is doomed by factors outside their control (this is not the case). Sarah stays with Matthew because his wanting her validates her sense of self-worth. Louise O'Neill confronts head-on the fact that women are socialized to believe that our bodies are not for our own pleasure; our own feelings are secondary; maintaining the relationship, however terrible, at all costs should be our main objective.As with Asking For It, the real triumph of Almost Love is the protagonist's unlikability. Sarah is awful, and O'Neill doesn't skirt around that. We aren't supposed to 'like' Sarah, we aren't supposed to want to take her out to dinner or bond with her. The fact that Sarah is an atrocious friend is pretty clearly established. What works about it is how O'Neill, again, is challenging this conception that a woman's worth is tied up in her likability, in how she's perceived by others. Yes, Sarah creates a lot of her own misfortunes here, but this situation is so intrinsically tied with how women are socialized from an early age, so it's important to look at the bigger picture here while considering Sarah's own situation. Maybe Sarah doesn't deserve the world, but she does deserve common human decency in the way she's treated by others. It's not a particularly earth-shattering concept, but it's one that O'Neill gets to the heart of deftly.Where it fell a bit short for me was in being very dialogue-heavy, it did a lot of telling rather than showing. I thought the prose in Asking For It was quite mature for YA, but it was so startlingly similar in Almost Love that it almost suffered for that comparison I had in my head - that this worked for a YA novel, and I was expecting something a bit more... elevated here? Which is partially my own personal hangup with genre expectations that I'm trying to break away from, but anyway. This didn't blow me away and shatter my soul the way Asking For It did, but it's still an important and engaging book that I didn't want to put down for a second....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"May 13, 2018","May 21, 2018","Mar 23, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35958295-almost-love

I studied art history extensively in college, I love Artemisia Gentileschi, and the promise of a story from her perI really wanted to love this book. I studied art history extensively in college, I love Artemisia Gentileschi, and the promise of a story from her perspective was so tantalizing that I ended up ignoring my suspicions that this book was going to be too young and too heavy-handed for me. I really should have listened to my gut on this one.Artemisia Gentileschi was an Italian Baroque painter, whose works are often overshadowed by the fact that she was raped by her mentor, Agostino Tassi. She and her father Orazio took him to trial and eventually won the case, though she was subjected to torture to verify her claims, and Tassi only served two years in prison before his release. Blood Water Paint is a novel in verse told from Artemisia's perspective, which focuses mainly on her rape and the subsequent trial, which explores the way she drew on the biblical figures Susanna and Judith for inspiration.Look, I am a self-proclaimed feminist. I could not agree more with McCullough's indictment of the patriarchy, her lament of how women are treated in society, the parallels between Artemisia's circumstances and the #MeToo movement. The problem is, she sacrifices subtlety and authenticity at the altar of these ideas. This book is one of the most maddeningly simplistic, binary, melodramatic, and anachronistic things I've ever read. While the word 'feminism' never appears in this book (thankfully - not because I don't like the word feminism, but because it isn't a concept yet in in the seventeenth century), we do see a lot of hot-button issues that we'll all recognize, like:(Why, though, does it takea mother, daughter, sisterfor men to take a woman at her word?)and:If I wait it out, he'll go.I learned this as a child:When boys pull your hair,it means they like you.Just ignore them.... which, I'm sorry, but narrated from the perspective of a seventeen-year-old girl in 1610 just strike me as laughably unbelievable. Not because these aren't universal, timeless ideas, but because they're stated so eloquently by this character who I hesitate to even refer to as Artemisia because she is so transparently a mouthpiece for the author.I'm not saying that it's impossible to write a historical novel that focuses mainly on themes which don't have an established vocabulary or some kind of developed social discourse at the time the book is set. I recently read and loved On Chesil Beach by Ian McEwan, which deals primarily with asexuality in a time before the term was coined, and the way McEwan handled the subject was done with subtlety and brilliance. I guess I was just looking for more of this here, I was hoping for a more nuanced and intellectually stimulating rumination on the themes in this book, rather than having everything stated so plainly and positively shoved down the reader's throat. (I mean, I guess it's also worth noting that Blood Water Paint is YA, so maybe I'm being unfair here, but I'd argue that it's even more unfair to posit that YA doesn't have the capacity to be more nuanced than this.)There's also another element to this whole thing that admittedly grates on me. As I've said, I really love Artemisia Gentileschi. But the way she's become a cipher for contemporary feminism I think does a disservice to the complexity of her character, as well as to the sundry other groundbreaking female artists we tend to overlook in holding Artemisia up as this feminist poster child. So when I say that I wasn't impressed with the research and historical accuracy in this novel, I'm not trying to be some kind of academic purist. It just felt like the author had seen a tumblr post about how 'Artemisia Gentileschi painted herself as Judith and her rapist as Holofernes!!!1! Badass feminist ICON!!!!' and spun the novel out of this half-formed idea of who Artemisia actually was. The few times the art itself is referenced also suggests to me that McCullough is out of her depth. If you're looking for historical accuracy, please pick up one of the many brilliant biographies written about Artemisia, notably those by Mary Garrard.So, to wrap up this novel length  (sorry, thanks for sticking with me): This is a book of (relevant, necessary) 21st century feminist concepts that try to masquerade themselves as Artemisia Gentileschi's story at the expense of narrative, character development, and subtlety, which I felt ultimately did a disservice to its protagonist. But clearly I do not hold the majority opinion about this book, and that is perfectly fine. There are many brilliant and eloquent s which discuss this book's virtues, if that's what you're looking for....more",Notes are private!,-1,83,1,"Jul 03, 2018","Jul 05, 2018","Mar 18, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35540804-blood-water-paint

After recently loving Rooney's sophomore novel Normal People my expectations for Conversations With Friends were high, though I was also a bit wary; in these situations I'm always afraid an author's debut isn't going to live up. I needn't have worried. This was perfect from start to finish. You know that feeling when you miss a stair and your stomach lurches briefly before you land - this was that sensation in book form.Once again I was impressed with Rooney's writing; it's simple and seemingly effortless, but the kind of natural and conversational cadence she achieves is no easy feat. The simultaneous intelligence and lack of life experience of the narrator, Frances, were captured so convincingly; from the start this was a person that I wanted to understand, whose head I wanted to inhabit briefly. Sally Rooney writes about interpersonal dynamics with such skill and ease and sharp observation, and that was the shining point of this novel, but whenever Frances looked inward, those moments were also captured with the same unnerving clarity. I related to Frances and I didn't; I saw bits of myself in her and I found bits of her unreachable. But Rooney made me care, she earned my investment as I watched with sympathy and frustration and anxiety as Frances attempted to navigate an awkward, ill-thought-out affair with an older married man, a dynamic which only complicated her limited understanding of love, class, status, artistic freedom, and belonging.If you can't handle books about unlikable, selfish people, you aren't going to enjoy this, and in that sense alone I don't necessarily believe this book transcends its premise. It's about unlikable, selfish people, many of whom are blind to their privilege. It's not about the kind of people you want to be, or want to be friends with. But if you're willing to sacrifice likability for realism, and an unpredictable plot for moments of startling self-reflection, this is the book for you.

I'm at a complete loss for words with this book - I just want to shove it into everyone's hands who has ever asked 'if the relationship is abusive, why doesn't she just leave?' Kandasamy answers that question with unapologetic candor, in this semi-autobiographical novel that fuses lyricism with forthrightness in a way that's utterly striking.The narrator in When I Hit You is an aspiring writer and a self-proclaimed feminist, who falls in love with a university professor who, to all outward appearances, is intelligent and charming. Not far into their marriage he begins to show his true colors, physically and verbally abusing in an effort to bully her into submission. She eventually escapes - we know this from the first page - and the book flits back and forth between before and after, though not necessarily in a linear chronology that alternates the two.

It's the most unflinching look at the psychology of those who endure domestic violence that I've ever read. But it's also politically charged, and keen to examine the broader role of women in contemporary society, and it also critically examines any kind of 'feminist' discourse that places blame upon those who are unable to escape abusive relationships.

To say that I have conflicting feelings about this novel would be an understatement; it's like every singular element of this novel draws two completely contradictory reactions from me. I both admire it and find it insufferable at the exact same time.Let's start with the prose, which is what everyone is going to be talking about when they talk about Sight, and rightfully so. It feels like Jessie Greengrass's sentences go on for days, each one carefully crafted to show very evident technical skill. Some of these sentences are striking, with poignant, meaningful commentary on the human condition:""I want only what I think we all must want: to come off as better than I ought, more generous, more sure--kinder than I know myself to be; but I want also to be known, to be counted and to be excused. I can't have both.""Some, not so much:""All morning, caught up in the business of appointments, I had forgotten to feel sick, but now it returned, the constant queasy ostinato over which rose exhaustion's disharmonious cadence, a progression paused before the point of resolution, aching forwards.""I mean, 'I had morning sickness' would have sufficed, but okay.After a while of immersing yourself in this prose, what first feels lush and fresh begins to feel methodical and calculated - even the variances of syntax have a very distinct rhythm to them. At times I would get lulled into it, and at others, it would feel like it was written by a particularly verbose robot. The interesting thing about Sight is that while it endeavors to reflect on the human condition, it does so in such a measured way it's almost as if it's devoid of all humanity. This is a book and a character that wants to be able to reduce the human experience to a series of elements which can be scientifically categorized, made evident by the heavy integration of medical history into the narrative.That brings me to my next point, which is that Sight is very light on the narrative. This entire book is driven by the narrator's fixation on her relationship with her mother, on whether or not she wants to have a child, on her ownership of her own body - and while I'd take character-driven novels over plot-driven novels any day, I hesitate to even call this character-driven, because by the end of it, we still know hardly anything about this person. For all the navel-gazing in this novel, we don't even know where this character works. Does she even have a job? No, this isn't the point, but it also makes it harder to fully immerse yourself in this character's world.There's another line, ""but the price of sight is wonder's diminishment"" which I think not only sums up this character's introspective journey, but also, for me sort of characterizes the book as a whole. This is a book which dives into themes which I ordinarily find interesting - how well can we truly know other people, how well can we know ourselves - and examines them so thoroughly, it leaves almost no room for the reader to actively engage. I feel like this is one of those novels which attempts to ask questions of its readers without being particularly interested in their answers, because you can find all of the answers in its pages. I mean, maybe that's not even a bad thing. It just doesn't get me particularly excited.I admire the technical skill that went into this novel, but it ultimately didn't leave as strong of an impression on me as I had hoped it would. But there's a lot of thoughtful commentary in these pages, and it's worth a read if you like your books heavy on the philosophy.Thank you to Netgalley, Hogarth Press, and Jessie Greengrass for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Apr 10, 2018","Apr 22, 2018","Mar 09, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36212526-sight

I think part of it is that it's been so long since I read a police procedural that I was ready for a foray back into the genre. It's still not my favorite type of thriller, and I probably won't pick up another one any time soon, but I think I'll check out the next book in Olivia Kiernan's series whenever it's published. The plotting in Too Close to Breathe was intricate, the subject matter was darker than dark but not particularly gratuitous, the characters were compelling, and the writing was mostly really solid (except for one dialogue which actually involved the line ""Blah! I don't go in for that kind of mumbo jumbo."" but I guess we can't have everything). This book also made me really want a bonsai tree (or more accurately reawakened my desire to own a bonsai tree - this has been an ongoing Thing for me), so all in all I'd say it was a success.I do have some qualms - I found that there were a couple of gargantuan leaps in logic, mostly involving the way the detectives profile the killer (at one point a man tries to stab a woman but she gets away, so they deduce from practically zero information that he's probably married and that he has a fetish for mutilating women and since this attempt went awry he'll most likely try again... what???), and certain details behind the legal proceedings were a little far fetched, but oh well, maybe I couldn't entirely suspend my disbelief, but I don't know, sometimes I find nitpicking to be so tedious. I raced through this book, especially the second half - it's undeniably engaging and entertaining and that's pretty much all I could ask for.I also really loved Frankie's character, which is the main reason I'm interested in continuing this series. I'm a huge fan of flawed female characters, and Frankie's tragic backstory was less a tragic backstory than one traumatic event that happened a few months back, and I like that Too Close to Breathe begins when Frankie's still in the middle of dealing with the aftermath. Overall, a promising start to what I hope ends up being an interesting series that will inevitably draw comparisons to Tana French - definitely worth a read if you're a fan of the crime-thriller genre.Thank you Penguin First to Read and Olivia Kiernan for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Mar 09, 2018","Mar 22, 2018","Mar 07, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36161451-too-close-to-breathe

It's also the most derivative book I've ever read.Look, I don't usually mind when the influence of another author is clearly present in a novel. Writers are influenced by other writers, this is how art has always been created. If We Were Villains is like The Secret History; The Book Collector is like Rebecca. It happens. But where the novels I just cited each have their own voice, their own distinctive characters, their own intriguing stories to tell, Rainbirds just... doesn't. My main problem with this book is that I've read it before, but it was called The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle then.I do like Murakami, but I have to admit there's a certain formula to his novels. Clarissa Goenawan follows that formula to a T. There's the apathetic, attractive-yet-disinterested protagonist, Ren (Toru Okada, Toru Watanabe), the fiesty young loner girl who captures his interest, Seven Stars (May Kasahara, Midori...), and several alluring women who wallpaper the background of the novel, all of whom confide inexplicably in the protagonist and share their life stories with him. The Apathetic Everyman protagonist is searching for something, but he isn't quite sure what, and he needs to be drawn into the lives of these random strangers in order to achieve clarity, in some roundabout way. And there's also a sort of magical realism influence where the atmosphere is just a bit odd and we have to listen to characters relay their dreams in exhausting detail.I mean, even the chapter headings are like this:The BubblegumWorld and theWoman with a Moleon the Back ofHer NeckThis isn't a 'fans of Murakami will love this novel' situation, it's just... why don't you just read Murakami instead?Anyway, even the tone of the novel is trying very hard for the elegant simplicity that Jay Rubin achieves in his English language translations of Murakami, but here it comes off as sophomoric rather than intentionally artful. Sentences like ""The day my sister died, a part of me died, too"" and ""I was shocked to find her in my class. Was it fate?"" and ""As I was flipping through one of the books, a piece of paper fell out. Something told me it might be important"" caused more than a few eye-rolls.As for the story itself, there is nothing original or noteworthy here. It's not really a mystery, or a thriller, or an introspective character study (that would be a stretch, since Ren has literally no personality), or the exploration of small-town Japanese culture that it claims to be. It's just a collection of quirky characters telling Ren their stories while he sleeps with a bunch of different women (even though he has a girlfriend the entire time) who are inexplicably drawn to him, even though he has all the charisma of soggy cardboard. Here's where Murakami's influence really began to annoy me - I feel like there's an undeniably masculine thread to all of his novels that Clarissa Goenawan was in a perfect position to subvert, as a female writer, but instead she gives us a thoroughly uninteresting male protagonist and tells us to root for him without giving us much reason to.The atmosphere was nice and it held my attention the entire time, and I certainly didn't hate this passionately enough to warrant a 1-star rating, but I'm just... not sure what I was supposed to take away from this book aside from the knowledge that Clarissa Goenawan is a massive Murakami fan....more",Notes are private!,0,59,2,"Mar 31, 2018not set","Apr 02, 2018not set","Mar 01, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33026565-rainbirds

I've actually yet to read The Beauty Queen of Leenane, but I much preferred this to A Skull in Connemara. It's about two brothers living alone after their father's death, getting into arguments about mundane things that often escalate to physical violence.Reading this play was a very quintessentially McDonagh experience: tension is high, but broken by dark, irreverent humor, and characters are all pretty much terrible people, and it should be irrevocably bleak for that, but there's an undeniable quality of tenderness. As always, McDonagh doesn't offer redemption or resolution. His stories are never about villains becoming heroes. But there's still a glimpse of hope, that maybe people can change - certainly not in the course of a two-hour long play, but maybe eventually.The dialogue in The Lonesome West was as witty and biting as ever, but there was also such an openness and honesty to it that I found refreshing. This exchange in particular struck me as rather beautiful in its simplicity, and as always I love McDonagh's use of dialect.

It hasTin Man is a beautiful, tender, deeply moving novel that packs a far greater punch than I would have thought possible for its short page count. It has all the heart and heartbreak of something like The Heart's Invisible Furies - and not a watered down version, either, just more compact. I put it down feeling drained and devastated and deeply impressed at the extent to which such a simple story was able to get under my skin.Tin Man is told from the alternating perspectives of Ellis and Michael, two childhood friends who once fell in love. But at the beginning of the novel, Ellis is alone and grieving for his dead wife, and Michael is nowhere to be found. The rest of the story puts the pieces together in a non-linear fashion, creating snapshots of Ellis' and Michael's lives until we finally see the full picture.From the very first page this is an achingly lonely and bittersweet book. My heart felt heavy even before we learned why exactly Ellis is grieving, because the atmosphere is rife with nostalgia and regret; the characters are all consumed with missed opportunities and thoughts of better days. It's hard not to connect to the novel's emotionality to some degree, even before you're pulled into the story that is uniquely Ellis' and Michael's. And what great characters they are - flawed and unhappy and afraid to grasp at the happiness that's within their reach.This book makes me appreciate the art of brevity in storytelling - Winman's prose is incisive and her execution of this story is succinct; not a single word is out of place and not a single page is wasted. Tin Man manages to be a subtle yet thorough meditation on first love, freedom, solitude, and the indelible marks we leave on each other's lives. By the end of this I wanted more, out of a selfish desire to stay immersed in these pages even longer, but nothing was missing.

I felt like I was getting whiplash from the amount of times I veered from admiration to frustration and then back again. An American Marriage chronicles the doomed romance of Roy and Celestial: the two have a passionate (if slightly tempestuous) relationship, but only a year and a half into their marriage Roy is sentenced to 12 years in prison for a crime they both know he didn't commit.The first section of this book is, in my opinion, the most compelling. We watch Roy and Celestial's marriage crumble through a series of letters they send one another while Roy is in prison. It's hard not to be moved by the situation's tragedy at this point: there's never any question that Roy and Celestial love one another, but torn apart by circumstances outside of their control, the cracks that begin to form are unavoidable. Roy and Celestial aren't particularly likable characters, and their relationship isn't necessarily one we find ourselves rooting for, but I do have to admire the way Tayari Jones allows her protagonists to be imperfect. In part 2, the novel's momentum comes to a screeching halt. While the first hundred pages take place over five years, the next two hundred take place over a couple of days. So what was shaping up to be a rather pacy read becomes a bit of a slog at this point, and an oddly melodramatic one. And while Tayari Jones offers some wonderful and incisive commentary throughout about race, marriage, and parenthood, I did feel like the element of racial injustice in the US legal system was a bit underdeveloped. Instead the novel's premise ultimately felt like a rather perfunctory backdrop which was being used to explore the strain a marriage undergoes while the partners are forced to separate. Certainly an interesting theme, but after several hundred pages of this I was hoping for a bit more depth in other areas which instead felt a bit contrived and simplistic.But I will say, what I admired the most about this novel was how equitable it was. I didn't feel like Tayari Jones was trying to manipulate the reader into taking either Roy or Celestial's side, and I felt like she was very cognizant of the fact that there are no easy answers in a situation as convoluted as this one. So ultimately I'm just a bit torn - this was at times exhilarating and at times boring; sometimes incredibly perceptive and sometimes underdeveloped. I think this is a worthwhile read and a worthwhile addition to the Women's Prize 2019 longlist, but ultimately it wasn't as impactful as I thought it would end up being when I first picked it up.

It's unfortunate that a lesbian neo-Victorian thriller should be this devoid of passion and suspense, but as it stands, this was a rather dull and middling read.From the very first page, everything about this book feels contrived. The premise is frankly absurd: a down on her luck young woman named Hester living in the slums of London gets into an accident one day and is rescued by a handsome and charismatic doctor who insists that she stay with his family to recuperate, and then be tutored by his sister so she has the opportunity to improve her station in life, and if that all sounds a little convenient, it's because this entire book is driven by coincidence and plot devices. Characters go through the motions as if in a pre-rehearsed pantomime; no one at any point feels present. The decisions they make seem to be solely in the interest of driving the plot forward; all rationality and logic is utterly abandoned to tell this story.The writing itself is both stilted and melodramatic, a combination that lends itself beautifully to 337 pages (not that I was counting) of telling rather than showing. There isn't a single personality trait to be found in any one of these characters, but even so, we are simply bashed over the head with Hester's heavy-handed narration in which she extols the virtues of her tutor Rebekah. But even that is a bit misleading, because I'm not sure what these virtues are, exactly; only that Rebekah is the greatest person to ever have lived. Hester also likes to spell out exactly what is happening at any given time, in case we missed it: ""With one faithless action I have changed the direction of both our destinies and unwittingly discarded my chance of future happiness."" This isn't the kind of thing you should have to say; you should have faith as an author that this is being communicated by the narrative itself. You shouldn't need your characters to narrate the story to the reader as they're living it.I really did want to love this, but frankly the whole thing felt silly and ridiculous, and not at all the sinister and atmospheric gothic novel I had been hoping for.

It also made a great audiobook, as Noah narrates it himself, and he's clearly a born performer and storyteller.I loved the anecdotes that featured Noah's childhood, particularly regarding his complicated relationship with his black mother and white father growing up under apartheid. It's a great example of a memoir which mixes human interest with a focus on the sociopolitical backdrop, drawing connections between the two, though after a while I found that I was most interested in the sections of this book where Noah talked about apartheid and South African culture. The personal anecdotes added a warm and comedic touch, but Noah's insights into the culture and history of his country were really what appealed to me about this memoir.The shift in focus to his adolescence is what dropped this from 5 stars to 4 for me. A really strong opening gave way to a rather aimless middle section which devoted far too much time to exploits about bootlegging CDs and trying and failing to get a date. It eventually regains its footing and the final chapter in particular is excellent, but I felt my interest waning for a while there.Another reason I'd recommend the audiobook is that the prose itself isn't as polished as it could be. Noah has a tendency to deal in superlatives - I lost track of the number of times I heard a phrase like 'I'd never been so scared in my life' or 'that was the happiest moment of my life.' As anyone whose writing I have ever edited can attest, repetition is probably my biggest pet peeve, but it's mercifully not quite as grating when you're listening to Noah tell his own story with such passion.Anyway, my few qualms aside, I did really enjoy this - I found it both entertaining and eye-opening.

Instead I’d seen it billed as a coming-of-age novel about a gay footballer, and I suppose I thought the football/soccer would be mostly backdrop. Reader, it was not backdrop.There’s a reason this book is 400 pages, and it’s because Ross Raisin details just about every single match, every single inner working of this low-level soccer club, with unerring precision. And for the first half of the book, it was frankly driving me mad. But then in the second half of the novel, when we start to dive into the meat of the story – our protagonist Tom beginning a relationship with the club’s groundskeeper – I found that my frustration with Raisin’s narrative choices was beginning to abate. Yes, I still found the soccer talk endlessly tedious, but the criticisms that I’d had (that soccer was the foreground, Tom’s story was the background, how does this make for a compelling narrative at all, why hadn’t an editor come at this manuscript with a machete) started to mostly* fly out the window, because it’s impossible to deny how well-crafted this book is. It’s a slow burn in every sense of the phrase: it’s a slow-paced story, and (unless you’re riveted by soccer) it withholds its rewards until you get to the end.*I did have another criticism that never fully faded, though I began to understand it more in the second half: why certain chapters were given to the perspective of a married couple, one of Tom’s fellow footballers, Chris, and his wife Leah. Their story does dovetail with the central narrative and I do understand the decision to include their point of view, but I’m not convinced that we needed as much detail here as we got.I know I’m doing a pretty poor job of selling this or explaining my 4 star rating (hang in there!), but the thing is, I’m not sure that this is a book I’d widely recommend. It takes patience and perseverance and if I were in the habit of DNFing I probably would have called it quits at the halfway mark. But if this sounds at all like a story you’re willing to commit to, it gets really, really good. Raisin navigates the homophobic world of professional sport with a deft hand, meditating with perception on themes of performative masculinity, shame, and the tension between the inner and outer selves. I think Raisin is a tremendously gifted writer, and the way he renders the relationship between Tom and Liam is so palpably fragile that it’s almost painful to read at times. So while this book wasn’t perfectly targeted to my preferences as a reader, I do think it’s a gem of a book that I’m glad to have read… and ultimately to have stuck with....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Apr 07, 2019","May 05, 2019","Feb 01, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36074937-a-natural

Ryan's style is everything I love about contemporary Irish literature incarnate - the lyrical, almost breathless writing which deftly balances black humor with an aching sadness, the quiet introspection of his characters, the skillful exploration of pain and loss and grief and religion and loneliness.From a Low and Quiet Sea is essentially a series of three short stories - the first follows Farouk, a Syrian refugee who pays a man to help him escape his country with his wife and daughter; the second is about Lampy, an Irish teenager who lives with his mom and grandfather and who's still desperately in love with his ex-girlfriend; and the third follows John, an old man who grew up under the shadow of his brother's death. Their stories converge at the end rather unexpectedly, but in a way that I thought was rather brilliantly conceived.As with any novel that changes perspectives, it's inevitable that some will be stronger than others. The opening chapter - Farouk's - is far and away the most accomplished of the three. Ryan doesn't rest on the already tragic premise; he crafts a positively harrowing journey for this character, and as we wrap up his story and proceed into the second section, it's almost painful leaving him behind. John's chapter is stunning as well - it's the only one told in first-person, as his story takes the form of a confession - and of the three it's the most episodic, lending it a very readable quality while still getting to the heart of this troubled and compelling character. For me, Lampy's chapter was notably the weakest. Though there was some poignant commentary here about growing up fatherless, I felt that there wasn't enough of a story or a character arc to justify this section's length.This is one of those books that was stressing me out as I headed toward the conclusion, because I couldn't even begin to imagine what was going to connect these three disparate stories, and I was almost afraid that whatever Ryan had come up with wasn't going to be satisfying enough. I needn't have worried - the resolution is surprising but gratifying. There's also an undeniable thematic interconnectedness that I thought was handled wonderfully throughout the book. I thought Ryan's examination of the role of storytelling in the lives of these three men was a beautiful element, as well as the similar yet distinct meditations on loneliness and grief as each of these characters search for some kind of peace. 4.5, which I'm rounding down now for the weak middle section, but which I may round up later depending on how this book stays with me over time.

Seeing the startlingly unprofessional behavior of the officers investigating Marie was painful; they would take minor inconsistencies in Marie's story and blow them out of proportion, having never been trained to recognize that assault victims often have scattered recollections.  But if there's one thing that saves this book from being a total downer, it's that T. Christian Miller and Ken Armstrong emphasize the department-wide changes that were instigated in the way officers are trained to deal with assault victims, that came about as a result of this incident.  I think this should be required reading for anyone in law enforcement handling a sexual assault case. I will say, one thing I would have liked from this book is more of a focus on the historical precedent of disbelieving women - Miller and Armstrong put the effort in here, but their research is essentially relegated to a footnote in Marie's story, whereas I felt like there was room for more interrogation into the socio- and psychological factors that underscored the particular narrative that they chose to highlight. There was also a certain discomfort in the back of my mind whenever I thought too long and hard about the fact that this book's two authors are both male - a bit of unpleasant irony given that the book's core conceit is advocating for the voices of women.  But to my pleasant surprise, this was actually addressed in the author's note; the discomfort has been assuaged a bit knowing that this book's editorial team was entirely female, a number of female experts were consulted, and Marie herself was able to weigh in on the manuscript before it was published....more",Notes are private!,0,40,1,"Sep 23, 2019","Oct 22, 2019","Jan 05, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/45213813-unbelievable

Nobody likes to be understood without warning.""My goodness, was The Italian Teacher ever my kind of book. I didn't love it from the very first page - admittedly with a book about characters called Bear and Pinch I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to look past my hatred of quirky names long enough to actually pay attention to what I was reading - but once over that hurdle I settled into this easily and could not put it down.The Italian Teacher follows the life of Charles 'Pinch' Bavinsky, the son of a renowned contemporary American artist, from infancy to adulthood. Pinch is a character who manages to be sympathetic, pitiable, and contemptible at all once, and it's interesting to watch this transition; at what point do we stop feeling for this neglected child and start hating the spineless man he becomes? Rachman never really answers that question and I love this novel all the more for that; this book is all about the sins of the father and the complicated, lasting, ugly effect they have on the son. Pinch idolizes his father, who the reader easily recognizes as arrogant and misogynistic, but Pinch is consumed with Bear's renown in the art world; likewise, he pities and fears becoming his luckless mother Natalie. To Pinch, Bear is success and Natalie is failure.But the influence of Natalie can strongly be felt throughout the novel - in fact, she's the only one who calls Pinch by his nickname rather than his real name, Charles, but still he is 'Pinch' in the third-person narration. His mother is his sole confidante and only friend throughout his childhood, but still he abandons her as soon as he is able, driven by his tunnel vision to live a life worthy of his father's legacy. As he navigates life in his father's shadow, there's a wealth of commentary on art vs. the artist, and the cost of creative genius, that make this book a clever, entertaining, and deeply sad read.Frankly I just loved everything about this. (Other than the characters' names.) I loved the setting in the first section of 1950s Rome because I used to live in Italy, I loved Rachman's clear knowledge of 20th century art because I studied the same thing in college and I cannot tell you how much I adored it, I loved that Pinch's favorite artist was Caravaggio because my favorite artist is Caravaggio, I loved these characters' complexity because I would choose depth over likability any day, I loved the sharp writing and wonderfully entertaining storytelling and the insight into the many themes that Rachman so expertly explored. This isn't going to be for everyone - namely, I'd advise you to avoid if you can't abide terrible, self-involved characters and you find discussions of art tedious - but this was just the perfect storm of everything I could want in a book, and I was so captivated by it....more",Notes are private!,0,40,1,"Dec 05, 2018","Dec 08, 2018","Jan 03, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31937362-the-italian-teacher

Having been granted only 3 travel visas to Hong Kong for 4 family members, Seok Koon is forced to leave one of her children behind in order to legally exit the country, and Kirsten Chen explores the ramifications of this harrowing decision.Bury What We Cannot Take is actually everything I had hoped Girls Burn Brighter was going to be. Both novels follow two parties which have been separated and which spend the novel seeking a reunion, and in both cases, these stories are filled to the brim with tragedy. But where Girls Burn Brighter indulges (at least in my opinion) a bit too heavily in the gruesome details of its characters' plights, Bury What We Cannot Take is more interested in the kind of resilience needed to survive. Though the chapters which follow the left-behind child can be difficult to read, I felt that the narrative was approached with sensitivity, and it quickly earned my emotional investment. This novel is deceptively short for 300 pages, and as a result, my only complaint is that at times it felt a bit rushed.

It's a fantastic look at Communist China and its insidious regime, which follows a host of complex, sympathetic characters aged across multiple generations.

It follows Mick Dowd, who each year disinters bones from the local cemetery to make way for new arrivals. When he's forced to dig up the remains of his late wife, questions arise about his possible involvement in her death.What I enjoyed about A Skull in Connemara is exactly what I enjoy about all of McDonagh's plays: morally corrupt characters, the banality of small-town life highlighted with humor and irony, morbid humor, razor sharp dialogue. I mean:MAIRTIN: What kind of questions, Mary beag?MARY: Questions about where did he put our Padraig when he dug him up is the kind of question, and where did he put our Bridgit when he dug her up is the kind of question, and where did he put my poor ma and da when he dug them up is the biggest question!MAIRTIN: Where did you put all Mary's relations, Mick, then, now? The oul bones and the whatnot.That's pretty great.Anyway, this isn't one of McDonagh's stronger stories. His characters aren't as well-developed as usual - the relationships between them and their motivations remain hazy, and the result is that I'm just not as invested as I'd like to be. In typical McDonagh fashion, his characters are all distinct and wacky, but none here are as memorable as Katurian from The Pillowman or Padriac from The Lieutenant of Inishmore. Maybe the right cast and the right production could breathe some life into this. I enjoyed reading it well enough, it was an entertaining enough way to spend an hour, and the final scene was definitely thought-provoking, but there was a certain lack of gravitas that McDonagh usually is able to incorporate into his black comedies. The biggest problem here is that the stakes in this play are low and they feel low, and I know McDonagh can do better. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Dec 25, 2017","Dec 26, 2017","Dec 25, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/412775.A_Skull_in_Connemara

The novel starts out with a short prologue about an old woman being interviewed by a journalist about her garden of trees. In only two pages, it was lovely, touching, and hard-hitting, everything that I hoped the rest of the book was going to be.The story then begins with two girls, Poornima and Savitha, who become fast friends in their adolescence, who work together for Poornima's father, weaving saris. Tragic circumstances soon pull them apart, and they spend the rest of the book searching for one another.This book is brutal. That in itself is not something that turns me off. I mean, you know me - the darker the better is pretty much my unofficial motto. What began to grate on me was how gratuitous and pointless so much of this brutality was. Shobha Rao makes her point early on. Girls - particularly in India - are given an absolutely terrible lot in life. This book is a celebration of that female-specific resilience, and that's what attracted me to this book to begin with. But there is just no end to the suffering Poornima and Savitha go through, for absolutely no narrative reason. It's hard to talk about this without giving specific examples, but basically, it started to feel like torture porn after a while. Keep in mind that one of my favorite books of all time is A Little Life - if you look at the negative s of that, of which there are many, 'torture porn' is a phrase that you will see crop up quite a bit. But I absolutely object to that, because not only does the heightened pathos of that narrative fit the quasi-surrealist tone of the novel, but Hanya Yanagihara has something to say about the extreme suffering and trauma that those characters go through. In contrast, I wouldn't say that Shobha Rao has nothing to say - just that she says it, very early on, and then doesn't add anything else. This isn't helped by the fact that the book also begins to take on a very monotonous, telling-instead-of-showing tone. ""This happened to Savitha. Then this happened. Then Savitha did this. Then she went here. Then she went there. Then this happened."" That was pretty much the entire second half of this book. It's just like, at a certain point, we get it. This  is turning out a lot more negative than I had intended. I was actually planning on giving this three stars at first. It's readable, educational about Indian culture, and I genuinely cared about Poornima and Savitha. But the amount of suffering these characters went through was so excessive it eventually deadened my emotional reaction, which was obviously the opposite effect from what the author had intended. I think this book has important things to say - I just wish it had undergone more rigorous editing, and adhered to the tried and true adage less is more.Thank you to Flatiron Books and Shobha Rao for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,298,1,"Feb 11, 2018","Feb 24, 2018","Dec 21, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34275212-girls-burn-brighter

I first heard of this book when it was one of Book of the Month's options for December, and when I think about Book of the Month, I usually think: commercial, will appeal to a wide audience, best-seller potential (lest I come across as a literary snob, these aren't bad things! I love Book of the Month.) Anyway, I think if I'd have read this then, I may have been more forgiving. But reading it as a part of the Women's Prize longlist, I had other elements in mind: is this book going to be 'literary,' does it have a strong artistic vision, does it break barriers and push the envelope and give us something truly original? Reading it in this context, I found it hard not to be slightly more critical.This book has two real strengths for me - the examination of the importance of friendship, trite as it may sound, is actually incredibly touching, and Eleanor's narrative voice is fresh and unique. Eleanor's budding friendship with Raymond was a huge strength; I found their interactions to be genuine and rather heartwarming. And Honeyman's prose is excellent, it's smart and witty, and Eleanor herself is particularly noteworthy for how unlikable she is (you guys know this is something I love). This isn't a manic pixie dream girl situation where a protagonist waxes lyrical about how shy and awkward and 'different' they are, but the most alternative thing about them is that they have brown hair. Eleanor is authentically an outcast, and the fact that she's gone her whole life without any friends is a fact which is absolutely supported by her behavior throughout the book.However. There were certain elements that didn't work for me: namely, Eleanor's character development over the span of this novel (which takes place over the course of a few months) to me felt hackneyed and unrealistic. When she and her coworker Raymond help and elderly man who's fallen over in the street, this sets into motion a chain of events for Eleanor, and suddenly she finds herself in unprecedented social situations: going to bars and parties and other people's houses. I think the problem for me is that there's an emotionally manipulative undercurrent here - it's constantly shoved in the reader's faces how alien these experiences are to Eleanor, which for me at least left little room for my own emotional reaction, when I was being told exactly what to think. I don't necessarily object to this novel's treatment of trauma, but I do think it was somewhat lazy the way every single one of Eleanor's idiosyncrasies were narratively pardoned by this traumatic event in her past, and how, with the introduction of Raymond into her life, she's not only willing to quickly uproot so many of her routines which had been firmly in place for years as coping mechanisms, but also confront her past in a way she never had before. It was just too much too soon.For the most part I enjoyed the humor in this novel, but there were so many moments which felt like they were being played for cheap laughs and didn't ring true for me. I get that Eleanor has had a very difficult and unconventional life, but am I really supposed to believe that a thirty-year-old woman who's lived her entire life in the UK doesn't know what McDonald's is, or refuses to give her name to a Starbucks employee because she thinks it's a breach of her privacy, or doesn't recognize a high-five? There were a lot of moments like this which I felt sort of compromised the realism of Eleanor's character, which is a shame, as she is someone that I believe a lot of readers will be able to relate to.Who knows what I'm trying to say. I liked this and I didn't. I get the hype and I don't. Maybe I read this at the wrong time, or maybe I'm just the wrong reader for it. Who knows. I'm being critical, because I didn't love this book, but I actually did enjoy reading it and got through it rather quickly. I've just got too many nagging criticisms, and I don't think this will stay with me in any sort of significant way....more",Notes are private!,0,48,1,"Apr 24, 2018","Apr 27, 2018","Dec 21, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31434883-eleanor-oliphant-is-completely-fine

Part novel, part memoir, part poetry collection, The White Book ultimately comes together to form a poised and tender examination of grief and the transient nature of life and death.If you've read The Vegetarian or Human Acts you'll know exactly what to expect from Kang's economical and unsentimental prose, translated brilliantly from the Korean by Deborah Smith. But The White Book is more abstract than either of its predecessors, fusing form and content to create a rather unique reading experience. Kang inserts black and white photographs; plays with the physical spacing of the text to assert a visual element into her novel, which only makes sense for a book which is thematically anchored by a color. There's a sort of hypothetical narrative that runs through the text - Kang imagining a life for her sister - but it's a rather abstract and experimental distillation of this idea, rather than a traditional plot-based narrative.This didn't hit me quite as hard as The Vegetarian or Human Acts, but I still found it striking and I think Han Kang is a genius and her working partnership with Deborah Smith is the gift that keeps on giving.

This book had all the potential in the world to be eerie and gripping and moving, but it sadly dropped the ball.This is not a mystery about a girl's disappearance; at the heart of Whistle in the Dark is Jen and Lana's fraught relationship, which feels almost claustrophobic. You want to take both characters by the shoulders and scream at them for their inability to communicate with one another. Which isn't a criticism - I thought the tension in this relationship was Whistle in the Dark's biggest strength, even if it wasn't the most pleasant reading experience.I just felt like this book didn't quite know what it wanted to be. It was part crime thriller, part literary character study, and all the while just spinning its wheels, never really going anywhere. The same ideas are recycled ad nauseum in a sort of cyclical format that doesn't suit the kind of depth that Healey is trying to achieve here. I feel like there's a lot that could have been said about mental health, religious fanaticism, and motherhood, but none of this is fully realized. Instead we chronicle Jen's almost comical levels of paranoia as she over-analyzes every breath that Lana takes, which gets old after several hundred pages.This also has some of the most trite dialogue I've ever read - this is one of those books where no one talks like an actual human being, but instead pontificates with the articulation of a philosophy scholar, speaking in bizarre abstractions and it ultimately detracts from the realism of their characters.I think most readers are going to be very unhappy and underwhelmed by the ending, but I actually didn't mind it. I think it's important not to think of it as a twist or a reveal, necessarily, just kind of... a logical conclusion? I don't know. But I liked the way it was done and I liked the closure Jen was able to glean from that. I just wish it hadn't been such a drag to get to that point.

Freshwater is utterly unique, and the result is breathtaking. It's a dark, sensual, and thoughtful novel about a young woman coming to terms with and accepting the multiple identities that define her.The details of Ada's life - raised in Nigeria, relocated to the U.S. for college - are only an elemental framework for what is ultimately an introspective story. The majority of this book is narrated by a chorus of Ada's selves - conceptualized as Nigerian ogbanje - until a traumatic assault in college causes two of these selves to take shape, as Asụghara and Saint Vincent.What I found so stimulating about this novel is that it challenged a lot of my conceptions about health and identity, particularly in how these are often so heavily informed by western culture. The perceived objectivity of psychology is something I've always found comforting and taken for granted, but with this book, I'm reminded of the significance of the relationship between culture and identity.

This is a vaguely unsettling, eerie tale of three sisterThe Water Cure was nothing like I expected, but I ended up enjoying it all the more for that. This is a vaguely unsettling, eerie tale of three sisters who were raised by their parents on a remote island to fear all men other than their father. They believe the outside world is dangerous and toxic, and they regularly perform painful rituals and 'therapies' to cleanse themselves. But then their father vanishes without a trace and three strange men wash up on their shore, and the novel takes place over the span of the week that follows.The biggest surprise for me was that I was expecting a Handmaid's Tale-esque feminist dystopia, but in reality I wouldn't actually describe this book as a dystopia at all. I think a certain amount of ambiguity in this regard is intentional, especially at first, and I think there is going to be some healthy debate about how you can read this book, as a lot of questions deliberately go unanswered. But if the appeal of dystopias to you is the worldbuilding and big picture stuff, The Water Cure will undoubtedly disappoint. To me this felt more like an allegorical contemporary (or if not contemporary, at least set in the very near-future) whose strength lies more in its exploration of complex interpersonal dynamics than in its merit as a dystopic text. I'd compare it to King Lear or The Beguiled (and I would not be surprised if Sofia Coppola directed an eventual film adaptation) over The Handmaid's Tale or The Power.But for me, its inability to fit neatly into the 'feminist dystopia' genre is only an asset. Sophie Mackintosh has created something strong and uniquely unsettling. Her prose is remarkably lyrical, and the insular setting she crafts is at once immersive and claustrophobic. This is a novel whose themes exist slightly below the surface, and though it has a lot to say about gender roles and social dynamics and what it means to exist in modern society as a woman, none of this leaps off the page at a quick glance. There's an incredible amount of depth and subtlety here, especially for such a short novel.The biggest problem - really, the only problem - I had with this novel was that I was occasionally unconvinced by the fact that these sisters had lived their entire lives so removed from society. Not only were their vocabularies littered with colloquial phrases in a way that seemed at odds from how their parents spoke, at times they drew generalizations about human nature in a way that didn't ring true for someone with such a limited world view. But this is something I found myself forgiving more and more as the novel went on, as it ultimately had the air of a fable, and I didn't find myself too hung up on the details.Basically, don't expect another Handmaid's Tale, but don't think it isn't worth your time because of that.

And indeed, I was prepared for McBride's signature and singular prose style, a terse, choppy sort of stream of consciousness that mimics the incompleteness of thought. It's a difficult style to warm up to: I've heard that listening to this book on audio can help, but personally I tried that and as I'm not an auditory learner at all, I found it much more comprehensible in print.

But more than that, this book is a raw and unfiltered look at sex, isolation, terminal illness, and sibling bonds, and though it's relentlessly internal in its construction, a commentary on growing up as a young woman in Ireland beautifully underscores the entire thing. The protagonist remains nameless, something that I often find gimmicky and unnecessary, but here it works perfectly as a constant reminder of the narrator's fractured sense of identity as she finds herself defined by the horrifying things that happen to her and around her as a young girl.

This is more a nineteenth century If I were prone to feeling guilt over enjoying the things I enjoy, I would classify this as a guilty pleasure book. This is more a nineteenth century soap opera of a novel than a literary gothic mystery, so you'll do well to check those expectations of a second coming of Rebecca at the door before starting The English Wife. But I have no reservations at all saying that I loved this. Sure, the writing is occasionally sophomoric; characters let out breaths they didn't realize they'd been holding; the word 'belied' is used approximately eight thousand times; the dialogue is often trite and heavy-handed, but for whatever reason, I found myself not caring. I was swept away by this incredibly well-crafted mystery that blends suspense and romance with the vibrant atmospheres of Victorian England and Gilded Age New York.The novel begins at a ball in upstate New York in 1899, when wealthy socialite Bayard van Duyvil is found with a knife in his chest, and his wife, Annabelle, has vanished, presumed dead. There are two point of views in this book - that of Bay's wife, in flashbacks, and his sister, Janie, in the present. Both were compelling heroines who I found myself rooting for wholeheartedly. This is the kind of book where every character has secrets, and uncovering them all is a highly entertaining process. Some of the twists are excellent, others are rather predictable, but it's an undeniably twisty ride from start to finish. And getting to the bottom of the identity of the novel's central character, Annabelle, was the most compelling element for me.Bottom line: this book was fun and enthralling enough to compensate for its many flaws. Highly recommended for anyone looking for somewhat mindless Victorian escapism....more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,"Dec 08, 2017","Dec 16, 2017","Dec 01, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34945222-the-english-wife

Miranda is the older, responsible one, who's spent her life looking after her younger sister, Lucia, impetuous and free-spirited. Throughout her adult life, Lucia grapples with an undefined mental illness (doctors are unable to determine if it's schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or something in between), and Miranda struggles with the guilt of never being able to help her sister quite enough.What's particularly striking about this book is how Mira T. Lee balances an array of perspectives, which serves to challenge the reader's perception on a single issue. We flit back and forth between Miranda, Lucia, Manuel (Lucia's young Ecuadorian lover), and Yonah (Lucia's husband), and we stay in each of their heads long enough that they genuinely feel like real people, each with their own strengths and biases and shortcomings. We hear from Lucia both when she's lucid and when she's wrestling with what she refers to as the 'serpents' in her mind, which provides us with a hard-hitting and candid exploration of how 'real' Lucia's paranoia and delusions feel to her. Lee also highlights the sad truth that there are often no easy answers when it comes to addressing severe mental illness - at different times in her life Lucia tries medication and hospitalization, and while I'm happy to say that this is not a narrative that maligns medication in any way (it's ultimately a rather pro-meds message), the reality of medicating doesn't provide Lucia with a simple solution, which is often the case. It's an important narrative that I think will resonate with anyone who's grappled with mental illness at some point, and I'm hoping that books like this and Chemistry will succeed in starting some conversations about the stigma surrounding mental health in our society.But back to the narrative - I do have a few complaints. (1) It was too long by about a hundred pages. The plot stalled at about a third of the way through, and though the pace eventually rectified itself, there was still a lot of filler. I was initially sure I was going to breeze through this book, but for a while there in the middle picking it up was kind of a drag. (2) I'm not a fan of first and third person being used together in novels. I've seen it done well (e.g., Burial Rites by Hannah Kent) but for the most part it doesn't work for me. Here it felt arbitrary and stylistic. The effect Lee created with the multiple POVs could have been easily achieved with exclusively either first or third person. (3) The timeline was occasionally unclear - there would be big time jumps between two chapters with hardly any indication. But all that said, I mostly really loved this. Everything Here is Beautiful is a powerful and moving novel. Mira T. Lee comes out of the gate strong with this debut, taking on issues of mental health, immigration, familial duty, motherhood, and national and cultural identity. I'd highly recommend this to fans of Celeste Ng, Min Jin Lee, and/or Weike Wang.Thank you to First to Read and Mira T.

As if the subject matter isn't disturbing and harrowing enough - an 18-year-old girl is raped and then ostracized fAsking For It is a difficult book. As if the subject matter isn't disturbing and harrowing enough - an 18-year-old girl is raped and then ostracized from her community because of it - Louise O'Neill's approach to this story is ruthlessly, unnervingly honest. Emma O'Donovan's story isn't one of healing and closure and happy endings, and it can be hard to read because of that, but it shows an important side to this story that we don't often see depicted in fiction. The most striking thing about Asking For It is how unlikable our heroine Emma is. The first quarter of the book is devoted to her treating her friends rather poorly and treating prospective partners like trophies; she's stuck-up, vain, and self-centered. She wears short skirts and low-cut dresses, she drinks a lot of alcohol and takes drugs recreationally, and when she's raped by four boys, the question in absolutely everyone's mind - from her classmates to her parents to strangers who pass her on the street - is 'wasn't she asking for it?' Louise O'Neill challenges this absolutely vile conception of what a 'good victim' should look like: someone who's a virgin, who dresses modestly, whose trauma responses fit perfectly into the DSM-5. People like Emma (though she's fictional, she's all too real) don't fit into this mold and their allegations of rape are often met with disdain, which is why it's all the more critical that we support them.Obviously, a book tackling an important and difficult subject matter doesn't in and of itself make it a good book, so I'm glad to say that I was blown away by Asking For It on just about every level. O'Neill's writing is stunning (I did such a double take when I flipped to the back cover and saw how young she is - not that young people can't be good writers, obviously! but this book is nearly flawless on a technical level). Her characters are three-dimensional - Emma isn't an archetype straight out of Mean Girls; she's pretty and popular and vain, but it's all rooted in a deep sense of insecurity that's tied heavily into her upbringing, which O'Neill deftly explores in the way Emma relates to her family. I also liked that I didn't at any point feel like I was being preached to, which is something I occasionally feel while reading YA as an adult. O'Neill explores these issues with subtlety and doesn't shy away from asking difficult questions of her readers. My one minor critique is that the rate at which secondary characters are introduced at the beginning of the novel is a little excessive - the first thirty or so pages were me going 'wait, who is that?' - but once over this hurdle, the book settles into a gripping pace. This book isn't going to be for everyone, and I'd certainly advise that you proceed with caution if you're triggered by this subject matter or if you struggle with anxiety (my heart was racing pretty much the entire time I was reading). But it is such a critically important contribution to the discussion of rape culture. O'Neill fearlessly advocates justice for all rape victims, not just the ones whose stories are easier to digest, that fit better into our conceived narrative of what 'counts' as rape. We need to stop blaming rape victims and start listening to their stories, full stop....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Mar 23, 2018","Mar 24, 2018","Nov 16, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25255576-asking-for-it

I love reading something that has me laughing out loud on one page, and has me covering my mouth in horror on the next. Mastering that tonal shift is a fine line to walk, but Marina Carr manages it with aplomb here.By the Bog of Cats is a play about a traveller woman called Hester, who feels a deep connection with the bog she lives on, but who's being forced to leave because her former partner is now marrying a younger woman and the two of them forced Hester to sign over the rights to her property. Throughout the course of the play we see Hester defend her relationship to the land, while she's also tormented by memories of the mother who abandoned her.Though there are more than a fair share of comedic moments, the heart of By the Bog of Cats is pitch-black, and the conclusion is absolutely harrowing. It's also a deliberate nod to Greek tragedy, and I am nothing if not predictable. I absolutely loved this. I read it in an hour this weekend, but I'd love to see it performed live one day.

Young Skins is a collection of seven short stories that all take place in the same town, and often the same pub, with a few overlapping characters, but which mostly stand on their own. Each story focuses on a male protagonist, usually young, all in some way navigating working class life, post-Ireland's financial collapse. It's very rare that I give a short story collection 5 stars; it's to be expected that in a collection like this, certain stories are going to shine and certain others are going to fade into the background. Though I loved Barrett's prose throughout, this collection really wasn't an exception to the rule - there are stories I loved and stories I found to be rather forgettable (though thankfully none I outright disliked).The Clancy Kid was a strong opening, introducing us to the gritty, bleak backdrop of young love turned to heartbreak that characterizes so many of these stories, as well as the kind of violence that permeates male youth culture. Bait is a tricky one; I'd been loving it, up until the very end where it takes an... incongruously supernatural(?) turn that I still haven't fully made sense of. (If you've read this story, please tell me your thoughts on the ending.)The Moon didn't leave much of an impression on me, though this is where Barrett states a lot of the collection's thematic conceits rather plainly, which makes it a solid addition (a young, flighty woman says to our protagonist at one point ""Galway's not that far[,] but it might as well be the moon for people like you."") And I thought Stand Your Skin was maybe too thematically similar to The Moon, though Stand Your Skin is the one I preferred.Calm With Horses, the collection's magnum opus, is more of a novella than a short story, nearing 100 pages. In my opinion this story stands head and shoulders above the rest, and it's not just because of its length. I think this is where Barrett is able to really stretch his legs and show us what he's capable of. Various characters and subplots weave in an out of this one and all dovetail in a satisfying, heart-rending conclusion. I really hope Barrett has a novel in the works.Diamonds I think is solidly the weakest story that doesn't offer much that we can't already find elsewhere. And Kindly Forget My Existence is a fitting ending, where Barrett eschews his young protagonists in favor of two middle aged men who sit down at a pub and discuss their own youth. So, as with most short story collections, a mixed bag, but it's worth the price of admission for the stunningly tragic Calm With Horses alone, and the rest of the stories mostly hold their own as well. Dismal and hopeless as this collection is on the whole, there's an assured beauty to Barrett's prose that I found very striking, especially for a debut, and I can't wait to see what he does next....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Mar 21, 2019","Mar 23, 2019","Nov 16, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/22571882-young-skins

But that's okay. Instead, it's a concise and thought-provoking introductory text for anyone interested in feminist theory, who maybe isn't quite sure where to start.Women & Power is a combination of 2 essays, which each began as a lecture that Mary Beard - classicist and outspoken feminist - gave somewhat recently in her career. The first essay concerns itself with the role of women in the public sphere, and the precedent of silencing women's voices, using both historical and literary examples. The second essay shifts to our societal conception of power as a male-dominated domain, to which women are still somewhat grudgingly granted access.My main piece of advice going into this is to keep your expectations reasonable and remember the page count. If you don't find this kind of brevity suitable for this subject matter, this is definitely not the text for you. But if that doesn't put you off, I'd highly recommend taking an hour to read this. Mary Beard's ideas are brilliant and well-articulated, and the way she links current events with classical precedents is something that I found particularly engaging and unique about this. This isn't exactly a treatise on where we go from here, on how we change the way we have perceived power for so long, which some may find disheartening, but Beard leaves this question up for discussion and contemplation.

And I guess there's nothing wrong with a little sappiness now and The Child Finder is a very strong contender for the sappiest book I have ever read. And I guess there's nothing wrong with a little sappiness now and then, but, I'm not kidding -""This is something I know: no matter how far you have run, no matter how long you have been lost, it is never too late to be found."" - this book was so saccharine I felt like I had to brush my teeth at the end of every chapter. I'm sorry but is that not the corniest sentence ever written???Anyway, let's back up. The Child Finder is a thriller (the least thrilling thriller of all time, but I guess that's how it's being classified) about a woman who finds missing children for a living. Though there are some seriously dark and disturbing themes in these pages, the narrative voice reads at a level your average ten-year-old would be comfortable with - it is painstakingly, aggravatingly childish. This book is the rather unfortunate result of someone actually sitting down and saying 'you know what stories about pedophilia need? More whimsy.'But, you know what, I think a certain type of writer might have been able to pull this off. I'm thinking of something like The Pillowman by Martin McDonagh (a play which balances fairytales with a harrowing exploration of child abuse), or Elmet by Fiona Mozley (which fuses dark themes with the narrator's childish innocence in a way that's subtle and breathtaking). But the integration of fairytales in The Child Finder was just so goddamn heavy-handed and patronizing. This book was trying so hard to be poignant and moving (despite having nothing of substance to say about trauma or child abuse) it was actually a little embarrassing.I mean, this is the quality of prose and dialogue that I'm talking about:""I loved you then. I loved you, no matter where you came from. No, scratch that."" His voice floated up to her. ""I loved you because you came from wherever it was. It must have been a magic place to produce you.""Naomi felt something deeper than crying, a flush in her womb. ""Are you trying to talk your way into my bed?"" she asked, her voice thick with emotion.""No."" His voice sounded warm. ""I'm trying to talk my way into your heart.""You have to be joking, right? Is this a Lifetime movie??Aside from all that, Naomi has to be the most exasperating protagonist of all time. She's actually referred to, constantly, as 'the child finder,' because that's not weird at all, I guess? and anyway, she is the most alluring woman alive. I know this because every man she comes into contact with immediately wants to have sex with her. And her personality consists of the fact that she only trusts three people - a fact that we're reminded of at least once a chapter - and... that's just about it.I could go on and on. The subplot about Danita was transparent and emotionally manipulative. The actions and sophistication of the five year old girl, Madison, stretched all suspension of disbelief beyond breaking point. The romantic subplot was contrived and obvious. Every single sentence was either corny or trite or overwritten or some combination of the three. The story unfolded so predictably, there was not a single moment of genuine suspense. The resolution couldn't satisfy itself with merely tying up the main plotline in a neat bow - it had to tie up several minor plotlines in neat bows too, lest Rene Denfield credit her audience with the ability to think for ourselves.I'm definitely in the minority with this one - at a glance I don't think any of my Goodreads friends have rated it less than 4 stars. And admittedly the atmosphere of this snowy Oregon forest was captured beautifully. That's the only positive thing I can think to say. Maybe the audiobook was a bad decision - maybe it just exacerbated the feeling I had that I was being preached at. But you cannot convince me that reading this book on paper would have eradicated its sundry narrative faults or convinced me that this is anything other than twee drivel masquerading itself as a deep and profound reading experience.

Because this feels more like a 400 page prologue than it does an actual book. But I'm willing to overlook the spectacularly poor pacing and haphazard plotting if the rest of the series actually builds on the foundation Stiefvater set up here, and she definitely hooked me enough that I want to keep going with it.I'm still not totally sure what to make of this premise (apparently this series is about a group of students trying to find a dead Welsh king, WHO KNEW, not me), and I think the execution was a bit of a mess. The first 200 pages are total filler; the villain's backstory is awkwardly shoehorned in without much exploration; perspective shifts aren't employed effectively (sometimes I couldn't tell whose head we were in until the end of a chapter); information that could have been withheld in order to build tension is readily offered up to the reader at all times; and the ending just kind of... plateaus without much of a climax.

Unbury Carol is not a bad book by any means - it was just not the book for me.I recently read and adored Bird Box, and even though the summary for Unbury Carol seemed about as different from Bird Box as anything could be, I had enough faith in Malerman's storytelling to confidently dive in. What I found was a very bizarre story, sort of a spaghetti western-horror-fantasy-fairytale hybrid. Basically, Carol Evers has this condition where she goes into a coma for days at a time, and while she's unconscious, she appears dead - you have to wait for a full minute to feel a pulse. When she slips into a coma at the beginning of the novel, this time her husband Dwight is conniving to bury her alive and steal her fortune. When he gets wind of what's going on, a notorious outlaw - and Carol's ex-lover - James Moxie, has to ride the Trail to Carol's town, racing against time to save her.Here's my main problem with Unbury Carol: it relies on and perpetuates one of the most tired tropes of all time - the damsel in distress. That's essentially what Carol is for the duration of the book. Whether Malerman eventually subverts this trope by having Carol save herself (which is hinted at early on as a possibility), I can't say without getting into spoiler territory, but the fact is, rather than focusing on Carol herself, the majority of this novel is told from the point of view of male characters who have a vested interest in Carol's fate: her husband Dwight, her former lover James, and a criminal called Smoke who's hired to prevent James from reaching Carol in time. As an avid reader, it feels stale, and as a feminist, it feels insulting, to have Carol's story stripped from her and framed around so many male characters. To clarify - Carol does have POV chapters. I don't think everyone is going to agree with my assessment about her lack of agency - you could even argue that that's the point, to illustrate the injustice of male characters having to fight for Carol's sake. It just didn't quite sit right with me, especially from a male author. I think any good intentions Malerman may have had with this book got swallowed up by a sort of unwieldy execution.The good news is that Malerman still has a great way with words, and I flew through this pretty quickly. I liked several of his characters, too, especially Carol's young and intelligent housekeeper, Farrah. Fans of westerns will probably be especially riveted by this story, which does well to evoke an old-timey western atmosphere, even though there are more fantastical elements than you'd traditionally expect. But the fact that I couldn't even make it through Westworld probably should have clued me in that this wasn't going to be for me.Thank you to Del Rey and Josh Malerman for the ARC received in exchange for an honest .

I saw well why the gods do not speak to us openly, nor let us answer. Till that word can be dug out of us, why should they hear the babble that we think we mean? How can they meet us face to face till we have faces?”This book is something rare and extraordinary. Though ostensibly a retelling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche (I'd recommend reading Lewis's afterward before you begin if you're not already familiar with the story, as he provides a succinct summary), it's told from the point of view of one of Psyche's sisters, Orual, a princess cursed with an ugly face. I think if I'd been informed before starting this book that so much of the focus would be on Orual rather than Psyche, I would have been disappointed - and that disappointment would have been very misguided indeed, because Orual captured my heart. This strong, flawed, broken young woman is honestly one of the most complex and haunting female protagonists I've come across.I hadn't read any C.S. Lewis except for the first three (I think) books in the Chronicles of Narnia series when I was younger, and, as evidenced by the fact that I only read the first three (I think), I was not a huge fan. Honestly, he was an author I never had much interest in, but after reading Till We Have Faces, I am distraught that more of his fiction doesn't appeal to me (I'm not a big science fiction fan). I love his writing - the passage I quoted above is only one of many that I had to pause and reread because I found his prose so striking.It's hard to summarize this book, or even fully wrap my head around it, as it's one of the more thematically complex things I think I've ever read. It's a book that almost demands to be read more than once. That's not to say that it's dense to the point of incomprehensibility - I read it in two days, and doing so was an absolute joy. But Lewis provides a thoughtful meditation on beauty and ugliness (with a startling commentary on how a woman's worth is wrongly determined by her appearance), as well as the symbiotic nature of love and hatred, before delving into even deeper philosophical and theological themes, examining the very nature of man's relationship with God (or, in the case of mythology, the gods). It's heavy stuff, but in a rewarding way. This book will stay with me. (Also, on a personal note, I'm not religious. I can't comment on whether having a vested interest in Christianity is essential for reading any of C.S. Lewis's other works, but I found that, despite the religious themes, this was really not the case here. I'd recommend this to absolutely everyone.)Till We Have Faces achieves everything I like to see in a retelling - it fleshes out the stories of minor characters who only play bit parts in the original, it interrogates and expands on the original themes, and it captures the wondrous atmosphere that makes mythology so compelling.

This book is absurd and unapologetically so, and once that clicked for me it ended up working incredibly well--arguably even better than Pride and Prejudice, which is a practically faultless book, unlike Northanger Abbey which is something of a structural mess, but which still left me a bit colder than this one did.What I continue to dislike about Northanger Abbey is its central romance. There's no sense that Cathy has met her match with Henry Tilney, or he with her; instead their dynamic where her youthful naivety meets his playful condescension makes my skin crawl. (As someone who's accustomed to liking books about unlikable characters, this ended up being much more of a sticking point for me than I thought it would, and probably points to my lack of familiarity with the romance genre.)Anyway, I think I partially like this book for how unpolished and imperfect it is, and of the three Austen novels I've read so far, I think this is the one I'm most likely to return to. I keep thinking about it while Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice have almost left my mind entirely.Previous  from 2017 which I have to keep in here as I find it quite funny now:This was the single most inoffensive reading experience of my life.

This book floored me... but I would be lying if I said I enjoyed every minuteOccasionally infuriating and impenetrable but undoubtedly a masterpiece. This book floored me... but I would be lying if I said I enjoyed every minute of it. I'm having a particularly hard time arriving at a star rating because Ali Smith is a genius and I want to read everything she's ever written (this was my first time reading her), but I found this book inspired and frustrating in equal measure.How to Be Both is comprised of two halves - one of these follows Francescho, a female Renaissance painter in the 1400s who disguises herself as a man to legitimize her art, and the other follows George, a teenage girl living in Cambridge in the present day, recovering from the death of her mother. Half of the editions printed of this book have Francescho's section first, and the other half start with George's.I had Francescho first, in a twist of fate that I believe ultimately worked out in my favor. Starting with Francescho is undoubtedly the more difficult approach to this novel - when ordered this way, Ali Smith is essentially taking your hand and asking you to stumble around in the dark with her, until you reach the end of George's section and have this stunning, wondrous moment of clarity that makes all of the precursory confusion worth it. Based loosely on the life of the Renaissance artist Francesco del Cossa, Francescho's section is written in experimental, playful, tonally anachronistic prose which is fierce and unapologetic, though undeniably frustrating at times. Sometimes there's a difference between recognizing the author's intent (i.e., sacrificing historical authenticity for a modern tone was a very deliberate literary decision that ultimately did serve Smith's larger goals with this novel) and appreciating the effect: though I knew it wasn't The Point, I kept wishing the setting of 1400s Italy would come to life in a more convincing way. Every time the words ""just saying"" came out of the mouth of a Renaissance artist I got jolted out of the story, which in a way feels like quite a pedestrian complaint when Smith's vision was so much loftier than a simple historical story, but I'm not going to pretend that I was so swept away by the novel's postmodern structure and philosophical musings that I was happy to eschew all conventions of setting, plot, and character development.Goerge's half is the much more traditional of the two, and the section I did ultimately prefer, but having read them both it's hard to conceive of one without the other. Admittedly as I headed into George's section, I was not convinced that these two disparate narratives were going to dovetail in a satisfying way. They do, of course, because Ali Smith knows exactly what she's doing, as obvious thematic parallels begin to emerge (the role of names in shaping our identity, art's versatility and timelessness, the relationship between perception and reality), but the two narratives ultimately do begin to play off one another in a much more literal way than I had been expecting. Reading through positive s of this book, what I find so wonderful is that the Francescho people and the George people are both convinced that starting with their section is the Correct way to experience this book. That's how you know the premise isn't a gimmick, because there's really no consensus about which works better. Though the order of the two stories obviously does have a huge bearing on the experience you have with it, it's exciting that two different novels are essentially coexisting inside this one book - the two novels not being George and Francescho, but George-Francescho and Francescho-George. Again, I think starting with Francescho is the more difficult way to approach the novel: if you start with George, you'll have a better idea of the big picture as you embark on the second half, but having that delightful 'oh, now I get it' moment as everything ties together at the end was half the fun for me, so I'm glad I experienced this book the way I did.Even though I didn't like this book 100% of the time I did ultimately love it, and I cannot wait to see what else Ali Smith has to offer....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Jun 30, 2018","Jul 17, 2018","Oct 17, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23164913-how-to-be-both

I hadn't really heard much about the plot of this book going into it, and honestly, that's how I'd recommend approaching it if at all possible, because it just sweeps you up into such a compelling and unexpected tale from the very first page.The characters in this book are all brilliant and well-crafted, none more so than Evelyn, our ruthless and at times unlikable protagonist.

Though it's only been a few days since I've finished this, I can already tell that Evelyn is going to be utterly unforgettable. But Evelyn didn't entirely steal the show away from this book's host of intriguing supporting characters - each one of them was so three-dimensional it was easy to forget this story is entirely fictional. There were several elements that ended up being hugely pleasant surprises - the inclusion of several LGBT+ characters being the main one (I won't say too much more here so I don't spoil anything, but, suffice to say this book is not half as heterosexual as its title would imply). What also surprised me was how invested I became in this story. I flew through this 400-page long book in only 2 days - I couldn't put it down and I was rewarded with a conclusion so beautiful and bittersweet it brought me to tears.Everyone should read this book.

On the one hand, it was compulsively readable and at times rather hard-hitting, and on the other, I found the effort as a whole rather trite. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't particularly striking or memorable. In the novel's prologue, in 1969 New York, the Gold siblings - Varya, Daniel, Klara, and Simon - visit a Romani fortune teller, who tells each of them the date they're going to die. The Immortalists is told in four sections, one for each of the siblings, and one by one, we see a snapshot of each of their lives, ending in each of their deaths.It's a chilling and intriguing premise, but Chloe Benjamin doesn't really do a whole lot with it. My problem with this book is that it was just so... obvious? Imagine you're told beyond a shadow of a doubt that you're going to die young. You'll probably shape your life decisions around the short-term, and live in the present, and these are the very careless actions that will probably end your life. This is the premise of the book, and each of the Gold siblings' fates unfolds in a similarly straightforward manner. I really wanted something more, I wanted Benjamin to dig in a bit further, to explore this theme from a less obvious vantage point. But I ultimately didn't get much more out of this book than if I'd stuck to reading its summary. As a whole, the four sections are rather well balanced. I think everyone is going to have a preference for which sibling's story they prefer, but each is similarly well-researched, and I don't think there's a clear objective frontrunner, or one that's notably weaker than the others, which is a good thing for a novel of this format. Unfortunately I did find that each of the sections suffered from the same issues - unclear timeline, emotionally manipulative plot points, the role of certain characters being ridiculously contrived (notably Eddie). Though this book is relentlessly depressing, the only part I found viscerally difficult to read was Varya's section, and the descriptions of the experiments Varya's lab conducts on primates. Though it was a comparatively small part of the book (if each of the siblings' sections comprises 25% of the book, the plight of Frida the monkey is only about 25% of that 25%), I found myself so upset by this one scene that I almost regretted reading this book at all. Thankfully Chloe Benjamin acknowledges her passion for the welfare of primates who have been used for lab research in her afterward, but animal lovers, approach this section with caution.I have no doubt that many others will love this book, but I can't help but to be somewhat underwhelmed. One last thought - maybe people with siblings will feel a stronger connection to this story than I did?Thank you to Netgalley, Putnam, and Chloe Benjamin for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,70,1,"Dec 14, 2017","Dec 19, 2017","Oct 09, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30288282-the-immortalists

So it wasn't a desire to keep up with the Hogarth series that drove me to click 'request' on this title - I was drawn to it because for whatever reason I just really, really like King Lear. The main question on my mind as I was reading was: what exactly is the purpose of a retelling? I don't think there's ever going to be a definitive consensus on this subject, as I'm sure some of us prefer our retellings on the more literal side, while others prefer them to be more abstract. But in general, I'd say that for a retelling to be a success, that the book should pay homage to the original while still adding something new to the story - maybe exploring certain themes present in the original in greater depth.So with that in mind, how did Dunbar fare? I can't quite make up my mind. Dunbar is a contemporary spin on the tale in which the titular figure is a Canadian media mogul, whose company is currently being usurped by his two vindictive daughters, Abby and Megan. The story begins in medias res, with Henry Dunbar in a care home somewhere outside Manchester, telling the story of how he was betrayed by his two power-hungry daughters, and how he regrets betraying his other, loyal daughter, Florence, by cutting her out of the trust.While it doesn't follow King Lear to a T, it really only ever deviates by omission. (The subplot with Edgar and Edmund isn't really present at all.) But where it zeroes in on the relationship between Lear and his daughters, Dunbar is an extremely literal retelling. I mean, Regan is actually called Megan. On the one hand, it was done very well, and on the other, there wasn't a whole lot left to the imagination.Interestingly, one facet of Lear that I thought went unexplored in Dunbar is actually one of its most salient themes: the fraught balance between fate and chaos - how much of our human nature is free will and how much is predetermined by planetary influence? The passages in which Henry Dunbar grapples with his 'madness' I thought were some of the weakest, and they really missed the opportunity to delve into this theme. Instead, this is a very stripped down King Lear, which ostensibly focuses on the reconciliation between Dunbar (Lear) and Florence (Cordelia). It was well done in its own right, but I couldn't help wanting more out of this story.Dunbar was also my first encounter with Edward St. Aubyn, who admittedly I hadn't even heard of before now, but I have to say that for the most part I was impressed. His writing is lively and clever; I was awed by his intelligence on more than one occasion. I'll readily admit that as someone with essentially zero knowledge of the stock market, a lot of the details of this book went right over my head - but St. Aubyn still kept me engaged, with stakes that consistently felt high even when some of the details escaped me.Bottom line (insofar as I am able to give a bottom line when I'm as conflicted as I clearly am about this book): as a novel in its own right, Dunbar was strangely riveting and stimulating. As a King Lear retelling, it left a lot to be desired. Nevertheless, I did really enjoy reading this, and was fully prepared to give it 4 stars until its overly hasty conclusion, which unfortunately left me dissatisfied. 3.5 stars, rounded down.Thank you Netgalley, Hogarth, and Edward St. Aubyn for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Oct 12, 2017","Oct 18, 2017","Oct 03, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33797939-dunbar

Though it had been initially ruled as a suicide, Rosemary's husband, George, becomes convinced that Rosemary had been murdered - which means the culprit was necessarily one of the six guests in attendance that night.Interestingly, the question of who could possibly have poisoned beautiful, well-liked, friendly Rosemary is quickly answered - it turns out that each of the guests in turn had their own motive. So instead the question becomes: who actually did it? It was refreshing that Christie's approach here was to rule out several potential culprits, rather than spending the majority of the novel searching for motive.As always with Christie, I found myself doubting my predictions at every twist and turn. The person I settled on about 65% into the book did end up bring the right one, but I'm still waiting for the day I read one of her books and can choose the murderer early on with a certain amount of confidence.

Now they're each happily married with children, successful in their careers as doctors, and still as close as ever. But when a figure from their past resurfaces in their lives, a charming surgeon called Nick Xenokostas, the two are forced to confront events from their third year of medical school that they've long since put behind them.My feelings about this book are extremely mixed. I've never seen Grey's Anatomy, but I get the impression that this is basically Grey's Anatomy in book form - a sort of melodramatic, over the top but engaging medical drama, which relies on entertainment value to compensate for its narrative faults.My main criticism is how the alternating point of views of Zadie and Emma were written. Neither of them had individual voices, at all - occasionally my mind would wander for a minute, I'd come back to the book and think I was in a Zadie chapter, and then I'd read the sentence ""Zadie said to me,"" before realizing oops, I was actually in an Emma chapter. That's not to say that Zadie and Emma were two iterations of the same person - the differences between them are clearly highlighted - they just happened to have the exact same narrative voice. It's an easy trap to fall into when you have two alternating first-person perspectives, so I wish Kimmery Martin had varied their vocabulary or syntax of speech slightly, especially given the differences in their upbringings.There was also a lot about Zadie's character that never quite rang true for me. We're told so often how charismatic she is, how people naturally gravitate toward her, but none of that charisma is reflected in Zadie's narration. To me, Zadie always struck me as competent, intelligent, and caring, but none of these things in abundance - she just seemed like a very average sort of person. And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. It just didn't quite add up with what we're told about her.Emma, on the other hand, I absolutely loved. She too is initially presented as competent and intelligent, but there is so much more going on beneath the surface which is gradually uncovered throughout the course of the story. I thought her narrative arc was brilliant and sad and so realistic - she's the kind of character who's so human that you don't like the bits of yourself that you see reflected in her. That was extremely well done.I think I'm going to have to go with 3 stars, though... I did quite like this overall - it was a quick, entertaining, and at times emotional read - but the occasionally sophomoric writing and amateur construction of Zadie's character dragged it down for me. (Not to mention the way Zadie's three-year-old daughter talked... god, I have never encountered a more annoying toddler either in real life or in literature.) I would recommend it though, especially if you're interested in stories which examine female friendships.One last note - this book is very heavy on the medical side of the medical drama, so if you can't stomach graphic descriptions of medical procedures, this is definitely not the book for you.Thank you to Netgalley, Berkley, and Kimmery Martin for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Jan 21, 2018","Jan 25, 2018","Sep 29, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/35142025-the-queen-of-hearts

Namely: an alcoholic, unreliable narrator who has information that no one believes, and a fascination-bordering-on-obsession with the couple next door. But I think seasoned thriller fans are going to be disappointed at just how predictably The Woman in the Window unfolds.I mean, don't get me wrong, I positively devoured this book. I read the bulk of this more-than-400-page book in one day. It's compulsively readable, the chapters are short, and it keeps you on your toes. But for me it was one of those things where I got to the end and was like, 'that was it?'This was a sort of mixed bag of predictability for me. There were two main twists - one that admittedly shocked me, and one that I saw coming virtually from page one. But for the most part, The Woman in the Window relies heavily on tried and true thriller formulas. It's plenty twisty and addicting, but, entertainment value aside, it doesn't really have much to contribute to the genre.The other thing that I found virtually insufferable about this book is how the author felt the need to insert his opinions about film noir and old thrillers onto just about every page. We get it, A.J. Finn, you've seen a lot of movies. This did absolutely nothing to further the narration, and resulted in a pretty ham-fisted attempt to force a Hitchcockian vibe onto the novel, which would have been altogether stronger without this heavy-handed comparison to Rear Window being shoved in the readers' faces.Bottom line: reading this was a fun way to spend an afternoon, but it's been a week since I finished it and I'm already forgetting characters' names, so that's not a particularly good sign for this novel's lasting impact. I won't go as far as to dissuade others from reading this, especially if you're curious about the book that may very well end The Girl on the Train's reign as the most oft-referenced psychological thriller, but I think it's a good idea to go into this with lowered expectations. It's entertaining but underwhelming.Thank you to William Morrow and A.J.

Lu Rile is in her late 20s, squatting in an Artists in Residence abandoned-warehouse-turned-apartment in Brooklyn which is so run down it should be condemned, working three jobs and trying to break into the competitive arts scene. When she accidentally captures in a self-portrait the image of a young boy falling to his death, the photograph turns out to be stunning, and Lu is forced to decide if she should destroy the print out of respect for the grieving family who she ends up befriending, or if she should use it to launch her career. (There's also a supernatural element to the story, as Lu believes she is being haunted by the ghost of the boy who died - though whether this element is literal or a manifestation of Lu's internal turmoil, I think Rachel Lyon leaves that for us to decide.)Lu is one of the best anti-heroines I think I've ever read. She's fueled by an almost ruthless ambition, but so vulnerable that I found myself sympathizing with and rooting for her, even though she never asks you to. She's not a warm narrator and she doesn't ask for pity, but she's all the more honest and compelling for that fact. When she looks at her photograph she's forced to confront the very nature of art itself and the role of the artist - is it her responsibility to spare the feelings of this boy's family, or does she have a stronger duty to her career and the truth behind her art?I'm actually very familiar with the Brooklyn neighborhoods - Dumbo and Brooklyn Heights - that provided this story with its setting, so that was definitely part of the appeal for me. It was fascinating to step back in time and look at Dumbo not as I know it now, but on the brink of gentrification in the early 90s. But even if you've never been to Dumbo, I think it's still possible to be impressed by just how immersive this novel is. It's such a brilliant and insular look at the New York art scene in the 90s; fans of twentieth century American art in particular I think will be entranced by this story.There's really only one element of this novel that didn't work for me - the omission of quotation marks in dialogue. I can only assume that since Lu is recounting this story 20 years later, the desired effect is to imply that it's Lu's remembrance of characters' dialogue, rather than verbatim quotes? But I'm still not sure that it was necessary - it seems like a rather arbitrary stylistic choice. It didn't bother me enough to detract from my 5 star rating, but I think it's going to be a big deterrent for some people.But like I said, all things considered, I was blown away. I don't think I appreciated just how hard-hitting this book was until I read the final sentence and nearly burst into tears. This whole novel was beautiful and unsettling and unique, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.

The complaints I'd seen leveled against it - dense prose, unlikable characters - are things I find myself often defending. As you can see, this did not go as expected.The prose wasn't just dense; it was clunky, awkward, and every sentence seemed to be crafted for the sheer purpose of deliberate obfuscation. Reading this book felt like walking through brambles that haven't been trimmed, I'm not sure how else to describe it. The characters weren't just unlikable; they were loathsome, and (in my opinion) utterly one-dimensional. Heathcliff and Catherine are jealous, spiteful, and cruel, and... that's it. Several hundred pages follow of them being jealous, spiteful, and cruel to one another. To clarify: my problem with this book isn't that I didn't find their relationship romantic - that's the last thing I care about in a novel, really. I had been looking forward into digging into this iconic fictional relationship and finding myself fascinated and compelled by the dynamic. Suffice to say, I was neither fascinated nor compelled. I was bored.My third problem with Wuthering Heights was the narration. It begins from the point of view of Lockwood, the most unutterably pointless character in the history of literature, and a few chapters in, Nelly begins to tell Lockwood the story of Heathcliff and Catherine. So you'll have a direct quote from Heathcliff, which is being narrated by Nelly, which is then recorded for our supreme reading pleasure by Lockwood. And the thing is, there is nothing to distinguish Lockwood and Nelly's narration. The narrative voices of a well-to-do gentleman and a housemaid should not be identical. It was also frustrating, the fact that everything was recounted secondhand. First person minor is probably my least favorite point of view of all time (I have similarly negative feelings about The Great Gatsby), so I am fully aware that this is mostly my own bias, but I don't fully understand the point of crafting such a passionate and volatile tale only to keep your reader at arm's length from it.Sorry, Emily, I think I shall stick with Charlotte from now on....more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Nov 08, 2017","Nov 30, 2017","Sep 25, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6185.Wuthering_Heights

Tudor is going to be a name to look out for.At first I was sure this was going to be a 5 star read, but (without getting into spoiler territory) I wasn't entirely satisfied with the ending... I found a lot of it predictable and I thought there were too many plot points conveniently tied up all at once. It's one of those endings that's a bit too neat and doesn't leave much to the imagination. I loved reading this, but I doubt it will stay with me years from now. That said, it's a must-read for anyone who likes their mysteries creepy and addicting. I dare you not to fly through this once you pick it up.While it's not an outright horror novel, this book flirts with horror more than your average thriller, so proceed with caution.

London is submerged underwater, the unnamed narrator gives birth to a baby, she and her husband are separated, and I should care, but I don't.Hunter's prose is worth mentioning as it is undoubtedly this novella's biggest strength.

The novel's larger conflict is centered on the French and American invasion of Vietnam, which is echoed microcosmically in the conflict that arises between Fowler and Pyle when they both fall in love with the same Vietnamese woman, Phuong. I loved Greene's writing, which was sparse but filled with sharp observations and imagery:“That was my first instinct -- to protect him. It never occurred to me that there was a greater need to protect myself. Innocence always calls mutely for protection when we would be so much wiser to guard ourselves against it: innocence is like a dumb leper who has lost his bell, wandering the world, meaning no harm.”There is so much here that resonates regarding this novel's sociopolitical context (Greene's observations on the destructive nature of colonialism read as both historic and prescient, over 60 years after it was published), but it was the character work that I found the most arresting. Fowler and Pyle are both emblematic of their countries - Fowler is jaded but also delusional enough to have convinced himself of his own neutrality in the war; Pyle is brash, naive, well-meaning, and disruptive. Phuong's own character is rather anemically constructed, a source of frustration for the modern reader but probably a deliberate choice on Greene's part as Fowler and Pyle both project onto her, attempt to possess her, while barely able to communicate with her. Surprising and inevitable all at once, the trajectory of Pyle and Fowler's characters and the dynamic between them remains the singular point of intrigue throughout the novel, for those of us less interested in the military detail that obviously transfixed Greene. That said, if this is a historic period that interests you more than it does me, this is a must-read.This was my first Graham Greene but it certainly won't be my last - I just found this so accomplished and well-constructed. The Quiet American is a subtle and affecting meditation on war and morality; it's a cautionary tale that was criticized upon its publication for being anti-American, and it's going to remain relevant until we finally listen to it....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,Jan 2019,"Jan 05, 2019","Sep 19, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3698.The_Quiet_American

I didn't know what to expect from this novel, but maybe that was for the best, because what started as a rather unassuming story really crept up on me, and I'm finding this  particularly difficult to write, because I'm so in awe of the scope and composition of this novel.Elmet (in terms of theme more than style of prose) is All We Shall Know meets All the Birds, Singing, meets Wuthering Heights - a gothic-inspired novel set in the lawless outskirts of British society. The story's setting, an unnamed rural town, is located on a site once known as Elmet, a Celtic kingdom now a part of west Yorkshire. Fiona Mozley's sensory descriptions are so vivid, I felt like I was transported straight into the heart of this rustic setting. The novel is narrated by 14-year-old Daniel, an effeminate boy who lives in a cabin in the woods with his tomboy sister Cathy and his father John, an almost paradoxically sensitive and brutal bare-knuckle fighter referred to only as 'Daddy.' Throughout the book their peaceful existence is threatened by a local landowner and his family, and the conflict between the two parties crescendos into an inevitable and harrowing conclusion. Though Elmet is a quiet and subtle pastoral tale, it's also an absolute powerhouse meditation on violence, gender, familial ties, and societal views on morality. There's an anger and a restlessness simmering beneath the surface of this positively humorless novel, but it's not actually as bleak of a read as you might think. There's a sort of innocence to Daniel's narration that doesn't evoke pity as much as demand reflection on the lifestyle of this novel's unlikely heroes. Mozley's prose is lyrical and incisive - there's nothing to do while you're reading this book but give it your full attention. I understand why Elmet doesn't work for certain readers. It's light on plot and heavy on backstory and its pace is slow, so if you aren't sustained by its themes and characters, I can see where the word 'boring' may be leveled against it. But if you're the sort of reader who loves a subtle and atmospheric story, this is well worth checking out. This is a solid 4.5, but the more I think about it, the more I like it, so 5 it is.Thank you to Netgalley, Algonquin Books, and Fiona Mozley for the copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Dec 30, 2017","Jan 11, 2018","Sep 13, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/36254681-elmet

Farrell died young, as he drowned at the age of 44, but this 1970 book got some semi-recent attention when it won the Lost Man Booker Prize in 2010, which was established to retroactively honor a book that missed out on being eligible for the Booker due to a rule change that year. So when you pick up Troubles with all that in mind, as I did, it certainly has a big legacy to live up to, especially when you don't even know what the book itself is about.It turns out that it's about an English man called Brendan, who's referred to in the third person narration as 'the Major,' who, after the end of the war in 1919, journeys to Ireland to figure out whether or not he's actually engaged to a woman who he's been exchanging romantic letters with, Angela Spencer. Her home is a crumbling mansion of a hotel called the Majestic, where she lives with her Protestant family as well as several eccentric guests. Upon arrival the Major expects to be greeted by Angela herself, but instead he finds himself swept up instantly into her strange family dynamic, with her aggressively Unionist father's pervasive fear of Sinn Féin (the political party advocating for an Irish republic) hovering in the background throughout the novel.Troubles is essentially a sardonic odyssey of the mundane - a reverse Nostos of sorts in which our protagonist journeys away from home and navigates a culture that's plagued with a completely different social climate than his own. It's also a kind of Gothic subversion, Farrell giving us a Manderley-like setting that's meant to symbolize the British Empire, the characters willfully in denial about its crumbling roof as well as the rising insurgency that's taking place in their country.It drags and overstays its welcome at times (much like the guests in the hotel), but for the most part Troubles is a riotously funny (and occasionally tragic) satire. While there isn't much of a plot, Farrell leads the reader with measured prose through a dizzyingly bizarre series of encounters that highlight the absurdity of the Spencers' myopic view of Irish society. It's a bit of a project to get through, but it's worth it for the sharp, incisive writing and commentary on colonialism that still feels relevant half a century later....more",Notes are private!,0,45,1,"Mar 07, 2019","Mar 15, 2019","Aug 29, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/256279.Troubles

It's fraught with I think I would have found this book insufferable had it been written by an author with even a sliver less skill than André Aciman. It's fraught with clichés, as well as an abundance of elements that usually irritate me - characters being preternaturally gifted at everything, talk of sex on just about every page, at times tedious introspection, being told rather than shown how characters feel - but somehow Call Me by Your Name is greater than the sum of its parts, or maybe André Aciman knew exactly what he was doing with this book's at times infuriating construction, because he ultimately won me over against my better judgment. Call Me by Your Name is less romantic than I had been expecting. Instead, it's charged with sexual tension, and the relationship between Elio and Oliver is characterized less by romance than by passion and obsession (which isn't to say it's not intensely intimate). Aciman chronicles the somewhat contradictory nature of young love with precision - the fear, the hesitation, the desire that Elio felt were all achingly real. Though it's a story that builds very slowly, Elio is a compelling narrator, and his struggle for self-awareness a well-crafted thread that holds the novel together. I think I mainly liked this book for two reasons. The first is that it's one of the most evocative things I've ever read - it transported me back to summer nights in Italy with an unnervingly convincing atmosphere. And the second is that André Aciman's prose is exquisite. This book is unapologetically pretentious in a way that I found more stimulating than irritating, though I'm sure many would disagree with that assessment. I was reminded of The Secret History in a way - Aciman's writing is nothing at all like Tartt's, but the comparison is that some people hate that book for its abundant intellectualism, and some people (myself included) can't help but to love it for it. I thought the intertextuality in Call Me by Your Name was nothing short of brilliant - references to Paul Celan, Emily Bronte, Michel de Montaigne, Dante, and Claude Monet abound - which for me served to give an understanding of how these characters interacted with the world, or in Elio's case, hid behind literary references instead of interacting with the world.I still don't really know what I'm trying to communicate with this . This book was nothing like what I'd expected, but I was still utterly swept away by it. I guess I'd been expecting a slow burn romance and instead found myself reading intellectually charged literary soft-erotica, so I think I have to give Aciman credit where it's due for winning me over, because if that is the book I'd been expecting to read, I don't think I would have picked it up in the first place. This was a beautiful novel, especially for a story that's more about the ugliness of love than the beauty of it.Also, this is the 100th book I finished this year.

The past timeline tells the story of four girls who are roommates at a desolate boarding school called Idlewild, where unwanted and illegitimate girls are sent by their families and then neglected. There are also rumors of a ghost called Mary Hand who haunts the school grounds, and one day, one of the four friends vanishes. In the present, journalist Fiona Sheridan attempts to come to terms with her sister's murder, which occurred 20 years ago near the ruins of Idlewild.Interestingly, there aren't a whole lost of twists and turns in this book. In lieu of shock and awe, Simone St. James lends her efforts to weaving together several seemingly unrelated plot threads, and she does so expertly. This is a book for readers who like satisfying conclusions and neat resolutions - I didn't have a big 'wow' moment, which I tend to enjoy while reading this genre, but the storytelling was superb, and I had fun reading this book from start to finish.Naturally I love when books are set in Vermont, and St. James delivered with the atmosphere. Though the town of Barrons and Idlewild Hall may be fictional, the dark, bleak tone of a rural Vermont winter was captured perfectly. It's the ideal setting for a ghost story in many ways, and St. James took advantage of that to create a ghost who's as intriguing as she is haunting. The research St. James put into this novel is also admirable, particularly regarding the Ravensbrück concentration camp, a chilling piece of history which features into one character's backstory.The characters themselves are very well developed, though my main complaint about this book was the heavy focus on Fiona's relationship with her police officer boyfriend, which lent itself to a somewhat cliched 'his parents disapprove because cops and journalists can't mingle' sort of narrative. But the girls in the 1950 timeline though were vivid and compelling enough to make up for this for me, and I didn't mind Fiona herself.Anyway, since I started this on Saturday morning and finished it on Sunday afternoon, The Broken Girls is the perfect book to get lost in for a weekend if you're looking for something quick, eerie, and compelling....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Feb 24, 2018","Feb 25, 2018","Aug 21, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/35533431-the-broken-girls

I mean, I'll be honest, with sentences like ""When tensions rise and Milly feels trapped by her shiny new life, she has to decide: Will she be good? Or is she bad?"" I was expecting a sort of corny, mindless thriller, which would have been okay, but the reality of this novel is so much better.Good Me, Bad Me is a dark, psychological character study of a novel. The story begins with Annie, who gets rechristened as Milly, finally deciding to turn her mother into the police, after a childhood of being forced to watch her mother abuse and murder children. Milly is placed into foster care with parents Mike and Saskia and their daughter Phoebe, who feels threatened by Milly's presence in their family and likes to remind her that her time with them is only temporary. Milly struggles with both assimilating to her new life, and ignoring her mother's voice which she hears inside her head, constantly urging her to indulge her darker instincts.This is a novel about aftermath and recovery, about nature vs. nurture, and though the prose makes for a quick and compelling read, fans of the mystery/thriller genre may be disappointed at just how character-driven this is. I thought that the moments where this novel endeavored to cross over into proper thriller territory were actually the weakest - neither of the two main reveals were shocking at all, so I almost feel like this novel would have been stronger if all facts had been presented up front rather than in a ""gotcha!"" kind of way.But that isn't a criticism as much as advice on how to adjust your expectations going in. As someone who finds character studies fascinating, I loved this book. I found Milly to be sympathetic and intriguing - I wanted to get to the bottom of her, to really understand to what extent she is her mother's daughter, but I also just wanted her to be happy.This is a chilling, harrowing novel that I won't forget any time soon. Trigger warnings for rape, child abuse, and self-harm, all of which are presented sensitively but unsparingly.

It's also a reminder of why John Boyne is one of my favorite authors; there's such a compulsively readable quality to his prose, where it's witty and compelling and tense all at once.I feel like a very common pitfall of the ghost story horror genre is phenomenal buildup to a sort of anticlimactic conclusion, and I'm sorry to say that this isn't really an exception. This is filled to the brim with delightful ghost story tropes that fans of this genre will adore (a spooky Gothic mansion, creepy children, a standoffish caretaker, a harrowing family history), and I loved the experience of reading this novel, but as we got closer to the end, I became more confident that I was going to be disappointed, and sure enough, the climactic scene and denouement left me pretty cold. There's also an entire element of the resolution that didn't totally work for me (the presence and identity of the second spirit I thought took away a lot of the tension).But, all that said, I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy this book. I loved the way Boyne played into certain familiar tropes while subverting others. I loved our heroine Eliza, who's both vulnerable and strong-willed. And, to give credit where it's due, creating a compelling ghost story as a contemporary author is hard.

Each chapter is titled with a different body part: Neck, Cerebellum, Lungs, etc., each chapter heading illustrated with a simple but brilliant anatomical drawing that corresponds with the narrative.The brushes with death themselves range in severity. They cover everything from O'Farrell getting tested for the HIV virus, a fairly common procedure, to having a machete held to her neck on a South American vacation. They also range in emotional poignancy for the reader. For me, nothing else was able to capture the undiluted fear and horror of the very first anecdote, the first chapter entitled Neck - I'm torn between thinking it was a brilliant opening and wondering whether O'Farrell should have saved her best story for later. But I'm sure individual reactions to each chapter will vary. One thing O'Farrell really succeeds at is reminding the reader just how common near-death experiences are, how maybe you've come closer than you realize in your own life. I'm sure anecdotes that some readers will find particularly frightening will leave others cold - it really all depends on our own experiences and perceptions.This narrative isn't linear - for example, in one chapter O'Farrell will be 25, and in the next she'll be 8. I loved the unpredictability that this lent the book's composition. It's clear from the very fact that this is a memoir that O'Farrell survived each event, but I still thought she did an excellent job keeping the tension high throughout. And then there's the prose itself, which is gorgeous and lyrical. I've actually never read any of O'Farrell's fiction, but I'm very interested after reading this.There are a couple of things holding me back from giving this the full 5 stars, however. Seventeen is a lot of brushes with death, and some of these anecdotes begin to feel redundant. Horrifying as each experience must have been, did we really need three separate chapters about almost drowning? I also felt like there was more description than interpretation to this memoir. Again, I adored O'Farrell's writing, and she captured each of these events from her life vividly and beautifully. But besides the obvious - each chapter describing a near-death experience - there wasn't a whole lot of thematic cohesion to this collection. At times I finished a chapter wondering what exactly O'Farrell had been trying to say with it. Not that I wanted a clear-cut moral necessarily, just a bit more insight. Certain chapters felt like an essay that was missing a conclusion. That said, I mostly found this collection intelligent, well-written, and thought-provoking, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.Thank you to Penguin First to Read, Knopf, and Maggie O'Farrell for an advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Jan 12, 2018","Feb 05, 2018","Aug 14, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34666764-i-am-i-am-i-am

II'm seeing the play adaptation of A Clockwork Orange off Broadway in a couple of weeks, so I thought it would be a good idea to read the book first. I read one paragraph and thought 'oh god, what am I getting myself into?' before deciding to soldier on anyway. Now, since I'm guessing this has been the experience of just about everyone who has ever read the first paragraph of A Clockwork Orange only to put it down after that, my advice is: push through it. By the second chapter it gets easier, and by the fourth or fifth you're practically fluent in nadsat.But let's back up. The most notable thing about A Clockwork Orange is that it's written in Anthony Burgess's invented argot, 'nadsat,' which draws on Cockney, Malay, and Russian. You're thrown into this hybrid language immediately without any explanation, and it's a little disorienting, which I think was the effect that Burgess was going for. But it works, beautifully. It draws the reader into Alex's world, and somehow serves to desensitize from the brutal violence that Alex and his gang inflict on others. The relief you feel at being able to understand the language washes over you in stark opposition to the horrors that the nadsat is masking, and it's a uniquely unsettling experience. I was completely drawn in by the effect that Burgess created here.Thematically, this book is absolutely fascinating. Burgess constructs a vaguely futuristic totalitarian state that draws on elements of both communism and capitalism, which makes sense given the social climate that Burgess was writing in, in 1960s Britain. This book raises a lot of questions about humanity, free will, and the symbiotic relationship of the state and the individual. What value is there in free will if an individual doesn't choose to be good? Is it better to choose to be evil, or to be forced to be good? What's so striking about A Clockwork Orange is that we don't have a hero worth rooting for in this dystopian society, but it's still a powerful commentary on governmental injustice and youth violence. I was very moved by Alex's story, and it's a testament to Burgess's skill that he was able to evoke pity for this character who should by all accounts be irrevocably loathsome. I really enjoyed reading this, as much as you can 'enjoy' a brutally violent book. I don't recommend this lightly, but if you can handle this kind of dark fiction, reading this book is a surprisingly rewarding experience....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Aug 15, 2017","Aug 23, 2017","Aug 09, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/227463.A_Clockwork_Orange

I'll be honest: I didn't love this. I just can't quite put my finger on why.Jesmyn Ward is a brilliant writer. Her prose is gorgeous and immersive. The comparisons to Faulkner and Morrison are not unwarranted at all; to Morrison especially. This is an important story about one African American family navigating the systematic discrimination that they have endured for years. It's moving, disheartening, tragic, and lyrical. It's exactly the kind of book that I usually love.It seems a bit callous to say that I didn't really care about these characters, and I'm not sure that's even true... I did care about Jojo, the thirteen year old son of drug addict Leonie who's more of a parent to his younger sister, Kayla, than their mother is. But it just wasn't enough to hold my interest. So much is attempted in these pages, right down to the inclusion of actual ghosts, but I can't help but to feel like there was a certain lack of subtlety to the themes Ward was addressing. I didn't feel like there was a lot of depth buried beneath the surface - I thought it was all spelled out in a sort of obvious way. Perhaps if the novel had been longer, Ward could have given herself more space to develop this narrative and its themes in a more challenging and compelling way. The bottom line is, this book tried to engage me on both an emotional and intellectual level, but it failed to really do either. But I can't help but to feel like that's more on me than the author.Read this book*. This is a timely and important novel that will hopefully infuriate and inspire you.

I think I read the first 75 pages or something and then found myself unable to read this concurrently with War and Peace, so it got put aside for a few months. But even so, this is the longest it's taken me to read a book all year - and it's only 310 pages. So, why the delay?Down down I down to the last flakes in. Dreaming for hours I think in my dream. Over over. Day white tongue teeth. Quickness and slowness. Stilts pander to streets and their up down their. I don't know what I've yet. Wander where no notion wanders in amongst the dust of. Devil may Slip. Then wake up.Because the whole thing is written like this. I won't lie - this book is challenging and draining.But interestingly, the style of prose isn't what ultimately hurt this for me. Once I got into the rhythm of it, it became easier (reading a few lines out loud every now and then helped), and I sort of vacillated between thinking it was pretentious gibberish, and thinking this Joycean stream of consciousness was actually a very profound and striking means of storytelling. I don't know, I still haven't made up my mind.But my main problem with this book is the story itself, which is basically two highly melodramatic people having a lot of sex. 18-year-old Eilis meets 39-year-old Stephen, and we chronicle their dysfunctional liaison with a heightened pathos verging on absurdity. On the one hand, I sort of admire how Eimear McBride was able to make the stakes of this story feel so high when all that was really at stake was an unhealthy train wreck of a relationship; on the other hand, it got to be somewhat tedious. But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't wholly captivated by this affair from time to time, against my better judgement.What frustrates me about this novel is that even though it's told from Eilis' point of view, I think Stephen's story is the one that McBride really wanted to tell. His backstory was unexpected harrowing, more twisted and disturbing than I had possibly imaged. But the more he tells his story, the more Eilis fades. Her whole life and existence becomes about Stephen, and the novel that starts as Eilis's sexual bildungsroman ultimately casts Eilis in a rather inconsequential role. I was left feeling dissatisfied with her character's journey, which is frustrating when essentially all your novel has to offer in the first place is characterization.I didn't hate it, though, even though I wanted to, for the most part. There was something undeniably stimulating and compelling about this book. I'm tentatively intrigued by McBride's style and I'm curious about her debut, A Girl Is a Half-formed Thing. But I would not recommend reading this author lightly - I'd only suggest picking up The Lesser Bohemians if you're up for a challenge and a bit of weirdness, and more than a fair share of sex scenes.Thanks to Blogging for Books, Hogarth Press, and Eimear McBride for the copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,35,1,"Aug 25, 2017","Dec 06, 2017","Aug 07, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34069818-the-lesser-bohemians

I think there's a really extraordinary novel in here - I just think it occasionally gets too caught up in its meandering structure, and loses focus too often. At its best, it's striking and thought-provoking; at its worst, it's a slog.Happiness is a quiet, contemplative novel that meditates on themes like trauma, cultural differences, the relationship between humans and animals, and what it means to be happy. The novel begins with a chance encounter between two expats in London, an American woman named Jean and a Ghanaian man named Attila. It takes place over the course of about a week (though it feels much longer), and it follows each of their narratives as they weave in and out of each other's lives.I've seen this compared to Kazuo Ishiguro's The Remains of the Day, but it actually reminds me more of The Unconsoled. Not the whole Kafkaesque element, but one thing that struck me was how Jean and Attila kept encountering minor characters, getting caught up in their drama, and getting derailed from their main story - reminiscent of Ishiguro's character Ryder (not to mention that Attila and Ryder are both meant to be preparing for exhibitions of sorts - a psychology lecture for one and a piano recital for the other). But anyway, these proverbial rabbit holes that they go down feel less like subplots than they do side-quests, and as a reader I couldn't help but to go through Happiness with a touch of impatience, waiting for the narrative to regain focus. This not-quite-linear structure is deliberate, but it didn't completely work for me.I thought Forna's prose was really excellent, and I highlighted so many passages on my Kindle that I found striking. But I also couldn't wait to be done with this after a while. While it's certainly a unique novel that has a lot to offer, I just wish it had been subjected to more rigorous editing. Maybe that's just a personal preference, though.

The The Absolutist is a tender and harrowing exploration of love, betrayal, bravery, and cowardice, set in the trenches in France during World War I. The story begins in 1919, with twenty-one-year-old Tristan Sadler making a trip to Norwich to deliver some letters to the sister of a man who had died in the war, Will Bancroft. Through a series of flashbacks, Boyne explores the relationship between Tristan and Will, and while it's clear from the beginning that there isn't going to be a happy ending, it ended up being even more devastating than I had expected. This book ripped my heart out, so naturally, I loved it.Tristan Sadler is everything I could want from a narrator - complex, sympathetic, flawed, and seeking atonement, and though his guilt is present from the first page, it isn't until you're deep into the story that you really understand the extent of it. Tristan's struggle with his identity as a gay man provides the novel with its central conflict, which Boyne addresses with sensitivity and nuance.Boyne's prose is understated and compelling, as he deftly weaves together this complex tale, whose barely-300-pages belies its thematic richness. From the synopsis I was expecting a rather cut and dry love story, but the reality of this novel is more intricate and unexpected, and a lot sadder.This is only the second John Boyne novel I've read after The Heart's Invisible Furies, but both left me awestruck, devastated, and wanting to pick up another Boyne novel immediately.

(I’m not an audiobook person but I get very motion sick and I can’t read on planes, so a few people suggested I try a nonfiction book narrated by the author. Unfortunately I couldn’t find any of the ones I was looking for, but when browsing the nonfiction section Jo Cox’s biography caught my eye, which I had been interested in reading for a while. Luke Thompson does a good job with the narration - empathetic but not overly sentimental in a tale already rightfully wrought with sentiment.)Anyway, this book wrecked me. I’m not British, and I’ll admit to not knowing anything about Jo Cox until her murder in 2016. But I remember looking her up that day, seeing her relatively young face, reading briefly about her politics, and just feeling very deeply sad.In her biography written by her husband and fellow politician Brendan, we delve into the life and politics of an incredibly strong, inspiring, and resilient individual. I have so much respect for Brendan Cox to be able to write this biography only nine months after Jo's murder, in the midst of grieving the loss of his wife and mother of his two young children. Brendan's love for Jo shines through every page of this book, but he still manages to depict her as a real and flawed person. From her background working with Oxfam to her humanitarian efforts in developing countries to her passion for providing aid to Syrian civilians, Jo’s work and personal life were both characterized by her fervor and determination to provide equal opportunities to as many people as her efforts would reach. It's an effort that is thankfully ongoing - all proceeds from this book go to the Jo Cox Foundation.And even though I’m sadder now knowing what a truly beautiful soul was lost that day, I think it's incredible just how much positive change Jo was able to instigate in her short life.

When you find a book that seems tailor made for you, and then you end up not clicking with it at all. If we're going down a checklist, Days Without End is everything I should love: contemporary Irish lit, LGBT protagonist(s), a blend of literary and historical fiction, depressing, lyrical prose; hell, my copy even has a quote from Kazuo Ishiguro (one of my all-time favorite writers) on the cover. No one is more surprised than I am that I hated it so much.First, I want to make this clear - Days Without End is not a bad book. I don't think the Man Booker panel or the myriad of ers who gave this 5 stars are crazy at all. My one-star rating is very much on me.My main problem with this book is that I found the narrative voice almost impossible to follow. The fusion of dialect and lyricism didn't add up for me - the protagonist, Thomas McNulty, is an uneducated young man, which is reflected in the improper grammar used by Sebastian Barry in his first-person narration... but then you'd also have sentences like ""Empurpled rapturous hills I guess and the long day brushstroke by brushstroke enfeebling into darkness and then the fires blooming on the pitch plains."" If you're committing to capturing an authentic voice to such an extent that you're writing your entire book in dialect, how is this level of poetic imagery consistent with that? I thought the internal logic of Thomas's narration was filled to the brim with contradictions, and it pulled me out of the story again and again. I also couldn't reconcile the fact that this character was raised in Ireland, and he was talking like he was straight out of a John Wayne western. My brain just had the hardest time following this prose. I'd only be able to read 5 or 10 pages at a time before I started to zone out (which is why I'd been reading this since November).This kind of goes hand in hand, but as for the story itself, I was bored out of my mind. There was little to no emotional depth here - this was a very monotonous account of the Indian Wars and the Civil War. Brutality is relayed with dispassionate narration (I realize this is The Point, but it did not work for me); characters had indistinct personalities; I still don't feel like I know the first thing about Thomas or the great love of his life, John Cole. This is one of those books where I could have read the first and last chapter and skipped everything in between, and I would have had the exact same experience with it. Well, I actually would have had a better experience with it, if I'd only had to read Barry's lifeless prose for 20 pages rather than 250. But as for the plot, I don't think I would have missed much.Ultimately, I didn't get anything out of Days Without End besides frustration. Emotionally this book left me cold and intellectually I failed to engage with it. But again, I am in the clear minority... if you're curious about picking this up, go for it. You'll know by the second page whether the narrative voice works for you. I should have trusted my gut and dropped it then and there....more",Notes are private!,1,132,1,"Nov 30, 2017","Apr 12, 2018","Jul 27, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30212107-days-without-end

I was having a hard tiFor the most part I enjoyed reading Disobedience, but it's one of those books that's somehow greater than the sum of its parts. I was having a hard time putting my finger on what exactly was working for me about this, because when I started to pick it apart, I realized there wasn't a whole lot to praise. It wasn't the writing, certainly, which I found rather sophomoric (more on that in a minute); it wasn't the plot, which was quite paint-by-numbers; and it wasn't the characters, who were pretty flat archetypes and essentially just mouthpieces for Alderman's ideas, completely with stilted dialogue that doesn't even begin to resemble how real human beings converse. But it was something, I guess, because it had a very readable quality to it and I certainly wouldn't dissuade others from checking it out.I think if I had to choose the one thing that really stood out to me about this novel, it was the setting. It takes place in an Orthodox Jewish community in London, and focuses on the romance between Ronit (the rebellious, wayward daughter of a renowned Rabbi who's recently died) and Esti (the submissive, conservative housewife who's miserable from deeply internalizing religious doctrine). While neither of these characters felt as fleshed out as they could be, what did feel very rich and textured for me was each of their relationships with Judaism; this community did feel very real to me and the sermons which began each chapter were an effective tool for immersing the reader in these characters' ideologies.I haven't yet read Alderman's Women's Prize-winning novel The Power, which received a lot of critical praise but which is not particularly adored among my circle of reader friends. I still intend to read The Power, but if the writing style is anything like it was in Disobedience, I think I'm beginning to understand the criticism. There were some individual sentences in here which I highlighted because I thought they were striking, but there were even more which caused me to roll my eyes, if only because Alderman has a habit of repeating the same words and phrases and ideas ad nauseum. On a sentence-by-sentence example, let's take this:Far away, very very far away, I made a sleek black telephone on a pale wood desk ring. I thought okay, that's an interesting way to describe making a phone call. But then Alderman does the exact same thing again: I dialed the number and, a quarter of the way across the world, I made a British number appear on a black telephone on a blond-wood desk.This whole book had a circuitous nature to it, where it felt like Alderman was taking the longest possible way to make a simple point. On the more thematic level, we're frankly bashed over the head with Alderman's pontifications on man's capacity for disobedience, and the societal expectation of silencing women. It's not that I disagree with anything that she's saying - in fact, several of these points I did find rather stimulating to mull over - but when you use the word 'silence' a grand total of sixty-six times in your novel, maybe you should consider that you're laying it on a bit heavy.And then there's the ending - admittedly this critique is tied up inextricably in my personal preferences, but if there's one kind of ending I cannot stand, especially in literary fiction, it's when everything is wrapped up neatly in a nice bow; all conflicts resolved and all character arcs completed. I think there's something so dissatisfying about following characters on a journey through a novel and essentially being told 'their story ends here, no need to think about this any further, everything's fine' at the end. I can't tell you how much I hate that. Coupled with the downright corny resolution, I did not finish Disobedience on a high.So, I don't know.

Most s I've seen of Holding, both positive and negative, seem to be written by readers who only picked it up because of the name Graham Norton. I was the opposite - I read the summary and thought 'that sounds exactly like a book I would like,' but my cursor hesitated over the request button because of the author. I mean, don't get me wrong, Graham Norton is a great television presenter. I just wasn't confident in his novel writing skills. But I was too tempted by the premise to not at least give it a shot.It was... okay. Holding is a sort of cozy mystery meets romantic comedy (if I'd realized how heavily romance factored into the plot, I would have stayed away), set in a modern day small Irish town, which follows sergeant P.J. Collins as he attempts to solve a decades old murder. The plot is rather flimsy, and takes an unnecessarily long time to gather steam. Characters are well developed, ordinary people with Dark Secrets, but there's a certain intrigue missing. And it doesn't help that most of the Big Reveals are from people just... deciding to tell P.J. things at opportune moments.The prose was technically decent, but it really failed to hold my attention. This book probably took me twice as long to read as it should have - I lost track of the number of times I realized my mind had been wandering, and I had to go back several pages because I hadn't been paying attention. Part of the reason for this was the rather poorly executed third person omniscient point of view - the ""head hopping"" got really out of hand at times and made it difficult to follow. I think this book is in some ways a direct homage to The Casual Vacancy - a slow moving mystery set in a remote town with a large host of unlikable characters, it's hard not to draw comparisons - but for me, it fell totally flat. I was actually one of the few who quite liked The Casual Vacancy ('liked,' not 'loved'), but Holding didn't manage to improve upon any of The Casual Vacancy's flaws. Where Rowling's plotting was intricate as ever, and her first adult novel managed to pack quite a punch by the end, Holding was only ever a tepid, flavorless imitation. Norton's certainly a better writer than I had expected; his wit and humor are as omnipresent as you would expect, and I like some of his ideas - I would be willing to read another novel from him in the future. But Holding just wasn't executed as well as I'd have liked. It was almost there, but not quite.Also, warning: there's a fairly graphic rape scene about halfway through.

I loved the first novel in this historical fiction series based on the life of one of the first female deputy sheriffs in the U.S., but its sequel, Lady Cop Makes Trouble, didn't quite live up to the high bar Stewart had set for herself. I had higher hopes for Miss Kopp's Midnight Confessions at first, but I think I ultimately wanted to like this more than I did.The premise of this novel is the most interesting to me of the three. Set in 1916, just before the U.S. entered World War I, women are having to take up the slack of men who are leaving to go abroad - taking factory positions and leaving the house more often to aid war efforts. This was a difficult pill for some of these young women's parents to swallow, and many of them reported their daughters to the police for wayward behavior, which is an interesting and frustrating piece of history that I ended up learning a lot about. I just wish the narrative had been on the same level as Stewart's impeccable research.While I was initially prepared to praise this novel for having more narrative cohesion than its two predecessors (the cases that Constance is investigating end up dovetailing with her personal life), I thought the execution was somewhat unwieldy. One of the characters does something that I felt was solely for the sake of furthering the plot, and really incongruous with her characterization. And while I enjoyed spending more time with Norma and Fleurette than we had in Lady Cop Makes Trouble, the relationship between the three sisters - easily the best thing about the first novel - always felt rather secondary to whatever else was going on.I loved the new characters who were introduced, Edna especially, and I enjoyed reading about her time involving herself in the war effort. But I still thought that there were too many subplots here, and the way it all came together in the end was a little ham-fisted.It's more of a 3.5 than a 3, and certainly an improvement on Lady Cop Makes Trouble. But I'm still waiting for Stewart to really tap into the magic that she was able to achieve with Girl Waits with Gun. I'm undecided if I'll continue this series if Stewart writes more. On the one hand, I'm rather invested in Constance Kopp at this point, but on the other, I have a nagging feeling that this series peaked with its first novel.Thank you to Netgalley, Houghton Mifflin, and Amy Stewart for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Sep 20, 2017","Oct 10, 2017","Jul 18, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33413882-miss-kopp-s-midnight-confessions

I mean, there are differences - I wasn't a talented webcomic artist with millions of followers, I didn't spend all my time on my smartphone because smartphones weren't a thing yet, thank god, and I put more effort into my schoolwork than Eliza did - but still. Using the internet as a coping mechanism against crippling social anxiety? Caring more about my fandom and my online life than my real life? All of my closest friends living in different places around the world? Check, check, check.What I found so remarkable about Eliza and Her Monsters was that it's at once a celebration of internet culture, and also a cautionary tale against letting your online persona consume you, and I think that's a very important message for teens. I mean, don't get me wrong, I love the internet. But, as with everything, balance is key. That's where Eliza is such a phenomenal protagonist. She's someone that so many people can relate to: she's insecure, she's anxious, she escapes into her art, she loves her friends; she's flawed and all the more compelling for that fact. But this isn't a story about her journey to overcome anxiety and abandon the internet in favor of the 'real world'; it's just about Eliza learning how to reconcile these two halves of herself, LadyConstellation, anonymous creator of the webcomic phenomenon Monstrous Sea, and Eliza Mirk, awkward soon to be high school graduate.The only thing I disliked about this book was Eliza's love interest, Wallace. Their friendship/relationship rubbed me the wrong way throughout the book, sort of for vague personal reasons, but he really lost me with his behavior at the end. Fortunately, their relationship didn't take center stage: this book was about Eliza, first and foremost, and that's why I feel like I can give this 5 stars despite my hatred of one of the two main characters (though I'd give it 4.5 if half stars were a thing). The supporting characters were all fantastic - I especially loved Eliza's brothers, Sully and Church.All in all, a really terrific and thoughtful book that I enjoyed immensely. ...more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,"Jul 26, 2017","Jul 28, 2017","Jul 18, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31931941-eliza-and-her-monsters

Crooked Kingdom is everything that was great about Six of Crows - fast paced action, characters getting out of impossible situations in unexpected ways - but it built something even better upon its already solid foundation, thanks to some truly phenomenal character development. In Crooked Kingdom, Leigh Bardugo digs into her characters' backstories to create even more depth and dimension to this already flawed and fascinating group of individuals, and I came out of it with an even greater appreciation of each of them.Where the plot in Six of Crows is much more straightforward and I can see where some people may prefer it for that reason, Crooked Kingdom is where Bardugo shows her complete mastery of weaving together intricate plot threads. I was mesmerized by the fact that every time there appeared to be a straightforward outcome to a situation, Bardugo still managed to veer the narrative in an unexpected direction. And it was never a cheap trick or a deus ex machina - just Bardugo cleverly staying one step ahead of the rest of us.I wasn't really fond of That One Thing that happens toward the end - I thought it was sort of rushed and thrown in for shock value, and I think Bardugo could have been capable of writing that in a much more satisfying way.But on the whole, I loved this.

Set in the near future, the novel begins in a vaguely post-apocalyptic wasteland that used to be suburban Michigan, where a young woman, Malorie, leads her two children to a rowboat, all of them blindfolded. Five years previously, there was some kind of event which wiped out the majority of the population - there's something outside, and when people see it, they're driven to madness and violence. There's only one rule in the new world in order to survive: don't open your eyes.This is more of a survival story than I had been expecting from a horror novel, but I was okay with that, because it focuses on the elements of survival that I find particularly interesting. How does a group of individuals move forward together in a lawless world? Which social norms from the old world are worth preserving? At what point does survival stop being enough? (It's strangely reminiscent of Station Eleven in this regard.) I highly recommend this to anyone who prefers their horror light on the gore and heavy on the psychological.But survival is only one element. Bird Box is scary. The tension that Josh Malerman creates in this novel never lets up, even for a second. Malerman taps into a really primal fear - fear of the dark, fear of the unknown. What's so remarkable about Bird Box is that the scariest passages aren't necessarily ones where you see horrifying things happening. It's the ones where the characters are taking a tentative step outside, eyes closed, not knowing if they're mere inches away from danger.No, it's not perfect; yes, there are questions that go unanswered, but I loved this.

And I loved it. In this novel Kamila Shamsie gives us a fearless adaptation set in present-day London, following two Muslim families both grappling with family legacy and national identity.I hesitate to say that you won't get anything out of this book if you aren't familiar with Antigone, but just in terms of my own experience, my reading of it was almost entirely informed by the parallels. Just consider that this reads more like a Greek tragedy than it does a contemporary novel - not in terms of prose quality, certainly, but in terms of themes and narrative structure.There is nothing subtle about the way in which Shamsie riffs off Sophocles, but the hidden depths in Home Fire makes it a rewarding and necessary retelling, as does Shamsie's choice to reframe the story around an all-Muslim host of characters. The main theme at the heart of Antigone- measuring the power of the individual against the power of a corrupt state - is also the main theme of Home Fire. But it's complicated here by the fact that the protagonists and antagonists alike are all a part of the same minority group; all striving to live as best they can in a society which continues to alienate and dehumanize them.The main criticism which I've seen leveled against this book - that its characters are flat - is valid, and I agree to an extent, but I also find myself forgiving this more here than I might in another novel. The characters are 'flat' as such because they're deliberately constructed archetypes, and this is where I'm wondering if this would be a less rewarding reading experience for those not already familiar with the original story and characters. The Creon figure here I thought was particularly fascinating for the way Shamsie subverted certain elements of his narrative.Anyway, I thought this novel was stimulating; the way in which Shamsie uses a classical narrative to give voice to a minority group is one of the best reasons I can think of to adapt a story that's already been told to death.

I wouldn't call it a flawless piece of literature or even a flawless Iliad adaptation, but it utterly consumed me, I couldn't stop thinking about it for weeks, and I have no hesitations when I say that it's one of my favorite books. My feelings about Circe are much more complicated.In many ways, you could argue that it surpasses The Song of Achilles from an objective standpoint. The scope of Circe is much larger, and Miller crafts an absolutely stunning arc for her titular character. I put Circe down feeling so satisfied with the conclusion that I wanted to give it 5 stars solely for that mastery... but clearly I did not end up doing that, so let's back up.My first issue with Circe was the unnecessarily languid pace. For one thing, there is no reason this book needs to be nearly 400 pages. There is just not that much going on. And for another thing, so many of the subplots in this novel happen offstage, so to speak. In case you aren't familiar with the original story: Circe is exiled to the island Aiaia and unable to leave. Consequently, a lot of background information is obtained secondhand, from other characters visiting the island and relaying information to Circe. It doesn't exactly make for the most thrilling narrative.This ties into that, but due to Circe's immortality, the stakes in this novel are constantly low. Any altercations that could theoretically result in Circe being killed or injured have absolutely no tension, because you know it's all going to be okay (physically, at least, if not emotionally). Circe's immortality is approached beautifully on a thematic level, but not necessarily on a narrative one.Now let's talk about Circe herself. This is something I'm sort of conflicted about. Circe is one of those characters from Greek mythology who doesn't have her own literature, but she features into the background of so many different stories (the Odyssey, notably, but also Theogony, the now lost Telegony, the Aeneid, Ovid's Metamorphoses, to name a few). Though none of these stories explore Circe's life in the way that Miller has endeavored to do, we do get a sense of who she is - a ruthless witch who dwells in solitude and turns men into pigs for sport. That... is not the Circe that Miller gives us. Hers is soft, tame, misunderstood - and the thing is, none of it blatantly contradicts anything from mythological canon. Circe in this novel does turn men into pigs - and Miller shows how she gets there. But at times I still felt like I was reading about an original character, and not Circe. I mean, it all turned out okay. Like I said, the arc that Miller wrote was brilliant. It just took some time to adjust my expectations of how I thought this character was going to be portrayed. (Also, this is only sort of related, but another point of confusion for me were some of the myths that Miller decided to incorporate into Circe's narrative... though some of her invented stories fit very well. It was sort of a mixed bag for me.)I know this has been largely critical, but I did like this. It was super readable, I thought the background characters were fascinating (Pasiphaë in particular was really excellent), and I adored the ending. And, as always, I love Greek mythology. I'd rather read Greek mythology retellings than almost anything else. I loved diving back into this world, especially so soon after re-reading the Odyssey. But, I've said this before: I tend to be critical of the things I love the most. This is a solid book that many fans are going to love just as much, if not more, than The Song of Achilles. I'll be very curious to hear what everyone else thinks.Anyway, this is a very solid 3.5 - I'm rounding down for now solely because I seem to have written a 3-star  instead of a 4-star one, but I may revisit my rating after I've thought about this some more.Thank you so much to Little, Brown and Co and Madeline Miller for the advanced copy provided in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,109,1,"Mar 02, 2018","Mar 07, 2018","Jul 11, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/32993458-circe

This is a book about things happening - one after another in monotonous succession. Well, it's actually about an Italian girl, Eugenia, who relocates to Los Angeles with her family in the 1990s, but where it endeavors to be a candid coming of age story, it falls short with a pace that languishes and a promise of emotional poignancy that never really delivers. I was unable to form an emotional connection with any of these characters, and the whole thing came across as rather trite.Where Things That Happened Before the Earthquake failed for me was the style of narration. It was cold and detached in a way that I'm unable to reconcile with the POV of a teenage girl who's been uprooted from her home and transported into a different culture. Eugenia envelops herself in what she refers to as her ""rubber suit"" - she remains purposefully detached from a lot of what transpires around her, and the narrative result is that it's almost impossible to understand her behavior or personality. She seems more mature than your average 15 year old while also making a lot of terrible teenage decisions.Having read this, I now completely understand why no one seems to know whether to classify this novel as adult or YA. On the one hand, it deals with teenage issues - sex, love, identity - but on the other hand, there's some seriously dark and graphic stuff in here. Trigger warning for animal abuse, and... kind of rape? I guess? Minor spoiler: Eugenia's first time having sex is... potentially non-consensual but then swept under the rug by the narrative and never really addressed again, and that whole thing made me really uncomfortable. But onto the good - this is a 3 star  after all. Contrary to my chronic tendency toward negativity, I didn't hate this book. Chiara Barzini is a fantastic writer, and even through Eugenia's detached narration, Barzini's prose shines. This story is told with unflinching honesty and humor, and at times it's a delight to read.Ultimately: I didn't love it, I didn't hate it. This was just a kind of monotonous read that I wanted to end much sooner than it did.I received a copy of this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest .

I've never read a YA thriller before, which is why I requested this one on a whim. I was curious. But honestly, my expectations hadn't been very high. More fool me.When I Am Through with You is told from the point of view of Ben, a high school senior who's waiting to go on trial for murder. As his story begins to unfold, we first learn about Rose, his girlfriend of two years who he allegedly ends up murdering. We also learn all about the school hiking trip up in the mountains that went wrong, as this compelling story of intrigue, adventure, and betrayal develops.This is one of the most addicting books I've ever read. It had me from the very first page. I cared about these characters, who were at once sympathetic and realistically flawed, and I was intrigued by Ben's complicated relationship with Rose. I was drawn into the host of fascinating characters - whip-smart Avery; mean and self-loathing Archie; kind-hearted but unfulfilled Mr. Howe, the history teacher who leads their expedition. Each of these characters is multifaceted, and has their own story to tell.I'd never heard of Stephanie Kuehn before, but I can say with certainty that I will be reading more of her books in the future. I thought her prose was intelligent, compelling, and quick-witted. The pacing in this novel was outstanding - I sat down to start this yesterday and when I blinked hours had gone by. Kuehn brought the scene of this treacherous camping trip to life - I truly felt like I was with this group of students on that mountain. It's been a while since I've read something with such an immersive setting.I highly recommend this to fans of adult and YA thrillers alike. The only thing that served as a constant reminder that this was YA were the ages of the characters - otherwise, I found this novel surprisingly mature and dark and quite twisted.I received an advanced copy of this book from Penguin First To Read in exchange for an honest .

Believe the hype, guys!I know the major bookworm stereotype is devouring books in one sitting, staying up way too late to finish them, but I actually rarely do that. I usually read a few chapters before bed and put the book down at a reasonable hour, no matter how addicting. Not the case with Final Girls. Thanks to this book I am running on very few hours of sleep, but it was worth it. There was no point in the second half of this book where I would have felt satisfied putting it down and going to bed without getting to the bottom of things. Because each time I thought I had this book figured out, Sager threw another twist into the mix.Final Girls is about Quincy Carpenter, a young woman who survived a massacre ten years ago, where she went on vacation with five friends and all of them ended up murdered. Two other women were the sole survivors of similar attacks, Lisa Milner and Samantha Boyd. The media collectively refers to them as the 'Final Girls,' referring to the horror movie trope where one girl is left alive at the end of the film. The story picks up when Lisa is found dead, and Sam suddenly shows up at Quincy's door, intent on making her confront the events of that night, despite Quincy's insistence that she can't remember anything that happened.Part thriller and part horror, this novel was tense and addicting, with a tone not quite like anything I've ever read before. The chapters which offered flashbacks to the night of the massacre were properly terrifying. I don't scare easily, which is a shame, as I love the feeling of being scared in a controlled environment, but I have to admit, I was on the edge of my seat here. The looming inevitability of the night's events lent even the most innocuous of scenes a sinister edge.The present-day narrative involving Quincy and Sam is more slow moving, but never dull. This novel unfolds at a satisfying pace, and is filled to the brim with fascinating, enigmatic characters, not least of all Quincy herself.Tense, gripping, and downright terrifying at times, Final Girls is one of the more memorable thrillers I've ever read.

But in an effort to condense my experience with it into a single sentence, I don't even know where to begin with ing a book like War and Peace. But in an effort to condense my experience with it into a single sentence, here we go: I didn't like it. I wanted to like it, I tried to like it, I was in fact sure I was going to like it, but even giving this novel the unenthusiastic three stars would be disingenuous.If you made a Venn diagram of things that interest me in a novel and things that interest Leo Tolstoy, there would be nothing the middle. On my side at the top of the list you've got: characters. On Tolstoy's side you've got: Russian history.Maybe it was naive for me to expect less war in a book where War comprises half the title, but my expectations going into this were all wrong. I'd been familiar with the musical Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812, which was adapted from the 70 page segment of War and Peace which focuses on the affair between Natasha and Anatole Kuragin. Already having some affection for these characters, I dove into War and Peace with a list of questions that weren't apparent to me from the musical alone: What exactly was Helene's role in the affair? What were the circumstances of Anatole's first marriage? Did Anatole ever love Natasha, or was he always out to use her? Unfortunately, such details turned out to be beside the point entirely.I've never quite read a novel like this, where the plight of the characters always seemed secondary. Here is a list of things that got more narrative attention than the main characters: Napoleon, military strategy, Tolstoy's personal philosophical musings, heavy criticism of the Great Man Theory... and if all that interests you, you will love War and Peace. But as someone who isn't so interested in war, who needs something more quotidienne to drive a story than Big Philosophical Ideas, this ended up being a long slog for me.I don't mean to imply that there's no character development at all in this 1,358 page behemoth. Pierre and Andrey notably struggle with finding their place in the world, each adopting different philosophies at different points in their lives, constantly striving to be good men. But their personal journeys weren't quite enough to really pull me into this story, especially when I didn't find either of them particularly interesting to begin with. Characters who I found much more intriguing - Helene, Anatole, Natasha, Sonya - were only ever paper thin.I think War and Peace also suffered for the unintentional contrast with Victor Hugo's Les Misérables that I couldn't quite get out of my head. (This was the initial reason I was sure I was going to love War and Peace - my only other experience with a monster-length nineteenth century novel resulted in me finding my favorite book of all time.) I can't help but to see these two novels and their musical counterparts as inversions of one another. Les Mis condenses the contents of the novel into a two and a half hour long musical, cutting it down to the absolute essential characters and events. And while it does a good job, reading the book only enriches the experience and gives you a fuller picture. Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812 extrapolates from a very small section of War and Peace - it takes characters who weren't very well developed to begin with, and gives them new depth and new life.If I ever read this again (which I don't intend to, but, never say never!) it will have to be with the intention of furthering my understanding of the Napoleonic Wars. This, in my opinion, is the height of what War and Peace has to offer. It's a seminal text where military history is concerned. But I wanted more of a story.I'm glad I can say I've read War and Peace... but the relief I felt at turning the final page isn't like anything one should feel while reading a much-loved novel....more",Notes are private!,1,80,1,Sep 2017,"Oct 27, 2017","Jun 23, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/220859.War_and_Peace

After never having read any of her books, Three Act Tragedy marks the fourth that I've read so far in 2017 (following And Then There Were None, Murder on the Orient Express, and The Murder of Roger Ackroyd). So far, none have disappointed.What I find so remarkable about Agatha Christie is that when I read her books, I never have the slightest clue whodunnit. With contemporary mysteries, I find that early on in the book I always have a guess. It's not always right, but usually 20-30% into the book I point to one character and say with a certain amount of authority, 'you, I think it was you.' I've yet to be able to do that with Agatha Christie. I still try to take a guess for the sake of being able to say 'ha, I knew it' if it ends up being right, but so far I'm 0 for 4. And my guesses are always tenuous at best - I always end up second guessing myself, because there are just so many moving pieces to her mysteries, which always come together in the most unexpected ways. She has that rare ability to make the reader go 'why didn't I think of that?' while creating plots that are so complex there's almost no way the reader is ever going to figure it out. But you still don't feel tricked, at the end, because it makes too much sense. There's such a distinct sort of satisfaction that comes from watching Christie work her magic.Three Act Tragedy starts with a dinner party thrown by Sir Charles Cartwright, where thirteen guests attend and by the end of the night, one ends up dead. It turns out the victim was just the first in a series of murders that are to unfold over the upcoming months, a mystery that the characters attempt to solve, aided by famous detective Hercule Poirot.Of the Christie novels I've read so far, Three Act Tragedy is the most focused on individual psychology, and how that factors into the crime in question. Without giving too much away, I'll just say that I was impressed by the motive that Christie devised for the murders, as well as the the way she examined the biases which prevented each of the characters who were investigating the case from solving it sooner. This wasn't quite as good as And Then There Were None, Murder on the Orient Express, or The Murder of Roger Ackroyd - there's a reason those are three of her most famous works - but still thoroughly enjoyable and shocking....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jun 14, 2017","Jun 28, 2017","Jun 14, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10122772-three-act-tragedy

This book was delightful. It's been a while since I've read a book so addicting that I couldn't resist pulling it up on my phone every time I got a spare ten seconds throughout the day, but here we are.A Fugitive in Grass Valley tells the story of Lev, part-time artist/part-time barista in a Sacramento suburb, who falls in love with Ernie, a mysterious stranger with a Tragic Past. Okay, so there's nothing particularly groundbreaking in this premise, but trust me when I tell you that this book is seriously addicting. The characters are endearing, their relationship progresses at a believable pace, the humor is consistently on point, the dialogue is realistic, and even though it's largely centered on the romance, there's also a lot going on here, as Ernie's past as a Marine-turned-mercenary starts to catch up with him. Flippy did a positively impressive amount of research for such a short little novel, and it all comes together in such a satisfying way. I honestly do not have a single negative thing to say about it.In case you're still unconvinced, let me reiterate: you do not need to be an avid romance reader to enjoy this book. If you're a fan of contemporary dramas and compelling characters, there is a very good chance that you'll also be charmed by it. Sure, it may indulge in a bit more sappiness here and there than the kind of stuff I usually read, which is why I doubt I'm going to make a habit of reading this genre, but there's nothing wrong with that every now and then. And if you are a fan of the romance genre, even better. Lev and Ernie are a couple worth rooting for if I've ever seen one.A Fugitive in Grass Valley goes on sale tomorrow. Perfect for some light beach reading this weekend.Many thanks to the author for providing me a copy of this book in exchange for an honest .

The novel mainly follows four characters: the feisty British girl Roxy, the American politician Margot, the Nigerian journalist Tunde, and the teenager Allie who escapes from her abusive foster parents and turns to a self-made religion.So, it's undoubtedly a great premise, but problem #1: I was bored to death by each one of these characters, and I was also frustrated by the unwieldy execution of the point of view shifts. The entire book is narrated in a third-person omniscient POV, but is broken up into chapters whose headings are one of the four characters' names. But, the head-hopping always felt arbitrary; for example we'd have a chapter called 'Roxy,' where the focus is actually on Allie, and it was all a bit ironic given the fact that everyone in this story just blurred together anyway. I do not need to personally care about the characters to enjoy a book, but I do need there to be a certain level of intrigue, a certain understanding of why this person's story in particular is worth telling, and I just didn't get that from any of the four protagonists here.But, my bigger issue with The Power was the distinct lack of narrative. You'd think, with the amount of literary fiction I read, that I wouldn't need a clear-cut plot to keep me engaged, but I'm learning that with SFF, a good idea alone isn't nearly enough to sustain my interest. I can't help it - I want a good story. And there just wasn't one to be found in these pages. The narrative felt scattered and uneven, potentially interesting plot threads were underdeveloped, and the pacing was either rushed or stilted. Each chapter would read as a solitary vignette before we skipped ahead another year and the characters would be doing something else entirely, and while the sections themselves were counting down to some big event - '9 years to go,' '8 years to go,' the section headings would read - this didn't provide enough tension or intrigue to counteract the boredom that mainly characterized my reading experience. I wasn't wowed by the ending, either. I did think the novel's framing device was effective, if a bit heavy-handed, but I put this down feeling nothing but relief to finally be done with it.And I mean, it's undeniable that the premise is brilliant and that certain themes in this book are fascinating. As others have observed, this is less a book about gender than it is about power; gender may be the vehicle that Alderman chooses to use, but it's less a 'feminist dystopia' than a relentlessly dark fantasy that interrogates humanity's innate blood-lust. But the fact remains that this was just so, so much better in concept than in execution. I thought Alderman's writing was simplistic and downright lifeless, which is also how I felt about her Jewish lesbian romance Disobedience, another book that fell short of its potential for me. I was hoping that my experience with this one would be different as it's a completely different genre, but I think I should just accept that I don't get on with Alderman's writing....more",Notes are private!,0,75,1,"Jan 27, 2019","Feb 13, 2019","Jun 08, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33641244-the-power

I understand why a lot of people didn't. The GloriousApparently this is an unpopular opinion, but I loved this just as much as The Glorious Heresies. I understand why a lot of people didn't. The Glorious Heresies is dark but it still retains a lot of signature Irish humor, and some warmth along with that. The Blood Miracles on the other hand is just a black tragedy. It picks up where McInerney's previous novel left off, but it follows the thread of only one of the protagonists (though a few others play peripheral roles). And it was an interesting choice to shift from following five characters to following only one, but I have no complaints here as McInerney picked the right one.I can't think of any character I've read recently who I love as much as Ryan Cusack. Ryan is a drug dealer, both his own worst enemy and a victim of circumstance as he was raised by his abusive alcoholic father after his mother's death. While The Glorious Heresies thoroughly examined Ryan's relationship with his father and the near impossibility of breaking out of the life of crime and poverty that he's been raised into, The Blood Miracles shifts the focus to another aspect of Ryan's identity - the Italian side he inherited from his mother. As his boss Dan brokers a deal with the Italian Camorra and forces Ryan into the role of translator, Ryan faces conflicts both internal and external, as he tries to forge a place for himself in this new enterprise without alienating his concerned girlfriend Karine.The main reason I imagine The Blood Miracles hasn't gone over as well as The Glorious Heresies is that the only plot here revolves around the intricacies of drug dealing and Irish gang dynamics, and if you tried to sell this book to me with that pitch alone I can't say I'd be terribly excited about it. But I think it's a testament to McInerney's skill that I was riveted. She expertly peels back the layers of contemporary Irish society to reveal its dark underworld, infusing her narration with Cork dialect to lend it a vibrant authenticity. This book is brutally, unflinchingly honest in a way that I find so refreshing.I just adore McInerney's writing. I love her distinctly unpolished style, her flawed and vulnerable and occasionally loathsome characters, her skill at tying together personal and social conflicts. This book is even darker and more violent than its predecessor and I wouldn't recommend it to everyone, but if any of that appeals to you, I cannot recommend these books highly enough. I'm not sure if she's planning on writing more in this series, but I thought the ending was perfect - it ties up all loose ends while still leaving the door open if she chooses to continue Ryan's story.

I have such a lingering resentment toward it that I almost dismissed Chemistry the novel for its title alone, but I was able to put my hatred of the subject aside long enough to really enjoy this - though I'm not sure 'enjoy' is the right word. This is an incredibly intense book, and I felt like I wasn't able to truly come up for air until I'd finished it.Chemistry is The Bell Jar meets The Vegetarian but also something a bit lighter, quirkier. It doesn't indulge in the same gory details of the two I just compared it to - this isn't a book about psychiatric wards and forced hospitalization. Our unnamed narrator begins seeing a psychiatrist of her own free will, tries to make sense of the reason she can't seem to commit to her long-term boyfriend, or the reason she just walked out on her PhD program at a prestigious university in Boston. It's about her journey learning to trust, learning to give herself to another person while not compromising what she was raised to believe.Weike Wang takes the traditional disintegrating mental health narrative and propels it into uncharted territory, by chronicling the mental breakdown of a young Asian American woman. The novel examines the ways that her upbringing - born in China, raised in the U.S. by Chinese immigrant parents - influenced the way she navigates adulthood, and the struggles that have arisen for her because of it.The prose is spare and concise, but it isn't simplistic. This is a very technically well crafted book, which plays with a fusion of tenses, past and present narratives often coexisting in a single paragraph. Though the large font and just-barely-200-pages makes it tempting to breeze through this, speed read Chemistry at your own peril. This is such a richly detailed book that you need to really slow yourself down in order to get everything out of it that Wang intended. This book won't work for everyone. It's very light on plot and heavy on character analysis, full of razor sharp commentary on parental expectations and academic pressure. It's definitely one of these books that's going to appeal the most to people who have been in similar situations as the narrator, whether it's being raised in the U.S. by Chinese parents (which does not apply to me) or having struggled with mental health while in an intensive academic setting (which definitely applies to me), so if you read this summary and think 'there's nothing here for me,' chances are, there probably won't be. But if you see even a fraction of yourself reflected in the narrator's circumstances, this can be a very intense and harrowing read, though one that's not without an underlying glimmer of hope....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Jun 29, 2017",Jul 2017,"Jun 01, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/31684925-chemistry

I'm sure it was mostly a fault in my own expectations, but I'd been in the mood for something unapologetically fun and silly, so I was disappointed by how deceptively seriously The Gentleman's Guide to Vice and Virtue ended up taking itself. I'm conflicted about this book.It tells the story of Monty, rich but rebellious heir to his father's estate. Monty embarks on a Grand Tour of Europe with his best friend Percy (who he happens to be in love with), and his sister Felicity. Again, what I was expecting was an unabashedly ridiculous romp through early-Modern continental Europe, but unfortunately I found the plot anything but thrilling. It bounced from city to city in a rather perfunctory way (I never was able to visualize the atmosphere of the setting in a way I would have liked), and it dealt with an array of rather serious topics: homophobia, racism, abuse. In and of itself this isn't a bad thing at all, but I thought the execution here was just a bit... basic? The extent of Mackenzi Lee's exploration of these issues kind of amounted to 'Percy is not afforded as many opportunities as Monty because of the color of his skin.' Okay...? Yes? Obviously? That's all? This ultimately struck me as a book that was on the rather young end of the YA spectrum. That's not to say that you can't enjoy it if you're older, of course, but this is the kind of occasionally preachy YA book that I ordinarily like to shy away from.Though I loved each of these characters individually and was ultimately rooting for their relationship, I also wasn't a fan of how Mackenzi Lee chose to develop it. Here's the thing: when your story centers around the possibility of a relationship between two characters, you can't show your hand too early. You can't tell us essentially from the very beginning that Monty and Percy are into each other, and then rely on the tired trope of miscommunication to keep them apart for the duration of the story. There's just... no tension, just a rather prolonged story while you're awaiting the inevitable conclusion. But as I said, I did love these characters, Monty in particular. He's exactly the kind of well-rounded anti-hero I love. Though you see nothing but his flaws at first, his guile and loyalty easily won me over. He's the sort of character who acts in a loud and brash way to cover up his own fears and insecurities, and I thought Mackenzi Lee did a very good job of developing his character in a believable way throughout the book. He's occasionally infuriating, but ultimately hard not to love. I was pleasantly surprised by Felicity as well, who for some reason I thought was going to be an awkward accessory to the main narrative - but she ended up having a fantastic role.I know this  has been mostly negative, but I did really enjoy reading this. It was quick and occasionally fun - the truly lighthearted moments were the ones I thought shone the most - but this basically boils down to the fact that I was not the right reader for this book.

But it's also an engaging revenge tale that's so Aeschylean it could have been straight out of The Oresteia. I mean, naturally I loved it.I read Kanae Minato's second novel to be translated into English, Penance, earlier this year, and I really enjoyed it, but I was actually surprised by how similar Confessions ended up being. Each deals with the aftermath of a child's death, and the revenge sought by the grieving mother. Both books are also told in a series of chapters which change point of views and tell the same story from different angles. In this case, the story centers around Yuko Morigucho, a teacher and a single mother whose daughter Manami was recently murdered by two of her students.Admittedly the first chapter of Confessions, the one narrated by Moriguchi, ended up being my favorite. It went out on such a bang that I actually yelled out loud at the chapter's final reveal. It's genuinely one of the most shocking and disturbing twists I've ever read.Though the other chapters didn't end up being quite as strong, it was still a fast paced, engaging, sinister read. Rather ironically, the two chapters which I found the least interesting were the point of views of the two murderers (doesn't that sound like it should be exciting?). By that point, the rehashing of the events was getting a bit stale, and neither perspective offered as much insight as it should have.

But that's about all that can be said for The First Day, which I found to be directionless and disappointingly misogynistic.This book is divided into two parts. The first half chronicles a love affair between a priest called Orr and a Beckett scholar called Anna, living in Belfast. The two of them fall in and out of love, and somewhere in between, they have a child, called Sam. The second half is set some thirty years into the future in New York City, where Sam is working at the Met, and suddenly comes into contact with a figure from his past.There's not much congruity between these two halves. Each focus on different themes - the first, adultery, religion, predestination; the second, sexuality, fear, shame. Harrison's writing seemed to exist constantly on the precipice of genuine insight - if he had given himself more room to develop the themes in this novel, I think the result would have been a lot more resonant. But unfortunately, coming in at 224 pages, this novel stops short of making any sort of statement that hasn't been made before. And it's frustrating, because Harrison is an incredibly skilled writer. His prose is incisive and clever and compulsively readable - lyrical, but not flowery - but really, it ends up being window dressing for a rather aimless story, that builds tension but culminates in a lackluster conclusion.And now to my second criticism - the treatment of female characters in this novel is abhorrent. Or should I say, character. One. There's really only one female character who makes any significant impact on this story, and while the men around her are three-dimensional, complex, enigmatic, contradictory, she, Anna, is essentially a void, unfulfilled until she becomes a mother. This is one of those books that is so, so obviously written by a male author. I'm sorry, but when you devote an entire paragraph to the experience of motherhood being literally (I'm not bending the use of the word 'literally,' folks) orgasmic, you've lost me.""For Anna, the sheer physicality of her son was a starling location of pleasure, an eroticism she had not expected but found herself longing for daily, the strange combination of pain and focused, visceral pleasure[...]""Anyway. Disappointing too were Anna's lack of convictions about Orr, who let her down on more than one occasional, but who she still begged to take her back when he tried to leave. Again, all of this wouldn't sting quite so much if Anna weren't the only noteworthy female character in this novel.I still have no idea how to rate this, so I'm going with the noncommittal 3 stars. I occasionally liked this in spite of myself, in spite of my many criticisms, and undoubtedly it will work better for some people than it did for me. Phil Harrison is definitely one to watch in Irish literary circles. With the self-assured quality of the prose, it's hard to believe this is a debut novel.I received a copy of this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest .

In Fall River MassachusettsLizzie Borden took an axe and gave her mother forty whacks; when she saw what she had done, she gave her father forty-one. In Fall River Massachusetts, 1892, Andrew and Abby Borden were gruesomely murdered, and Lizzie (daughter of Andrew; stepdaughter of Abby) was charged with the crime before eventually being acquitted. In See What I Have Done, Sarah Schmidt gives a fictionalized account of the Borden murders, one of the most notorious unsolved crimes in American history.I love true crime, I love fictionalizations of real people and real historical events... all things considered I was really excited for this book.Unfortunately I didn't like a single thing about it.This isn't eerie and twisted and sinister like I was hoping it would be... it's mainly gross? And I mean, really, really gross. I think the author uses a lot of these disgusting descriptions to try to shock a visceral reaction out of the reader, and I don't have a lot of patience for that. What's so shocking about vomit or pieces of mutton in some man's beard? Nothing, really, it just creates an atmosphere I have no interest spending any time in. It was such a struggle to pick this book back up every time I put it down. I very seriously considered DNFing this book at 85% because I just couldn't gather the motivation to push through. I ended up skimming through to the end.I thought See What I Have Done read like a first draft - a very rough, underdeveloped first draft. The structure of this novel is confusing and hard to follow; the prose is jarring and the pace is odd and uneven. It was kind of like trying to walk through a path in the forest that hasn't been manicured, and constantly tripping over roots and branches, i.e., frustrating, painful, and more time consuming than it needs to be. The prose gets rather experimental at times, especially in the chapters told from Lizzie's point of view; e.g., ""the clock ticked ticked,"" which I think was meant to be evocative and unsettling, but for me it served only to irritate. Here's another example:""I thought of Father, my stomach growled hunger and I went to the pail of water by the well, let my hands sink into the cool sip sip.""I'm sorry but this just did not work for me.All of the characters were rather loathsome, but not in a particularly intriguing way. This is a book about truly repulsive people who act a fraction of their age, and it gets old fast. I didn't care about Lizzie, I didn't care about Andrew and Abby Borden, I didn't really care about Lizzie's sister Emma... the only character who was even remotely sympathetic to me was the maid, Bridget, but her few point of view chapters (complete with dialogue that includes a truly horrendous transcription of the Irish accent) weren't enough to hold my interest.One star seems harsh, especially given that I am clearly in the minority here, but I just... didn't like this book. At all. I really wish I could have seen in this book what so many other people seem to. All I can say is that if you're interested in the premise (and have a strong stomach) I encourage you to give it a shot, because you never know.

In the world that Felicia Yap depicts in Yesterday, society is divided into two groups: the majority, Monos, who only have a day's worth of memories, and the elite Duos, who can remember up to two days. When a woman is found dead, the detective on the case is literally racing against time to solve the mystery before his memory resets itself. When I read the summary, it reminded me a bit of the Nolan film Memento, which I love, so I decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately, it was a major letdown.My first major disappointment with this book came when I realized that Yap hadn't created a futuristic universe, but rather, a sort of half-baked parallel one. The events in this story take place in 2015... just a different 2015, where people have limited memories. But Virginia Woolf was still a writer, Quentin Tarantino is still making movies, and Steve Jobs is still patenting Apple products. It doesn't make any sense, and it feels lazy, like Yap took the easy road rather than putting sufficient effort into the world building. Am I really supposed to believe that civilization would have developed at the exact same rate with this massive neurological deviation? The characters have this handy device called the iDiary, in which they record their activities each day, and which they can peruse at their leisure to recall details. Characters say things like 'According to my diary, I think she's a very nice woman' and 'According to my diary, I saw them have a fight last week.' So even though they can't 'remember' everything, they still have easy access to information, and the memory twist starts to feel more like a gimmick than a quintessential thread that holds the story together. Why does it matter that they can't remember, when they have the information at their fingertips anyway?The mystery itself is bland and uninteresting. Without the memory twist, is there much of a story here? Not really. It's just window dressing. So with that in mind, what does this book have to offer? Not much. The characters are boring and paper thin, the writing is clumsy and amateur... There's nothing here that's noteworthy except for the premise, which is never utilized to its full potential. I'm glad I stuck with it, because it picks up steam about halfway through, but I have to admit I was quite relieved when I finished.I received a copy of this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest .

There was something beautiful here once.This is one of the most hard-hitting and thematically rich books I've read in a long time. There's so much to unpack here, I'm not quite sure where to begin. The Glorious Heresies centers around five characters: fifteen-year-old drug dealer Ryan and his alcoholic father Tony, grandmother Maureen and her gangster son Jimmy, and a prostitute named Georgie. The way these characters relate to one another is complicated, tangled. They weave in and out of each other's lives, implicitly connected by a single act that occurs in the first chapter: Maureen discovers an intruder in her home, and, startled, she hits him over the head, killing him. The consequences of this unplanned murder unfold over the course of the novel, which spans several years, in the city of Cork.Lisa McInerney's debut novel is an unflinching examination of the cycle of poverty that drives crime in modern day Ireland. This book not only explores the complex web of social dynamics that breeds crime and corruption, but pays particular attention to the way this is manifested across generations. Is someone truly responsible for the way they raise their children, if they too were a victim of society's moral and structural failings? Where and how does the cycle end? These are the questions McInerney raises while examining this group of broken individuals living on the fringes of society. Crime and religion are so heavily intertwined in these pages it's hard to know where one ends and the other begins, as McInerney fearlessly dissects these themes as thoroughly as possible in this not-quite-400 page novel. The Glorious Heresies is bleak and profane and at times quite depressing. But it's also darkly comedic and hopeful. McInerney's intelligent prose is laced with Irish slang that makes this a visceral and immersive reading experience, in a novel which is layered with complex characters who are each in their own way seeking retribution. It's honestly one of the most striking things I've read in a while. I know I won't stop thinking about this any time soon.Thank you Blogging for Books and Penguin Random House for the opportunity to read a copy of this book in exchange for an honest ....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"May 25, 2017","Jun 03, 2017","May 15, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29441096-the-glorious-heresies

It tells the story of Deborah Stevens, a retired former hospital manager who's just lost The Former Chief Executive is a short and sweet little book. It tells the story of Deborah Stevens, a retired former hospital manager who's just lost her husband to cancer. She hires young and charismatic Luca to look after her late husband's garden, and the two forge a strange sort of friendship.Despite the simple premise, there's a lot going on in this book. The generational gap between Deborah and Luca takes center stage; an issue that Kate Vane tackles with insight and sensitivity, as she examines each of their distinct approaches to life. There's arguably more nuance here than I've seen given to this sort of narrative before. Even though our protagonist is older, this isn't a story which maligns millennials for laziness - on the other hand, Kate Vane acknowledges a lot of advantages that Deborah's generation had.This book is also an interesting meditation on mortality. While Luca's girlfriend, Belle, is due to give birth in a short time, Luca is training to be a ""death midwife,"" someone who helps provide emotional support to terminally ill patients. Birth and death run parallel in this novel, which is ultimately a reflection on life itself, on whether anyone ever really knows what they're doing.Though mostly solid, the prose could stand a bit of polishing here and there. Little things - a few too many exclamation points and question marks outside of dialogue for my personal taste (despite the third person narration this is a very introspective book which reads like Deborah's thoughts unfolding - a narrative voice which Kate Vane employs consistently, though it does start to grate at times when Deborah continues to muse to herself in the form of question after question). My only other complaint is that I thought it ended on a note that was incongruously abrupt given the pace up until that point.That said, I was really charmed by this book. It's a really brilliant character study that weaves together a host of distinct and memorable characters. Deborah is certainly flawed - proud, judgmental - but I liked her even more for that, because I love female characters who have all the complexity of real women.

You know those books that technically do everything right, but you still don't love them for some reason? 3 stars feels unfair to the author, who's created a beautiful story that sweeps across multiple generations and locations, but I'm in the habit of using my s and ratings to express my personal experience with books. I'm not trying to reach an objective truth, here, just explain why I wasn't able to love this book the way I'd thought I was going to.The Leavers tells the story of Deming Guo, whose mother, Peilan, leaves for work one day in New York City and never comes home. Deming is then adopted by a white family, the Wilkinsons, who live in rural upstate New York. The story then follows Deming, who's been rechristened Daniel, in the decade following his adoption, as he tries to assimilate to his new life while still searching for information about his birth mother. If this book had been told entirely from the point of view of Peilan, I probably would have given it 5 stars. I found her chapters riveting; from her early years growing up in a small Chinese village to working in a factory in Fuzhou to her immigration to America, I thought her story was compelling, and I could not put the book down during these segments. Unfortunately, this was a comparatively rather small part of the novel.I just could not get invested in Deming. While there was a lot that I found intriguing about his character - his insecurity about his cultural identity, never feeling American enough or Chinese enough to fit anywhere, as well as his uncertainty about his future - there was also a lot that just bored me, for lack of a better word. So much of his narrative focuses on his gambling addiction as well as his floundering career as a guitarist, and I just felt detached from a lot of it, like I was viewing the action of this story through a hazy lens and I didn't care enough to examine it more closely. I was often frustrated by Deming, who made a series of poor decisions without much thought for the consequences, and I think this frustration was partially the point, but this character just never managed to grab me in the way I had hoped for. I pitied him in an abstract kind of way, but given that this is a largely character driven novel, there just wasn't enough to sustain my interest. The parts of this novel that deal with the unique struggles of being a Chinese American adoptee - quite literally torn between two worlds - are heart-wrenching and fascinating, but I'm sorry to say that for the most part, this book just left me cold. It's very technically well made, just lacking in emotional resonance for me.

I loved it, I loved it, I loved it. I can't remember the last time I read something that managed to be both wickedly funny and devastating, often at the exact same time. The Heart's Invisible Furies is a sweeping epic about the life of a gay man growing up in twentieth century Ireland. The story begins with Cyril's mother, Catherine Goggin, being denounced by her village church for becoming pregnant at 16 and forced to relocate to Dublin. Deciding she can't raise the child alone, Catherine gives Cyril up for adoption to a very odd couple who constantly remind him (in a surprisingly humorous way) that he's ""not a real Avery."" The closest companion that Cyril has is his friend Julian, whom he loves and idolizes in a way that he's forced to downplay as the two grow up together.This is an ambitious novel which spans about seventy years, addressing themes of sexuality, religion, the hypocrisy of the Irish Catholic church, as well as how attitudes change over time. As a protagonist, Cyril is incredibly flawed - he makes arguably unforgivable mistakes, but never out of malice; always out of a desire to find his place in a society that refuses to accept him. Despite the absurd humor, at its core this is a very sad story that actually moved me to tears more than once.Much like The Glorious Heresies, another fantastic contemporary Irish novel that I'd highly recommend, The Heart's Invisible Furies subtly makes use of fate as a prominent theme. Characters show up in each other's lives with a regularity that stretches coincidence, so fair warning, you're going to need to suspend your disbelief early on. But this is ultimately a story about how Cyril and Catherine come to find one another - you learn in the first few pages that they eventually reconnect, so it's always a question of when and how - and though neither is actively searching for the other, they weave in and out of each other's lives in unexpected ways, never knowing the other's identity. It's such a moving saga of these two flawed but strong individuals living with their regrets and the mistakes they've made.I've seen some s that criticize this book's length, and it's a fair point. I thought the pace was fantastic until the last hundred pages or so, which I thought could have been condensed. But for the most part, I absolutely flew through this - I couldn't put it down and I was sad when it was over.

Sae, Maki, Akiko, and Yuko were a close group of friends, joined by Emily in the summer of fourth grade, whose family just moved to their rural town. One day a man approaches them while they're playing, asks if one of them could help him for a moment, and walks off with Emily. A few hours later, she's found dead. The problem is, the four remaining girls can't remember what the man looked like.Penance takes place over a decade after these events, in five chapters told from the point of view of each of the girls and Emily's mother, and focuses on the aftermath of the murder, and the effect it had on each of them.I could not put this book down. It's not really a gripping page-turner in the sense that there's an urgent mystery to solve or anything like that. It's more of a psychological thriller, which thoroughly examines the role that guilt plays in the lives of each of the girls, and how a promise they made to Emily's mother prevents each of them from living a normal life. Each of the characters is compelling - Emily's mother perhaps most of all - and the numerous layers to this story makes it an engaging read. Penance explores themes of guilt, rage, retribution, and revenge, centering entirely on a host of female characters, each with a distinct voice and personality. Certain aspects of this story are unrealistic - something happens to each of the girls that's like, 'what are the odds?' - but it honestly lends this story the air of a parable, something that feels more like a story than something that could happen in real life. But that's okay. It's a damn good story.Fair warning: this is a dark book. Trigger warnings for rape, suicide, child abuse, and violence. Proceed with caution.

Maus had obviously been on my radar for ages as a critical piece of Holocaust literature as well as being the only graphic novel to ever win the Pulitzer Prize, so I was certainly expecting it to be good, but I don't think anything could have prepared me for how utterly harrowing of a read this ended up being. And again, yes, I did know that its subject matter was the Holocaust, but I also knew that Spiegelman made the famous stylistic decision to depict Jews as mice and Nazis as cats in this book, so I guess I was expecting something altogether more abstract? Instead it's a rather literal depiction of Spiegelman's father's experiences throughout WWII, culminating in his release from Auschwitz in 1945.There's also an added dimension where Spiegelman chooses to depict the scenes in which he interviewed his father and came to hear these stories. In this present-day timeline we learn about Spiegelman's complex relationship with his father, and all the tension and resentment that's built up between them through the years, often due to the fact that his father's life was shaped so significantly by this atrocious thing that Spiegelman struggles to make sense of, as he was born after the end of the war. Spiegelman also lost his mother to suicide decades earlier, a tragic event from which his father had never fully recovered, though he did go on to remarry. In one particularly devastating panel, Spiegelman laments to his wife that he wishes he could have been in Auschwitz with his parents so he could understand what they had to go through, so he could bridge that gap between generations. That's this book in a nutshell: raw, unfiltered, uncompromising. It takes a strong stomach to get through this, and I think I spent the better part of it in tears, but if you're able to read this, I cannot recommend it highly enough. This is the best graphic novel I've read, the best piece of Holocaust literature that I've read, and strangely enough, the best love story that I've read.

I'm not saying that lightly.Gone Without a Trace is about Hannah, a thirty-somethThis is a very strong contender for the worst book I have ever read. I'm not saying that lightly.Gone Without a Trace is about Hannah, a thirty-something young woman living the dream - she's got a house, a boyfriend, a steady job, and an imminent promotion. Until she comes home one day and finds that her boyfriend Matt has left her, in the most cold and calculated way possible - he's moved out all of his stuff, erased his number from her phone, deleted the pictures of him off her computer, and deactivated all of his social media accounts. She literally has no way to contact him, and she has no idea why he left.I love the premise. It sounds like a nightmare, for someone to forcibly remove him or herself from your life in such an extreme way. This book had all the potential in the world... but Mary Torjussen dropped the ball. Getting through this book was agonizing. The prose was some of the most juvenile I've ever seen - exclamation points everywhere and probably about 80% of the sentences starting with ""I"" (""I wondered why Matt would do this to me! I loved him! I needed to find him!"" - those sentences are my own, but I think they condense the contents of this book rather nicely). I try not to judge thrillers on their literary merit, but come on. This was painful to read. And on top of that, it was just insanely boring. Hannah literally spends months - about 60% of the novel - trying to track down Matt, even though all signs point to him having left voluntarily. Each of her fruitless efforts is recorded in excruciating detail - why do I care that she's calling Matt's barber? And now his mechanic? And now every hotel in the greater Liverpool area? (Why doesn't she hire a private investigator? She has the money. She starts to go to such extreme lengths to find him, impersonating people, trying to trick them into divulging details; why wouldn't she just hire a professional at this point? Nothing in this book makes sense.)My other major annoyance throughout this book that I just want to mention briefly was Hannah's relationship with her ""best friend,"" Katie. These two had one of the pettiest relationships I've ever seen - when will we stop depicting all female friendships as catty and competitive? That's not real life. If you're 32 years old and you're still secretly trying to one-up everything your best friend does as if you're still in middle school, maybe you should reevaluate this supposedly rock solid friendship. The characters in this book just don't act like real people - they're shoddy and offensive caricatures. And then we get to the twist. No spoilers, but I just... I literally do not have the words to describe how dumb this ending was. It's like the author was spinning a giant wheel of possible explanations including the likes of ""aliens made them do it"" and ""it was all a dream"" but instead landed on... whatever the hell we got instead. The 'explanation' we get to justify these characters' behavior doesn't make any sense. It doesn't fit with the information we'd had until that point, and not in the kind of way where if you went back to reread the beginning, you'd be able to read between the lines and see the truth lurking beneath. No, the explanation we get just doesn't add up. The entire ending of this book is one big incongruous, plot hole-ridden mess. I'd have preferred the aliens, to be perfectly honest.To impress upon you just how terrible this book was, I have to tell you that I literally started doing a dramatic reading for my roommate toward the end, because we were getting into straight up comical territory. I'm sorry, but how did this book get published? It wasn't fast paced, it wasn't a page turner, it wasn't fun, it wasn't creepy, it was just... bad. I would compare this book to a soap opera, but soap operas didn't do anything to deserve that.I received a copy of this book in a Goodreads giveaway.

Still, I thought I'd give it a shot and hope my love of Irish lit would prevail. Instead I think my dislike of magical realism won out.Here's what I don't like about this genre. (I realize this is a blanket statement and that there are exceptions - I can even think of some myself. But, just talking generally.) I feel like a lot of magical realism arbitrarily includes magical or supernatural elements to force a certain tone or atmosphere onto the story, but rather than being integrated into the framework of the narrative, these elements feel more like awkward accessories.What I mean is: in Himself, the main character, Mahoney, sees dead people. There are ghosts on almost every page of this book, and there's an air of mysticism about the fictional town of Mulderrig. Consequently, I want to call this book 'creepy' or 'eerie' or even 'whimsical,' but, was it really any of those things? It was sort of a hollow story. Mahoney, orphaned from a young age, returns to his hometown at the age of 26 to find out the truth of what happened to his mother. A lot of tedium and forgettable characters ensue, and the story lacked an engaging emotional core to draw you in. I just didn't care, and the ghosts didn't do it any favors, because they didn't really do anything - even the ones that I thought would play a larger role in the narrative ultimately did not - so I guess they're just there to make the book seem creepier than it actually is.So, why 3 stars? It's more like 2.5 rounded up, but, Jess Kidd's prose is stunning. This book was beautifully, brilliantly written, and when it's so clearly a case of 'it's not you, it's me,' I feel compelled to be generous in my rating. If you like mysteries and contemporary Irish lit as much as I do but you are kinder to magical realism, there's a good chance you'll love this. Maybe you'll get more out of the ghosts than I did....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Jan 21, 2018","Feb 04, 2018","Apr 14, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30753697-himself

There's nothiThis is an unassuming little book, the sum of which somehow manages to exceed its parts and become something unexpectedly extraordinary. There's nothing terribly original about this book's premise - a plane crashes, two strangers need to learn how to survive together - but reading Castle of Water is like taking a breath of fresh air. I was surprised by how much I loved it.Barry Bleecker one day decides to leave his corporate Manhattan job and travel to the grave of his favorite painter, Paul Gauguin, which lies somewhere in the Marquesas. French architect and newlywed Sophie Ducel and her husband Étienne are on a honeymoon in French Polynesia, and they decide to take a detour to visit the grave of singer Jacques Brel, incidentally buried a few yards away from Gauguin. When their plane crashes somewhere between Tahiti and the Marquesas, Étienne and the pilot die on impact, leaving only Barry and Sophie to survive on a small island together - which is complicated not only by Sophie's grief, but also by a limited patience and understanding for each other's language and culture.Dane Huckelbridge's prose is hard to describe. Castle of Water is told in third-person omniscient narration which is almost insensitively concise; full of facts and devoid of any sentimentality. This story is also told with a weird, offbeat humor that resists any temptation of melodrama. It's not at all what you'd expect and should theoretically clash with the premise of the story, which invites an onslaught of emotion and introspection. But, somehow, Huckelbridge's approach works. Better than it should, and yet, better than its maudlin alternative. This story isn't heartless, it isn't cold and unfeeling. And it isn't a comedy, either. At its core this is a bitterly, achingly sad story, which managed to both make me laugh out loud and break my heart. Sure, this book is full of unrealistic conveniences: the survival kit they salvaged from the plane has literally everything they could possibly want; they each have unique survival knowledge that transcends the very basics you'd learn in the boy scouts; there is no universe in which three pairs of contact lenses being worn every single day is going to last a person several years; Sophie is magically able to continue to have her period despite her drastic weight loss and without any mention as to how on earth she dealt with it without an unlimited supply of tampons (this one really bugged me), but getting hung up on these details is to miss the point, because this is so much more than a simple Survival Story. If you want to read 300 pages about people surviving in the elements with nothing but the clothes on their backs, there's plenty of fiction and nonfiction about that already. In giving these characters certain basic necessities, Huckelbridge is bending this story in a different direction, making it less about Survival and more about the characters themselves, how they interact, and how their relationship progresses. Castle of Water is first and foremost a story about humanity; about two imperfect strangers drawing on each other's strengths in order to endure - not only to physically survive, but to sustain themselves on a deeper level.It's hard to communicate what exactly was so special about this book which seems so unremarkable. I can only say that Castle of Water is a book with many hidden depths, and it was a joy to read. Though there weren't a lot of surprises, plot-wise, the big surprise was really the emotional reaction these character elicited from me. Barry and Sophie were incredibly sympathetic and complex in their own right - Sophie in particular I grew rather attached to - and I'm sad to be leaving them behind.I received a copy of this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest .

We sort of pick up where we left off, chronologRoses of May is more of a companion novel, rather than a sequel, to Hutchinson's The Butterfly Garden. We sort of pick up where we left off, chronologically, but then we follow a different thread. FBI Agent Brandon Eddison features more heavily in this novel, and we see a fair bit of Inara and Bliss, but the meat of the story is about a new character altogether. Priya Svrasti's sister Chavi was murdered by a serial killer five years ago; every May he seeks out a new victim, always a young girl, and murders her in a church and covers her with flowers. As springtime approaches, the FBI agents involved in the case - and Priya - want to make sure this man is found before he kills again.What I found interesting about this novel is that Hutchinson didn't play to what everyone agrees are the strengths that she exhibited in The Butterfly Garden. The power of that book was all in the atmosphere. The contrast between the stunning setting and the horrors that occurred in those pages made it both terrifying and unforgettable... but there's none of that here. This is a rather run of the mill thriller that has none of The Butterfly Garden's magic.That's not to say that it's boring. It isn't. It's a quick and engaging read. I wanted to know what happened, and I was immediately invested in Priya, who's both strong and vulnerable, in a way that's reminiscent of Inara (whom I loved), but not so similar that it feels like Hutchinson is rehashing the same character again.However, there's a lot that I was frustrated with. (1) To me, Priya's relationship with her mother was completely unbelievable, and the extent of what her mother allowed was absolutely ridiculous (you'll know what I'm talking about by the end). (2) I thought the FBI agents facilitating the connection between Priya and Inara was beyond unprofessional, and the interest they took in Priya fell somewhere in the realm of unprofessional and unbelievable - maybe both, I'm not entirely sure. (3) I was able to guess the killer the second he was introduced to the story, and anyone else who's ever read a thriller will be able to do the same.And finally, it's up to you to decide if this is a good thing or a bad thing (I think it's clear where I stand on the matter), but just a general observation: this novel read a lot more like YA than The Butterfly Garden did. Priya is younger than Inara was, so that may have something to do with it, but honestly, there was just a general preachiness to it that I hadn't really been expecting from an adult thriller. Two recurring themes in Roses of May are 'it's okay to not be okay,' and 'you choose your family,' both of which Hutchinson bashes us over the head with, over. and over. and over. and over. I'm not kidding - toward the end, we literally have someone ask Priya if she's okay, and she says something like ""Aren't I always?"" and he replies ""No. And that's okay."" I lost track of the amount of times I rolled my eyes reading this book. Characters are also constantly making comments about how badass Priya and her mom are, which started to feel rather self-congratulatory by the end. There's also a majorly corny excess of 'this character knows EXACTLY what this other character needs, EXACTLY when they need it'... for such a dark subject matter, this book shows a rather idealized picture of humanity.I mean, Hutchinson is a good writer. She knows how to craft a compelling story. She kept me flipping pages, both here and in The Butterfly Garden. But Roses of May just... wasn't entirely what I wanted. It may have been stronger on its own than as a follow up to The Butterfly Garden, but Hutchinson set the bar high for herself with that one, and I can't help but to feel like Roses of May suffered for it.Trigger warnings for rape (nothing graphic, but it's mentioned fairly frequently), suicide, eating disorders, and emetophobia.I received a copy of this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest .

This is Fates and Furies all over again.White Fur was a long, painful slog for me. I thought this book was overwritten and vapid; the characters were loathsome and one-dimensional; and perhaps most frustratingly, there was a distinct lack of subtlety to a narrative which was anemic to begin with. Filthy rich Jamey falls in love with Elise from the wrong side of the tracks, and... they have a lot of sex. That's it. That's the book. If you're expecting a nuanced examination of class differences, keep looking, because there's none of that here.Take this passage, where Elise is meeting Jamey's family:Elise should be a Dartmouth lacrosse star whose granddad went to Groton with Bats, and she should be bronzed from the Vineyard, lips opaquely shiny from Chapstick. So happy to meet you, Mr. Hyde!But no! Jamey is pushing forward the real Elise, in couture dress, shins bruised from basketball, cornrows latticing her lean head, feet wedged into slingbacks.Getting hit by a freight train whose sides are painted with the words THEY COME FROM DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS may have been more subtle, but okay. And this wouldn't be quite so bad if it weren't literally the entire book. There is absolutely no depth here. Jamey is rich and handsome and discontent and restrained, and Elise is poor and crass and loud and impulsive. Jardine Libaire leaves all her cards on the table by the end of the second chapter. There is nothing left to discover about these characters when every facet of their practically non-existent personalities has been spelled out from the very first page.There's something undeniably voyeuristic about the way this story is spun. This book isn't romantic. It's gritty, dirty, raw. It's about the ugly sides of relationships, about jealousy and obsession. But that wasn't the problem, because in theory that all sounds great to me. I love books that take a conventional premise and then spin the narrative in a different direction. It's Romeo and Juliet but instead of love it's passion, lust, obsession? Cool. Sounds fun.But it wasn't. I just didn't care. Why was I suffering through the uncomfortable experience of acting as a voyeur into the lives of these two characters who bored me to tears? The answer is because I don't DNF books. That's it. That's the only thing that kept me going. There was absolutely no intrigue, and absolutely no payoff for sticking with it as long as I did.I thought the prose was terrible. It was trying so hard to come across as devil-may-care that I felt an acute sense of secondhand embarrassment for how much it did care. Each sentence felt artificially manufactured with MFA-degree precision (not that there's anything wrong with getting an MFA in creative writing, but sometimes it just shows; what should come across as effortless becomes painfully obtrusive on every page.) What we're left with isn't artistic or poignant or emotional or insightful, it's mostly just insipid. (Vaguely NSFW text ahead, this quote is taken from a sex scene.)Jamey is starting to operate in a trance, biting his lip. He's a mystical vision of an orangutan in a nature show. He actually has the thought: I'm a monkey, and that's okay. He's got a dumb look on his face and that's okay. For a minute, an hour later, right before he comes again, with two tongues licking him like kittens, he understands everything.I'm sorry, but what is the point? Is this supposed to be profound? Sexy? Shocking? It's not any of those things. It's awkward. It's dumb. It's embarrassing. I could not stop cringing the entire time I was reading this.But in an effort of not ending on a terribly negative note: none of my Goodreads friends who have read this have given it less than 4 stars. This is clearly a matter of personal taste, so if you think this sounds like the sort of thing you'll like, give it a try! And I'm sorry for being so negative, but this is one of those books which managed to tick every item on a checklist I didn't even know I had of things I hate in fiction.

The Girl In The Ice follows DCI Erika Foster, who's recently been reinstated to the police force after a failed mission which resulted in the death of her husband. She's investigating the death of young socialite Andrea Douglas-Brown, whose body was found in a frozen pond in London. Much tedium ensues. I guess I wouldn't describe The Girl In The Ice as a slog, but it wasn't exactly a page-turner, either. Especially thanks to a totally unnecessary conflict between Erika and her boss, which results in Erika being sidelined from the investigation and then spending many chapters just waiting for people to call her back and keep her updated. This book was so much longer than it needed to be because of this subplot.Anyway, interspersed with Erika's perspective are chapters from the point of view of the murderer, who is referred to (presumably in an effort to hide their gender?) solely as 'the figure.' It's alright the first time Robert Bryndza does it, but then it just gets weird. ""The figure watches Erika. She steps toward the window. The figure retreats. I want to kill her, muses the figure."" (That's not a real quote, but it basically could be.) I mean, why wouldn't you just write these chapters in first person?? Or use a gender neutral 'they,' or eliminate these kind of pointless chapters altogether, or just... do anything to avoid having to resort to 'the figure'??Which brings me to my main complaint with this book: the writing was startlingly, inexcusably bad. I obviously don't read thrillers for their literary merit, but we're almost verging into 'how did this get published' territory with lines like:""'DCI Sparks. I have just been to the crime scene and there are things...' started Erika.'I said, I'm now in control of this crime scene and I'm ordering you to step aside!' shouted Sparks, losing it.""And that's not even to mention the murderer's eloquent declaration:""'You think you can analyze me. Rationalize what I did, why I killed? I did it because I CAN.'""Yes, that's a real quote.When you have to put the book down during the big climactic scene because you're laughing too hard, that's never a good sign.There's one element of this book that I thought I was going to love - the criticism of how the investigation into Andrea's death wasn't being conducted properly in order to preserve the rich family's decorum (e.g., Erika isn't allowed to announce in a press conference the name of the shady bar where Andrea was last seen, because it would look bad for the family to be associated with a place like that). The problem is, it quickly becomes so heavy-handed, and no matter how much I agree with a message, I don't like it being shoved in my face.

EIt's hard to say where exactly Omar El Akkad went wrong with American War, because on the surface, this appears to be such a well-constructed novel. El Akkad ties in the story of our protagonist, Sarat, with his imagined vision of a second American Civil War in a way that's comprehensive and undeniably steeped with tragedy. The world building in this novel is immense, with various news articles scattered like historical set pieces throughout the narrative. But when you look closer, there are too many gaping holes.What about the current social climate in America, with all our institutionalized racism and police brutality, suggests that we're moving toward a post-racial, colorblind society? How can El Akkad draw so heavily on the first American Civil War for his narrative and completely ignore the question of slavery and racism? How can the South continue to use fossil fuels when the rest of the country no longer does? How did the Mexican annexation of a large region of the U.S. come about? How on earth did every country in the Middle East come together in the span of about fifty years (?!?!) to form a republic?These are just a few of the questions American War left me with. Maybe they're not the point. But I can't help but to feel like a novel which goes to such great lengths to set the stage for this future-alternate history needs to be able to provide the reader with satisfactory answers.My second issue with this book is that it's dull, tedious, and downright boring. If I hadn't been reading this for a book club, I would have strongly considered DNFing, which as you guys know, I never do. I just couldn't bring myself to care about Sarat, who felt more like a caricature than a well-developed character in her own right, or about the background characters who littered the narrative without much depth or individual personalities.I was really disappointed by this book. I thought that a novel about a second American Civil War would be difficult to read because of what a realistic possibility it is, but American War was never able to convince me that it was anything other than highly imaginative fiction. Maybe I could have forgiven that if the plot or characters held my attention, but they didn't.

Though it starts out slow, iThis was mostly an inoffensive read for me - I was intrigued, but only mildly so - but my god, did it go out with a bang. Though it starts out slow, it gradually gathers steam, and then that final, satisfying denouement brings it all together in a way I hadn't been expecting. Fantastic. But let's back up.Six Stories is a novel constructed as a series of podcasts, in which an investigative journalist looks into the mysterious death of 15-year-old Tom Jeffries, which occurred twenty years ago. By interviewing people who knew Tom, podcast host Scott King attempts to paint as clear a picture as possible of the circumstances surrounding his death.I actually picked up this book right after finishing Are You Sleeping by Kathleen Barber, and I had to put it down almost immediately because the premises were just too similar. Are podcast murder mysteries the hot new trend? Anyway, so I put down Six Stories, read a different book, and returned, ready to give this style murder mystery another try. And I'm glad I did, because Six Stories blows Are You Sleeping out of the water, in my opinion. Of course, they're completely different narratives and the novels are formatted rather differently, but while I felt that Are You Sleeping suffered and lost some of its intrigue for each new information reveal, I thought Six Stories only became stronger with each successive chapter.Part true crime investigation, part character study, and part ghost story, Six Stories balances each of these elements satisfactorily, creating an uneasy atmosphere, and you can't help but to wonder what's lurking beneath the surface of each of the six stories that are told. Matt Wesolowski does a fantastic job at playing with themes of perception and subjectivity, as each character's perspective alters the story in some fundamental way. The dynamics amongst Tom's friend group are also fascinating. There's Charlie, the 'leader,' wild and reckless; Eva, the second in command; Anyu, the sensible one; and Brian, the outsider. Where does Tom fit in? It's a compelling and intricate dynamic that Scott King does his best to untangle in his podcast.Because of its format - interviewing six people about the same series of events - this book does undeniably suffer from an excess of repetition. The interviews really do read like podcast transcripts, so kudos to Wesolowski for nailing that format, but unfortunately, this isn't always a good thing. While interrupting interviews partway through to fill the reader in on background information and constantly reminding 'listeners' of information that was revealed in the last 'episode' seems like a realistic approach, it makes for rather tedious reading at times. Fortunately it's a short novel, coming in at 225 pages, so you won't get too bored. But I still feel that it could have been edited down to be a bit more concise.Overall, an unexpectedly satisfying read. Though it's not the most original story ever told, the modern twist (or gimmick, you could argue) of the podcast breathes new life into this genre. I do wonder if we're going to start getting an excess of these Serial-inspired podcast murder mystery books, which I worry could become quite tedious - but for one of the pioneering novels in this unique subgenre, Six Stories is original, well-crafted, and after a certain amount of initial exposition, compelling. It takes a while to get going, but if you pick it up, you owe it to yourself to stick with it until the very end.I received a copy of this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest .

A literary, character-driven story about an unexpected death in a small town with just a flavor of mystery is literally right up my alley (see also: Everything I Never Told You, Swimming Lessons, Dead Letters, You Will Know Me, etc. - all books I loved!) But for me, Girl in Snow just didn't work. And it wasn't because there wasn't enough of a mystery - I'd been expecting that. Or that the main characters weren't really good people - this is something I really don't mind in fiction. Honestly, it was because the writing was painfully juvenile. I just couldn't get past how irritating I found the prose. It read like YA, and there's nothing wrong with that, but it's not a genre that I particularly enjoy. The fact that this is being marketed as an adult literary mystery suggests that Kukafka was aiming for an adult audience and missed the mark entirely. From the other side of the door came the swell and sway of her breathing, a delicate rhythm that reminded him with such peaceful clarity that he was alive. I am, I am, I am, she told him with this inhale and exhale and inhale and exhale. I am alive, and so are you, and isn't this a paralyzing thing?Yeah, this is definitely the sort of thing that I may have found poignant when I was a teenager.The other thing I hated about the writing was that practically every other paragraph was a character remembering some trivial detail about their past, that urgently had to be recounted. These characters couldn't stay in the present long enough to have a simple conversation, and it started to drive me crazy. Maybe I'm just not sentimental enough, but I couldn't keep from rolling my eyes when your story is filled with lines like: 'He was having fish for dinner. Once, his dad took him fishing.' Okay, that's not a real quote. This is:""Is this a church?"" Cameron asked.Cameron's family used to go to church. He would sit between Mom and Dad and wonder how long he could hold his breath without dying.This is just.... literally the entire book is written like this.Of the three characters, I didn't find any of them particularly compelling. The police officer investigating the case, Russ, was so bland that I audibly groaned on more than one occasion when I saw that the upcoming chapter was his POV. Cameron, Lucinda's stalker who believes himself to be in love with her, was a character who I found rather disturbing, and while I think this was partially the point, he wasn't someone whose head I particularly enjoyed inhabiting. His chapters also read as the most juvenile, which makes sense, as he's the youngest narrator, but I think it's possible to write from the point of view of teenagers (especially when it isn't even first-person narration) without losing your adult voice as an author. Jade, a girl a few years older than Lucinda who hadn't liked her, was definitely the most interesting of the three, but the fact that so much of her narration was taken up with pining after her ex-boyfriend was a bit tiring.I should have been able to finish this book in two days, but it ended up taking me two weeks, because every time I put it down I had no motivation to pick it back up. This was an overwhelmingly blasé reading experience. I was hoping for at least a few moments of poignancy or insight, but Girl in Snow left me cold. I felt like it never really delivered on anything it promised, and I'm left wondering what exactly the point was.I don't want to be unkind. This is Danya Kukafka's debut novel, and she's a young writer. While her writing style obviously wasn't to my taste, I will make the distinction that it wasn't objectively bad. I just think this book would have worked so much better targeted at a younger audience. There's a lot that teenagers can take away from this story: Jade's struggle with her body image, Cameron's vulnerability. But as an adult reader who was hoping to read an adult novel? It just didn't do much for me.I received a copy of this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest . Thank you Netgalley, Simon & Schuster, and Danya Kukafka.

I am not in the habit of quoting others' s in my own, but there's a blurb from crime writer Rod Reynolds on the book that says 'A masterclass in suspense and delayed terror, reading it felt like I was driving at top speed towards a cliff edge - and not once did I want to take my foot off the pedal' - and I think that sums it up better than I could.I've had this book on my shelf for years, and I can't remember where or how I first heard about it, but I think I had it in my head that it was going to be a fairly standard thriller, which I had been in the mood for. But it was no disappointment to me when it turned out to be a different beast entirely. The Bird Tribunal felt to me like a modern-day Scandinavian Rebecca, following a young woman living in the shadow of her enigmatic employer's first wife, but with all the dreary atmosphere and profound social isolation of Wuthering Heights. But though I wouldn't necessarily classify this as a thriller, and I think it might disappoint readers who are specifically seeking out twists and turns, the tension and sense of growing dread I experienced while reading this were palpable. The relationship between Allis and Sigurd is a tender, terrifying thing; this is the hook that gets its claws in you from the offset. Through Allis's first person narration we're drawn into her obsession with Sigurd, a distant, surly man who employs Allis as a kind of housekeeper while he awaits his wife's return. Though Allis is blind to so many of the warning signs that the reader has access to, her obsession with Sigurd doesn't feel unnatural or unrealistic or frustrating - reading this book isn't like watching a train wreck so much as feeling like you're the one steering the train.

But then sometimes you have to just bite the bullet and let yourself believe the hype, and Exit West is the reason why, because this book was every bit as extraordinary as I'd been led to believe.Exit West is a delicate yet hard-hitting exploration of the immigration experience, and of the strength of character required to leave your home and family, without any guarantee that where you're going will be safer than what you're leaving behind. Both hopeful and achingly sad, this short little novel is an absolute tour de force.Saeed and Nadia, two young people from an unnamed country on the brink of civil war, meet and fall in love, even as they find themselves living in increasingly dangerous conditions as their city is torn apart. Meanwhile rumors start to crop up of doors that can transport you to another part of the world, but not without a price, and not without danger and uncertainty. Left with no choice, Saeed and Nadia pay for a passage through a door, and step through. These doors are not the point of the story, so those who were drawn to this novel for its promise of magical realism may be disappointed; they're merely the abstract literary device that Mohsin Hamid chooses to employ in order to elevate themes of relocation, alienation, and the commonality of the human experience.As Saeed and Nadia are bandied about to different locations across the globe, their relationship matures and regresses in accordance with each new circumstance they find themselves in. We follow their journey from the early moments of attraction to the quiet tedium of a love gone stale, as their relationship eventually, inevitably takes a turn that tugs at your heart as a reader, because even in a story characterized by fear and hunger and war and brutality - especially in a story characterized by these things - we want to believe that it's possible to move forward, that it's possible that love and normalcy can be retained. Devastating as this story is at times, it's also not without hope, thanks in part to being grounded so firmly in the lives of these two compelling central characters, who grow and change as needed to survive, but who never become irrevocably hardened by the horrors they experience.While there's an undeniable universality to this story, this was a novel written for the times we're living in, that speaks, most ostensibly, to the Syrian refugee crisis. We can't turn a blind eye to the millions of families and individuals affected by this crisis, and Hamid uses his narrative to challenge us to inhabit a more compassionate and forgiving world. (More information on the Syrian refugee crisis here: x, x, x.) Hamid's prose is exquisite. I can't conclude this  without mentioning that. This unconventional journey that he takes us on is chronicled in a writing style that's appropriately wistful, poetic, subtle, and powerful. It's exactly this effect of the writing paired with the story that makes this novel so unique and striking.Part literary fiction, part romance, part war story, with a touch of magic, Exit West is the sort of book that has a lot to offer. But it's also a quiet story, and rather than expecting to be blown away right out of the gate, you have to be willingly to immerse yourself in this novel and allow it to slowly begin to wash over you, until you're completely submerged....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Apr 11, 2017","Apr 15, 2017","Mar 08, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30688435-exit-west

Podcast host and investAre You Sleeping is a topical mystery about a podcast which reopens a decade-old case about the murder of a college professor. Podcast host and investigative journalist Poppy Parnell is unconvinced that the person convicted for the murder, Warren Cave, is actually guilty, and sets out to uncover the truth. Meanwhile, as the podcast gains momentum and becomes a nation-wide phenomenon, the victim's daughter, Josie Buhrman, is forced to return home and confront her twin sister Lanie whom she hasn't spoken to in ten years, in order to make sense of what happened that night. The entire conviction of Warren Cave hinges on a piece of evidence given by Lanie, who claims she saw Warren do it - but did she really?I wanted to love this, and I was pretty sure I was going to, at first. It's snappy, fast paced, and the use of the podcast makes for a really unique and intriguing premise. I loved the inclusion of comments on various social media outlets; I really felt like I was involved in the case in some voyeuristic way. That was very well done. Unfortunately, there was also a lot that I didn't like.First, the prose. It's very simple and readable, which can be good for this genre where you don't necessarily want your mystery to get bogged down in excessively flowery writing. So I didn't mind that at first, but it eventually started to feel a bit too amateur. The dialogue could have been straight out of a Lifetime movie, and there was this thing the author did incessantly that really started to bug me: someone makes some big declaration to Josie, like, ""you abandoned me ten years ago!"" (this is never actually said - I'm just making up an example.) And then instead of replying immediately, Josie pontificates for an entire paragraph: ""I realized he was right. I did abandon him. Ten years ago this happened, and I reacted this certain way. I realize now I maybe shouldn't have reacted like that."" And it goes on and on and on, like that particular thought hadn't occurred to Josie until right this second, and she has to take time immediately to reflect on it.... which would be okay once or twice, but I literally lost track of how many times a conversation was derailed by Josie randomly going into some deep introspection partway through it. It just felt unrealistic and melodramatic. That isn't to say that I didn't like Josie. I did like her. I thought she was a well-developed character, along with nearly all of the rest of them. The huge exception for me was Poppy Parnell. If her name makes her sound like a villain from Harry Potter, that's probably appropriate, since she reminded me so much of Rita Skeeter. She embodies just about every negative stereotype you can think of about investigative journalists - insensitive bordering on cruel, intrusive, heartless. At first I liked Poppy's character for this reason, she did seem like the sort of person who would reopen a closed case without a second thought for the repercussions on the victim's family. By the end of the book, however, she started to feel like such a stereotypical villain that I was half expecting her to start twirling a mustache.To switch gears a little bit, my other huge problem with this book was that there never felt like there was much at stake. The characters are investigating a ten-year old case, and none of the suspects are really in a position to cause further harm at this point. There's just a sense of urgency that's missing from this narrative; there's no 'this needs to be solved NOW because someone's in danger,' just... a reopened case that can be solved at the characters' leisure. I don't mean to imply that this was dull or tedious read. It wasn't; it was extremely fast and well paced. I just felt like there was some kind of tension missing throughout the whole thing.And finally, the ending. No spoilers, but I can't remember the last time I read a thriller where I was this disappointed with how obvious I thought the ending was. Also, a huge reveal basically hinges on a character randomly remembering a repressed memory, which of course happens in real life, of course people are triggered by certain sounds and smells etc. to remember something they'd been repressing. However, in storytelling, it just comes across as a bit too convenient. If this book interests you for its cool premise, I hope you give it a try when it's published. It's short and fast-paced, which makes for a really quick read. And I did enjoy reading it... at least for the first 80%. That's about when the rating really started plummeting for me. But based on other s so far, it looks like I'm going to be in the minority with this opinion! And one final note: don't read this and Dead Letters around the same time. There are so many similarities that I actually started mixing up the characters in my head, which is something I never do. Seriously: protagonist is an identical twin sister, the 'good twin', her sister is the wild twin; protagonist is estranged from her family because she chose to leave them behind and go abroad following a betrayal by her twin sister; the mothers in both case have mental health issues; protagonist returns home following a long absence and is confronted with her high school love interest who's now involved with her sister... I mean, given their publication dates this has to be 100% coincidental, I don't mean to imply otherwise - but still!!

If I had to explain this book to someone, I don't think it would be particularDead Letters probably has the weirdest vibe of anything I've ever read. If I had to explain this book to someone, I don't think it would be particularly helpful to summarize the plot, which makes it sound like a tense mystery instead of the literary character study that it is. I'm not really sure how I would explain it. There's something about it that reminds me vaguely of a film noir, told with a linguistic prowess and dramatic flair that calls to mind the poetry of Arthur Rimbaud. Somehow. Despite not really having anything in common with either of those things. Are you sufficiently confused? Yeah, me too. Let's proceed.Dead Letters commences when Ava Antipova receives a distressed email from her mother, informing her that her twin sister Zelda has died in a barn fire. Ava, who's been living in Paris, flies home to her family's vineyard outside Ithaca New York, suspecting that Zelda's death may not be exactly what it seems. Soon she begins to receive a series of clues, hoping it will lead her to the truth of what happened that night in the fire.In this era of fast-paced thrillers, let me stress: this does not belong in the mystery genre. This is a (at times slow-moving) character-driven novel. I didn't like it any less for this fact, but I'm glad I'd heard that it wasn't exactly a thriller before picking it up. Sometimes it's difficult to adjust your expectations partway through a book.Though you'll have a hard time loving these characters, each makes a hell of an impression. Each member of the Antipova family is a volatile, selfish alcoholic. This is a book about horrible people being horrible to one another, and if you can't bear to read about that, you won't enjoy this book. But if you're fascinated by dysfunctional interpersonal dynamics, as I am, there's a good chance you'll find this rewarding.Our narrator, Ava, is one of the most well-crafted and three-dimensional characters I've read in anything recently, which is especially a feat considering the first-person narration (which I find at times complicates the reader's ability to give the narrator an objective assessment?) But I thought that Ava was frustratingly, unnervingly real, for all her faults and virtues. Though at the beginning I was sure I wasn't going to be able to see any of myself in her, there were certain details, like her fear of intimacy, that I found I related to so intensely it was a bit unnerving - the kind of thing where you're reading and suddenly your breath catches and you feel deeply unsettled like you're seeing yourself on the page. That's just how present this story felt.Caite Dolan-Leach's writing is superb. Though it's wordy to the point of pretension, you can always tell, with a book like this, which authors are anxiously flipping through thesauruses and which authors have had these words in their arsenal all along, and it's pretty clear that Dolan-Leach belongs in the latter category. The (at times annoyingly overwrought) prose suits the story and the characters so seamlessly that it's hard to imagine it being written any differently.As for the ending - I won't spoil anything, but I loved it. It was exactly the emotional payoff I was looking for after this long-winded adventure. Though it takes a while to get going and relies a bit too heavily on elaborately baseless guesswork from the characters in order to connect certain plot points, Dead Letters was a clever and addicting read, and I thoroughly enjoyed this ride.I received a copy of this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest .

So we're I can't decide whether to begin this  by saying that Lincoln in the Bardo is 'the most unique' book I've ever read, or 'the weirdest.' So we're going to go with both, because it is. Both unique and deeply weird. I'm starting this  completely unsure of the star rating I'm going to end up giving it by the end, because I'm finding it incredibly difficult to evaluate a book that's unlike anything I've ever read before. It's not wholly novel, or wholly poetry, or wholly play, but some strange fusion, something in between. A literary 'bardo' of sorts, if you will.In 1862 Abraham Lincoln's son Willie dies, and there are some accounts of Lincoln going to visit his son's body in the cemetery. George Saunders takes this small detail of Lincoln's life and runs with it, turning it into a bizarrely exhilarating literary exploration of life, death, and grief. Combining this snippet of American history with the Tibetan concept of the bardo, the liminal state between life and death, Lincoln in the Bardo is told by a chorus of voices, inhabitants of the cemetery, who observe Lincoln's mourning.I'm not going to pretend that I understood this book completely. I think I could read it ten more times and still not fully understand it. I think at least part of that had to do with the fact that I was so far out of my wheelhouse with this one. I'm pretty abysmal with American history, so I found myself wondering which 'citations' are fact and which are fiction; which names mentioned are real people and which are Saunders' inventions. I'm also unclear as to whether how much of this ambiguity was intentional, and how much was me just being obtuse. But it certainly made for a confusing read at times. I'm not even sure that being a Civil War buff is necessary to this reading experience - I'm scrolling through s and getting the impression that there are plenty of people who loved this book who weren't terribly familiar with Lincoln's life beforehand. I guess it's just my own personal hangup. I felt like I was stumbling around blindly for a good part of this novel, which was sort of unsettling.If I had to try to simplify this book, which is no easy feat, I'd say that it's about the commonality of the human experience; the unifying factors that transcend social status and race and culture. That's what really resonated with me, at least. While I thought the first part was slow and perhaps too bogged down with irrelevant details, there were certain passages of part 2 that struck me so deeply it was absolutely gut-wrenching. Saunders' prose is absolutely gorgeous, both genuinely moving and also darkly comedic at times, and I envy that ability of his. I also envy his ability to say so much in so few words. This isn't a particularly long book, all things considered, but it's still one of the most thematically rich things I've ever read. I'm going to be thinking about this one for weeks.I didn't fully love this book and remain rather conflicted, but I'm finding myself unable to go lower than 4 stars, because it's undeniably the most innovative and thought-provoking thing I've read in ages.

It's an unflinching look at police brutality, told through the eyes of a teenage girl who witnessed the senseless murder of her friend who was pulled over by a cop for a broken taillight. This happens in the second chapter and the majority of the book deals with the aftermath; the guilt Starr feels over surviving the incident and not being there for her friend in the months leading up to it, the tension that exists between her home life (where she lives in a very poor black neighborhood) and her school life (where she attends a private school on a scholarship, which is attended mostly by rich white students). Starr's narrative voice was wonderfully authentic and this book just provides such a necessary perspective on the racism and violence that run rampant in this country. Having finally read this, I can say I'm genuinely thrilled that this book has become such a cultural phenomenon as well as a commercial success.But in the interest of giving you the full picture, let's move onto what I didn't like. It was overly long and I found the dialogue and the 'cute' domestic moments particularly inane. Moments like this caused more than a few eye rolls: ""He grins and he feeds her a grape, and I just can't. The cuteness is too much. Yeah, they're my parents, but they're my OTP. Seriously."" I get that when you're dealing with such a serious topic (especially in YA) you do need moments of levity if you don't want your book to be a nearly-500-page misery fest, but all of the humor felt shoehorned in. There were so many discussions of Harry Potter and Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and meanwhile nothing was actually happening and I didn't feel bored, necessarily, because YA contemporary reads so quickly, but I did feel a bit cheated whenever the main narrative got derailed for these fan-service moments.My other main issue was that I would have loved to have seen some more nuance. It's hard to talk about this in detail without getting into spoilers, but as an example, one of the subplots shows how over the course of the novel Starr comes to realize that one of her best white friends is racist, and I thought this would be a good opportunity for the author to explore the subtle ways that racism can manifest in even well-meaning white allies, but instead the execution was a bit heavy-handed. The kind of racist remarks this girl made toward Starr were... not subtle in ANY way, which made me wonder why she was even friends with her in the first place. And the fact that Starr's white boyfriend could basically do no wrong added to this kind of weird dichotomy that white people are all either Good or Evil? When in reality the grey area between those two extremes is so much more realistic and would have been a good focal point for this part of the narrative.But anyway. This is a book for teenagers, first and foremost, and I'm happy that it has been received so well among teenagers, and among adults who read more YA than I do. I hope you don't take this  and rating as me being dismissive of this book's themes and its cultural impact; I'm just afraid that it didn't totally work for me personally.

Fortunately for me, I See You was my first Mackintosh novel, so I'm happy to say that I was able to mostly really enjoy it. Enough that I'll probably read I Let You Go at some point, with high expectations. I See You is a topical and creepy thriller about a one-sided 'dating' website that targets London-based women. Their pictures will appear in a newspaper advertisement for the website, and soon after they'll become victims of some crime, ranging from theft to murder. When Zoe Walker sees her photo in the paper and discovers a link between the crimes, she's sure that someone's marked her as the next target.Tense and addicting, this had me on the edge of my seat. While the plot itself is at times slow moving, there's a certain fear and paranoia that permeates the narrative; it leaves you guessing about these characters and their motives, but it also makes you think about your own life, about the privacy settings on your Facebook account, about the dangers of living in this technological fishbowl of a society, where your movements are constantly tracked. Alternating chapters with Zoe, we get the point of view of Kelly, working with the Murder Investigation Team to track who's behind the series of attacks. I wasn't surprised to learn that Clare Mackintosh had worked in the police force before becoming a writer, given the meticulous level of detail to this side of the story. All in all, it's very well done.Sure, I See You requires a certain suspension of disbelief, but I think the mark of a good author is the ability to make you believe something that you might not, ordinarily. It's an outlandish premise, but Mackintosh had me thoroughly convinced. It wasn't until after I finished this book that I started ruminating on flaws in its design - and there certainly are flaws, certain things you need to accept without question (I won't go into detail in order to keep this spoiler-free). But ultimately, I don't care so much about that. This was a good story, and a downright terrifying psychological thriller that leaves you guessing - literally! - until the last page. A really enjoyable reading experience and a great way to spend this snow day.Also, I pride myself on my ability to figure out whodunnits pretty early on in the story, nine times out of ten.

Plain Jane narrator becomes enamored with a mysterious, glamorous, troubled girl. The Girls. The Strays. Even stuff like The Girl on the Train, to an extent. I wanted so much for Marlena to be different, or if not different, at least special, because in theory I have no problem with the bare bones of this story: I like the exploration of female friendships, and I like female coming of age stories. I just didn't get anything out of this one. I wanted to, but I didn't. This is the story of two girls, Cat and the titular Marlena, who are friends for less than a year in high school, after Cat's family relocates to Marlena's town. By the end of that year, Marlena is dead, and she's made an indelible mark on Cat which continues to define her throughout adulthood, as she struggles with an alcoholism that she picked up in her adolescence. This book promises heartbreak and emotional devastation, but doesn't deliver. I'm left feeling rather apathetic about these characters, and for such a character-driven novel, that's probably not the best impression to be left with.For such a short book, there are too many pages of nothing happening. Cat skips school, Cat smokes a cigarette. Marlena pops a pill. Cat's mom drinks wine before bed. Intriguing characters lurk in the background: Marlena's father, Marlena's drug dealer. But every time they appear to get close enough to touch, the narrative is derailed, usually by Cat smoking another cigarette or Marlena popping another pill. This story really goes nowhere; which, again, fine, I do enjoy character studies - but these characters' entire personalities are captured almost too sufficiently in the first five pages. Cat the reserved, thoughtful one who's so desperate to fit in she's willing to compromise parts of herself to do so, and Marlena the wild and reckless one that everyone's drawn to, even when she treats others terribly. Julie Buntin lays all her cards on the table too early. There's nothing I got from this book that I wouldn't have got if I'd stopped reading after the first chapter.There are two timelines in Marlena, the present, and twenty years ago. Simple, right? Except. Twenty years ago, according to this story, characters all had their own cell phones, YouTube and Facebook were just becoming popular. ... in 1997?!? Either this is a glaring error, or the 'present' chapters are really taking place in 2027, not 2017 - which would be fine! But there's never any explicit information given about the date, and given the frequency with which this (anachronistic?!) technology is mentioned, this ambiguity becomes very distracting very fast. What I did like about this book were the questions it raised about moral responsibility, about survivor's guilt, about how we either put our teenage years behind us or let them define us. There was a lot of talk about 'truth,' as well, and how subjective of a concept that is. If at times a bit heavy-handed, this book was at least thought-provoking in that regard. Julie Buntin is a good writer. This just wasn't a unique enough story for it to make much of an impression on me....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Mar 06, 2017","Mar 12, 2017","Mar 01, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30199414-marlena

Horrifying depictions of animal death abound. And I'm a huge animal lover, so the way I get through reading that kind of stuff is to desensitize - I'm able to sort of turn the emotional side off long enough to read about graphic descriptions of sheep in agonizing pain. The problem is, doing that sort of deadens my emotional reaction to the rest of the book, too. I felt like I wasn't able to engage with this novel the way I was supposed to - what was probably meant to come across as an intense emotional journey left me feeling sort of hollow.All the Birds, Singing is a novel as bleak as the coastal English terrain where the protagonist, Jake Whyte, finds herself living as a sheep farmer. Jake is running from some kind of mysterious event in her past, that we slowly learn about through a series of flashback chapters that occur in reverse-chronological order. I was initially intrigued by this backwards timeline, but ultimately found it to be rather baseless in its execution.This is a novel which flits between multiple genres - first it's literary, then it becomes a thriller, wait, now it's vaguely paranormal fantasy or magical realism - but instead of these elements existing in harmony to play off one another, the whole effort came across as rather disjointed.But there are good things, too. I found this novel's treatment of gender roles fascinating. Jake, with her traditionally male name, lives a rather stereotypically masculine existence - a manual laborer living in self-imposed isolation. It isn't until a male figure enters her life that her dreary farmhouse takes on a homely quality. The dynamic between Jake and this stranger, Lloyd, is very compelling, and probably my favorite thing about this novel. It's really difficult to give a bottom line for this book. This is the kind of novel that everyone is going to have a different experience with. Where some readers will find it suspenseful and thrilling, others will find it boring and tedious. I'm not sure I fall into either category... this novel's biggest strength is undoubtedly its atmosphere, and I respect Wyld's skill at crafting a setting, and it did engage me on an intellectual level. But it's a difficult book to pour your heart into as a reader without coming out feeling kind of sick. 3.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,"Sep 26, 2017","Sep 28, 2017","Feb 25, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18142324-all-the-birds-singing

I mean, it must work, because it's seen a number of illustrious and well-ed revivals over the years, but it reads comfortably like a novella, and if you are planning on seeing it on stage (in the upcoming Los Angeles production, for example) I would highly recommend familiarizing yourself with the script first, because I imagine a lot could be lost in translation to the unfamiliar viewer.Written in four monologues, this play tells the story of faith healer Frank Hardy. Frank's two monologues (each about ten pages long) open and close the play, and in between we also hear from Frank's wife, or maybe his mistress, Grace, and his stage manager Teddy. Together they chronicle the downfall of Frank's faith healing act, but less focus is given to the narrative itself than the relationship between these three characters and the way it has disintegrated over time.This play's magic is all in the details. If you're reading or watching this just trying to glean the overall gist, so much is going to be lost. Friel expertly navigates three conflicting accounts of the same events; each character tells essentially the same stories, with at times heartbreaking variations. The biggest punch to the gut was after hearing Grace's account of her newborn baby dying, and hearing how Frank fashioned a makeshift cross for the grave, we then get Teddy's account that Frank was nowhere to be found when Grace went into labor, and how Teddy was the one to build the cross and say a prayer over the grave. The fallibility of memory is probably one of my favorite themes in literature and when it's rendered with the same kind of subtlety as it is here, it's hard not to be deeply affected and unsettled. The other salient theme running through this play is Frank's unreliable gift for faith healing - with noticeable parallels to artists' creativity, the whole play reads as an allegory. Can truth exist in a vacuum or is it always shaped by the stories we tell?If you aren't someone who ordinarily enjoys reading play scripts, I'd still recommend checking this out if it interests you, as again, it reads very much like a novella. Friel's writing is sharp and lyrical and this leaves no question as to why he's one of the most influential playwrights to come out of Northern Ireland....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Mar 25, 2019","Mar 26, 2019","Feb 23, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/31309641-faith-healer

But that said, this is a book I really enjoy engaging with and I can see myself returning to it again and again as my own personal relationship with Shakespeare and performing evolves. ------------Original : I was really looking forward to reading this (having followed this author on various social media for a while now), and it did not disappoint. If We Were Villains is an intelligent and moving story about friendship, passion, guilt, and the role Shakespeare played in all of the above for a group of seven student actors in their final year at the fictional Dellecher Classical Conservatory. This group of friends has spent years playing the same roles over and over onstage and off, but when their instructors decide to mix up their casting, cracks begin to form in their carefully constructed group dynamic, and in a few short months, one of them ends up dead. Oliver Marks is convicted and spends ten years in prison, but it's only after he's released that he's ready to tell the truth about what happened that night.If you've seen the comparisons to The Secret History, you'll know to expect plenty of character drama and academic geekery, and a bit of murder, but the comparisons stop there. Despite the fact that these characters have long conversations speaking only in Shakespeare quotes, If We Were Villains is actually a lot less pretentious than The Secret History (I say this with love - I adore The Secret History). The characters in If We Were Villains are much more likable, too, for the most part. I felt their youth much more acutely than I did with Donna Tartt's characters, who all seemed larger than life and at times much older than college-age. Rio creates a host of characters who are are each in their own way memorable, vulnerable, and sympathetic. This is every bit as much a coming of age story as it is a thriller - probably more so. The twists were mostly easy to guess a mile off, but it didn't matter, because I was so immersed in these characters that I found it gratifying to watch their story unfold.Rio's prose flows with a natural elegance, and although Shakespeare himself does a lot of the legwork (his quotes infusing this narrative with such frequency) Rio holds her own. One word I'd use to describe this book is 'concise': not a word is out of place; not a scene is extraneous. It's a relatively short novel, but it doesn't feel underdeveloped, because Rio succinctly shows us everything we need to see in order to form the full picture. And it's a gorgeous picture - the setting of Dellecher is so vivid that I truly felt transported straight into this world, straight into that castle-like dormitory by the lake, straight into that world of Shakespearean drama.People tend to be very polarized about Shakespeare. Love him or hate him, everyone has a rather strong opinion. I think I'm in the minority in falling somewhere in the middle: I've enjoyed the Shakespeare productions I've seen but I don't actively seek them out; I mostly like reading his work, but again, don't make it a priority. So I'm going to actually argue that you don't need to be a Shakespeare aficionado to enjoy If We Were Villains. Does having a love of Shakespeare enrich the overall experience of reading this novel? Undoubtedly. This is a book for Bardolators, first and foremost, and if you love Shakespeare, you should pick this up immediately. Rio's extensive knowledge shines through every inch of this narrative. But there is a sort of universality to the passion that these students display, and the Shakespeare is adequately contextualized, so that it's possible to get something from this book even if you aren't intimately familiar with the plays these students perform.This novel isn't without faults, of course. The descriptions of the performances themselves tend to be rather indulgent and don't do much to propel the narrative forward. The concept of each of these productions is gorgeous (and I'd love to see Rio direct them!) but for such a short novel, I'd rather have spent that time focusing on other things.I do have another complaint having to do with a sudden shift in a certain character's behavior, and not fully understanding the impetus behind that (keeping this deliberately vague for fear of spoilers). There was something about this characterization - and the way the rest of the group reacted to it - that felt a bit like a plot device designed to move the rest of the narrative forward. From that point on the story and characters resumed their believability, but I did have this one moment in particular where I found myself thinking 'I'm not buying this.' But ultimately there was enough that I liked about this novel to compensate for this one element. A solid 4.5 stars. This is a really stunning debut that forces the reader to think about guilt and culpability; about youth and passion; and about art and life and the way the two coexist so intensely. I loved reading this and I'd highly recommend it to anyone with a fierce love of the humanities - and in particular, of course, Shakespeare.

Book I of David Vann's novel begins in medias res: Medea has just killed her brother, and is helping the Argonauts flee from her father Aeetes, which she reflects on as they sail from her home in Colchis to Jason's home in Iolcus, having obtained the Golden Fleece. Book II follows Medea as she assists in Jason's ascent to power, before the novel finally culminates in the story's famously tragic and violent conclusion.Vann's Medea is instantly recognizable as the notorious, vengeful priestess that we know from the classics, rage personified. But rather than resting on this archetype, Vann goes further. Here Medea's rage isn't only portrayed, but thoroughly examined. Bright Air Black is more analysis than portrait as Vann deconstructs Medea, rationalizing her, humanizing her.Being a feminist and being a fan of classical literature are two facets of my life which are at odds more often than not. So when I read modern retellings, I'm really looking for female characters to be afforded the same depth and quality of narrative voice as their male counterparts have been through the ages. In this regard, Bright Air Black is a resounding success. Violent, vindictive, impenitent, Medea seems more villain than hero. And yet. Driven by a singular desire for agency, Medea is rendered sympathetic by Vann, almost hauntingly so.Reading Vann's prose is a bit like being suffocated, or being submerged under water. Meditative and contemplative but also characterized by a pervasive darkness, this is a story that's both grotesque and spellbinding. The fragmented sentences take some getting used to, and this style undoubtedly won't appeal to everyone. Admittedly I tend to be wary of novels which deal in experimental prose, because more often than not, there's just no reason aside from showcasing the author's skill. I didn't find that was the case here. I was quickly entranced by the rhythmic cadence of Medea's thoughts, which break like waves crashing relentlessly through this narrative. This is a rare example of poetic prose where form and content complement one another masterfully; Medea's character is inextricably tied to this terse and fragmentary style of writing. Very few authors could pull this off, but Vann does so with aplomb. Usually a 5 star rating from me means 'everyone read this book immediately.' However, I do get the feeling that this may be a little too niche to recommend to the world at large. I'd highly recommend reading Euripides' Medea or at least reading up on the myth before starting this. It's not that the story isn't sufficiently self-contained in these pages, but as an interpretation which is more character driven than plot driven, it's probably not an ideal starting point.I do want to stress that Bright Air Black is far from perfect. The pacing is uneven, far too much time is spent on the voyage from Colchis, the ending is abrupt. But these imperfections seem almost appropriate, in a way, because this is a tour de force, electrically charged work whose strength lies in its unapologetically tense and frantic approach. This is ultimately a bold and fearless examination of agency, power, and one woman's rage. Medea, destroyer of kings.I received a copy of this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest .

This cartography project sets the context for Friel's narrative, a story which, for its many layers, is ultimately a bold examination of the function of language.The characters in the play, a group of students who attend a local hedge school, speak only Irish. In actuality the actors on stage are speaking English, and when English-speaking soldiers arrive, the audience is meant to infer that the two parties are unable to communicate. The multilingual Irish schoolmaster and his two sons exist at this intersection of language and culture, and the liberties they take in translating back and forth remind us that translation isn't a wholly linguistic effort: it's a complex process in which meanings become twisted and manipulated.Though the students speak very little English, they fluently read Latin and Ancient Greek, this integration of dead languages paralleling the probable future of Gaelic. It also provides a delicate subversion of the traditional colonial narrative which hinges on the conqueror imparting culture upon the 'barbarians' - in Friel's play, the Irish are the educated, the multilingual, the classicists. The function of English then becomes one of eradication rather than enlightenment. In examining Ireland's complex socio-linguistic history, Translations is a fascinating look at colonization, English imperialism, and the function of language as a tool that's at once manipulative, restrictive, and liberating. Although this is a play whose themes are perhaps more interesting than the story itself, the characters are all endearing, and the plot, though slow-moving, keeps you engaged through its conclusion. A challenging, erudite, and moving work.

The Lieutenant of Inishmore is a farcical look at Irish terrorist organizations, set on the island of Inishmore in the Aran Islands in the early 1990s. The play focuses on a cycle of small-town bloody revenge set into motion by the death of an INLA man's beloved cat.As usual, much of McDonagh's humor relies on the irony behind corrupt morality - in this case, we meet Padraic, who's literally in the middle of torturing a man when he gets a call that his cat Wee Thomas is poorly. (It's reminiscent of Woody Harrelson's character in Seven Psychopaths, a violent gangster who's unnaturally attached to his shih tzu Bonny, or Ralph Fiennes' character in In Bruges, a hitman with a selectively rigid moral code.) But even though McDonagh likes to revisit similar themes time and again, it never gets old for me. He fuses comedy and tragedy/morality and violence in such a uniquely striking way, each of his plays approaching the theme from a distinct angle. And while most of his plays are rather silly on the surface, there's something so much darker lying beneath, and that's what he really excels at with Inishmore.Better than The Cripple of Inishmaan; not as good as The Pillowman.

Here I was thinking that McDonagh couldn't possibly shock me any more than he has in the past - I do consider myself familiar enough with his style of black comedy that my continued reading of his plays has more to do with their comfortable familiarity than with unearthing a facet of his writing that I feel I haven't already uncovered. But what I hadn't counted on with The Beauty Queen of Leenane was how immeasurably sad it was going to be. For once McDonagh's characters aren't memorable for their immorality as much as for how pitiable they are, and though the dialogue is as sharp and irreverent as ever, the humor in this one doesn't hit its mark quite as much as the more somber undercurrents do. Isolation, wasted youth, mental illness, and domestic claustrophobia are all at the heart of this deceptively dark story about an elderly mother and middle aged daughter living in a cottage together in rural Ireland. I think it shows that this is McDonagh's first play - his craft of dark comedy doesn't feel sufficiently honed and there are some dissonant elements that don't fully come together, but my god is this haunting....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Dec 07, 2018","Dec 08, 2018","Feb 09, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/24263549-the-beauty-queen-of-leenane

But I hadn't read it until now, and reading the script reaffirmed a lot of the thoughts I had while watching it on stage. I like it, but I don't love it.I don't think this is Martin McDonagh's strongest work. He is the undisputed master of the black comedy, but that careful balance between gravity and levity that he strikes so expertly is I think at its best in The Pillowman and In Bruges. Inishmaan relies too heavily on inane humor to carry it until its conclusion, which is so tonally incompatible with the rest of the play that it's easy for some of its darker moments to get swallowed up and misconstrued. Maybe that jarring tonal shift is the point, or maybe comedy and tragedy just don't complement one another here to their full potential.Like all of McDonagh's work, Inishmaan is absurd and biting and irreverent and cruel, and the result is something poignant that won't readily leave your mind after you're done with it.

Having some kind of knowledge or passion for Greek mythology seems requisite goingI loved this book, but I'm not really sure who I'd recommend it to. Having some kind of knowledge or passion for Greek mythology seems requisite going in - I can't imagine getting much enjoyment out of this if you aren't familiar with the original stories that Merlis is adapting and expounding on and subverting - but this is not your run of the mill Homeric retelling.You start the novel with Pyrrhus, son of Achilles, and you think you're going to Troy. That's how the story goes, anyway - Achilles dies, Pyrrhus takes his place as leader of the Myrmidons, and with the bow of Philoctetes, Pyrrhus takes Troy. Mark Merlis has other plans.What starts as a (granted, wildly unconventional) retelling of the tale of Pyrrhus quickly morphs into something bigger, via a detour to Sophocoles' Philoctetes - an allegorical commentary on the AIDS crisis in 1980s America. And it's just weird enough that it works, beautifully. This is a quietly powerful and unsettling story that starts with the Trojan War and ends up having a lot to say about fate and free will and gay identity.We're held at arm's length from our anti-hero Pyrrhus for the majority of this story. Self-centered, lazy, and apathetic, Pyrrhus is ostensibly difficult to root for. And yet. He gets under your skin, as do all of Merlis's characters. In that way, this isn't necessarily an easy book to love. It's deliberately provocative and graphic, and it shows an ugliness to human nature that isn't easy to stare in the face. But it's an even stronger achievement for that, I think. Merlis is able to take this dark and cynical story and infuse it with just enough hope and romance that you're compelled to see it through to the end - with beautiful payoff once you do.Merlis's prose is witty, droll, and surprisingly incisive. It ranges from mildly amusing to positively breathtaking. There were so many lines I had to stop and reread just to take in the full effect. Passages like this:Did they just not believe it, the Trojans? Or did they believe it the way you believe you're going to die? With certainty and utter incredulity so perfectly balanced that they fight to a draw, leaving the ignorant animal in you free to get out of bed in the morning.And this:The most terrifying thing that could happen to anyone: to have to stand there and hear, from someone who knew everything, the worst you've ever thought about yourself.If you're looking for a modern but slightly more straightforward Greek mythology retelling, try The Song of Achilles or Ransom or Alcestis or Bright Air Black. If you're looking for a powerful gay epic that touches on the AIDS crisis, try Angels in America or The Heart's Invisible Furies or Tell the Wolves I'm Home.

Gentle, elegant, and deeply moving, this one will stay with me for a long time. Pachinko tells the story of a Korean family through multiple generations, spanning nearly a hundred years and multiple locations. The novel begins against the backdrop of the Japanese annexation of Korea in 1910, and as the story progresses, it explores the unique discrimination faced by Koreans living in Japan in the twentieth century.Our story commences with Sunja, a young woman from a small Korean town who finds herself pregnant, abandoned by her lover, and seemingly out of options. When a traveling minister, a kind-hearted but sickly man, agrees to take her to Japan and marry her, the wheels of the story are set into motion, as we follow Sunja, her husband Isak, and the life they manage to create together while facing constant adversity.This is a quiet book whose thematic richness is all the more powerful for the subtlety with which it is rendered. Questions of home, nationality, and cultural identity permeate this nearly 500 page narrative, manifesting and reinforcing themselves in the lives of characters across generations, but Min Jin Lee rather expertly leaves the reader to draw our own conclusions. Lee resists any temptation to simplify the complicated Japanese-Korean relationship, as the ambitiously sweeping narrative manages to paint a comprehensive picture of the Korean immigrant experience. Historical elements are integrated seamlessly into our story of the fictional Baek family, continuously edifying but never overwhelming the reader. While Lee's careful narrative doesn't dilute the intricacy of the topics which she showcases, it's still a rather accessible introduction for readers who may not be familiar with the complex socio-political history of these two countries.Lee's writing is light and elegant, and for such a long novel the pace rarely falters. While it may not be a story filled to the brim with action, it keeps you turning pages, mourning and grieving and celebrating with these characters who feel as close as family by the end. I raced through this in a couple of days and now feel sad that it's over.Above all else a nuanced exploration of cultural identity, Pachinko is an incredible achievement. I cannot recommend this highly enough to fans of family sagas, historical fiction, fiction set in East Asia, or really any reader who just wants a good story....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Feb 13, 2017","Feb 19, 2017","Feb 02, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29983711-pachinko

It's funny how the setting of a thriller never seems to be the most important element, but it's always a bit striking when you find one set somewhere other than small town England or wintry Scandinavia or New York City. Characters and environment play off each other well, and Harper captures that small-town claustrophobia perfectly.I do have one huge criticism, and that's the use of italicized flashbacks to show backstory. Frankly I found it lazy - can you really not work that information into the description and dialogue? - but it also pulled me out of the story constantly.

But, ultimately I was satisfied. I read it in two days, it was a compelling read, the big reveal was perfect, and there were enough subplots and character intrigue that it's gripping from start to finish.

And it's a great discussion, because even though war is undeniably the thematic center of the work, glory and grief are both explored so fully that there's always going to be this unresolved ambiguity. Meanwhile Lisa Peterson and Denis O'Hare's theatrical adaptation An Iliad firmly takes a side and runs with it. An Iliad is a one-man show, in which our narrator, 'The Poet,' tells the story of the Trojan War, focusing on the conflict between Achilles and Hector. Abbreviated with admirable succinctness, all major events that occur in the human realm in The Iliad are at least touched upon. But more than a simple retelling, Peterson and O'Hare take a story with a famously epic scope, and bring it down to a scale that we as a contemporary audience can engage with, imbuing it with intimate and tactile details which I imagine are only augmented while viewing it in its intended theatrical setting. You could argue that there's a certain lack of subtlety in an anti-war polemic that takes up four entire pages relaying a list of every known major conflict in recorded history. But it's the immediacy of hearing (or reading) these words - the suffocating rhythm of the list and its fearlessness that really drives home the tension and horror and tragedy which exist both at the heart of the epic and at the heart of Peterson and O'Hare's vision. Wrought with inevitability as our weary narrator tells the story he's so familiar with, An Iliad is a piercing examination and condemnation of the horrors of war, and man's tendency toward conflict. A thought-provoking, faithful adaptation which honors the original story and embraces the unique conventions of its medium....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Feb 25, 2017","Feb 25, 2017","Jan 22, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18114369-an-iliad

This was just as awesome as everyone says it is.I'll have to admit, I had a slow start with Six of Crows. Here's where I clarify for those who are not familiar with my reading habits: I do not read a lot of fantasy. So when I'm thrown into a world with all sorts of new vocabulary to learn with such a large array of characters, I'm a little unmoored, to say the least. Leigh Bardugo integrates her invented vocabulary seamlessly into the narrative without pausing to explain what everything means - you're able to discern the meaning through context, and it's expertly done. But I'd be lying if I said I hadn't been thinking 'wait, I'm dumb, though, can't you just explain it?!' on more than one occasion. It probably took me longer than it should have to figure out just what a Grisha is, exactly.But I think at about 20% it really began to hit its stride, and my confusion finally abated. Before I knew it, I was completely sucked into this fast-paced, exciting adventure, and I fell in love with this group of flawed yet compelling characters. Notable to me were Kaz and Inej, two of the most complex and intriguing and heartbreaking characters that I've ever encountered in YA lit, Kaz in particular. He's the first character who really grabbed me in this story, and I just fell more and more in love with him as his devastating backstory was slowly revealed. The twists in this book were all kinds of exciting. Bardugo keeps the tension high, and every time it looks like things are finally, finally going to turn out okay, another obstacle arises. It never gets monotonous, though, because the stakes are high enough that you're constantly holding your breath for a positive outcome.4.5 stars just because of my difficulty getting into it at the beginning (but again, that's more down to my incompatibility with this genre than Leigh Bardugo's storytelling, which I admit was technically very well done). I ended up loving this, and I can't wait to read Crooked Kingdom. ...more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"Jun 10, 2017","Jul 13, 2017","Jan 15, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/22294935-six-of-crows

I loved the idea of a murder mystery set in the publishing world, as this is much more my area than the foreign and glamorous entertainment industry, the setting for the previous Cormoran Strike novel. So it is with much sadness that I have to admit I found The Silkworm to be kind of a letdown.This book was a hundred pages longer than it needed to be, and I have a simple suggestion for paring down that page count: remove every instance of Strike complaining about his knee hurting, Robin fighting with her fiancé, Strike resolving to use fewer taxis in the future, Strike pining after his horrible ex, and Robin and Strike going out to lunch. All of that comprises a pretty solid bulk of this novel, which passes the point of character-driven into the area of complete tedium. Rowling needed an editor with a firmer hand.The plot itself was punishingly convoluted. Not only are there a lot of characters, there's also a story within a story which contains thinly veiled references to 'real' people - it's just a lot to keep track of. The pace languishes - there just weren't enough clues dropped throughout to keep me fully invested. I won't say anything specific about the ending - just that I didn't experience the shock and awe that The Cuckoo's Calling's resolution had elicited from me.I know I'm probably giving off the impression that it was a chore to read this book, but it wasn't.

This is going to be a long and detailed (though spoiler-free) , because Ancient Greek lit is something of a passion of mine and this was my most anticipated read of 2017.This is a story that I've loved for years, and have loved enough to read it in multiple iterations by different authors. Which begs the question - why? What exactly does a retelling accomplish? How does an author effectively strike a balance between the old and the new, between honoring a story which has been loved for centuries, and giving it new depth? I think readers go into retellings hoping to see the elements that we loved about the original preserved, but also to see gaps filled in, or to see a new intimacy given to a story originally told with impartiality. This question was on my mind the whole time I was reading this novel - what has Toibin succeeded in adding to this familiar tale?House of Names begins with the point of view of Clytemnestra, who plots to murder her husband Agamemnon in retaliation for Agamemnon sacrificing their eldest daughter, Iphigenia. Clytemnestra is a character who I find particularly intriguing, and a character who I think has been unfairly maligned in various works of literature through the ages. Toibin's Clytemnestra is everything I could have hoped for: she masquerades vulnerability with a hard exterior, she is motivated by vengeance while being grounded by a love for her family. She's complex and nuanced and Toibin succeeds in humanizing rather than vilifying her. It's a promising start to a novel which I hoped would be told in its entirety from this perspective. It's hard to build on the thematic richness of The Oresteia, which concerns itself with questions of conflicting systems of justice (justice through vengeance vs. justice through law), but one often unexamined thematic thread is that of gender, which permeates the original narrative as Clytemnestra's crimes are viewed through a different lens than Orestes' and Agamemnon's. How better to give this story new depth from a contemporary perspective than to tell it from a female point of view?But then the narration shifts to Orestes, and things go downhill. As we plod through an unnecessarily long chapter detailing Orestes' kidnap from the palace of Mycenae, I couldn't help but to think: why? Why are we devoting so much of this narrative to Orestes? Clytemnestra is a character who has historically never been given much of a narrative voice. Orestes, on the other hand - there is no dearth of material surrounding Orestes. Homer and Aeschylus and Pindar and Sophocles and Euripides have pretty much got that covered. But interestingly, Toibin takes this character of Orestes who is traditionally known for his resolve, and renders him rather inert. In Homer's Odyssey, Orestes is consistently held up as a shining example of decisive action to Odysseus' son Telemachus, who is being urged to reclaim his house from the influx of his mother's suitors. In Toibin's House of Names, Orestes is a follower - he doesn't make decisions, but rather, waits for the affirmation of his friend Leander and his sister Electra. Is this an intentional subversion of Orestes' traditionally hyper-masculine narrative? If so, why does Toibin allow Orestes' point of view to overpower his narrative at the expense of Clytemnestra and Electra's perspectives? Wouldn't a more effective subversion be to reduce Orestes' narration, or eliminate it altogether?Once Orestes' perspective took over, I couldn't help but to feel a certain aimlessness to this story. After the sacrifice of Iphigenia, one of the most poignant and harrowing renderings of that scene that I've ever read, Toibin's narrative begins to be infiltrated by details I no longer recognize. While I have no theoretical objections to authors deviating from the well worn path of canon (some of the best retellings I've read have involved original characters or invented plotlines - Katharine Beutner's Alcestis and David Malouf's Ransom come to mind), I struggle to discern the rationale behind some of Toibin's choices. He omits Pylades and invents a character to essentially fill the role of Pylades - why? He changes the duration of the Trojan War from nine years to five years - why? He does a complete overhaul of Aegisthus' narrative - why? None of this becomes self-evident throughout Toibin's meandering story, and the result is frustrating. The further you read, the more this story's initial poignancy becomes diluted.Since this  has erred on the side of the critical, I do want to highlight what I thought were particular successes. Toibin's writing is beautiful and visceral. This is only the second Toibin novel I've read after Brooklyn, which I enjoyed well enough while being frustrated by a certain detachment in the narration, but I didn't think that was the case here. This is an inherently brutal story, and Toibin's prose succeeds in adding another layer of darkness and unease, creating a tense and urgent environment. The two chapters which focus on Clytemnestra are superb, and the first-person narration was an excellent choice here. I would tentatively recommend this to readers who maybe aren't so familiar with the original story that Toibin is attempting to build upon, because this seems to be where the majority of my criticism lies. It's impossible for me to say how this story would stand on its own for one who is entirely unfamiliar with these characters and their fates, but maybe that reader would fare better with the unconventional journey that Toibin takes us on. It's not that I necessarily want to see the events of Aeschylus' Oresteia rehashed in exactly the same fashion, but I felt like Toibin never embraced his unique contemporary perspective to its full potential; the invented details felt extraneous and did nothing to augment the themes present in the original. This wasn't a bad novel. I'm always critical of the things I love the most. I received a copy of this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest .

It tells the story of Bridey Sullivan, a young American woman living on the streets of Athens, who takes up with Jasper and Milo, a British couple living and working in the hotel Olympos. The three work as 'runners,' essentially hustling tourists into staying at their run-down hotel in exchange for commission and a place to stay.I wasn't sure what to expect from this novel and now, having finished it, I'm not really sure what I got from it. I'm sort of confused and very conflicted. The best part of this book was the atmosphere. The red light district of 1980s Athens comes to life on the page. Evocative and lyrical, Hoffman's prose complements the insular setting and draws the reader into this world of crime and addiction. The characters, flawed and compelling, all make a strong impression. This is a book about the indelible impressions that relationships leave over time, a motif explored particularly well by the scope of Hoffman's narrative. Now, onto the bad. I'm not sure what logic (if any?) Running's timeline follows. It's certainly no logic that I recognize. I was constantly confused about when Bridey's narration was taking place, and while I understand that this uncertainty was most likely intentional on the author's part, it really detracted from my ability to get invested in this narrative. Additionally, the switches from Bridey's first-person POV to Milo's third-person are jarring. Maybe it's a matter of opinion, but I personally dislike when first and third person are used in a novel together. As a disclaimer for this next complaint, I just want to clarify that I am not the sort of reader who requires every facet of a story to be wrapped up in a neat bow. I actually enjoy ambiguous endings more often than not. But I need to feel like that ambiguity serves a purpose other than frustrating the reader, and I didn't really get that here. This isn't just a case of 'do not expect answers' - it goes further and we get into the murky territory of 'do not even be sure which questions you're supposed to be asking of this book.'The bottom line is that Running needed more. There is so much potential here. A story which promises to be filled to the brim with excitement ends up being rather anemic, and I'm personally left with too many questions to have found this a particularly rewarding reading experience.If you want a book that's as thought-provoking as it is sultry and atmospheric, look no further. If you want a comprehensive story that examines its themes to their full potential and leaves no stone unturned, skip this one. The problem is, I'm not sure which category I fall into.

Though this book is set against the backdrop of a specific historical context in 1930s Australia, this element was never embraced to its full potential. That said, I couldn't help but to really enjoy this book. Emily Bitto's prose is sophisticated and articulate, her characters compelling for their flaws. The Strays is about a young girl, Lily, who befriends the daughter of a prominent Australian avant-garde painter, and spends most of her time at their house-turned artists' colony. The exploration of relationships (those between friends, between parents and children, between lovers) are all imbued with tenderness and fragility. I enjoyed immersing myself in these characters' lives and getting to the bottom of the dissension that rose between them. This book was a superb character study, and as such I'd recommend it to fans of literary fiction over fans of historical fiction. Though, I would be curious to learn whether Emily Bitto has siblings. Her depiction of only children as lonely and unfulfilled struck me as rather disingenuous - why is it that people with siblings always think only children are either spoiled or miserable?

If anything, I was expectingAs someone who liked but didn't love The Girl on the Train, my expectations for Into the Water weren't particularly high. If anything, I was expecting another entertaining but fairly run of the mill thriller with a predictable outcome. (Honestly, I only added Into the Water to this month's BOTM box because I loved the cover so much.) But I loved this, and if I was secretly expecting Paula Hawkins to rest on her laurels a little bit with her sophomore novel, I was proved very, very wrong. Into the Water outdoes The Girl on the Train in just about every conceivable way.Into the Water begins when Jules Abbot gets a call that her sister Nel is dead, drowned. This brings Jules back to the small town of Beckford where she grew up, and into a complicated web of small town dynamics, packed to the brim with deceit and betrayal. Before she died, Nel was working on a project about ""The Drowning Pool,"" a local piece of lore involving the mysterious deaths of women dating back to the 1700s, all of whom died at the same spot in the river. But how many of those women committed suicide, and how many were murdered? When Nel Abbot meets her end there, the mystery surrounding The Drowning Pool takes center stage, as everyone tries to make sense of what happened.Into the Water is cleverly plotted, intricate, and nuanced; and sure, I was able to guess a few of the reveals, but some of them came as a surprise. I wanted to get to the bottom of the mystery/mysteries, but more importantly, I just enjoyed the ride. There are a lot of subplots in this story, but information is consistently revealed at a satisfying pace. Reading this book is like slowly assembling a jigsaw puzzle - it's slow at times, but steady, and before you know it you're completely sucked in and you've lost track of time, because you're so focused on finding the next piece. For this reason, there isn't necessarily one shocking reveal at the end: the final chapter is more of a quiet sort of 'ah, of course' moment, the last piece settling into place, but I was okay with that. I think I've read too many thrillers where the author tries too hard to be surprising and throws in an outlandish twist at the last moment, so I've come to favor this sort of denouement. It probably won't make you gasp out loud, but it feels appropriate. This book isn't going to work for everyone. Keep this in mind: if you are someone who gets confused by a lot of names and frequent POV switches, you will find this book maddening. There are at least 10 different narrators, all of whom have boring names like Mark and Josh and Jules and Sean. I'm good with names, so this wasn't an issue for me, but I understand why a lot of readers are turned off by the sheer amount of characters to keep track of in this book. It's actually rather reminiscent of The Casual Vacancy in this regard (small town intrigue with a massive host of characters), so if you were someone who hated The Casual Vacancy for this reason, this probably won't be for you.One final note to consider if you're thinking about reading this: trigger warning for rape. There's nothing particularly graphic, and I actually thought it was dealt with rather sensitively (bringing to light questions of victim blaming, as well as the importance of educating young people about consent, and about ""not saying no does not mean yes."") That said, it's a rather omnipresent thread in one character's narrative, so if you're triggered by this, you may want to skip this one.If you were underwhelmed by The Girl on the Train, I'd still recommend giving Into the Water a shot. This is where Paula Hawkins really shows what she's capable of, both in terms of quality of prose as well as the skillful execution of a much more nuanced story. I'm sure some people who loved The Girl on the Train won't like this one as much - there's no denying that it's quite different, in tone and subject - but it worked for me. I enjoyed reading both The Girl on the Train and Into the Water, but after I finished the former I put it down with a sense of frustration and anticlimax, and with the latter I feel mostly content. ...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"May 08, 2017","May 11, 2017","Jan 03, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/33151805-into-the-water

But I'm glad I took a chance on it anyway, because I thought there was something genuinely very refreshing and moving about this book.Between the present-day chapters that follow the point of view of Flora, daughter of Gil and Ingrid, we have letters that Ingrid wrote to Gil in 1992. Ingrid tells the story of their marriage from her point of view and hides these letters amid the thousands of books that Gil owns, and when she finishes her last letter, she vanishes, presumed drowned, though Flora never believed it. So when Gil thinks he sees Ingrid in town one day, Flora returns home and attempts to learn the truth behind her mother's disappearance. While you definitely have to suspend your disbelief with Ingrid's letters (she writes out lengthy bits of dialogue word for word in a rather un-epistolary fashion), these were still my favorite part of this novel. Ingrid's character was fascinating and tragic. Seduced by her college professor and finding herself married and a mother at too young of an age, Ingrid writes these letters to assert herself after years of living in Gil's shadow.With the exception of Ingrid, these characters are hard to like, but I found them all the more believable for that. Gil was reprehensible in a lot of ways, but he was still human. Flora and her sister Nan were frustrating, but they were products of a difficult upbringing. All of these characters were real and well-crafted, and though I didn't personally care for many of them, I couldn't help but to be drawn into their complicated dynamic. Two themes run parallel throughout Swimming Lessons - first, is it better to live with concrete knowledge of someone's death, or to hold out hope that they might still be out there? And second, does a story belong more to the author or to the reader? These themes manifest themselves throughout the story in a clever fashion. This is one of those thought-provoking books that you can't help but to keep thinking about every time you put it down. And you won't want to put it down, with Claire Fuller's gorgeous and compelling prose.One final note - file this one into the Everything I Never Told You and Dead Letters category of 'the blurb makes it sound like a mystery, but it really isn't.' This is a slow but evenly paced character-driven novel, and though the thread of Ingrid's disappearance runs through it, that isn't the focus. Just keep that in mind if you're trying to decide whether or not to pick this up. If you read exclusively mysteries, this probably won't be for you, but if you appreciate character-driven stories, this is a great one....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Mar 19, 2017","Mar 28, 2017","Jan 03, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30304221-swimming-lessons

In a collection that ranges from ghost stories to psychological horror, at times the distinction between these two horror sub-genres isn't entirely clear-cut. To what extent is this horror real, and to what extent is it a psychological manifestation? This collection is characterized by a sort of toxic obsessiveness, and Enríquez never shies away from showing the most horrible and cruel aspects of human nature. Each story is fueled by a tense urgency that pulls you in and leaves you wanting more - but this was part of the problem, for me.There's a sort of dissatisfying ambiguity to each of these narratives, and I found myself constantly wishing Enriquez would go a bit further. The open endings work at times, and add to the uneasy atmosphere (Adela's House and The Inn are good examples), but at other times the ambiguity serves only to frustrate. I was sure I would end up giving this collection 4 stars at first, waiting for that one story that would wow me and justify the high rating, but I kept finding story after story to suffer from that feeling of incompleteness. Favorites were: The Intoxicated Years, The Inn, An Invocation of the Big-Eared Runt, and Adela's House. Least favorites were: Under the Black Water, Things We Lost in the Fire, Spiderweb, and Green Red Orange. Ultimately: recommended to horror fans who (1) aren't easily triggered - there is some seriously disturbing stuff in these pages - and (2) don't mind ambiguous endings. Enriquez's strength is the unsettling atmosphere that she so expertly evokes; this collection is really for readers who are willing to enjoy the journey rather than spend the whole time looking for answers.

If I'm not into YA and I'm not into fantasy, I am really not into YA fantasy. However! I am someone who'll read anything that's been suggested to me, so in an effort to expand my reading horizons, I heeded the recommendation of my friend Hadeer and decided to give it a go. And I'm glad I did!When the Sea Is Rising Red is a paranormal fantasy with a vaguely Dickensian vibe. Think Oliver Twist or A Christmas Carol, and then throw in some magic and vampires. This is a moody and evocative book whose real strength lies in the atmosphere that Cat Hellisen creates. And on top of that, the world building in this novel is impressively extensive. Hellisen has a really phenomenal imagination. The problem is, she wasn't always able to translate her visions into a cohesive narrative. There are so many incomplete elements to this novel that are full of promise, but they just... never manage to come together in a satisfying way.For about 90% of this book, nothing happens. And that was fine with me, because I'm someone who prefers character-driven stories to plot-driven stories anyway. My problem is that most of the characters were paper-thin, and that the ending was incredibly rushed and dissatisfying. The heroine of the novel, Felicita, is easily the most three-dimensional character. She's understandably youthful and naive, and I like that after she runs away from home she frequently considers going back. It's just realistic that a girl who grew up being waited on in a lavish home wouldn't be aware of just how difficult it is slumming it, sleeping on a hard floor and scrubbing dishes for ten hours a day. Her feelings toward her two potential love interests, the charismatic low-born Dash and the vampire Jannik, are likewise believable. She's a solid protagonist that holds the story together nicely.But really, she's the only character I even begin to understand. I'm left with so many questions that I doubt will be answered in the sequel, all having to do with secondary characters' loyalties and allegiances. If you're going to sacrifice plot for the sake of depicting character dynamics, your reader shouldn't be left wondering what the characters are thinking, or how they feel about one another. One of the worst examples of this is the relationship between Felicita and and her brother Owen, which was disappointingly underdeveloped. I didn't understand the impetus behind Felicita's decision regarding Owen at the end - it involves a change of heart that's never fully examined. The whole ending was wrapped up entirely too quickly and neatly - it's like the whole book was building up to a scene that ended up lasting about two paragraphs.But ultimately, I enjoyed reading this. Hellisen's prose is incredibly mature for YA, and the world she creates here is rich in history and mythos. On the surface level, this book is gorgeous and strange and unique and fascinating. It's in the details that it starts to fall apart. Regardless, I'll probably be interested in checking out the sequel at some point....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"May 14, 2017","May 19, 2017","Jan 01, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11388429-when-the-sea-is-rising-red

While she's clearly attempting to grapple with racism, sexism, and classism, the result is a muddled mess, and I don't think there's half as much nuance to any of these subjects as the author thinks there is. I found the graphic depictions of Mireille's sexual assault to be indulgent and gratuitous, and this unsparing and almost voyeuristic approach to each rape scene was especially disappointing given Gay's reputation for feminism.

In fact, thiMaybe all the lukewarm s I'd seen actually worked in my favor for this one, because I was pleasantly surprised by Under the Harrow. In fact, this is probably my favorite thriller that I've read all year - though it's less a thriller than it is an examination of one woman's grief. Maybe those who were underwhelmed by it were expecting a bit more excitement, but I thought the unsettling atmosphere more than made up for it.Under the Harrow is a dark, bleak, melancholy book that transported me instantly to the English countryside where it's set. One day Nora is on her way from London to visit her sister Rachel, but when she arrives at the house, she finds that Rachel has been brutally murdered. (There's also an upsetting scene involving animal death, so, proceed with caution.) In the following weeks Nora stays in Marlow to help with the investigation, but unable to know who she can trust, her sense of isolation grows alongside her paranoia.I can't even emphasize how palpable Nora's grief and loneliness are in this book from start to finish - it was so evocative I started to feel like my own sister had just been murdered, and I'm an only child. Nora's relationship with Rachel was so real to me - I was surprised by how much nuance Flynn Berry was able to pack into this short little book. Though it's a very introspective story, as we spend the majority of it inside Nora's head, I didn't think it was slow at all. I was captivated by the tension from the very first page. I wasn't able to guess any of the twists, either, which I love (though some twists I liked more than others, and there are a couple of points which I felt could have used a bit more development or explanation, hence the 4 stars rather than 5... though it's more like a 4.5, really).The audiobook was a good choice here, I think. The prose itself was occasionally quite staccato in a way which I think would have irritated me more if I'd been reading it, but it suited the narrator's speaking voice and sounded quite natural.

One night he goes out to a dinner party during a storm, and on the way back he gets out of his car to move a tree that's fallen in the road, and gets struck by lightning. The story that follows is part mystery, part thriller, and part paranormal, as dreams and reality begin to blur and Peter doesn't know who he can trust to keep his visiting family safe from an impending crime. I mostly liked this book. Although the writing wasn't great, it wasn't terrible, either, and it was definitely a page-turner. My problem is that I ultimately put it down with a 'so what?' feeling. Without giving away any details, I'll just say that I found the ending much too neat and clean, the result being that any potential for emotional resonance ended up neutered. I didn't mind our narrator Peter, and some of the secondary characters were intriguing, but they weren't particularly memorable, either. Not much happens until the climax, which resolves itself at the 90% mark. It's a boring slog through the last 10%, once we already know how the main action ended up playing out. Again, these characters aren't particularly interesting enough that we want a thorough follow-up with their lives after the main drama. I also don't see the point of Judie's backstory - again, no spoilers - but a lot of gruesome information was divulged for what I can only assume to be shock value, and I'm really running out of patience for that. The Last Night at Tremore Beach was originally published in Spanish in 2014. The English translation will be published in February 2017. Recommended if you're looking for a quick and somewhat mindless thriller. There are some cool ideas here, but for me the end result was just lacking in emotional resonance. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Dec 25, 2016","Dec 29, 2016","Dec 13, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30753797-the-last-night-at-tremore-beach

Oddly, I’ve been misremembering for years that these books have the same English-language translator; they do not, and I think that factor alone might be responsible for the fact that I had a stronger reaction to Medea than I did to Cassandra. Jan van Heurck’s translation here is serviceable, but John Cullen’s Medea translation really sings in a way this one does not. (Hannah, whose favorite novel is Cassandra, has assured me that the German-language prose in Cassandra is much stronger than in Medea, but knows other English-language readers who share my assessment of the two.)In this volume published by FSG in the 80s, Wolf’s novel Cassandra is published alongside four essays which were originally presented as a lecture series. The first two are travel diaries that detail Wolf’s journey to ancient sites in Greece, the next is a personal journal entry, and the final one is a letter. Through these essays the reader comes to not only see what a passion project this novel was for Wolf, but also to see the myriad of factors from her contemporary sociopolitical perspective that influenced her perception of the Cassandra character. She writes of the ways in which her concept of Cassandra evolve throughout her research:The character continually changes as I occupy myself with the material; the deadly seriousness, and everything heroic and tragic, is disappearing; accordingly, compassion and unilateral bias in her favor are disappearing, too. I view her more soberly, even with irony and humor. I see through her.The novel, which comes first in this bind-up, is essentially a monologue from Cassandra’s perspective, narrating her account of the Trojan War as her death draws nearer. Like Medea, this is a very political retelling, focused not only on Cassandra’s life but also the machinations of the Trojan court, notably subverting the romantic notion that the war was waged for Helen’s honor and beauty, instead exposing that that was a smoke screen for Greek occupation, actually driven by an interest in Troy’s trade routes.This book in both of its halves — novel and essays — is a beautiful and thoughtful meditation on the destructive effects of war on the individual. I’m glad I finally made the time to read it, I only wish I were capable of reading it in the original German, in which I suspect it may have affected me a bit more....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"Aug 14, 2021","Aug 30, 2021","Nov 29, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/153482.Cassandra

Resonance and pathos are within its grasp but it isn’t quite able to achieve either. I'll Be Right There follows Jung Yoon, a young woman looking back on the period of her life when she was a university student in 1980s South Korea, where she had close friend group that was eventually torn apart by tragic circumstances. It seems a bit callous to say that I ultimately didn't care about these characters and the horrors they endured, but I guess that's what it does come down to. Despite a premise that promises heartbreak and emotional turbulence, Kyung-Sook Shin goes to pains to ensure that the reader remain as apathetic about her characters as possible.My main frustration with I'll Be Right There is down to the fact that so much of this narrative happens off-screen. A secondary character will die, and rather than seeing it happen, or even seeing Yoon’s reaction to hearing the news, we’ll find out that six months have gone by since the last chapter and Yoon has been processing her grief all that time. It’s time the reader doesn’t get to spend with her, and the story suffers for it. It's just impossible to get inside this character's head, which is especially perplexing given the first-person narration. A tragic backstory will be revealed, and Yoon will flinch or shriek or cry as she hears the story told, but we're just calmly informed that she does these things. She'll develop an obsession with another student, and tell the reader that she's interested in this person, but it's almost impossible to discern why. She'll feel an inexplicable attachment to her professor (who's apparently meant to be at the center of this story in a mentor role, but who has maybe three scenes in the entire book and isn't able to anchor the narrative in the way he's meant to) and this is just never expounded upon. And admittedly there's something to be said about poignancy that's achieved through unsentimental narration - Human Acts comes to mind - but interestingly, I don't think that was the author's intention here. This book is undeniably steeped in melodrama, or it tries to be, but the result is just hollow. Kyung-Sook Shin commits the cardinal sin of assuming the reader's investment in her characters without earning it. It's like all the elements are there to tell a beautiful and moving story about young people growing up against a backdrop of sociopolitical unrest, but there just isn't enough humanity in this story to make it convincing or affecting. I know Kyung-Sook Shin is a prominent writer in South Korea and I really want to love her work, so maybe I'll give it another try, but I'll Be Right There was a pretty big disappointment. ...more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Aug 07, 2018","Aug 20, 2018","Nov 21, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18209505-i-ll-be-right-there

It's an addicting psychological thriller about two unrelated women who both, at different times, agree to move into an experimental house designed by minimalist architect Edward Monkford. The house comes with a long set of rules: no clutter, no children, no pets. Nothing but the absolutely essential. Chapters alternate between their perspectives following two different timelines; we have Then: Emma and Now: Jane. Though the young women don't know each other, their narratives parallel and we see Jane falling into the same patterns and making the same choices as Emma did, lending the story a tense air of inevitability - it's like watching two trains about to collide, and it's terrifying.This started out being one of the creepiest thrillers I've read in a long time. I raced through the pages in order to get to the bottom of the mystery. And then it all went downhill.I try my best to write my s without spoilers, but all of my problems with this book come down to the twists and reveals, so without further ado:(view spoiler)[1. Emma lying about being raped. On the one hand, I love unreliable narrators, especially in this genre. The fact of Emma being a pathological liar is fascinating, and it's fun trying to wade through her web of deceit to discern the truth. But then we arrive here, and... well. What a letdown. I'm not saying that false rape accusations don't happen. But in a society where allegations of rape are often met with scorn and skepticism, where alleged rapists are let out of prison after six months because of promising athletic careers or even appointed president of the United States, do we really need more fictional accounts of women lying about being raped? Especially seeing as the biggest name in this genre from recent years also focuses on a false rape accusation, it stings even more seeing it repeated here. Once was enough. (I won't name the title because of spoilers, but I think we all know what I'm talking about.)2. The reveal that Simon was the killer. This is one of the rare cases where I think I would have preferred the killer to be the person we all guessed it was on page one, rather than this outlandish twist. In Edward Monkford we have a fascinating and terrifying depiction of a narcissist and a sociopath, someone who seems from the outset perfectly capable of murder. While it seemed a bit too obvious that he was the killer, I couldn't help but to expect it. I wanted to see what drove him to that point, what was enough to make him snap. Even though I thought I had this book figured out, I didn't care. It was still addicting and tense and my heart raced as I tore through the pages, waiting for the final pieces of Edward murdering Emma to click into place. But no, it turns out that Edward's just a bit of an eccentric weirdo, and boring and possessive Simon is secretly crazy enough to murder the woman he loves. Simon was a jerk, there's no doubt about that, but I still didn't really buy this. Something that writers of the thriller genre fail to grasp is that sometimes less is more. Sometimes a bit of predictability is okay if your characters and situations are unique enough, which was certainly the case here. Readers are just as likely to enjoy a book because of its vivid characters - and Edward is certainly that - as unexpected plot twists. Twists like this need to strike a balance between shocking and believable in order to be effective, and this one relied too heavily on the former. 3. Down Syndrome being equated with imperfection and Jane being forced to choose between the epitome of perfection in the house and her 'imperfect' baby... really????? Could we not have told this story without going here??? [note: edited on 12/12/16. I originally incorrectly stated that the baby had autism, while it actually is Down Syndrome, as someone reminded me in the comments. I apologize for the error - I hadn't had the book with me at the time I wrote this  and was going off memory.] (hide spoiler)]3 stars because I couldn't help but to be sucked in by this story, but its layers of intrigue and deception. The pace was fantastic and the short chapters made it almost impossible to put down. But as more and more of this story's layers are uncovered, the more distasteful it became, and I can't help but to mourn the wasted potential in what started out as a truly unique and memorable novel.

Like her stunning debut, Everything I Never Told You, Little Fires Everywhere is a book that grabs you from the first page, but it isn't until you're fully immersed in the story that you begin to realize what an accomplishment it is. There's something about the careful construction of her novels that calls to mind a tapestry - how each element adroitly fits in to complement the whole.The premise of this novel is this: Mia Warren and her daughter Pearl move to a small, progressive town in Ohio called Shaker Heights, where they befriend a wealthy family, the Richardsons. Meanwhile, one of Mia's friends, a Chinese woman named Bebe, abandons her infant daughter in a fit of desperation in order to provide her with a better life. The Shaker Heights community is divided by the fate of this child, and Mrs. Richardson digs into Mia Warren's past as a schism forms between them.At its core, this is a book about motherhood, and I'll be honest, that is usually not my favorite subject to read about. I'm burned out with the 'how far would a parent go to protect their child' premise - I think I read too many Jodi Picoult books in high school. But Little Fires Everywhere offers a subtler examination of this theme, which dovetails with several others - conformity, race, belonging, and the cost of community.As always, Ng's prose is light and effortless. She blends third person omniscient prose with an unnerving intimacy, drawing you into the heart and soul of her characters in a way that's difficult to accomplish in such a short novel.I didn't put this novel down feeling quite as stunned and breathless as I had after Everything I Never Told You, but that's only because Ng's debut was such a tour de force. Little Fires Everywhere is an extraordinary follow up, just as intelligent and thought-provoking and nuanced as I knew Ng was capable of. Ng has solidified her position as an auto-buy author for me. I can't wait to see what she does next.4.5 stars - changed from 5 to 4 on Goodreads after a few days upon further reflection!...more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Sep 06, 2017","Sep 09, 2017","Nov 03, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34273236-little-fires-everywhere

It started out at about a 4 star level (I really was in the mood for something light after reading mostly classics lately) and I was prepared to forgive its many flaws, but ultimately the list of complaints just piled up too high. Sorry Lucie Whitehouse, I tried.The House at Midnight chronicles a year in the life of a group of friends, one of whom, Lucas, recently inherited a mansion in a small English town, following his uncle's suicide. The story focuses on Joanna and her relationship with Lucas as it shifts from friendship to romance, and the tension and betrayal that follows.An abridged list of grievances:- The author's attempts at rendering the house as a dark and sinister force are almost embarrassingly heavy-handed. We can't go a full ten pages without Jo reflecting on how the house feels like a sentient being. Okay, Joanna, we get it.- The mystery of Lucas's family history took a backseat and instead we get 200 pages of relationship drama, before the author seems to remember the story's core mystery, which is hastily wrapped up in the final pages.- It's almost like Lucie Whitehouse had a Point A and a Point B in mind for this story, but didn't know how to get from one to the other. The narrative meanders in an awkward, directionless fashion, focusing on all sorts of weird, irrelevant details. There was something off about the pace, too; we'd spend four chapters on a single evening and then randomly skip ahead two months. It was hard to keep track of at times.- The characters, though initially compelling, end up being rather underdeveloped. Jo doesn't have much of a personality, Danny's villainy is never fully examined, Michael is a complete nonentity, Rachel disappears altogether, and Lucas hovers in the grey area between victim and villain, but I was unable to care one way or the other. If you're someone who needs your characters to be likable, you're going to hate this book. I'm not that reader, so I was able to enjoy certain elements of the group dynamic presented here, but by the end I was underwhelmed, especially since these characters started out with a lot of potential.- The lazy depiction of feminism as a hindrance to Jo experiencing the sort of romance and sex life she craves is just embarrassing. There are literally lines like 'I thought the idea of being pregnant with his child was sexy, and the inner feminist in me shuddered' (not a verbatim quote but pretty damn close). - The book ends on a cliffhanger, which is totally fine! But here's the thing: the narrative is told in the first person past tense, complete with lines like, 'Years later, I wasn't sure how I managed to drive the car home without getting in an accident' and 'Even now, I can't remember what happened in the week that followed.' This means Joanna is looking back on these events years after the fact, and if that's the case, why would she stop her narrative right in the middle of an event? The cliffhanger is completely incongruous with the way the rest of the story is told. Writers, take note. Tense and number aren't arbitrary, irrelevant factors; they have to suit the narrative. Present tense would have been a much more appropriate choice here.All that said, parts of this book were certainly gripping and addicting. Reading through some s here, I do think this book suffered especially from its comparison to Donna Tartt's The Secret History and Daphne du Maurier's Rebecca. The similarities with those two books lie solely in the themes and setting, not the way they're presented. That isn't Lucie Whitehouse's fault. Books are compared to other books in order to sell, and sometimes this backfires. I initially wanted to be able to give this a higher rating for that reason. But there was just too much potential here and not enough payoff....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Feb 26, 2017","Mar 04, 2017","Nov 01, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2363802.The_House_at_Midnight

If it can provide me with some suspense and some fun escapism for a few hours, I'm pretty easy to please. Unfortunately, The Woman in Cabin 10 slid under my relatively low bar.This book was boring. I don't say that a lot. I read a lot of character-driven literary fiction, and not a whole lot of what I read is terribly plot-heavy. I don't need consistently high stakes or action packed adventure to hold my interest. But this was boring. Lo Blacklock is a travel journalist who goes on a luxury cruise, and while she's on the boat, she believes she witnesses a murder. The majority of this book is then Lo just attempting to convince people of what she saw, and it gets old pretty fast. This book also required a positively excessive amount of suspension of disbelief. Characters consistently did not act like real people, or else their motives, Lo's in particular, made zero sense. An early example of this is when Lo's long-time boyfriend, Judah, asks her to move in with him. Until this point in the book, Lo had essentially been waxing eloquent for thirty pages about how much she loves him, and then when he poses this question, she completely freaks out and they get into a fight. And there are plenty of reasons why someone wouldn't want to move in with their partner, even if they're in love, but are any of these reasons actually explored? Not particularly. Their argument is a pretty transparent plot device to drive a wedge into their relationship before Lo embarks on her cruise. Also, at the very beginning of this book, Lo's apartment is burgled while she's inside, an event that was supposedly terrifying and which had a pretty huge effect on her for the rest of the novel, but while we're told over and over again just how traumatic and upsetting this was for Lo, I never really felt it. There's this constant disconnect between her actions and what she's relaying (in first person) to the reader. 'I need to snap out of this,' she muses frequently, without ever detailing what THIS actually is.Anyway, back to the boat. Ruth Ware was clearly attempting an Agatha Christie-esque locked door mystery, but where she failed was the sheer amount of interchangeable characters. First of all, while there are only ten cabins, you'd think that that would limit the number of suspects to ten, right? Incorrect - there are so many crew members on this boat I couldn't even begin to keep track of them. And even of the aforementioned ten guests, only about three of them had any sort of personality. The rest just bled together. I figured out pretty early on in this book that I wasn't going to care about the whodunnit reveal, because these were some of the least interesting characters I have ever encountered.There are also some pretty gargantuan leaps of logic on a fairly regular basis. For example. Lo thinks she sees a woman get thrown overboard; she tells the security guard about a woman in that room lending her some mascara earlier that day, and the security guard and Lo both conclude that the ONLY possible person who could have been thrown overboard is that particular woman - he doesn't even bother taking inventory of all the passengers and crew members?? In what universe does this make sense??It finally, finally picked up toward the end - even though there weirdly was not much of a climax to this book, the final five or six chapters do provide a bit of long-overdue excitement. But by this point I really didn't care what happened either way.But my biggest problem with The Woman in Cabin 10 was actually its treatment of mental illness, which, interestingly, I've seen praised by a lot of ers. And look, I get it. I think this book thinks it's conveying a pro-medication message, and it's easy to be distracted by its good intentions and not examine just how offensive these words actually are. (For the record, I have been taking anxiety medication for over five years, which I'm only disclosing to let you guys know that this is something I care a lot about on a personal level as well as an academic one.)""There's no reason, on paper at least, why I need these pills to get through life. I had a great childhood, loving parents, the whole package. I wasn't beaten, abused, or expected to get nothing by As. I had nothing but love and support, but that wasn't enough somehow.""I'm tired of even well-meaning narratives feeding into this idea that depression needs to be justified. You're allowed to be depressed without having had a shitty childhood. And yes, you could argue that that's exactly what Ruth Ware is saying here, but this entire book bends over backwards to remind us how normal Lo is, and isn't it weird how someone so normal needs to take medication?? Sorry, but if her intention is to normalize medication, she's failing miserably. I felt condescended to by the fact that every time meds were brought up in this book, there was this aura of otherness about them - in fact, early on in this book, we find out that Lo is taking medication for something, but we don't know what, and it isn't until her sanity is being called into question that another character reveals (in hushed tones, of course) that Lo is taking meds for... dun dun dun... depression. Is it too much to ask that a character can just take depression or anxiety medication without there being a whole song and dance about it??""Cognitive behavioral therapy, counseling, psychotherapy - none of it really worked in the way that the pills did. Lissie says she finds the notion of chemically rebalancing your mood scary, she says it's the idea idea of taking something that could alter how she really is. But I don't see it that way; for me it's like wearing makeup - not a disguise, but a way of making myself more how I really am, less raw. The best me I can be.""And then there's this. Where do I even begin with this. Wearing makeup isn't empowering or feminist. There is a social and historical precedent that women are expected to wear makeup in order to be taken seriously, in order to succeed at our careers that should have nothing at all to do with appearance. It's one thing to enjoy wearing makeup on an individual level, but it's important to acknowledge just how messed up it is that women are fed this idea from an early age that we aren't our best selves until we paint our faces on. (I don't want to derail this  too badly, so here is a great article that goes into this in more depth. And this tumblr post, while brief, pretty much sums up my feelings exactly.)And look, I don't care if this character likes wearing mascara. But Ruth Ware drawing a comparison between makeup (an artificial standard of beauty that forces unhealthy expectations onto young women) and medication (something that actually saves lives) is offensive, and counterproductive to whatever point she was trying to make. You're really going to try to frame your narrative as progressive by asserting that it's okay to take medication for mental illness, and in that same breath feed into this false makeup = empowerment narrative?Basically, this book dropped every ball it was trying to juggle. The plot was weak, the characters were weaker, and the treatment of Lo's mental illness would have been laughable if I weren't so offended by it. The only reason this is getting 2 stars instead of 1 is that 1-star books require a certain passionate hatred that this book didn't inspire in me. It mostly held my interest and offered a few surprises, but on the whole I just wanted it to end....more",Notes are private!,0,61,1,"Jan 15, 2018","Jan 19, 2018","Nov 01, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28187230-the-woman-in-cabin-10

But the strong focus on female friendships and the three-dimensionality given to all of the girls who are introduced made this a really poignant and memorable read, as did the really remarkably crafted setting. I loved it up until about ten pages from the end.(view spoiler)[That was honestly one of the worst 'twists' I've ever read. You have to suspend a lot of disbelief to accept a lot of things that happen in this book - which is okay, because Dot Hutchison's compelling prose makes you believe things you ordinarily wouldn't, and that's part of what you sign up for when you read a book with an outlandish premise like this - but Sophia being the escaped Butterfly and Maya already knowing about the Garden really push it over the top. I'm really struggling to believe that someone who escaped from the Garden wouldn't report it to the police - and the billion-to-one odds of the Gardener kidnapping someone who already knew about the Garden just had me rolling my eyes. And after everything, the fact that this is what Maya was keeping from the police seemed a little ridiculous. As did her tears at the end - I'm tired of the 'character who never cries finally moved to the point of tears by a compassionate act' trope. Hutchison's background in YA shines through occasionally in this mostly adult thriller, and this was one of those times. (hide spoiler)]But otherwise, this was a great thriller. Fair warning: while Hutchison errs on the side of sensitivity and doesn't divulge too many gory details, this is still a very dark and disturbing read with obvious trigger warnings for rape and violence, so naturally I would not recommend this to everyone.

I didn't have very high expectations (despite I received a copy of this book from netgalley in exchange for an honest .This book was fantastic. I didn't have very high expectations (despite being intrigued by the premise, contemporary teen drama books are a dime a dozen), but I was really floored by Lindsey Lee Johnson's debut novel. The Most Dangerous Place on Earth chronicles the lives of students at a high school in a wealthy San Francisco suburb, dipping into the perspectives of a wide array of characters, from the Type A students to the smart-but-uninspired to the complete slackers. These vignettes are interspersed with chapters from the perspective of 23 year old teacher Molly Nicholl. She spends her first year teaching attempting to understand and connect with her students, whose high school experience is collectively colored by a middle school tragedy that Molly is unaware of.A common pitfall of fiction surrounding the lives of high schoolers tends to be an evidence that the author has clearly forgotten what high school is actually like. While Johnson's efforts occasionally lend themselves to clichés (students having affairs with teachers, enough drug use that it stretches the point of believability), this is mitigated by vivid characters and drama that is mostly realistic. This book evoked a lot of less than savory memories of high school: the crushing anxiety over grades, the constant struggle of finding and maintaining friendships over years, the constant uncertainty about the future.There's a searing honesty and urgency to this narrative that I find is sorely lacking in so many attempts at describing the lives of teenagers (actually - in so many books in general). This isn't a book about plot twists and shocking reveals, but it's a page-turner nonetheless, whose compulsively readable prose and short chapters make it tempting to devour it in one sitting. Lindsey Lee Johnson layers her narrative with careful intricacy - different narratives subtly overlapping - which compels the reader to dig further and further until all secrets have been unearthed.The Most Dangerous Place on Earth also serves as an incisive commentary on the culture of wealth and privilege that these students have grown up in. And while Johnson tackles issues like cyberbullying and teen suicides, this isn't a narrative which maligns technology or bashes millennials. The students are all sympathetic in their unique ways - some you want to sympathize with more willingly than others - but this is a story that examines so many facets of the life of the average American high schooler that it's hard to come away from it with anything but a deep appreciation for these students and the challenges that they face.A very strong and compelling debut. 4.5 stars....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Nov 19, 2016","Nov 20, 2016","Oct 20, 2016",,,view (with text),/book/show/20760053-the-most-dangerous-place-on-earth

It actually occurred to me a few days ago that I could give up, but then I realized I haven't DNF'd a single thing this year, and I wasn't about to start on December 30. So at long last I sat down and forced myself to finish. I was really intrigued by this short story collection. As those who know me well know, I like my fiction as dark as possible. So when your summary promises to ""shock and scar readers for years to come,"" my interest is automatically piqued. This sort of thing is right up my alley, and I had high hopes from the outset. To say that Redefining Darkness didn't deliver would be an understatement. An alternate title for this anthology might have been ""Men Being Terrible."" We've got a pedophile priest, an unhappy rich adulterer, a couple of murderers; every character in these pages stepped straight out of some sort of book on villain clichés. Every story goes exactly like this: ""Dr. So-And-So was rich and handsome. He was also very athletic. He went to the gym twice a week. In addition to being an esteemed and respected professional, women loved him. But he had a Dark Secret."" Okay, not every story, but it starts to feel like it.And this is how just about every single male protagonist is described:""His hair was graying at the temples; he walked four miles every morning to get some exercise, and although he hadn't dated in years, women found him attractive. He had blue eyes that sparkled, a smile capable of holding hearts captive, along with a charm and articulacy that disarmed even the most contentious feminists.""... Are you serious?For being such prevalent themes, wealth and masculinity are never fully examined for the role they play in the characters' misfortunes. Basically, the author wants us to surmise that the 'darkness' inherent to the wealthy straight white male existence is somehow universal. I'm not buying it. The only thing that scared me about this short story collection was the extent to which misogyny unwittingly framed these narratives.I appreciate what the author was going for: brief stories without neat endings which are meant to be chilling and thought-provoking.

I don't particularly like YA and I don't particularly like magical realism, but nevertheless, I was intrigued by the rave s and the summary which promised an innovative plot and diverse representation, so I decided to give it a try, because you never know. There are plenty of books that I love with the disclaimer 'I'm not usually a fan of XYZ, but...' Unfortunately, this was not one of those books.I mean, this is a great book. If you like YA and magical realism. This is a sensual, atmospheric book: it's definitely about the mood more than the details. We meet Sam and Miel, a transgender boy and an orphan girl who can grow roses out of her wrist. Their relationship sets the backdrop of this novel, which largely involves their conflict with a group of sisters known as the Bonner girls. This is more of a character study than an action-packed novel, which is ordinarily the sort of thing I like, but for a number of reasons, this book just didn't do it for me.I have three concrete issues with this book (and then a fourth which is essentially that I just didn't care. But that one's on me, not the author). First, the prose. I'm seeing plenty of s praising McLemore's prose as rich and lyrical, which it is. To the point of excess. I think there is a such thing as a surfeit of lyricism, an overabundance of similes and metaphors to the point where your plot ends up getting lost beneath the fancy window dressing. I found myself rereading entire sections because I lost track of what was actually going on. This is a matter of preference - I'm sure others loved this book for this very reason, for the ethereal, magical quality that the prose lends the story. But for me, I thought it was just too much. It's like eating a bunch of candy bars one right after another: they're good at first, but end up being too sickly-sweet to stomach all at once.Second: the plot. Again, not much happens. I was bored. Third: the infuriating repetition. This book is less than 300 pages long, but the same phrases and ideas are repeated over and over, and the scene where Miel first arrives to the town emerging from the wreckage of a recently torn-down water tower is revisited so often I was about ready to throw my kindle across the room in frustration by the end.However, I won't go as far as to dissuade others from reading this book, especially if this is your genre of choice. (I feel a bit like I'm at a Rolling Stones concert, complaining that the band only played Rolling Stones music.) So I'll end on a positive note. Here's what I liked about this book: there are a lot of important issues tackled in these pages, and McLemore writes about them with admirable sensitivity. Sam begins life as a bacha posh and then comes to realize that he identifies as male, and it's refreshing to not only see a trans protagonist in YA lit, but to see his struggle with his gender identity captured in such an honest and compelling way. There's also a refreshing amount of racial diversity - Sam is Italian-Pakistani and Miel is Latina, and McLemore never glosses over the unique practices and traditions of each culture.So, while this book didn't quite do it for me, it certainly has enough positive attributes that I'm glad to see it's being well received by those who are more interested in this genre than I am....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Oct 18, 2016","Oct 23, 2016","Oct 11, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28220826-when-the-moon-was-ours

Snow Flower and the Secret I received a copy of this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest .I've been a huge fan of Lisa See for years. Snow Flower and the Secret Fan, Shanghai Girls, and Dreams of Joy are some of my all-time favorite historical fiction novels. But then in 2014 she came out with China Dolls which many, myself included, considered a massive disappointment and not at all up to her usual standard. As this is the first novel she's published since then, it was with both excitement and trepidation that I approached The Tea Girl of Hummingbird Lane. Was China Dolls a random flop, or an indication of a new direction in her writing?Well, it's safe to breathe a sigh of relief, because Lisa See is back, with this compulsively readable tale of a Chinese girl from a southeastern hill tribe, who gives her baby up for adoption after giving birth out of wedlock.My favorite thing about Lisa See's novels is her unerring attention to detail and her skill at immersing the reader in different periods and locations throughout Chinese history. In this case, the novel begins in 1988, and our narrator Li-yan is a member of the Akha tribe - a ethnic group that I knew absolutely nothing about before picking up this novel. Lisa See sheds light onto their rich history and culture in a way that's both engrossing and sensitive. She also delves into a lot of other subjects that I now know much more about than I did a week ago: the history of pu'er tea, Chinese land ownership laws in the wake of the Cultural Revolution, the shifting growth of the international tea economy. This was a very illuminating read on multiple levels, and the historical elements weave seamlessly through Li-yan's narrative. Though Li-yan begins the story as a bright young girl with a promising future in academia, a series of difficult choices leads her to hardship early on in her life, which only serves to fortify her character as the story continues. Meanwhile we catch glimpses of Li-yan's daughter, Haley, who grows up searching for answers about the identity of her birth parents and her heritage. It's a captivating, moving story, which keeps the reader constantly engaged despite its length, and although its footing falters somewhat around the 60% mark, it culminates in an ultimately gratifying conclusion.4 stars instead of 5 because I wasn't completely satisfied with See's prose this time around. One sort of awkward characteristic of her writing is a tendency to favor authenticity over poetic license - let's take the most obvious example, ""doing the intercourse."" Is this a more direct translation than ""having sex"" from the Akha's Sino-Tibetan language? I actually have no idea. Probably. I trust Lisa See's research skills. But the awkward translation also lends a slight sense of absurdity to See's otherwise solid prose, as do the abundance of exclamation points and the frequent interjection waaa! in the middle of the narrator's thoughts.For the full Lisa See experience, I cannot recommend Snow Flower and/or Shanghai Girls/Dreams of Joy highly enough. But if prose isn't the make it or break it factor for you (and I will stress that it wasn't bad, just not quite up to the standard that I know See is capable of), The Tea Girl of Hummingbird Lane has a lot to offer. It's a richly detailed story that spans several decades and multiple locations, both in southeast China and America; it's a story about the strength born from suffering and the reconciliation of innovation and tradition, told in a fascinating and unique historical narrative....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Nov 05, 2016","Nov 12, 2016","Oct 05, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/25150798-the-tea-girl-of-hummingbird-lane

Their stHarmless Like You is the multigenerational story of Yuki, growing up in New York in the 1960s, and her son, Jay, who she abandoned as a baby. Their stories move forward together in parallel timelines, one beginning in 1968 and one beginning in 2016, culminating in a reunion that we know is coming ever since the prologue. In the meantime we explore the reasons that led to Yuki's abandonment of Jay, and how Jay has learned to cope with her desertion, especially as he now has a newborn infant himself. I have a lot of thoughts about this book - not all of them good, despite the 4 star rating. I'll start with the downsides: (1) The book begins with a very hasty plot point which to me reeks of a plot device (Yuki's parents agreeing to let her live in New York at 16 years old with a friend they'd only met once, while they go back to Japan to live - there are absolutely reasons for a family to do something this radical, but those reasons go mostly unexamined here). (2) It took me ages to get invested in Yuki - I think the third-person POV really serves to hold her at an arm's length from the reader. (3) The resolution is a bit too neat, and there's some abrupt character development at the end which to me felt unearned.But when it's good, it's great. When Yuki's personality begins to develop (starting with a really beautiful and heartrending scene where she sees an exhibit at the Whitney and is overcome with sadness), she's a wonderful and complex protagonist, whose journey is at times devastating. What surprised me though is how utterly brilliant I found Jay's character to be. Here we have a pair of characters who don't want to be parents, but they each find themselves in that role anyway. Jay is not a particularly palatable character - he loves his bald cat more than his newborn baby - and while some readers may think he's a monster, Hisayo Buchanan doesn't pass judgement in a way that I found sort of refreshing. This is one of those books where I think I liked the overall impression it left me with more than I liked reading the book itself. It's the kind of book that elucidates harsh truths about parenthood, growing up, art, and identity, and it leaves you feeling sort of sad and hollow - but for whatever reason, that's a feeling I like. This is one of those thought-provoking books whose characters will probably stay with me....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Apr 03, 2018","Apr 08, 2018","Oct 05, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30231823-harmless-like-you

I’d never heI received a copy of this book from netgalley in exchange for an honest .I wasn’t sure what to expect from The Fall of Lisa Bellow. I’d never heard of Susan Perabo, but the blurb grabbed me with its promise of similarities to Everything I Never Told You and Room, two of the best books I’ve read so far in 2016. This can be a double edged sword, going into a book with such high expectations. Fortunately, Lisa Bellow lived up to this tall order.This is the story of Meredith Oliver, an insecure eighth grade girl who goes into the local deli for a root beer after school, only to witness a robbery and the kidnapping of Lisa Bellow, the pretty, popular girl who Meredith had always disdained. This summary may make it sound like a thriller, but it’s not. This is a quiet character study of a novel, and a careful examination into the psychology of those affected by trauma. In the aftermath of the event, Meredith grapples with the guilt of being the one left behind, and feels a closeness to Lisa that she’s unable to understand. While the obvious choice would have been to center this story around Lisa’s abduction, Susan Perabo opts for the often unexamined perspective: the story of the girl who didn’t get taken, whose life was changed by the event in less ostensible, less quantifiable ways.This novel weaves between Meredith’s point of view and that of her mother, Claire, whose older son has also recently undergone a severe ordeal. While I thought Meredith was a compelling narrator - insecure, scared, and vulnerable - I found it difficult to sympathize with Claire. I wouldn’t say that I prefer characters to be likable, necessarily - with female characters especially, I think it’s important to let them be flawed and honest, even if it means sacrificing more ‘desirable' characteristics. But for some reason, I never found Claire compelling in her imperfection: I never wanted to dig to the root of her flaws, to really understand her. It didn’t matter so much that I didn’t like her; the problem was that I found myself completely unable to care.My indifference toward Claire’s character is my main criticism. Otherwise I thought this was a very impressive debut novel. Perabo’s prose was both incisive and compelling; she creates a captivating, page-turning read which both stimulates and challenges the reader. Finally, it bears repeating: don’t go into this novel expecting a thriller. Sure, you’ll want to know what happened to Lisa, but don’t expect that to be the point. This is Meredith’s story, in all its messiness and tension and fragility. Perabo bypasses any temptation to sanitize or sensationalize this story, and deftly cuts to the heart of the drama in a way which is admirably real.

I was so disinterested with the first 20% that I wouldn't have been able to tell you the protagonist's name at this point (actually, as it was told in first person I wouldn't have been able to tell you the protagonist's gender, either). I think I spent about five days trying to get through the first quarter of this book, certainly on the verge of calling it a DNF; then I ended up reading the rest in one sitting yesterday. At the aforementioned 20% mark it begins to hit its stride - it turns out the narrator is a young man named Max, whose recently deceased mother left behind a series of clues about a dark family secret. Max tries to balance his comfortable London job with frequent trips back to his mother's house in Vienna, where he attempts to get to the bottom of the mystery. As Max finds himself buried deep within the investigation, more and more unsavory layers are revealed, and with paranormal elements at play Max finds himself wondering if he's on the precipice of madness. The story takes place in the present, though each chapter ends with a short flashback to Max's mother's early life, beginning in 1938 Vienna.This book was so close to being great. Initial pacing issues aside, I ended up being very glad that I stuck with it, as there was a lot to love: the scenes where you felt the presence of the ghost(s) were wrought with tension, and the intricate web of family secrets is at once compelling and horrifying. Information is revealed at a satisfying pace, and while I don't think any of the big reveals were particularly difficult to guess, the story keeps you engaged through the end, with a handful of surprises along the way.If you're looking for a terrifying, nail-bitingly scary ghost story, this isn't it. I'd actually recommend this to fans of the mystery/thriller genre over fans of horror and paranormal. The integration of the ghost story to the mystery is something that I thought started out well, but ended up faltering toward the end. Without giving away specifics, I'll just say that I thought there was a lot of build up and not enough payoff in this respect. It's not that we don't get answers - we do - but I couldn't help but to feel a bit of a sense of anticlimax, a sense that the author could have gone a bit further. But when it comes to the Albrecht family's sinister past and the mystery that ties the novel together, nothing is lacking. It's a darkly compelling and sad tale.There was just a level of detachment I couldn't get past, and I think a lot of that had to do with a difficulty connecting with our protagonist. We're held at arm's length from a lot of details of Max's life that the author considers extraneous to the central plot - his job is mentioned, but specifics are conspicuously omitted, and though his girlfriend Lana plays a role, we never really get to meet her. Consequently this ended up being a page-turner at a very surface level: I wanted to get to the bottom of the mystery and my interest was piqued enough to get through most of it in a day, but I didn't care enough about the characters that it made a very strong impression on me. I didn't dislike Max; I rather felt for him at times, but, despite the first-person narration, it was difficult to really get inside his head.This is a difficult book to rate - as you can see, my thoughts are all over the place - but I think I'd call it 3.5 stars. Despite my criticisms, I did really enjoy this and I would almost certainly look into anything Amna K.

All I knew about this book going in waWell, The Female of the Species was just as brutal as everyone says it is, so naturally I thought it was great. All I knew about this book going in was that it's somehow about rape culture, which it certainly is, but it's not so much a 'rape book' a la Asking For It, Speak, etc., as a teenage vigilante story that could be compared to Hard Candy or Sadie (if I'm allowed to compare it to a book that was published later). So, another successful foray into YA for me this month!The Female of the Species follows three characters - Alex, the occasionally violent but intelligent loner girl whose sister was murdered, Jack, the popular jock with hidden depths, and Peekay, the preacher's kid who's recovering from a bad break-up. Alex is a brilliant character, and she's ultimately at the center of this novel, tying together these three characters' disparate plotlines. What I loved about Alex is how her violent streak is neither condemned nor romanticized by the narrative - this is not one of those books that falls victim to very basic 'murder is wrong!' moralizing (which, yes, we can all agree that murder is wrong, but reinforcing that point over and over doesn't make for a terribly interesting story). Instead, McGinnis uses this character to explore a much more intriguing narrative.To everyone who suggests it's impossible to discuss rape in media without showing it in graphic detail, I say: read this book. When I mentioned above that this isn't really a traditional 'rape book,' what I meant is that the only rape occurs off-screen before the story begins, and that gets a comparatively small focus in the story. Instead, this deals with those 'almost' situations, the grey areas, the insidious ways that rape culture informs teenage social situations in ways we don't even think about. This is such an astoundingly important book for teenagers to read - like Asking For It, I think it adds a really unique and important slant to this conversation. But of course, 'important' doesn't really say anything about literary quality - a book can naturally be 'important' and terrible - but I thought The Female of the Species was very smart and engaging. This book builds tension brilliantly and culminates in a positively brilliant conclusion. It does take quite a dark turn, but I loved it; I don't think anything else would have suited the story quite so well.But I did have problems with this book, and they were essentially: Peekay and Jack. Both of these characters felt more like a construct than an actual human being to me. Jack was the Generic Romantic Hero straight out of any YA novel I've ever read, and Peekay's character just felt so contrived to me. The extent to which being the preacher's kid (PK = Peekay) informed her entire identity could have been believable to me if we had spent any time examining how that impacted her, or looking at her relationship with religion, but instead it's reduced to almost a gag - apparently the entire town thinks of her as the preacher's kid, but we have no concept of what that actually means to her. To this end, occasionally this felt like it fell on the younger end of the YA spectrum than its subject matter would imply; simplicity where there should be nuance. Not every character and theme fell victim to this, of course, but there was no reason for Alex to be so fleshed out at the expense of the other two main characters, and I just would have liked to have seen a bit more depth to each of them.But for the most part I thought this was very well done and I enjoyed it immensely. Also, aside from the rape and violence that I mentioned, there's a lot of animal abuse mentioned in this book - this one definitely requires a strong stomach....more",Notes are private!,0,32,1,"Jul 14, 2018","Jul 15, 2018","Sep 20, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25812109-the-female-of-the-species

This is the second book of his that I've read after Ransom and in both novels I've found his writing to be simply striking. An Imaginary Life is a daring, abstract fictionalization of the poet Ovid's years in exile, and while half of me wonders about the choice in using Ovid to tell this story which could theoretically be about any person, real or fictional, the other half of me recognizes that the unique thematic nods to Ovid are no less relevant for being as abstract as Malouf renders them. As Malouf himself says in his Afterword, ""My purpose was to make this glib fabulist of 'the changes' live out in reality what had been, in his previous existence, merely the occasion for dazzling literary display."" An Imaginary Life is unique and imaginative, told with a brilliant and succinct clarity. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jan 25, 2017","Jan 28, 2017","Sep 17, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6240.An_Imaginary_Life

In Katharine Beutner's retelling, after sacrificing herself for her husband, Alcestis falls in love with the queen of the underworld, Persephone. Sign. Me. Up. I was so excited to read this that I put aside several things that were higher up on my TBR list. And now, having read it, I'm extremely conflicted.This novel can be divided into two halves, right down the middle: the first half chronicles Alcestis' life, and the second half, her death. Unfortunately, it's rather a difficult format to pull off, when you have two radically different sections that comprise a single story. You spend the first half acquainting yourself with one specific setting and one set of characters, only to be transported to what feels like a different novel altogether. Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't. I don't think it worked here, especially because the two halves meet at the intersection of two genres: first historical fiction, then fantasy. I think Beutner's skill shines with the former, then fades in the latter.The element of this novel that I was most looking forward to was Alcestis' relationship with Persephone, but the part that most captivated me was actually Alcestis' early life. While I can imagine that this section may have come across as boring to some readers, as there wasn't a lot of action, I was transfixed with Beutner's rich prose and the beautifully imagined setting of the palace in Iolcus. In contrast, the setting of the underworld was (pardon the pun) completely lifeless. I struggled to conceptualize a lot of the details, which was disappointing; in the first half of this book I felt like I could smell the sea and feel the fabric of Alcestis' bedsheets. When we got to the underworld, what happened? Persephone as a character was alive and vivid, but not much else was. I often found my attention wandering, and it took much longer than it should have to finish this book after I hit the 50% mark.I did appreciate that there were a lot of refreshingly feminist aspects to this story: Beutner takes a figure who's known for her wifely devotion, and turns it into a story of a woman trapped by social constraints and expectations, who is, in a way, liberated once she reaches the underworld. It's a fascinating interpretation and I appreciate that Beutner decided to approach the story from this lens. For this reason alone I wanted so badly to be able to give this book 5 stars, as I was sure I was going to when I began reading it. Beutner's prose is visceral and gorgeous, and Alcestis is a stimulating and candid narrator. Unfortunately, the relationship between Alcestis and Persephone never felt as real or believable or even as interesting as it should have. The part of this story that should have most enchanted me ended up feeling like an awkward accessory to an otherwise refreshing and original story.3.5 stars. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Sep 18, 2016",Oct 2016,"Sep 15, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6952589-alcestis

For whatever reason, I tend I received a copy of this book from netgalley in exchange for an honest .I was really looking forward to this book. For whatever reason, I tend to love WWII fiction and I've had a morbid interest in Josef Mengele in particular since high school. Background for those who are unfamiliar: Mengele was a Nazi researcher who performed cruel and inhumane experiments on victims in Auschwitz, especially those with 'abnormal' genetic makeups, focusing mainly on identical twins. Mischling is a fictional account of Stasha and Pearl Zagorski, twelve year-old Polish twins who arrive at Auschwitz in 1944. It alternates between their perspectives, and is divided into two parts, first their time in the concentration camp, and then in the chaotic aftermath of its liberation.Konar's prose is... interesting. That's probably a kind way to put it. Mischling begins with the following lines: ""We were made, once. My twin, Pearl, and me. Or, to be precise, Pearl was formed and I split from her. She embossed herself on the womb; I copied her signature. For eight months we were afloat in amniotic snowfall, two rosy mittens resting on the lining of our mother. I couldn’t imagine anything grander than the womb we shared, but after the scaffolds of our brains were ivoried and our spleens were complete, Pearl wanted to see the world beyond us. And so, with newborn pluck, she spat herself out of our mother."" I honestly should have put the book down right there. But, now somewhat unenthusiastically, I persevered.Sadly, the prose continues on in the same manner: awkward, flowery, with weirdly out of place metaphors on every page. Her stronger passages were quintessential MFA-English-prose, and her weaker passages reminded me of a teenager's homework assignment for a creative writing class more than anything. Not only does the overly metaphorical prose obscure the subject matter, it also doesn't suit the twin narrators, who, again, are meant to be twelve year-old girls. ""Remember the floating world? We were less than babies then, and still, we knew how to love each other. We knew these times would come, we just didn't know how, much less why. We hd a lot of living to do before they came for us. That's why we decided to leave Mama early and start seeing the world as soon as we could."" What twelve year-old talks like this? The plot isn't the only thing that Konar's experimental prose manages to obscure. There's a lot about Pearl and Stasha that I still don't understand, that I can only guess the reader is meant to infer. We know that the twins divide up certain areas of life between them: Pearl cares for 'the sad, the good, the past,' and Stasha looks after 'the funny, the future, the bad.' I understand that this is meant to be a coping mechanism, but it's one that's very poorly explained. How did they arrive at this strange and abstract conceptual division? We don't know, because for the first half of this book it's frustratingly difficult to get inside the heads of our two protagonists.I did think it picked up at the halfway mark, in which we witness the death march away from Auschwitz and the chaos and brutality of this often overlooked period. At this point the prose begins to suit our now matured protagonists, and the few moments of actual emotion this book managed to elicit from me were in the last few pages. But it was just too little too late. For a story that should by the very nature of its subject matter be emotional and heart-wrenching, I was left rather unaffected. There were far too few moments of genuine tension, there wasn't a strong enough emotional connection to our protagonists, and too many details were omitted in favor of the cerebral and metaphorical. While I understand where this book and Konar's writing style may appeal to a certain reader, I just didn't think the Holocaust was an appropriate subject for what was essentially an elaborate literary exercise....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 23, 2016","Nov 05, 2016","Sep 13, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28664920-mischling

Nineteen year old Sean has been riding in the races for years, ever since his father died, and he's won four times on his stallion Corr. Puck has never ridden a capall uisce in her life, but she enters the races in a desperate attempt to save her family house from repossession. (Incidentally, I used to be a horse girl and my nickname used to be Puck, so all things considered, I immediately had a connection with this book.)I'd never read any Maggie Stiefvater before, but consider me hooked. This is one of the most atmospheric books I've ever read - with the dreary November setting it almost begs to be read in the fall. Stiefvater's prose is so immersive I could practically feel the wind whipping across my face when Sean and Puck were riding their horses across the Irish cliffs. One element of this story I loved was the fusion of Irish Catholicism with the fictional island of Thisby's own mythos - the way the two coexisted in this narrative was fascinating to me.These characters quickly and easily won me over. Puck instantly became a favorite (maybe it was the name thing at first, but she turned out to be pretty awesome), and her relationship with her two brothers was one of my favorite things about this story. Unfortunately I found Sean rather bland for the most part, but one element that I appreciated was the contrast between Sean and Puck's relationship with the capaill uisce. Both of them had parents who had been killed by the water horses, but where Puck was repulsed by them as a result, Sean formed a stronger connection with them. While the story is leading toward an inevitable romance between Sean and Puck, I was glad to see that the romance never really took center stage. It's more a book about belonging, and surviving, themes which are rendered subtly throughout the novel.This was at a 4.5 star level the whole time I was reading, and whether I rounded up or down in my  was always going to depend on the ending, which unfortunately left me a bit dissatisfied... Too many plot points were rushed and tied up neatly in too few pages, and for me, the emotional climax of the story happened with about 30% of the book left... While on some level I do think the conclusion was tonally appropriate, I guess I had been hoping for a bit more pain to see out the novel. But that probably says more about me than the book. I really enjoyed this, and look forward to reading more from Stiefvater....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Oct 27, 2017","Nov 02, 2017","Sep 09, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15827344-the-scorpio-races

I think N.K. Jemisin is a really brilliant writer, and it was one of the most original fantasy novels I'd ever read. I was expecting to love The Obelisk Gate even more, since I was going to be able to dive straight into it without the ""what the heck is going on"" feeling that plagued me for a large part of The Fifth Season until everything fell into place, but I think The Obelisk Gate fell victim to Second Book Syndrome. There was just so much filler and transition in this novel.Hardcore fantasy fans probably love the way science and magic play off each other in this series - but I am not a hardcore fantasy fan. For me, Jemisin's world building crosses the line from 'thorough' to 'punishingly intricate.' I'm awed by the complexity of this concept of orogeny that she's created - I just don't think she's always able to communicate the nuances to the reader in an accessible way. That was my main hangup with this book - I got tired of feeling like I was groping around in the dark. But again, take that with a grain of salt - seasoned fantasy readers are obviously the target audience for this series.But let's move on. Jemisin's characters are brilliant. I loved getting to spend more time with Essun and Alabaster, and enjoyed all the new characters who were introduced. Jemisin's writing, as always, is superb - she creates a tone that's tense and cynical and completely engrossing. The last 50 pages or so were epic - I just felt the book was rather stagnant until it got to this point. At any rate, I am looking forward to reading The Stone Sky and seeing how Jemisin concludes this series - I'm sure it'll be amazing....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Oct 03, 2017","Nov 16, 2017","Aug 29, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/26228034-the-obelisk-gate

Lady Cop Makes Trouble is a formidable attempt at continuing Constance Kopp's story, but for me, it just lacked the magic of Girl Waits with Gun.My main problem is that I think this actually would have been much better suited to a short story than a novel. The overarching plot - prisoner escapes, Constance tracks him down - is somehow stretched out to span 300 pages, in a narrative that gets bogged down by a lot of filler, which includes some cases in the background that end up being ultimately inconsequential.One element from Girl Waits with Gun that I was really hoping would be explored in more detail here is Constance's relationship with Fleurette (I won't say why, in case you haven't read Girl Waits with Gun, because you should). But Norma and Fleurette actually took a backseat for the most part of Lady Cop Makes Trouble. Sheriff Heath had a much bigger role than the two of them, and while I found his dynamic with Constance compelling, I would have liked to have seen much more of Constance's sisters. After all, that was my favorite thing about Girl Waits with Gun - over a year later, a lot of details of that plot escape me, but what really stands out when I think about that book is the fascinating relationship between Constance and her sisters. Lady Cop Makes Trouble is somehow more focused on plot than characters, even though its plot is weaker. It's not a good combination.As always, Amy Stewart's research is impeccable. I highly recommend reading her afterword about which elements of this book were real and which were fictionalized - it's fascinating reading.Bottom line - I didn't dislike this at all. But where I found Girl Waits with Gun to be fun, enthralling, and a real page-turner, I was always lukewarm about Lady Cop Makes Trouble - at some points I got engrossed in the narrative, but at others, I really had to push myself to keep reading. Maybe I wasn't in the right mood for it, maybe it's suffering from Second Book Syndrome, I don't know. I enjoyed it, but I didn't love it the way I'd wanted to. At any rate, I have the third installment, Miss Kopp's Midnight Confessions, from Netgalley, and I'm hoping this series continues (concludes? I'm not sure if Stewart intends to write more) on a stronger note....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Jul 22, 2017","Aug 05, 2017","Aug 05, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28114478-lady-cop-makes-trouble

Rather, they were a substitute for the deaths of others. Many thousands of deaths, many thousands of hearts' worth of blood.""I am in awe of this book. The Vegetarian, Kang's first novel to be translated into English, was one of the best and most thought-provoking books I read last year. Among of the numerous themes explored in those pages, Kang fearlessly tackled the question of violence - whether it's possible to live a life free of violence, or whether violence is an inherent part of the human experience. In Human Acts, Kang takes this same theme and amplifies it, chronicling pages upon pages of brutality that resulted from the Gwangju Uprising of 1980. At the center of this novel, which operates almost as a series of vignettes told from the POV of different characters, is a young boy, Dong-ho, who dies in the massacre. Human Acts spans the next thirty years, following characters who had known Dong-ho, some personally, some peripherally. You don't need to be an expert or even to know anything about Gwangju before starting this book - translator Deborah Smith gives a brief but succinct summary of the sociopolitical context surrounding the uprising in her Introduction (as well as a note on the difficulty in translating such an ambitious novel).While I thought The Vegetarian was a very intense read, Human Acts was much more so, for me. Kang doesn't sensationalize the events in these pages - the prose is succinct, sparing - and yet, this novel is anything but unfeeling. It's understated, told without melodrama, but it's all the more hard-hitting for that fact. Interestingly, the riots themselves aren't the focus of this novel - it's the quiet moments in between gunfire that Kang hones in on; the aftermath; the decay of rotting flesh of the bodies who have yet to be claimed. I felt a visceral ache while reading this book that I've only ever experienced with a few others in my life. After the chapter entitled ""The Prisoner"" I actually had to put the book down for a while - despite there being only 100 pages left, I wasn't able to force myself to finish this in one sitting. This is a book that demands reflection.Human Acts examines grief, guilt, brutality, injustice - all on a universal scale while still relating so inextricably to the events of Gwangju in 1980. It's masterfully written and uncompromising, raw and harrowing and more thematically relevant than ever. It's difficult to read at times due to the sensitive and graphic nature of the subject matter, but if you're able to commit to it, it's incredibly rewarding. Han Kang deftly explores the cruel side of humanity without burying the thread of hope that runs unbidden through this narrative. She's created something that's absolutely striking, both heartbreaking and beautiful. ...more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Jul 04, 2017","Jul 07, 2017","Jul 31, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30091914-human-acts

It follows the original story very closely and offers few surprises in terms of plot for those already familiar with the tale, but it endeavors and succeeds in giving Medea a narrative voice, allowing her to tell her own story. Christa Wolf's Medea, published 20 years earlier than Bright Air Black, is another feminist victory for this narrative, but interestingly, Wolf's and Vann's interpretations of Medea's character couldn't be more different. I love them both.Vann's is very straightforward. Though he at times renders her character sympathetic in a way that's deeply unsettling, his Medea is every bit as violent and vindictive as you'd expect. Wolf approaches the narrative from a different vantage point altogether. What if Corinth stood something to gain from Medea being painted as a monster? This is the question Wolf explores in this politically-driven retelling, narrated in a series of monologues by Medea, Jason, Glauce, and other individuals in the royal court at Corinth.The first thing that struck me as soon as I finished Medea's first chapter and started reading Jason's was how startlingly different their narrative voices were, which I think is such an incredible and impressive feat to accomplish in a book like this, which hinges on different characters' perspectives telling the same story. The other thing that struck me was the mastery and lyricism of Wolf's prose (translated beautifully from the German by John Cullen). It's possible they sense my unbelief, my lack of faith in anything. It's possible they can't bear that. When I ran over the field where the frenzied women had strewn your dismembered limbs, when I ran over that field, wailing in the deepening darkness, and gathered you up, poor, broken brother, piece by piece, bone by bone, that's when I stopped believing. How could we be meant to come back to this earth in a new form. Why should a dead man's limbs, scattered over a field, make that field fertile. Why should the gods, who demand from us continual proofs of gratitude and submission, let us die in order to send us back to earth again. Your death opened my eyes wide, Apsyrtus. For the first time I found solace in the fact that I don't have to live forever. And then I was able to let go of that belief born out of fear; to be more exact, it repelled me.I mean, that's stunning.What I love so much about mythological retellings; the reason I read the same stories over and over again written by different authors, is that each retelling offers something new, each author interacts with the original story in a different way. That's clear in the stark contrast between Medea and Bright Air Black, how one can render Medea as a victim and the other as a villain, while both staying, in their own way, true to the original myth. Wolf's retelling is also concerned with the greater political context of Corinth at the time of Medea and Jason's arrival - it reflects on how a community is willing to turn a blind eye to its leaders' faults, which is relevant not only in our current political climate, but also to Wolf's own life, when you consider that she grew up in the GDR. This is what I mean when I talk about the universality of myth, and how it belongs to everyone, and how individuals from different cultures and different backgrounds can all draw different conclusions from the same story, and why Euripides' and Seneca's versions of Medea remain so important thousands of years after they were written.

I don't get a sense of chemistry or compatibility or... anything, really? which is too bad. all that said, if you do like YA, you should definitely give this book a try. there's a lot to love: unique premise, vivid characters, lots of diversity, a strong focus on female friendships, etc. it wasn't for me, but that isn't entirely stacey lee's fault. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Aug 26, 2016","Aug 30, 2016","Jul 08, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22501055-under-a-painted-sky

I was also skeptical when this memoir quite literally opened with a paragraph about anal sex - I think I sighed and thought 'oh, this is going to be one of those books.' I feel like this is a category of book that both novels and memoirs can fall into: the ones that think sex is this shocking, scandalous thing, that want to prove to their reader how daring they are for graphically depicting such a 'taboo' subject, that mistake vulgarity for profundity and bravery, but which are written so awkwardly you just end up cringing.And I can see where for some readers, The Argonauts might end up being that kind of book. But Nelson won me over. There is a searing honesty to her prose that's an undeniable force in this memoir, and it's hard to put it down once it sucks you in. Nelson's sentence construction is striking, and her observations on love and sexuality are all poignant. While Nelson's perspectives are often heavily rooted in academia, the personal, emotional slant never fades. This is also one of the most candid, unapologetic memoirs I think I've ever read - though it isn't self-deprecating in tone, Nelson never spares herself from her own commentary and conclusions. It's just refreshingly human.I wouldn't dream of attempting to level this against The Argonauts as any kind of objective criticism, but I still have to mention it to explain why I dropped the 5th star from my rating: I'm tired of motherhood books. It's a subject that doesn't particularly intrigue me to begin with, and I feel like I've been reading quite a few novels and memoirs lately that reflect on motherhood. I'm just tired of it. The parts of The Argonauts that focused on Nelson's pregnancy were the least interesting to me, and I kept wishing that the focus would stay on her relationship with Harry. But that's entirely a personal preference, and I fully intend to check out Nelson's other works in the near future....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"May 23, 2018","Jun 06, 2018","May 17, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/22929741-the-argonauts

unfortunately, a lot.atwood's characterization of helen as the shallow and duplicitous narcissist was both lazy and downright shocking. for those unfamiliar with the original story: helen is taken by paris against her will; she is forced to live in troy for ten years as her husband and brother-in-law wage the war to win her back. she is (sadly, unfairly!) self-deprecating, she laments her role in the bloodshed. “I wish that on that day my mother bore me/ some evil wind had come, carried me away,/ and swept me off, up into the mountains,/ or into waves of the tumbling, crashing sea,/ then I would have died before this happened.” (iliad, book iv) ah, yes, what heartless vanity.to clarify my intent in drawing from the iliad in this , it's not the fact that atwood chooses to deviate from homer's text that alarms me as much as the fact that this is the deviation she chooses to make. in a world already riddled with misogyny and a host of female characters devoid of agency, atwood chooses to demonize this virtually blameless character, condemning her in order to exonerate penelope for her modesty. it’s insulting and it’s lazy.of course, it’s not just helen’s characterization in the penelopiad that concerns me. this insidious enmity of female characters also extends to anticlea, eurycleia, clytemnestra; in short, the majority of the women that comprise this story. i’m not sure what exactly atwood was trying to achieve in turning the reader against all of these mythological women, but i do know that this story could have been told much more effectively without this distasteful element. this struck me as exceptionally shocking, coming from a writer known primarily for her feminism. who exactly are we left to root for? well, aside from our narrator penelope, there’s odysseus. compelling, nuanced, intriguing odysseus, a character given just about as much respect in atwood’s penelopiad as he has been given in literature throughout the centuries. if only atwood’s female characters had been granted this much courtesy. but let’s move on. narratively, the penelopiad comes up short. in the book’s introduction, atwood confesses to be intrigued by the twelve maids who are hung at the end of the odyssey and scarcely mentioned outside this tragic act. in this novel, penelope’s first person narrative chapters are interspersed with various sorts of poetry, representing the maids as a sort of greek chorus. atwood’s primary interest in the maids becomes apparent toward the end of the novel, when penelope and her narrative begin to fade into the background. after spending two hundred pages with penelope, we’re left thinking, what exactly was the point? what exactly did we learn about penelope that we didn’t already know? i do think atwood succeeds in giving voice to these maids, who are shown in the penelopiad to be innocent victims rather than the treacherous figures odysseus thought them to be. but ultimately, it doesn’t feel like enough. the maids’ narrative and penelope’s don’t manage to dovetail in a satisfying way; instead the ending feels abrupt and rather underwhelming.now, the good. atwood’s skill as a writer shines in both her prose and poetry in the penelopiad. it’s a short book, and one that you want to devour in one sitting. it’s told from the point of view of penelope who’s lived in the underworld for several thousand years, watching as various iterations of her story are told throughout history. the intersection of the past and the present is an intriguing element, and while penelope’s vocabulary occasionally feels too current, that can be forgiven as it’s interesting to see the way a figure who lived thousands of years ago interacts with modernity.for the prose alone i mostly enjoyed reading this, though i’m left feeling underwhelmed and dissatisfied. what exactly is the point in giving a narrative voice to penelope and to absolve the maids of their supposed treachery, only to turn around and steal the voices of helen, of eurycleia? the penelopiad doesn’t feel like much of a victory. and it’s a shame, because there is so much to love here - the fascinating premise, the intriguing narrative structure, the lucid writing style. i wanted to love this, but unfortunately, there's just too much about it that rubbed me the wrong way. this is only the third atwood novel that i've read, after enjoying the blind assassin well enough and being thoroughly frustrated by the handmaid's tale. i want to love her the way most of my feminist friends seem to, so i'll keep at it. maybe i just haven't found the right atwood book yet. i was fully prepared for the penelopiad to be it, but i guess i'll have to keep looking. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Jul 20, 2016","Jul 23, 2016","Apr 27, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17645.The_Penelopiad

But make no mistake: this book is hard. Renault's prose is gorgeous but dense; pages upon pages upon pages are devoted to military strategy; characters appear without proper introduction because of a certain amount of knowledge already expected from the reader; the third-person omniscient narration is at times difficult to follow. Verbose and academic, this isn't exactly one to take to the beach this summer.But I loved it.""He stood between death and life as between night and morning, and thought with a soaring rapture, ‘I am not afraid’.""This book is beautiful. Immersive, lyrical, and intelligent, Renault gives us a truly credible window into the world of Ancient Greece, and into the life of Alexander in particular.Fire from Heaven is about Alexander the Great before he was Alexander the Great - when he was just Alexander, son of Philip II and Olympias, tenuous heir to the Macedonian throne. Alexander only lived for 32 years, from 356 - 323 BCE, but in that time, became one of the most accomplished military strategists in history, creating one of the largest empires in the ancient world, that extended into Egypt as well as Asia. Even during his lifetime, Alexander's character became almost mythologized. No wonder countless books - fiction and nonfiction - have been written in an attempt to understand him, to humanize this man who was the cynosure of all of Greece, who seems too legendary to have ever been mortal.But Mary Renault does just that. There are no first-hand accounts of Alexander's early life, as Renault tells us in her afterward, and this book is an attempt at recreating this period of Alexander's life, drawing on the few sources that do exist. Raised by two parents who openly disdain one another - haughty, manipulative Olympias, and proud, cruel Philip - much of Alexander's childhood is characterized by this tension. Alexander, the boy we first meet and the man he becomes, is kind, bright, forgiving; but he's also impulsive and stubborn; ambitious but without a clear path leadership, as the question of his birthright and Philip's chosen successor dogs him through adolescence. In short, though the Alexander that Renault creates is in many ways a product of her imagination, he's also clearly been derived from intensive research; his fictionalized personality dovetailing with the historical records of his character.Renault also famously, controversially, depicts the relationship between Alexander and Hephaistion to be a romantic one. While the romance is just about as explicit as you would expect from a novel written in 1969 (i.e., not very), it's an undeniable force to this story, which adds yet another compelling layer to this novel already so rich in detail.Fire from Heaven is not for the casual reader. It's a good introduction to Alexander the Great... if you truly want to learn about Alexander the Great. While it is historical fiction, this book is decidedly strong on the history and light on the fiction. Renault's research is thorough, and undoubtedly will not be of interest to readers hoping for a fast-paced story. There actually isn't much action to be found here, despite the numerous battles recounted. This is a sort of quiet historical reimagining, that in some ways serves as an elaborate preface to the latter two novels in Renault's Alexander series - The Persian Boy and Funeral Games, both of which I look forward to reading. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Feb 10, 2017","Apr 30, 2017","Apr 19, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/67697.Fire_from_Heaven

I’m currently on a French hiatus in order to catch up with some of my other reading, but I intend to pick up where I left off in early 2022.Each book in this series follows a different detective on the (entirely fictional) Dublin Murder Squad, and the series begins with Rob Ryan, who has memory loss around a traumatic event from his childhood, where he went out with his two best friends in the woods, and was the only one to come home. Twenty years later, Rob’s friends have never been found, and he’s working as a detective (a career choice that he insists is entirely unrelated), currently on a case involving a dead teenage girl who was found in the same Dublin suburb where Rob grew up.The thing I’ve heard praised about French the most often is her writing, and I wasn’t disappointed. It’s difficult to find thrillers that hit that sweet spot of propulsive/entertaining while actually displaying genuine literary skill, and I couldn’t be happier with how French manages to walk that fine line. Her mysteries are well-crafted and her books have that can’t-put-it-down factor, but the thing that really stands out about them is her brilliant character work and her deft hand at depicting the dark, fragile corners of human nature.I only had two complaints while I was reading this, the first of which actually resolved itself—for a while, I found the depiction of Rob and Cassie’s friendship a bit tiresome; I felt like French would often go the extra mile to hammer the reader over the head with how special the bond between them was… but then by the end of the book I was stupidly invested in their relationship so I suppose Tana knew what she was doing there. The other thing is that French has this one habit that bothers me, where her narrators often turn to the reader and say something along the lines of “I know what you’re thinking”/”I know you must be wondering”/”I know how this sounds,” etc, and I find that whatever they’re next about to say rarely lines up with what I am actually thinking, leaving me with the vague sensation that they’re talking to someone over my shoulder rather than me. This is a minor complaint in the grand scheme of things but it did irritate me often enough to mention.Anyway, I thought this book was fantastic, and while each book in this series can absolutely be read as a standalone, if you’re interested in getting into Tana French I do think this is a really good place to start. Without getting into spoilers, there’s a certain detail about the ending, about the way this book resolves itself, that I know a lot of people find objectionable to the point of being a dealbreaker. I actually knew this detail ahead of time, so I actually wasn’t fazed by it—but I like to think that if I hadn’t known, I’m not the sort of reader who would be too bothered by something like that. Anyway, just a warning that you may not find this book as satisfactory as you hoped—but I still really think it’s worth reading in spite of that....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,Nov 2021,"Nov 07, 2021","Apr 05, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2459785.In_the_Woods

The Color Purple is an epistolary novel that follows the relationship between two sisters who are torn apart early in life, but who nevertheless spend a lifetime trying to communicate with one another. The protagonist Celie is married off to an abusive husband, while her sister Nettie becomes a missionary in Africa. Celie's husband, known only as Mr. ____, hides the letters that Nettie writes to Celie, who believes for years that her sister is dead. Robbed of contact with the only person who ever loved her, Celie contents herself by writing a series of letters that she addresses 'Dear God'.Celie's voice is arguably the strongest element of this novel; Walker captures the voice of a poor, uneducated woman living in the American south in the 1900s with a vibrant authenticity. Nettie's voice is similarly convincing, though distinct; it's filled with a similar dialect but more polished and educated - this book is a case study in how to strengthen characterization through voice. The relationship between these two sisters is the heart and soul of The Color Purple, though Celie's relationship with God and its different manifestations over time provides the novel with one of its most salient themes that develops beautifully over time. The novel's title comes from an exchange where Celie's lover challenges Celie's conception of God as a larger-than-life white man; she tells Celie that she doesn't think of God as a person, but as an invisible force that's inside all of us, and then remarks “I think it pisses God off if you walk by the color purple in a field somewhere and don't notice it. People think pleasing God is all God cares about. But any fool living in the world can see it always trying to please us back.”So while this book is relentlessly brutal, documenting rape and abuse and pervasive racism, there's also a thread of hope that runs through it, and it's ultimately an unexpectedly empowering tale. This book is every bit as beautiful as it is disturbing. One last note: I don't want to derail this  too drastically with a lengthy meditation on whether it's possible to separate art from the artist, but suffice to say that being aware of Alice Walker's well-documented antisemitism did impact my reading experience somewhat, and I don't think I'll be able to call this as all-time favorite. But still, it would be wrong to deny this book of its merits and cultural impact. I can't judge anyone else for deciding not to pick this up out of a discomfort with Walker's personal beliefs, but if you're on the fence, I do think it's well worth reading....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Feb 20, 2019","Feb 22, 2019","Feb 04, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/26113439-the-color-purple

This is a bildungsroman about navigating adolescence, which captures with aplomb how absurd and hypocritical and draining the whole experience is. But it's also a novel filled to the brim with hope and humor, told with honesty and vulnerability. I was immediately endeared to thoughtful and sensitive Jason, who hides the fact that he writes poetry from his family and classmates in order to avoid social isolation. Mitchell details the ins and outs of unspoken social norms which govern the male adolescent life with admirable precision: you're only allowed to call someone by their first name if they're one of the popular kids, you can't be seen in public with your parents unless it happens to be an event where everyone else is out with their parents too, if you start dancing too soon at a school dance you're a loser but if you don't join it at just the right time you're lame - and the absurdity here lies in just how much sense it all makes. I was instantly transported back to high school and the complex set of social dynamics which at the time felt like life or death, but which looking back on now just seem sort of silly. The stakes in this book constantly feel high, but not melodramatically so. There's a self-awareness that permeates the narrative, saying, hey, I know this is ridiculous, but it's also survival.Mitchell's approach to this narrative is fragmentary rather than cohesive, each chapter representing a single episode from each month of the year. Not all of these episodes are centered around Big Life Events, either. Sometimes it's the little things that end up defining us the most, and that's what Mitchell hones in on. Each chapter reads like a short story, but it all comes together in the end; you gradually realize how and why each of these incidents shaped Jason so profoundly, and how they tie in to the bigger things going on in his life at the time (his parents' fragile marriage, the Falklands War and the death of a local boy overseas, the political climate of England under Thatcher's leadership). There's so much packed into this book, my brain is still reeling from it all. Black Swan Green tackles the fragility of human connections; the difficulty of being true to oneself while also trying to fit in; the futility of war; the hypocrisy of the way some parents interact with their teenaged children; the utter powerlessness that comes with being young; knowing on some level that youth is transient but not really believing it. Ironically, though this book is told from the point of view of a teenage boy, I think I got more out of it reading it as an adult than I would have reading it when I was that age. That isn't to say that it's inaccessible to teenagers or that younger readers would miss the thematic richness. But I think it helped that I'm removed enough from that period in my life that this story doesn't feel quite as raw to me as it does to Jason.At any rate, this was an unexpectedly moving book, told on one level with urgency and on another with a nostalgic reflection. The result is original and poignant and I loved it. And to the person who lent it to me: sorry it took me three years....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,"Apr 16, 2017","May 21, 2017","Nov 15, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/548474.Black_Swan_Green

But then we got to the end, which... oh boy.  It's hard to talk about without spoiling, but, in essence - this book starts to lead toward an inexorable conclusion, and it does arrive there, so that isn't the issue.  The issue is how it unfolds, which... I personally found more offensive than I can even adequately describe, lol.  Ok, fine, spoiler: it involves a rape fetish that we got to experience through two (2) different perspectives in excruciating detail.  To say this served no purpose, was tonally incongruous, and bastardized Masako's character - would all be an understatement. I'm glad I finally read this as it's been sitting on my shelf for years, but it also felt like a shame that I decided to pick it up for Women in Translation Month (I'm ing it rather belatedly) when it ended on a note that I found to be so fundamentally antifeminist it kind of cancelled out the brilliant character work that had come before....more",Notes are private!,2,30,1,"Aug 21, 2020","Aug 31, 2020","Nov 02, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/764644.Out

But it's quite the contrary - I'm happy to report that this was wonderful. It's just that I was in the mood to read this and then I wasn't and then I was again, and that's that mystery solved. This was my first Thomas Hardy, and I chose it because I'd already seen the Carey Mulligan film and fell very much in love with the elaborate soap opera that is Bathsheba Everdene's life. Sorry if this is slanderous, but the frankly elaborate ways in which she and Oak are pushed together and pulled apart throughout this book are something straight out of EastEnders, and it was delightful.But even though I already knew the story, I enjoyed watching it all unfold again. I also found Bathsheba to be one of the most complex heroines from any classic novel I've read, and her thoroughly compelling journey for peace and love as she came to better understand herself was just a constant source of joy to read. It goes without saying that this male-authored work from 1874 is not a Feminist Novel, but the sheer compassion with which Bathsheba's character arc is crafted was something of a surprise to me, in a good way. I certainly wasn't expecting lines like this:""It is difficult for a woman to define her feelings in language which is chiefly made by men to express theirs.""Or this:""'But a husband–''Well!''Why, he'd always be there, as you say; whenever I looked up, there he'd be.''Of course he would – I, that is.''Well, what I mean is that I shouldn't mind being a bride at a wedding, if I could be one without having a husband. But since a woman can't show off in that way by herself, I shan't marry – at least yet.'""(That may be the single most iconic exchange I've ever read.)I occasionally found Hardy's writing a bit overwrought, but the dialogue was lively and the pastoral setting was brought to life spectacularly. Despite the fact that this is a book filled with vibrant characters and dramatic plot twists, it's ultimately rather slow-paced, so I don't really regret the (excessively) languid pace at which I read it. I'm looking forward to reading more of Hardy, probably Tess of the D'Urbervilles or Jude the Obscure next....more",Notes are private!,0,57,1,"Jun 30, 2018","Oct 30, 2018","Nov 02, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25109681-far-from-the-madding-crowd

I genuinely don't understand what happened here. the story was told by three first-person narrators, none of whom seemed to have individual voices. It was commonplace for me while reading this book to have to flip back to the beginning of the chapter to remind myself whose section I was currently reading. it was all a giant blur, held together by shoddy prose.in regards to the story itself, China Dolls again proved to be a massive disappointment. I never for one second believed the friendship between the three main characters, all of whom were so caught up in their own affairs and ambitions that they seemed to genuinely have no concern for or understanding of the two other girls who were supposed to be their best friends. they were three of the most unlikable characters I've ever encountered - even my early pick for a favorite, Grace, started to fail me about halfway through - and by the end I was just relieved to be rid of these characters and their petty drama. (it's impressive that a story set against the backdrop of World War II managed to come across as so vapid. while some of the characters suffered real horrors, these weren't granted the depth they deserved by the narrative.)ultimately, I don't understand the point of this book. in a sentence: it was about three girls who latched onto one another for reasons never fully explored, despite seeming to actively dislike each other more often than not. sorry for the critical , but I really expected more from Lisa See. I don't mean that I wanted her to tell a different story, exactly - I just expected higher quality prose, more three-dimensional characters, and at least a semblance of emotional resonance....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Nov 24, 2014","Nov 24, 2014",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18404427-china-dolls

First off, SomerseI feel like I've been reading this book for so long that I can't even think of words to adequately summarize my experience with it. First off, Somerset Maugham has a gift with words that I envy with my entire heart and soul. He is one of the best writers I have ever encountered and about twenty pages into this ~700 page book I knew that it was going on my list of favorites. There were flaws, and I could list them all, but in ten years when I think back on this book, those aren't going to be at the front of my mind. What I'm going to remember is the seamless way in which Somerset Maugham divines the tale of Philip Carey and his search for life's objective truth, constantly compromising his own values and desires to be at the mercy of his passions and suffering, which he chooses to follow as his path to self-discovery. Somerset Maugham at times lauds and at times criticizes the inconsistencies and weaknesses of human nature in a way which so completely encompasses everything real and beautiful and painful about the human experience.Basically, this book was incredible. Please read it, or at least something by W. Somerset Maugham at some point.

At times charming and at times horrifying, this novel has almost a surrealistic, mystical quality to its permeating realism. On the back of the book, there was a quote from some , which I believe said something like ""a tribute to the resilience of the human spirit"" - and one need not look past that sentiment to find a better description of this novel.

Taking this into consideration, I find it remarkable that I had to painstakingly drag my eyes across every page of this mess of a novel. In short: I didn't care.

However, Cobain Unseen is not simply another Kurt Cobain biography (author Charles Cross saves that one for his original Cobain book ""Heavier Than Heaven""). This is what the author calls a ""supplement"" to his other work - an artistic portfolio of Kurt's life complete with Polaroid pictures, journal entries, and an audio CD. In a way, it almost feels uncomfortably intrusive, listening to a recording of Kurt reading from his journal. But in another way, it's completely awe-inspiring to have access to this type of perspective on Kurt's life. A true Nirvana fan won't learn anything from this book in terms of facts that they didn't know before, but this book provides a unique experience which invites the reader to follow Kurt's life journey as an artist and songwriter. Well-written and respectful, Cross masterfully fuses objectivity with intimacy as he tells Kurt's story.
