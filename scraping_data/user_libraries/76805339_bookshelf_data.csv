Both of those books were pretty packed with sex and violence, so when I picked I loved A Brief History of Seven Killings and The Book of Night Women. Both of those books were pretty packed with sex and violence, so when I picked up Black Leopard Red Wolf, I expected much of the same. I have a pretty strong stomach--I believe in literature and in all forms of art, sometimes it's necessary to make people a little uncomfortable for the sake of bringing the realest version of the work to life. I found that to be the case in both A Brief History of Seven Killings and The Book of Night Women. In Black Leopard Red Wolf, I found the sex and violence (and quite frequently violent sex) pretty excessive and not necessarily necessary to build the world/narrative/characters. A weak stomach might have a difficult time powering through this 620 page work of art.They would be missing out.In spite of the ""extras"", Marlon James remains is an incredibly talented writer. He is a master of voice and dialogue and in Black Leopard Red Wolf his protagonist, Tracker, is so complicated, so flawed and human, and on this expansive journey he continuously evolves. The secondary characters read as real people and if you're willing to stomach the sludge of this world, you'll grow fond of many of these people, absolutely loathe others, and most importantly you'll care about the plight of the hero.Looking forward to the next installment!...more",Notes are private!,0,8,2,"Jun 20, 2022Jan 06, 2021","Jul 03, 2022Feb 04, 2021","Sep 19, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40524312-black-leopard-red-wolf
