Parts are truly compelling: Worth paints the East End of London of the 1950s vividly, describing a variety of living What an odd, contradictory book. Parts are truly compelling: Worth paints the East End of London of the 1950s vividly, describing a variety of living conditions and people with an evocative eye for detail. She makes the work of a '50s midwife sound fascinating, brutally hard, and often rewarding, and she brings you fully in to her world. As her midwife training took place at a convent, she also lets the reader in to the nuns' lives, and the sisters are some of the most fully realized characters, with sympathetic backstories, idiosyncrasies, and surprising senses of humor. But then there are parts that just feel fake, or created to push an agenda -- often one that feels distasteful. Worth is admirably not anti-sex, and is very enthusiastically pro offering affordable housing and services to the poor; she is also sympathetic toward sex workers. However, one of the worst -- and longest running -- pieces in the book is the story of the ""turning out"" of a young Irish girl. Worth deliberately gives the girl's seducer an ethnic sounding name, and then describes the abuses inflicted against her in highly unpleasant as well as cliched and frankly faux detail. She also focuses three (3!) chapters on the increase in mixed race children born in the UK in the 1950s, but bizarrely from an angle that presents all circumstances of this as white women who cheat on their white husbands with Black men, and the drama that causes. Weird choice, Jennifer!I also could have done without the ultimate framing of midwifery (avec nuns) being behind Worth's call to God. It's not overbearing in the narrative, but it's also still just Not For Me.I do think Worth's evocation of the period and the very specific place make this a worthwhile (pun unintended) read, just with some caveats. And I am curious enough to check out the TV series now -- in hopes it improves upon some of the book's faults....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Mar 08, 2024","Mar 08, 2024","Mar 09, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15810860-call-the-midwife

I know King was stuck and then had this ""revelation"" about the bomb, but while it does kickstart the plot again, it doesn't really make a lot of sense regarding what he'd thus far set up. Nick's story in particular just cuts off entirely. (And I forget if this is a problem in the actual book too, but in these graphic adaptions, it also creates a continuity error: in the nasty and unnecessary scene with Julie, they say Nick will have to deal with her again but...he dead. It didn't happen.) Annoying!But not as annoying as how badly all the women are written in this. Maybe Aguirre-Sacasa & Co. couldn't actually fix that, but this adaptation could have made the cast less white.

We do, I guess, learn that Jen views herself as the villain in hers and Andy's breakup, in a way that feels semi-endorsed by the author -- a bizarre take on everything we've just seen for several hundred pages.--What's the deal with Morris and his outlandish political beliefs? Is he really meant to be a pro-BREXIT, Julian Assange fanboy who we're nevertheless meant to find charming? Who predicts COVID?

It's discovered that the U-Boat is carrying Zyklon B and the Doctor notes it must be ""heading to a concentration camp."" (Why would a U-Boat be transporting this? Why near Dover?) At this point I paused and was like, ""yikes, not something I want evoked by my escapist sci-fi media, why would they even...oh no.""Because I had guessed, correctly, that they were going to use the Zyklon B to kill the aliens.Yup.The aliens who, it's later revealed, are the last of their kind, because they are victims of previous genocides, but they need to consume the blood of host species to survive and breed, so...This story provides a direct connection between Jewish victims of the Holocaust and these blood-drinking aliens (through the specific evocation of Zyklon B, the substance used in Nazi gas chambers) and then proceeds to wipe them out. The Doctor is sad, but still helps.(Side note: the Doctor is also the one who insists on bringing the injured Nazi back to the English base; this directly leads to him infecting 30 or so more people there and their deaths. If he'd just let the Nazi die it seems the alien problem might have resolved itself, so all the English casualties are also sort of his fault?

It's a horror-tinged fantasy-mystery set in Jazz Age New York, with a diverse cast of characters whose plotlines intersect on the way to stopping a puritanical death cult. Great! In theory! But I just could not sink into it. First and foremost, I think, because there was just something about it that felt inherently faux to me: so much exaggerated '20s slang. Also, there's just an endless litany of characters and POV shifts, so you never really feel like you get to settle down with anybody. The interactions and relationships I kept hoping would happen/slowly form for the most part simply didn't.The character we do spend the most time with is Evie, who unfortunately commits the cardinal sin of characters for me -- not, as some would think, being selfish or difficult or ""unrelatable,"" but being really annoying. This book is 600 pages long and I'm not sure she evolves at all. Also, it stretches credulity to an extreme degree that she'd be allowed to visit crime scenes and investigate these murders in the first place. (The cop character in this book sucks also, not in a way that appears to be commentary, just in that he doesn't make any sense.)Finally -- remember all those characters whose paths were going to converge? Well, they don't! I feel like a good 30-40% of this book or more is just set up for the rest of the series. Again, this novel is almost 600 pages and it cliffhangs more plot threads than it resolves. And not in an intriguing way: in a way that suggests you, the reader, has just had their wheels spun for most of the book. Argh! I did not enjoy this experience! Bray clearly has a lot of ideas, some of them interesting, but I find this a baffling and deeply unappealing way to structure a piece of writing.

This one lured me back in by being about not one but two of my favorite stupid things, time travel and amnesia. But I made a mistake.I did not instantly realize I had made a mistake. The opening is pretty good, made tense and strange by being from the POV of Joe, who comes to awareness on a train pulling into London from Glasgow -- a London where all the signs are in French. He only has dim, confused memories that don't match reality and he makes for a good vessel through which to experience this altered world.However, the worldbuilding soon started to irk me. How does France winning the Napoleonic Wars lead to mass enslavement (of everyone from the Chinese to the Welsh) in 1903? Pulley doesn't dwell. The plot stone-skips ahead -- except for when it draaaaags (so many badly described naval battles). Worse, Pulley eventually starts madly skipping through POVs too, and the tension and interest just drains out of the novel. There are some interesting time travel ideas in here -- the letters from Madeline (a character done massive disservice by the narrative, like almost all the female characters) being a highlight and an unusual application of the trope. But the romance is tepid -- Pulley is another overwhelmingly cold writer; do people think this makes them seem sophisticated? The character development is negligible, the twists immediately identifiable, and the ending so annoying and cheap I nearly bit through my lip.

I also initially gave it four stars, but it has not sat particularly well with me so it's dropping down one. Essentially: this is an old-school adventure in the style of Treasure Island, but with zeppelins and dragons and one (1) female character. It's fine, and maybe especially fine if you are a twelve-year-old boy, but I don't think Oppel really adds much to the genre with his updates, and in fact, Stevenson makes more interesting character choices, in my mind, than Oppel does; in fact, Oppel seems to default to (view spoiler)[killing characters off rather than continuing to develop them or leaving things open to ambiguity (hide spoiler)].

But not as shocked as I was tThe Secret of NIMH was one of my favorite movies as a kid, so I'm sort of shocked that I never read the book before now. But not as shocked as I was to discover how different this is -- the novel, unlike the film, has no fantasy elements at all (if you discount talking animals, which in this context, I do). Props to Don Bluth and cowriters for the strange but magnificent adaption, which has one of the most memorable and frightening climaxes of any film -- children's or otherwise -- that I can recall. And this is not in the book! The filmmakers were wise to shift the conflict with Jenner to the present, and the emotional core of the climax to Mrs. Frisby and her children, rather than the rats. Also, props to the way the film covers the rats' backstory so efficiently and with such memorable imagery -- spiraling DNA! Was this the first time I ever encountered that? -- when in the novel it takes chapters. Though of course, in fairness to O'Brien, that is the advantage of a visual medium over a written one.This has turned into a  of the film much more than of the book, but I can't divorce them in my mind, and my intense fondness for the former certainly colored my opinion of the latter. I think I would have found this inventive but average were Bluth's visuals not imprinted so firmly in my brain. But why quibble over the boost?Some random other thoughts:--I had forgotten that our heroic mouse protagonist isn't called Mrs. Frisby in the film, but Mrs. Brisby. Apparently this is because the makers of frisbees threatened to sue the filmmakers for possible copyright infringement. Wow. Fuck off, Big Frisbee.--I recalled the heroic rat Justin being An Uncomfortably Sexy Animated Animal, a la the Robin Hood foxes, and figured this was because Bluth seems to like to include a certain type of man who is That Way (see also Dimitri in Anastasia, a far inferior film -- don't @ me, Anastasia girlies!). But in fact, O'Brien also takes the time to pause the narrative to let readers know that Justin is one hot rat. No one is allowed to leave this story without understanding what a sexy rat Justin is, okay?--The Jerry Goldsmith score to the film is so good that just a few notes of the theme reduced me to a blubbering mess when I rewatched tonight. Suddenly I was five years old again, feeling how deeply this story gripped me. --It's possible that we as a society forgot how to make good children's movies when we stopped making them incredibly terrifying/traumatizing.

It does take about 100 pages to kick off, but then it goes. The setting is vivid, and the commentary on the evils of the Inquisition unsubtle in just the right way. Bardugo makes you feel the claustrophobic terror of Luiza's impossible position--poor, a woman, a Jew who must keep her identity secret at all costs--but also the binds placed on other characters in a variety of different circumstances. Luiza and Guillén are a fairly typical Bardugo pairing, but not in a bad way; that's kind of what we're here for. bri compared their dynamic to Howl and Sophie (among other things), but to me it feels like she decided to rewrite Alina and the Darkling, only better. I am extremely cool with that.It's true that one some level I'd hoped to be completely swept away by this novel, and in all honesty I wasn't: I could feel its various plot points coming too steadily, like hoofbeats, to really be surprised or deeply moved. But I'd still rather have a story that does what one would expect than that throws in nonsensical twists. This is solidly good, meaningful, and feels much more adult than the Alex Stern series.

And they just had to collaborate on a profitable book about it to share their story.2) Religious terror. Demons are real (and, to judge from this book, capable of kicking your average Catholic priest's ass -- the Exorcist he ain't), and you should be very, very afraid of them -- not to mention their myriad human servants who are no doubt right this minute performing rituals in dark basements. Maybe even utilizing red paint. Hello, Satanic Panic!Both of these goals are, what's the word, gross. Especially when you consider that to accomplish them, everyone involved in this book willingly exploited a real tragedy involving the deaths of six people. Tacky!Also the book is pretty boring.

Full of terrible people being terrible, gross period-typical attitudes, more eating disorders than you can swallow, and also a lot of annoying POV-hopping. That said -- and despite the fact that this is somehow 900 pages long -- I was pretty consistently captivated. The writing is breezy, and Cooper takes more care with character development than I would have thought. Plus the show jumping scenes are genuinely exciting -- I got so into it I ended up watching some competition highlights on YouTube.The one thing that would prevent me from recommending this book as pure trash fun to anyone in the mood is that, about 3/4ths of the way through, there's a gang rape scene. Neither the author nor the characters seem to fully recognize it as such -- it's painted as bad, but not that bad. To modern/my sensibilities, it was shocking and horrific, and I had to take an extended break afterward. Yet, the characters' (non)reactions unfortunately do feel in keeping with the way they've been presented in the previous 600 or so pages.

Folman and Polonsky are particularly deft at capturing the force of Anne's imagination.

I think this was in the box because I had tried previously to get through it and failed. Now, I adore Sayers' Lord Peter Wimsey mysteries, so no one is more disappointed than me. But these stories simply do not do for me what the (better) novels do. I think this is because the focus of the novels is on character; here, they are on the mysteries themselves, and Sayers has a tendency to try to be too clever (with timings, crossword clues, outdated technology, evil twins, etc.). Some of these tales have an evocative gothic atmosphere, which is kind of fun, but since Peter just floats in and out of the narratives, there's rarely any emotional impact. And like, the ramifications for the overall canon: he pretended to be dead for two years??? Literally where did he find the time?Also I have to say, Sayers is usually better than Christie in terms of letting her (generously: period typical) unpleasant views show like a sloppy slip, but there's an unusual amount of antisemitism in these pages, and some shocking uses of the n-word.

I am now even more impressed by what a good job was done with that adaptation, which enriches not only the characters but also the plot, adding significantly more drama (and significantly reducing the racism!). I mean, I suspect that all adaptations of this book are, shall we say, loose -- did you know that no hot air balloon appears in the novel? Some stories take on lives of their own once they're out in the world, and this is very much one of them.Possibly because, while Verne's idea is great, his execution is rather thin. His novel is still a fun adventure and a quick read, but his Fogg is an emotionless cipher -- I believe this is meant to be Verne's parody of an Englishmen -- and almost every problem he and Passepartout encounter is solved via money. Verne still accomplishes some good gags -- I'll admit I laughed at the Mormon missionary on the train -- but there's not a ton here.

I enjoyed the early chapters of Sam realizing he was back in 1869 and falling in with the Cincinnati Red Stockings, baseball's first pro team, but after that things get convoluted -- not to mention sillier and sillier. Mark Twain appears, becomes Sam's bestie (Sam is named after him so...the dream I guess), and then vanishes from the narrative. There's a Fenian plot involving buried treasure and ghosts and murder, which is too many things (I can accept time travel, but maybe not time travel and ghosts. And psychics!). Sam courts a lady, his supposed true love, then abandons her for plot reasons that make no sense. He makes terrible investments. He befriends a Black cyclist so Brock can vaguely be like, ""oh yeah, 1869 was cool but racist I guess"" and then the narrative drops this character even more abruptly than Mr. Twain. And throughout Sam just sort of stinks! His entitled 1989 white guy POV is all over everything and not necessarily better than the 1869 dudes, who (somewhat) have the excuse of being from 1869. (""Should I try to warn Custer?"" he thinks. NO.) He treats the past like a game he can win, while also only very rarely remembering to care about the daughters he left behind in 1989. I'm sorry, but if you're going to abandon your family to pursue your dreams, you have to do it in a sympathetic gay way, à la Stede Bonnet.And you, Sam Fowler, are no Stede Bonnet....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 18, 2023","Aug 26, 2023","Aug 26, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3248563-if-i-never-get-back

I haven't read Orwell since I ragequit Down and Out in Paris and London c. 2008 because the opening chapter hit me with a trifecta of misogyny, racism, and antisemitism and I just couldn't take it. I almost DNF'd this book in chapter 1 too: an almost entirely unnecessary and snobbish set of caricatures of people at a boarding house Orwell stayed at. I stuck with it because of Victor Gollancz's introduction and I'm glad I did. Gollancz published the original edition for the Left Book Club, and his intro is one of the funniest things I have ever read: it's basically him going, ""Look, I know George is a prick and says a lot of wild shit, but there's good stuff in here too!"" And you know what, he's right: Georgie is a prick, this book is fully of moments of mind-boggling racism, sexism, bizarre prejudices -- what was going on in 1937 that he hates people who drink fruit juice so much? -- homophobia (paired beautifully of course with rapturous descriptions of miners' small, muscular bodies), more snobbery, and just...being an asshole. But it also paints a vivid, thoroughly researched, and devastating portrait of the effects of industrialization on Northern England, particularly the mining communities around Liverpool, Manchester, and Wigan.This first half of the book is the most fascinating and effecting (though I could never figure out what anything cost in Orwell's endless listing of prices in Britain's labyrinthine pre-decimal currency system). The second half is his diagnosis of The Problem with Socialism -- a system he believes in, so really, The Problem with Selling Socialism to the Masses. Aside, again, from more weird nonsense about fruit juice drinkers (is this like Moon Juice drinkers in this day and age? Orwell would shit himself over that), he has some good points: ideas and observations relevant not just to Europe during the rise of Hitler, but to today. The left does have a bad tendency to only speak bleakly of problems and not present hopeful solutions, to purity test itself to death, and to fail to create a convincing narrative the way fascism does. Which is perhaps why, just like Orwell in 1937, we are still fighting fascism today.

I read with the same fascination/relief with which I watch videos about cave diving disasters, knowing I will never, ever do this.Madhouse at the End of the Earth is a well-executed example of the genre, profiling a lesser-known expedition, and serving as a particularly fascinating portrait of Roald Amundsen (later very famous for being the first man to reach the South Pole) and Fredrick Cook (later dismissed as a scammer for his North Pole claims, and then jailed for a Ponzi scheme) and their friendship. The Terror girlies (gn) would like this one. Sancton grapples with how much of what Cook says can be taken as fact when he's a proven fraud in some cases, and perhaps overly maligned in others. I enjoyed this final stretch of the book a lot, but could maybe have done with slightly less detail of being trapped in the ice. (I'm sure the Belgica's crew could have likewise done with less of being trapped in the ice.) Sancton is mostly a good tour guide and portraitist, though he makes a few weird assumptions, bizarre claims (petty but: Sherlock Holmes is not an antihero), and glides past some issues of sexual and racial politics with a bit too much ease.

I quite enjoyed the first quarter of this, inIs there a worse feeling than liking a book quite a bit at the start, then slowly feeling it betray you? I quite enjoyed the first quarter of this, in which Emry Merlin has to disguise herself as her wastrel brother Emmett and take his place at court as trainee wizard. Emry-as-Emmett develops a cute relationship with Prince Arthur, who in this is quite bookish (fun!) and only recently possessed of the sword he has pulled from the stone. The dialogue is nice and bantery without being overdone, and through the trip to Avalon I was thoroughly on board, despite some niggling warning signs.Such as: the world building makes little sense. When is this set? If one is pretending at a historical Arthur who has to unite Britain, then why is London a flourishing metropolis full of fancy homes and in fact the king's seat? Why do social attitudes toward homosexuality seem to shift as plot-convenient? Emry is bi (excellent), Lancelot and Percival are gay, and the latter two seem fairly comfortable referencing this openly. On the other hand, Lance's tragic backstory at the novel's start is that he was stripped of his position of squire because he was caught in flagrante with Arthur's cousin; the cousin lied and said Lance attacked him because he feared his parents' homophobia. Emry also says in narration that she's felt horribly othered and alone because she likes girls as well as boys, but then again, other characters are casually and openly queer whenever, I guess, it is cute and flirty for them to be so? I'm not saying there's no way to reconcile this, just that the novel never attempts to. Instead, the queer content feels like set dressing. Similarly: Schneider makes reference to many of the characters in Uther's court being non-white, but in that colorblind casting way where it almost deliberately must not affect the plot -- or their characterization, their experiences. (And of course, all of the mains are still white.)I started to sour on this book a bit when I realized it was never going to be as Gender as I wished. Emry masquerades as a boy but definitely isn't one; and that's fine! Congrats to her on her Cis+ card! But we are also reassured constantly that she's -- you guessed it -- Not Like Other Girls. She's a Cool Girl, not a stupid ""pink princess"" (actual quote). So we see the classic double bind in action: one must be definitely a girl, and able to look flawless in a borrowed French gown at a ball -- but not too girly, like you actually tried or anything. SCREAMING CRYING GNASHING MY TEETH.Also: from about a quarter through to very near the end, this book forgets to have a plot. The narrative meanders from scene to scene, with occasional moments of interest, such as a sword-fighting tournament, but the threat is not clearly established until the very end, and barely even then. And it feels so long...so much time spent in characters' heads as they angst, so little tension and action. When things do happen, they are often resolved off stage, so you get, for example, (view spoiler)[Emry -- who's been sentenced to death for her deception and escaped -- finding out off page and well after the fact that she's been pardoned; the reader only learns when Arthur shows up in her home town -- yeah, she's wanted by the crown but just went home -- and is like, hey did you receive word? (hide spoiler)] And like of course: this novel is the start of a series. Duology, trilogy, idk, but clearly if it's this drawn out, it should have been one book.Needless to say, I am not tempted to read any further, because clearly Schneider does not have anything to say about gender, sexuality, or the roles of women that interests me....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"May 07, 2023","May 14, 2023","May 14, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/58386742-the-other-merlin

I almost DNF'd when in the first few chapters O'Connell admits to stalking random old men around Dublin, thinking one might be the released murderer. The middle picks up a bit as the crime is put in the context of 1980s Irish history, but I was annoyed again when O'Connell paints his work in opposition to the ""trend"" of telling victims' stories in true crime; he says he feels it inappropriate to speculate on their thoughts and emotions, and maybe he's right! But I see little point on wasting all these pages on Malcolm Macarthur, who was a terrible, inept, needless criminal, and who provides little insight into his own psychology other than to show he is self-deluded.

Like a week ago I told someone that they couldn't make a joke about axe murderers in something set during the Regency period because it's anachronistic, and then here comes Mary Balogh using the term like three or four times a page. I'm right; she's wrong!Cassandra's husband, Baron Paget, died under mysterious circumstances -- what much of society suspects was the aforementioned axe murder, although actually he was shot. Early in the novel, Cassandra tells her love interest that she super did it and does not regret it -- her late husband was an abusive piece of shit who caused her to miscarry multiple times. Pretty badass! But of course, (view spoiler)[she didn't actually do it, thereby removing the most interesting thing about her (hide spoiler)]. Cassandra's shitty stepson is denying her her portion of the estate, so out of desperation she seduces the angel of the title -- in fact, just Some Guy -- and forces him to pay her for sex. They rapidly fall in love for reasons I can't discern (an Adorable Moppet is tangentially involved), and despite Cassandra protesting that she never wants to marry and be controlled by a man again, she is eventually (and fairly manipulatively) convinced that it is better if she does so (and also (view spoiler)[start pumping out more babies immediately, despite her fears (hide spoiler)]). Yay?This book is full of HEAVY SHIT that I do not feel it addresses adequately, and beyond that, it is simply no fun, really and truly no fun at all.

Or perhaps, depressingly, mediocre white men have simply been failing upward for centuries, while somehow making women swoon with their average at best dick game; the shocking thing about Sorel, maybe, is that he is eventually made to face consequences for his misdeeds. He's supposed to be a deliberately ambiguous figure, but to be honest I mostly just thought that he sucked; Stendhal's depiction, especially in the earlier Madame de Rênal sections, is at least amusing, as Sorel first puts his budding MRA routine into action. He reminds me of no one so much as Rimmer from Red Dwarf -- self-impressed and obsessed with Napoleon -- although distinctly less likable or sympathetic. And more successfully heterosexual, for some reason.Eventually, I did get a bit weary of the novel's various political machinations, as I rarely knew precisely what Stendhal was satirizing -- I'm sure in the 1830s a lot of this material killed, though. Stendhal's meta-commentary and fourth-wall breaking is still delightful today. This was not an easy read, nor a book I see myself returning to, but I am glad I read it.
