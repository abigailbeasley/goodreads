However, around 2/3s of the way into the book, something clicked and I Got It. I think a good foundation had been laid for me up until that point and I’m sure bread crumbs had been dropped for me that I was choosing to ignore but the book just began to speak to me! I don’t even want to try to sum up the things that meant the most to me, but the quote below is kind of when it clicked for me. I just think this book is such a good meditation on how we, as humans, with completely different cultural backgrounds and multiple, large language barriers would react and interact when forced to live together in one house, trapped for months. It’s fiction but it’s also very real to me, because I DO believe art would be the connection between us and we WOULD all individually discover what is actually important to us and we would spend each day doing things we were BORN to do, which would be discovered by sitting around all day with nothing else to do. Oh Ann I will never doubt you again I swear.“The dead we can imagine to be anything at all. My brothers and I were all excellent observers. Some people are born to make great art and others are born to appreciate it. Don’t you think? It is a kind of talent in itself, to be an audience, whether you are the spectator in the gallery or you are listening to the voice of the world’s greatest soprano. Not everyone can be the artist. There have to be those who witness the art, who love and appreciate what they have been privileged to see.”...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Feb 27, 2024","Mar 11, 2024","Feb 27, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5826.Bel_Canto
