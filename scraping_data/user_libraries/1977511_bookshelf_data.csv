For that reason, and because it is always compelling reading, I've given it four stars. I admit I'm still puzzling over the novel's odd structure. It begins in the voice of an unnamed (I believe) narrator who speaks eloquently about one of his colleagues, Raif Efendi, a man he describes as ordinary, but a man he admires very much. He details the way he gradually gets to know Efendi a bit better, and becomes a visitor to his house. Then, during a severe illness, Efendi asks the narrator to bring him a notebook from his desk at the office. The contents of that notebook, written by Efendi in the first person, comprise the remainder of the novel, which is set primarily in Berlin and describes how Efendi falls in love with a woman artist from the first glimpse of her self-portrait at an exhibit. This ""Madonna in a fur coat"" turns out to be a character fascinating not only to Efendi but to the reader, and the growth of their relationship proves compelling reading. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Dec 03, 2023","Dec 06, 2023",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/27793819-madonna-in-a-fur-coat

I learned about this novel from a er who called it a ""romantasy,"" and the romance between the main character--Violet and the man she falls in love with (no spoilers here) is certainly a central element, which means that the novel includes both the strengths and weaknesses of the romance genre. But the novel is well-plotted and quite a page-turner if the romance element doesn't disqualify it for you. Violet is a young woman who has intended to study to be a scribe, as her father was. But her mother, a cold, distant and critical figure who holds a position high in the military hierarchy, decrees in the wake of the father's death that Violet should be a dragon-rider, like others in the family. Violet takes up the challenge in spite of having physical pain and limitations that make it difficult for her. (In this way the novel is a bit reminiscent of Bujold's Vorkosigan series.) As the novel progresses, we begin to suspect the higher-ups are concealing important facts from the students at the dragon-riding academy. The novel is the first in a series, so the ending, while dramatic and satisfying, doesn't wrap everything up.

Its characters are part of a group of African-American soldiers who are fighting in the mountains of Tuscany. One of them--a massive southerner named Train--rescues a white child and bonds with him. Three other soldiers are sent after him, and the four--plus the boy--become separated from the main division and from their white commanding officer. They come to an Italian village filled with interesting characters with painful histories and take refuge there.

His investigation takes him to the British embassy where he meets and is drawn to the daughter of the ambassador.

In the process he animates dozens of human communities and writes movingly about the project of rescuing species almost driven from the planet.

I agree with those who believe it to be Woolf's greatest achievement. In my early twenties I studied its stream-of-consciousness techniques assiduously and hardly noticed the content. Now, fifty years later, its treatment of the passage of time strikes me as remarkable. The novel begins and ends with Clarissa Dalloway on the day that she gives a party. She is a woman in her fifties, recently recovered from a serious illness, married to an MP. As she goes out into the streets of London to buy flowers for her party London comes alive with characters: Peter Walsh, who courted her when they were young; Septimus and Rezia Smith, a WWI vet suffering from mental illness and his Italian wife; manlike Lady Bruton; Doctors Holmes and Sir William Bradshaw; the ""admirable"" Hugh Whitbread--to name a few of many. Life pulses, throbs, as the narrator inhabits first one character and then another, each seeing things differently. But difference isn't so much the point as life: its vividness, its fullness. Truly an extraordinary book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Dec 2022,"Dec 01, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/14942.Mrs_Dalloway

James allows Miriam Rooth, an aspiring actress, to be as driven, as single-minded, as hardworking and as sacrificing as any male artist. In Paris she is introduced by one Gabriel Nash to two other men. One is Peter Sherrington, an English diplomat who takes a great interest in the theater. The other is his cousin Nick Dormer. Dormer is slated to run for parliament and have a career of the kind his late father did, but he itches to paint, instead.

And, yes, this novel is going to tell a story about these characters. This novel, my second my Kate Christensen, gave me that feeling and kept its promise. Christine, a former journalist who returned to Maine, where she'd grown up, and married a farmer (but was it a mistake), is on the last cruise the Isabella will ever take; it's due to be retired. She's with her friend Valerie, a driven journalist who hopes to write about the conditions the cruise staff live under. A quartet of Israeli musicians is also on the cruise, and one of them, Miriam, is falling in love with another of them after working with him for decades. And Mick, the Hungarian cook, is hoping to advance his career by impressing the chief chef. The description of him picking out the food prior to the cruise is so vivid you can almost smell the seafood. In addition to all the interplay among the characters another question rises ominously: Should the Isabella even be afloat? And can it survive the difficulties that will beset it?

This is the one I read and that gets four stars from me! A group of adults are vacationing together in a compound. The children are disgusted by their parents, who drink and sleep with each other to numb themselves about the coming destruction of climate change. They withdraw, refusing even to identify which adult belongs with which child. At last the storm comes, further separating children from parents. Riveting events ensue, and there's both pain and beauty in the ending.

This one tells two stories, awkwardly interwoven: the romance between Lady Frances Trafford and lowly post office clerk George Roden, and the romance between Frances' brother Lord Hampstead and lowly daughter of a Quaker clerk, Marion Fay. Of the latter it can only be said that it's Victorian in the worst way. Added to these criticisms, the novel drags. In spite of all that, I mostly enjoyed it anyway. That's Trollope for you.If you're looking for Trollope's best, try his Chronicles of Barsetshire series or his Palliser series; his novel THE WAY WE LIVE NOW or HE KNEW HE WAS RIGHT.

The priest's dilemma: the richest citizen of the village has met his death by drowning, and the rural dean is insisting that someone be found responsible. The story is told from back to front, with each successive section of the book detailing the day previous to the one just described, so that the final section narrates the day the man died. This treatment brings a powerful impact to the last section of the novel--one that leads the reader to immediately reread the first section.

However, the claustrophobic point of view and the fact that it is almost entirely narrated, rather than shown scenically, diminishes the pleasure of the read. It's impressive that in 1910, when women in Italy were so oppressed politically, religiously, legally, and personally, the author had the courage to publish this challenge to patriarchal forces. It is also painfully honest in its conclusions about the depth of maternal love and its very high cost. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jun 12, 2021","Aug 08, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1559221.A_Woman

The opening section, in which the meteor falls almost immediately, is a real page turner. After that the novel tells the story of the main character's fight against patriarchal prejudice and her own anxieties (about being in the public view, not about going into space). Much of that, for me, moved very slowly, though the final chapters picked up the pace a little. My greatest criticism of this novel is that the characterizations are too slight to bear the weight of a gradual or ""quiet"" plot. They are done in broad strokes, without nuance or surprise. That can work in a fast-moving plot, but doesn't work in this one--at least or me.A more minor complaint is that the author felt compelled to give us many, many quick peeks into the coy and cozy sex scenes between the narrator and her husband. Sex scenes, like all scenes in novels, should either characterize their participants or move the story forward. These do neither. They seem to shout: See, I'm NOT afraid to show my characters having sex!

It's not a rehash of hearings, speeches and tapes, but confines itself to the backstage dramas of its characters: Fred LaRue, Howard Hunt, Rosemary Woods, Dick and Pat among them. The characterizations are excellent--Nixon comes across as a complex man, damaged and needy. The most entertaining character of all is Alice Roosevelt Longworth; the book is worth a read for her alone. I'm not sure where the line between fact and fiction falls in this novel, but an afterword acknowledges that the author occasionally changed history to suit his purposes, and that the life of Fred LaRue was fictionalized more heavily than most. By the time the novel was over even I, a lifelong Democrat, ended up feeling a little sympathy for some of these wayward folks....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jul 04, 2020","Jul 06, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11864578-watergate

But before the people who sent her can confirm that she arrived where and when she should have, Oxford is overtaken by a mysterious virus that cannot be sourced. Meanwhile the reader learns that Kivrin is lost and that she, too has succumbed to the virus. The novel alternates between the future timeline and the medieval one, keeping readers turning the pages avidly. The book was written many years ago, and mentions ""historic"" (fictional) events that have since failed to happen. It also fails to predict the invention of the cell phone and some other high tech wonders. Still, I could hardly give it less than four stars given the number of times I've read it. Connie Willis has her faults--I so wish she'd had an editor to restrain her repetitive tendencies. She's so afraid the reader will miss something that she uses a sledge hammer when the faintest tap of a tack hammer would suffice.

The protagonist is a man whose family was once prominent, but he now must work as a grocery clerk for the Italian who owns the store. The novel examines the process of moral decay in the face of difficult circumstances, and does so in superb prose.I'll be honest. I read this novel many years ago, and was prepared to read it again for a book group. I was over halfway through when I realized I was going to be out of town on the day of the discussion, and I quit reading with relief, because I wasn't enjoying it. There's no doubt that Steinbeck's prose in this novel is superb, and some of his themes were ""big"" and interesting. But two things irritated me continually. The first and worst of these is that Steinbeck's tendency to show women as either pure (innocent, childlike) or evil. The male protagonist of the novel adores and reveres his wife, but is she is incapable of understanding him or his feelings--he wouldn't dream of sharing them with her. The second problem for me was the narrator's obsession with family status, which seems so wholly irrelevant and unimportant to me that I had trouble taking an interest. Since I didn't finish the reread and don't remember it well from my original reading, it's possible that later on in the novel Steinbeck treats these topics differently before the conclusion of the book. I certainly hope so. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Oct 23, 2019","Nov 03, 2019","Oct 23, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4796.The_Winter_of_Our_Discontent

He has put it off so long his two spinster sisters have become used to running the roost, and feel that in choosing Mary Louise Dallon, daughter of a farmer, he is lowering himself. Mary Louise is herself doubtful about marrying a man who is so much older than she is, especially since he's not especially attractive. But both families are Protestant, and there aren't that many single Protestants available. Elmer and Mary Louise settle for each other.But in that time and place a mistake in marrying could have serious and lifetime consequences. The book alternates between a timeline in which an aged Mary Louise is preparing to leave the mental institution she has lived in for many years and the timeline which begins with her marriage and shows us how she ended up in that institution. Williams likes to write about apparently ordinary people whose lives veer off the track of ordinariness in ways that are usually bleak. He does so here with well selected detail, though I found his depiction of the mean sisters rather flat--they could have been given more complexity. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,"Oct 04, 2019not set","Oct 21, 2019not set","Oct 04, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1354222.Reading_Turgenev

She doesn't understand the social conventions of those around her, the nuances of what to mind and what to let slide, what is expected of her by the boy she's falling for, or the theories and perspectives of some of her professors. But in fact she's highly intelligent and a keen observer, and her narrative produces a novel of ideas laden with deadpan hilarity.

This is a voice-driven novel, and you have to like the voice, which rather brilliantly combines a number of apparently unconnected observations in ways that make an impact, paragraph after paragraph. But even for fans of the voice, and I'm one, there are times when it wears on you.

The language is as exquisite as in any of his major works, and some moments--such as Pierre and Jacques holding up palm fronds to the powerful desert wind--are unforgettable. It is amazing to think that a literary genius could rise from a background that was in many ways narrow and impoverished, and Camus is amazed right along with us--amazed, a little guilty, and grateful to the teacher who made it happen.

After some historical explication it becomes a typical Murdoch novel, concerned with love and infatuation and the way we deceive ourselves even as we struggle to make good moral choices. For the most part the novel is successful, but the Epilogue is painfully awkward and unsatisfying. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Apr 13, 2019","May 08, 2019","Apr 13, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/336158.The_Red_and_the_Green

Christopher Newman is an American who, after fighting in the Civil War, becomes a businessman and piles up a fortune. When the novel opens Newman has decided to leave the business world behind him and spend some time in Paris. He suspects that there is more to life than money, and thinks that in Europe he can learn what that more is. In addition to being rich, Newman is good-looking, wonderfully self-confident, agreeable, and open to new experiences. The world seems his oyster.But in Paris he falls in love with an aristocratic French widow who seems to return his feelings. But the disgust her family feels toward the idea of her marrying someone ""commercial"" is a very real impediment, and it appears that, for the first time in a long time, Newman may not get something he fiercely wants. Though not considered one of James's major novels, it is not unlike other titles, except that it's perhaps less reflective and inward-looking. But the same beautiful prose rhythms are there, along with the same confident plotting and carefully delineated characters. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,2,"Mar 26, 2019not set",May 2019not set,"Mar 26, 2019",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/20675.The_American

The declining might of the British defense and the accompanying decline of British social conventions are described gradually, chapter by chapter. The head of the outpost, referred to by the author as ""the Collector"" does his duty in spite of everything, while his own convictions about the importance of bringing British modernization to India are also, so to speak, under siege. Details are of the sort that make you want to laugh and cry simultaneously: for example, the way artifacts of culture are buried in the mud to try to strengthen the ramparts during the rainy season. The point of view is kept strictly to the British, but feelings such as fear, not to mention horror, are kept out of the narrative in a way that heightens the sense of the ridiculous.

Set in a lay community attached to an abbey filled with cloistered nuns, the novel has multiple viewpoint characters. Michael, who leads the community, is a celibate homosexual who thinks he has come to terms with his identity, but events at the abbey show he has not. Dora is a former art student of little talent who has married an academic whose love for her is mixed with contempt. The real excitement of the novel is played out on moral ground: will the characters stay true to their ideals and values, or will they slip, will they err? Murdoch's characters are consistently more sinners than saints, but these are characters who hold the sympathy of readers in spite of their errors. It's worth noting that this novel, published in 1958, takes Michael's homosexuality as a given, rather than a choice--an attitude very much ahead of its time. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Sep 05, 2018","Sep 30, 2018","Sep 05, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11230.The_Bell

And throughout this the reader experiences the tension of knowing that this narration is approaching a single, vital day in the protagonist's life: his last. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Aug 29, 2018","Oct 14, 2018","Aug 29, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29773751-solar-bones

The story, set in 1941, is told through a variety of viewpoints, but is centered on Pecola, a young adolescent who, as we learn at the outset, is pregnant by her father. Having learned that, we are taken by the author into the past, to examine how that came to happen. The story has been criticized for its many viewpoints, but for me they worked well--only Soaphead Church's section seemed problematic. My favorite narrator was Claudia, younger than Pecola but, with her sister Frieda, determined to defend her. It hardly needs saying that even this first novel of Morrison's shows her tremendous gifts with language. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Aug 29, 2018","Sep 03, 2018","Aug 29, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11337.The_Bluest_Eye

There's no doubt that the author's style is original and exciting, though much of her content remains opaque. The language is vivid and fresh, and the novel explores important themes and raises interesting questions. The characters are convincing in terms of psychology, but because they are described rather than displayed scenically, they didn't come to life for me. The plot, which with a realist treatment might have interested me intensely, was lightly sketched.

I've avoided all the Jane Austen spinoffs out of principle, but this one worked on my weakness: I have a soft spot for time travel. The novel's narrator, Rachel, is a doctor who has spent her work life serving around the globe in response to disasters, natural and otherwise. Because of her deep love of Jane Austen, she is paired with Liam, a cautious and reserved historian, on a visit to 1815. Flynn does a creditable job of creating a believable Jane Austen, and the plot moves along fairly briskly. Be forewarned: it is heavily, heavily romantic, also erotic. (Whatever people mistakenly believe today, Austen was not a romance writer.) And I felt the final section, and in particular the final scene, could have been bettered.

It's the first of a many-volumed work titled PILGRIMAGE, which describes the life of Miriam Henderson, who (in this first volume) leaves school and her family to teach English in a finishing school in Germany. Though intelligent and observant, Miriam is ill-suited for her work. The writing will leave many readers cold. Hers is the only point-of-view, and the novel depends heavily on her close, almost Proustian observation of the world around her, together with her emotional highs and lows. There are very few extended scenes, and those that could be so qualified are still told from a distance, through the lens of Miriam's consciousness. All this is one way of saying that there's little conflict or forward movement, and we see only surfaces among the minor characters. Still, I found something extremely compelling about following Miriam's mind as she ponders musical and theological mysteries, and will probably continue on in the series....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Mar 14, 2018","Mar 18, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7697487-pointed-roofs

But one character gradually emerges as the protagonist, and she alone continues into the remainder of the novel. And after that, sadly, it rambles. There's a coherence of theme, having to do with the suffering that immigrants flee from, no matter where they may be from. And that theme is an important one, perhaps especially today.

The reason I put it off was because it was described as being a series of related short stories that comprised a novel. I tend not to like this sort of thing, but preferred a sustained story, and, especially, one or two (rather than many) main characters. The reason that I knew I would eventually read it anyway is because the main character was supposed to be in some way unsympathetic, unlikable. Olive Kittredge, a school teacher who lives in a small town in Maine, is certainly that. Over the years that these stories span, she seems to try her best to evade the tolerance of the reader. And yet, thanks to Strout's highly skilled writing (and the magic such writing sometimes creates), we care about her in spite of ourselves. I deeply admire Strout for writing (and being able to write) this novel. I'm one of those who believes if any of us had all our foibles and failures exposed we would become ""unsympathetic.""

It was clearly meant to be an anti-war sentiment--the men became disabled in combat during a war the protagonist feels should never have been fought, and he has a strong objection to the way such people continue to be used by the government as a kind of propaganda meant to foment patriotism.

The novel takes up the story of Stephen Dedalus when he's young enough to wet the bed, and ends when he's at university. I first tried to read this novel many years ago, and was put off not by the stream-of-consciousness, but by the many Irish, religious, and literary references that I didn't understand. There was no Internet in those days! This time I enjoyed many parts of the novel, especially prior to Stephen's arrival at university. Even after that, I enjoyed the conversations he has with his peers about art and about Ireland. However, the fact that he is almost without relationship to any other human being, from the start of the novel to its close, made the story much less interesting to me than it would have been. The self-absorption of his university persona was, let's face it, not unrealistic for the age, but the fact that he showed so few vulnerabilities made his self-absorption rather insufferable. Also, Stephen's ideas and passions evoked such purple prose from Joyce that I found it quite difficult to read. All that, of course, takes nothing away from the fact that the novel was revolutionary at the time of its writing, and that in it Joyce demonstrates again and again his skill with language....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Dec 06, 2016","Dec 06, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7588.A_Portrait_of_the_Artist_as_a_Young_Man

Gawande argues that the medical establishment is failing to give those of us who are nearing death the quality and dignity of life and leaving that most of us deeply desire. Using the stories of individuals he has experienced and collected, he writes about changing assisted living options and about hospice care. (Unfortunately, not all hospice care lives up to his extraordinary experience of it. But perhaps that, too, is changing.) The book made me less afraid for my future.

But I was impressed by the compassion the Moravia demonstrates to all his characters except Leo, who is shown to be villainous and repulsive. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Oct 03, 2015","Oct 19, 2015","Oct 03, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/67145.The_Time_of_Indifference

Set in Transylvania and England, the novel tells the classic story of Dracula's determination to spread the race of vampires through England and how a small band of characters are able to thwart him. The plot moves briskly along, and though the characters are unrealistic, they somehow come to life in spite of that. The most interesting aspect of the novel to me was the way female sexuality was demonized, while the ""pure"" woman who occupied many of the novel's pages was idolized as intelligent, determined, and a virtual savior of them all. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Sep 19, 2015","Nov 02, 2015","Sep 19, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17245.Dracula

Set in the seventies with many flashbacks, it tells an readable, interesting, even compelling story of the marriage between a Chinese-American professor and his white, midwestern student. Marilyn always wanted to be more than a wife and mother, but her dreams of being a doctor got derailed when she married. But this is one of those novels you enjoy enormously and pick apart afterward.

Efforts to locate her fail, but Gill does find a collection of tapes which Aunt Rosamond has left for Imogene, together with permission to listen to them if she cannot be found. In the tapes, Rosamond describes a series of twenty photographs, together with the stories of family history they describe. Unfortunately, this turns out to be a very static way of telling what is rather an interesting story. Coe follows the trend in contemporary literature to emphasize narration over scene, but in this case I wonder if the result is perhaps not as successful as a more traditional approach would have been. Because Rosamond (rather foolishly, I think) is determined to describe each photograph in detail, a lot of text is taken up by these descriptions which aren't actually very revealing. Yet if this description were trimmed from what is already a very short novel, it would surely have been too short for publication--so it ends up feeling like padding. Coe does manage to produce some excellent atmospheric effects that are remembered and recalled through the novel, and he raises one haunting question about meaning and pattern that is woven effectively through the text. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jun 17, 2015","Jun 21, 2015","Jun 17, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/895807.The_Rain_Before_it_Falls

No other author has ever made such racing narratives out of moral muddles and doubts of the metaphysical kind, and puzzling over which philosophical rants are likely to represent the true Murdochian view is half the fun. Humor and tragedy both have their moments in this novel of the sixties, which revolves around a young American man's decision to stay in England to avoid fighting in Vietnam, and we are reminded (as in every Murdoch novel) of how easily our obsession with ourselves can end up damaging those around us. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Apr 30, 2015","May 16, 2015","Apr 30, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12056.An_Accidental_Man

He's since died and, though deeply attached to her boyfriend, she also struggles with their intimacy. All of this is made more interesting (to me, at least), by the fact that they are working class people who live in Scotland.This isn't literally the first novel I've read by a Scottish author, but they've been few and far between, and the first thing I noticed about this novel is that Scotland is not England. Seems as though it would be self-evident, but I'm embarrassed to say it wasn't, quite. The landscape is different, the customs are different, the slang is different, and having read dozens (hundreds?) of so-called British novels didn't familiarize me with the territory.It's a short book with short chapters and to do it justice it should be read rapidly, which is not how I read it. I always read several books at a time and on this occasion travel also interrupted me. The characters and their situations were interesting, but it moves fairly slowly at the beginning.

Miss Matty, the main character, is not especially bright or well-educated, and she's far from sure of herself. Yet the author manages to depict her in convincingly loving terms. Who would publish such a novel? Charles Dickens, as it turns out. Readers today are enjoying this humorous gem as much as readers did when it was first published.

Now Elf is a concert pianist with a compulsion to commit suicide, as their father and one of their cousins did some years back. Yoli, the narrator of their story, is a divorced writer of rodeo novels for teens. This superb, humane, voice-driven novel is sad on every page in spite of often being very funny. It's full of memorable images, such as ""I was gripping the steering wheel the way my father used to, like he was towing a newly discovered planet behind him, one that held the secrets to the universe."" Or she turns a cliche into a joke: ""...my tears were beginning to sting my eyes. A low point is when you can't even depend on your tears not to hurt you."" At the start of the novel Yoli feels it's her mission to save her sister, but as time goes on she wonders whether it may instead be her duty to aid her in ending her life.

There are many memorable characters, and I have nothing to say against his eccentrics; they're the best. But the supposedly virtuous characters, who are the major players in the novel, are so unlike actual people that their feelings are simply not credible, and the villains are essentially the reverse. Lady Dedlock somewhat escapes these black-and-white characters and is treated as a powerful personality.Young, marriageable women in novels by Dickens are almost always repulsively innocent, but although Esther, who narrates part of the novel, is shown to be a bit more competent than most, she pays for it with a bizarre and unbelievable plot twist at the end which is supposed to leave her in happily-ever-after-land. Dickens also shows his xenophobia in his portrait of Lady Dedlock's French maid. Add to this the sinister feline presence of Krook's cat, and the thing becomes quite annoying.SPOILERSEsther believes herself to be engaged to her guardian while in love with another man, only to be surprised at the end by her guardian arranging secretly for her marriage to the man she loves.

These friendships come not only to dominate her life, but to shape it for decades to come. Wolitzer's skillful history of those decades will resonate with readers who have lived through them, raising questions about what their events, public and private, have meant for the people inside and outside the novel. I often say that I would rather read about the lives of ordinary people than about those who have experienced unusual and dramatic events.

I found it engrossing but undisciplined, especially in contrast the Mantel's recent novels centering on Thomas Cromwell. In A Place of Greater Safety Mantel shifts wildly, not only between characters, but between formats: now we see characters through an objective viewpoint, now they speak for themselves in the first person, now snatches of conversation are reported as if dialogue from a play. Worse: these choices are not evenly mixed from the start, but are hauled in deep in the novel to produce results Mantel has failed (or feels she has failed) to achieve before. Upon finishing the novel I expected to be able to answer two questions about the three main characters: What made them revolutionaries to begin with?

The stories explore issues personally intense and intriguingly cerebral, and their intersection is not the typical one. I find it extraordinary that this book was written in the latter half of the nineteenth century; it is so very far ahead of its time. While Trollope's novels depict smarmy Jewish moneylenders, Eliot portrays complex and fascinating portraits of English Jews and even touches upon the earliest strands of Zionism. While Dickens peoples his novels with feminine types--the innocent and the eccentric--Eliot shows the unforgiving impact of patriarchal English society on complex, imperfect Gwendolyn. While there is no doubt that some passages of Eliot's prose trudge rather than fly, the sum of its pages must surely be one of the finest British novels of the nineteenth century. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 19, 2014","May 13, 2014","Mar 19, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/304.Daniel_Deronda

Professor St. Peter is a successful teacher and writer with two married daughters. His recent affluence permits his family to move from the house they have rented for many years to a new house more in keeping with their status, but the professor stubbornly continues to use his old attic office; there he thinks about former student Tom Outland, now deceased; he was once engaged to the professor's daughter Rosemary. Tom's journal of a breathtaking discovery of Indian ruins on a New Mexico mesa forms the center section of the novel; it carries a beautiful and profound spiritual charge. The family dynamics are perfectly drawn in this novel, and though St. Peter is in a kind of crisis as he falls out of love with life and draws away from his wife and daughters, Cather is careful not to vilify or trivialize the other characters. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 05, 2014","Feb 26, 2014","Feb 05, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/48203.The_Professor_s_House

I'm wondering if it's Austen's prose style as much as her characters that provides so much pleasure. There is something deeply satisfying about the shape of her sentences. The protagonist of Mansfield Park, Fanny Price, is about as different from Elizabeth Bennett of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE as can be. Lizzy is lively and confident; Fanny is quiet and timid. Lizzy is a gentleman's daughter; Fanny's father is a tippling ex-sailor with rough speech. It makes me wonder if Austen wrote MANSFIELD PARK in order to try something new.

Set in Moscow in 1913, it's told largely from the viewpoint of an English businessman who owns a printing press there. Frank was born and raised in Russia, though his wife is from England; they have three rather precocious children. Although the story isn't political at its heart, there are everywhere small reminders of what will happen in a few years. But the Russian climate may be the star of the show, and Fitzgerald's descriptions of the ice breaking up and the transition from winter to spring are not gratuitous, in some ways that IS the subject of this novel, which at the outset appears to be about how Frank will cope with the fact that Nellie has left him and their children and gone off somewhere. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jan 11, 2014","Feb 04, 2014","Jan 11, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/108620.The_Beginning_of_Spring

And yet I almost did. Jacob has fear-of-intimacy issues that keep him hanging out with a group of straight ex-pats for most of the novel. There are long scenes, not only of his going sight-seeing with his ex-pat friends, but of the friends discussing the possibilities of such outings. So many details are given of life in Prague--including an extraordinary amount of attention to Czech pastries--that at one point I decided this was a guy who had taken careful notes about every moment of his foreign adventure and was determined to get every one of them into his novel. Another time I decided that the novel lacked honesty--that Crain was writing about all his former ex-pat friends and was too kind to offend any of them. (Ditto his parents, since the protagonist's are barely mentioned.)Yes, there were interesting patches--mostly conversations about art. Caleb Crain is apparently a critic, and he does have interesting things to say. But it was slow going, and it's a long novel.I am by no means a compulsive finisher, and yet I kept reading. Though it was the epitome of a ""quiet"" novel, I tend to like quiet novels. In spite of the novel's flaws I enjoyed spending time with Jacob and his friends, even if nothing very much was going on. And when I reached the final section of the book I got my reward: the themes Crain had been plucking at like guitar strings throughout the book began to coalesce in impressive and insightful ways. It didn't hurt any that Jacob finally got some action. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,Sep 2013,"Nov 10, 2013","Sep 01, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16171304-necessary-errors

Pinky, more often called ""the Boy,"" is not even eighteen, but is leading a criminal gang in Brighton England--now that he's orchestrated the murder of its previous leader. In order to protect himself from the damaging testimony of Rose, a waitress who knows (though she may not realize it) something against him, Pinky begins to pay romantic attention to Rose, in spite of the fact that he finds sex repellant. Both Rose and Pinky are from an impoverished, Roman Catholic background; both fully believe what the Church teaches and as a consequence expect damnation. But it is for the character of Ida, repeatedly described by Greene in language that calls up thoughts of an archetypal earth-mother, that the author reserves his greatest condemnation. Ida finds in sex an idle pleasure, rather than sin or sacrament. Greene suggests that those who don't believe in good and evil, heaven and hell, but instead believe in right and wrong--it is they are the ones who do the most damage. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jun 06, 2013","Jun 12, 2013","Jun 06, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/48862.Brighton_Rock

Every psychic muddle, every impulsive choice toward aggression or belabored arrival at passivity, every judgment and rationalization, had me nodding my head sorrowfully, agreeing, Yes, this is who we (humans) are, this is how we operate. But this suggests an interiority not borne out in the novel, it's the human interactions that kept me turning the pages, engrossed. I greatly admire the way the author manages to make us empathize, momentarily,with even his most villainous character. I found it interesting that the horrific behavior of David, master (le mot juste) of the family, is presented in a way that is painful to its victim but not unbearable to the reader. The drama seems deliberately underplayed, which adds to its realism--rape and then a dinner party. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jun 06, 2013","Jun 24, 2013","Jun 06, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13514899-never-mind

His friend Arthur Wilkinson, with whom George was raised, misses out on the coveted first, and thereby deeply disappoints his family. But as the two men progress with their lives, nothing turns out as expected. George's fierce stand against materialism keeps him from benefiting from either a law career or his rich uncle, and his love for Caroline Waddington is such that when their romance goes awry it is a further blight upon his life. Though it was written during the same period as many of Trollope's finest novels (it was his eighth), I found the characters in THE BERTRAMS to be less complex than his best creations. Some of the dialogue was so elevated as to make me squirm, and much of the third volume digressed completely from the main plot. I did find myself fascinated by the view of nineteenth century English tourists in the Holy Land, however!

The story is narrated by Maugham himself; he uses his own name and mentions his own published works. It is the story of a small set of people from the American midwest, though most of it takes place in France. One of these characters, Larry Darnell, is a charismatic young man who is a seeker after metaphysical truths; his fiancee, Isabel Bradley, is used to the pleasures of affluent society and wants Larry to follow a more conventional path. From this initial clash between materialism and spirituality Maugham moves on to narrate the influence on his characters of the Great Depression and to pose questions about the nature and future of the United States, while he continues to follow the spiritual seeking of Larry Darnell. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 05, 2012","Jun 05, 2012","May 05, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/31196.The_Razor_s_Edge

James was way ahead of his time in examining the fate of Maisie, whose parents are divorced. The greatest triumph of the book is the delicate and perfectly done consciousness of Maisie as she shapes herself to survive her unusual circumstances and grows in understanding of what is in fact going on around her. To fully appreciate what transpires it would be well to keep in mind the scandal that attached to divorce, perhaps especially in England, at the time the novel takes place; how unfit it rendered all it touched for society with the respectable upper crust.

It addresses the pleasures of reading, gender issues, and the spiritual quest, all questions in which I take a profound interest. It keeps its focus on a small group of characters over a relatively brief span of time, and it moves briskly along. For all these reasons I preferred it to Middlesex, by the same author. Having said that, I have to add that I felt the author had a chance to do something more meaningful with his material than he ultimately did--I almost felt him drawing back, being frivolous when he could have been profound. Perhaps the fact that the characters were rather lightly sketched contributed to this, or the authorial distance employed. Maybe it was the fact that Eugenides kept his scenes short.

The book relays, in day-to-day, prosaic detail, the experiences of a young, well-to-do married American couple who are making a visit to post-WWII France. The greater themes have to do with the injuries France has received from the war and the general weight and thrust of history, I suppose, but the immediate, brilliant subject matter is the bewilderment of traveling in a foreign country and the confusion and insecurities involved in extending yourself to potential new friends. How do we know if the people we meet are sincere? How do we know if their way of being friends is compatible with ours? Though my own visits to France were taken many decades after this one, I experienced a sense of profound recognition in reading this.The book seemed to conclude with the departure of the couple from France; many mysteries were left appropriately, even deliciously, unanswered. But then came an extensive and clunky epilogue, which proceeded, in the authorial voice, to answer the questions readers are assumed to be asking. The seeds to this voice were planted earlier in the novel when italicized questions from an unknown source appeared and were answered several times. These were distracting, but for the most part were passed over quickly and forgotten. But the long indulgence of this technique at the end of the novel, which may have been considered audaciously post-modern, in fact is like an ugly tear in a beautiful portrait. I recommend skipping it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 09, 2012","Mar 10, 2012","Feb 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/291885.The_Chateau

I enjoy a leisurely pace, but object to a plodding one, which The Widower's Tale occasionally succumbs to. Glass's characters are often related to one another. In this novel the patriarch and central character is Percy Darling, who lost his wife Poppy when his two daughters were still young. His grown children and grandchildren, a Guatemalan gardener named Celestino, a gay pre-school teacher named Ira, and an artist named Sarah, are other significant characters; through these themes having to do with affluence, belonging, history, bonding, disease, and social change are explored.

The nSet in what was then called ""the Far East"" in the aftermath of World War II, The Great Fire is an extraordinary book by an extraordinary writer. The novel examines how lives and even cultures have been forever altered by the war, and demonstrates how people caught in its grasp struggle to see themselves as having free will and being able to make choices; it urges those who have managed to evade catastrophe to seize life and live it. The characters are convincing and indelible: Aldred Leith, the protagonist; Ben and Helen, gifted young people in terrible circumstances; Peter Exeley, Leith's friend, who is groping toward his own future. Shirley Hazzard's work is often compared to that of Henry James, for good reason: She has that acute observation of human personalities and interactions that can render subtle, precise truths. Her prose style is absolutely her own--she's that rare, truly original voice--and is deeply beautiful and evocative. (I should perhaps say here that I am particularly fond of elliptical prose, of sentences that must be reread to be understood.) I have a few reservations about the novel. A minor one is that Hazzard's dialogue is sometimes indistinguishable from her prose. I also think that the novel could be more deft structurally. The parallel story of Peter Exeley is essential to Hazzard's theme but is awkwardly handled, seeming to be either too large or too small for the book. My last objection is not technical, but philosophical: the conclusion of the novel allows more nobility to passionate love than I myself am inclined to do. But the fact that Hazzard was by all accounts deeply devoted to her husband for the thirty-one years before she was widowed elicits my forgiveness. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 12, 2011","Aug 29, 2011","Aug 12, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/142975.The_Great_Fire

I always knew it wasn't my story to write, and was delighted when I found out someone else had undertaken it. Peter Lefcourt's comic novel about a man who discovers his sexual orientation after he already has a wife and family is neither politically correct nor literarily weighty, but it's such a good read that I revisit it every few years when the baseball season opens.

Its dramatic concluding events move the novel into the realm of farce, but provide a satisfying ending. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Apr 2011,"May 10, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/452940.The_Dreyfus_Affair

But as it progressed I found myself deeply disappointed. The story describes a zany, dysfunctional family of Turkish (mostly) women (mostly). In common with many contemporary novels, the book has a fable-like quality, and through this lens examines the Turkish massacre of ethnic Armenians and the role denial can play at both national and familial levels. But the plot is clunky, with most events telegraphed many pages in advance, and of the many, many characters, only a few come to life even briefly. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 10, 2011","Jun 06, 2011","May 10, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/98920.The_Bastard_of_Istanbul

And the novel is especially interesting from a feminist perspective. I think I can safely say that it's the most unromantic novel with a marital plot--that is, a plot that ends with marriage--that I have ever read. Miss Mackenzie spent her youth in a dependent and confined environment, nursing her invalid brother. At his death she finds herself free and well to do, and sets out to discover what life can offer her in these circumstances. The dangers are many, as Miss Mackenzie, though middle aged (at least in Trollope's time), still thinks wistfully of marriage, and her money makes her a target for fortune hunters. She has multiple suitors, but none are young or dashing; even the ultimate victor remains stodgy and querulous, though ethically embraceable. An excellent comic novel that explores in acute detail the money-marriage tangle and creates a memorable and realistic portrait of a strong woman in the latter half of the nineteenth century--Miss Mackenzie is my favorite Trollope heroine ever. Two more pluses: there are no Semitic moneylenders in this story, and you can download it free at the Gutenberg Project. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"May 09, 2011","May 10, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/445700.Miss_Mackenzie

I reread it for pleasure, yes, but also so that I could share it with my face-to-face book group. But the experience turned out to be fresh and rich for me. Howards End is about the Schlegel sisters, Margaret and Helen, and their encounters--collisions?--with the Wilcox family, especially Mr. and Mrs. Wilcox. It's also about Leonard Bast, a London working man who wants terribly to acquire the education and culture reserved in Edwardian times for the upper classes. When young I loved this book because of its early feminism and its examination of class issues. Today I love it because I can feel Forster's anguish at the losses engendered by industrialization on every page. His concerns are still relevant, though now it isn't our speeding bodies that protest, as we put them into motor cars, but our speeding minds, as we feed them on the Internet. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 11, 2010","Jul 27, 2010","Jul 11, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3102.Howards_End

The novel tells the story of an old man whose life as a novelist has been only mildly successful and of his relationship with a young (female) graduate student who is doing her thesis on him. These themes--writing, aging, success or the lack thereof--are resonant ones for me, and I suspect that's why I raced through this novel in spite of its flaws. The prose, in particular, is extremely uneven and sometimes cliched; in the first few pages Morton presents us with the sentence: ""Her mind reeled."" There were also some felicitous phrases of course. (“He’d been alone for so many years that he’d lost all sense of what to do about the quandaries of longing.”) But these are the exception rather than the rule.

The novel deals with Chloe, an illustrator whose affluent and peaceful life is threatened by dual causes: a poacher on the grounds of their home and the fact that her son Toby has become engaged to Salome, a Croatian refugee. The story includes multiple viewpoint characters and extends to Louisiana, where Salome’s father now lives, and ultimately to Trieste, in Italy; where Salome unburies a piece of her past. It also reaches backward in time to the horrors of war in the former Yugoslavia. I don’t mind the fact that Martin is once again hard on her characters; she sheds some light that way--though I do think it’s interesting to note that the trio of female characters are painted much more severely than the trio of male characters. I like the themes Martin explores having to do with how we distance ourselves from those we consider “other.” But the threads of this novel combine somewhat uneasily, and the ending seems a bit ho-hum. My recommendation is that if you are going to read only one novel by Valerie Martin, pick a different one. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,Jun 2010,"Jun 05, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/429281.Trespass

He sets out on the road to academic distinction, marries Claire, a white woman, fathers three children. But the realities of race and class in America make nothing simple, and when the novel opens he's 34 and broke, earning money as a day laborer, trying to piece together such essentials as first and last month's rent so that his wife and kids, now at her mother's, can rejoin him in New York. At the same time he is trying to piece together the story of how he has come to this, and where he is going next. The novel takes place over four days. During that time there are dozens of social interactions, many flashbacks, deeply detailed descriptions of the topography of New York, much in the way of thought-provoking reflection, an abundance of literary allusion. There is, however, very little forward movement, and it could be argued that the narrator is the only fully realized character. However, he's a deeply compelling character, and it's well worth traveling with him on his journey.

Set in Nazi Germany, The Book Thief tells the story of a German girl, Liesel, who is in foster care in a town not far from the Dachau concentration camp. I imagine that the Printz Committee was excited by the novel's unconventional features: It is narrated by Death, which enables it to render historical events through a particular prism, informing without overwhelming. It experiments with structure by frequently interrupting the narrative with bits of information displayed in bold, centered type. It makes use of unusual imagery in which inanimate body parts and products are personified and abstract concepts sometimes materialized: tears trudge; voices heap themselves on one another to be heard; feet scold the floor; truth sits on a shoulder. But for me the best and most valuable books must always present complex and convincing characters. These are simple: they are good or they are bad. The Jew hidden in the basement is good, of course, without a cross word or a character defect; he and Liesel bond deeply. Liesel's foster father is similarly good. Her foster mother curses and hits, but Liesel never seems to mind; she understands from the first that Rosa is really a good woman underneath it all. The normal reality of human beings in relationship has been sucked out of this novel; what is left behind is dramatic, noble, and poignant--but not lifelike. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,May 2010,"May 09, 2010","May 01, 2010",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/19063.The_Book_Thief

David Shields believes that both traditional fiction and copyright protection have had their day, and that in the future the only exciting and vibrant work will be in a form (he suggests the lyric essay) that mixes a searingly honest sharing of self with rampant, uncredited borrowing from other authors. He employs this sort of borrowing extensively in Reality Hunger, where it seemed to keep him from exploring the possible ramifications of some interesting ideas. As some have suggested, this is a manifesto for writers, not for readers. In fact, readers play such a small part in the manifesto that it can be inferred that Shields feels their needs have no bearing on what a writer produces.

Why don’t we listen to the people we love? Is it because we only have so much listening in us, and so many very important things to tell ourselves?” Sam Pulsifer, the narrator and protagonist of An Arsonist’s Guide to Writers’ Homes in New England, poses this question to himself early in the novel. This pondering points to two key themes: the human need to narrate and our fascination with ourselves. As a teenager, Sam accidentally set fire to Emily Dickinson’s house, thereby killing two people. Years later, after Sam has served ten years in a minimum security prison, gone to college, married, and established himself in the field of package design, writers’ homes again begin to combust, and Sam sets out to find out who is making it happen. The novel is largely concerned with families, especially the dysfunctional family-of-origin of which Sam is a part. It’s also about literature: why we read it, whether it influences us. The prose is hilarious and the metaphors are often surprising and effective; it’s also thought-provoking in its examination of literature from an outsider perspective. But we are so closely confined to Sam’s head that the other characters don’t have a chance to live upon the page; even the scenes seem to have been told, rather than shown. And Sam is so static for so long, and repeats his failures so faithfully, that the book begins to feel repetitive, as do the many questions he poses to himself throughout. By the time he asks himself: “…would anyone want to read a true story that made you start crying and never stop? Would you want to read such a story? Would you read it because it was true, or because it made you cry? Or would it make you cry because you thought it was true?” I’ve pretty much quit caring about the answers. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Mar 30, 2010","Apr 21, 2010","Mar 30, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/733462.An_Arsonist_s_Guide_to_Writers_Homes_in_New_England

Sophie, the middle de Monferrant daughter, is the rose grower of this novel’s title; her quest is to produce a hybrid rose that will have dark red petals, while the quest of the Revolution is to produce a hybrid society in which all citizens are equal. This is a story of those who believe in the Revolution, not of those who oppose it, which makes the horrible massacres finally more painful. In the foreground of the novel there is romantic longing: The American Stephen Fletcher longs for Sophie’s married sister Claire; Sophie longs for Stephen; a young doctor named Joseph Morel longs for Sophie. Ultimately, the relationships evolve and resolve in satisfying ways (though I’m not promising any happy endings). The child Mathilde, passionately attached to her dog Brutus, may be the most interesting and attractive character of the book. I read this novel with a moderate amount of pleasure and interest; it was competently done, though I suspect the multiplicity of viewpoint characters diluted what could have been a more powerful story. In the end, the book didn’t have any of the plus factors that make me want to recommend it to others: It was neither compelling nor weighty. It remains to be seen whether I will find it memorable. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 21, 2010","Mar 29, 2010","Mar 21, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1228025.The_Rose_Grower

Set in New York in the mid-seventies, the book uses the historical moment when Phillip Petit walked a high-wire between the two towers as a touchstone for a portrait of the city and an indirect exploration of 9/11 grief. His characters are many, diverse, and briefly sketched: an Irish monk whose work lies among city hookers; the monk's Latina love interest; a white, visual artist whose drug experiences have led to tragedy; an African-American prostitute; a Jewish matron grieving for the son she lost in Vietnam; a Latino boy who rides the subways photographing graffiti, among others. McCann's major triumph seems to be that he was able to create a different voice for each of these, but I found myself comparing this achievement to ""great special effects"" in a film. The shadowy characters didn't satisfy; I hungered for more complexity. Perhaps I would feel differently if I were a New Yorker. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Mar 09, 2010","Apr 05, 2010","Mar 09, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5941033-let-the-great-world-spin

Two other men become important in Everdene's life, and Hardy writes with conviction about the dangers of passion and the tragedy of irrevocable choices. But his most powerful motivating force is surely his love for the rural life he saw disappearing around him as he wrote. Rereading this novel gave me a chance to remember how much pure story pleasure Hardy offers, and to muse on his contradictory attitudes in matters of gender. He creates a strong and memorable female character in Bathsheba Everdene, but at the same time includes more sexist generalizations in his pages than most of his contemporaries did, and lagged behind them, too, in his sparing use of free indirect style--narrating events through the eyes of his characters (but while using the third person). ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 21, 2010","Mar 09, 2010","Feb 21, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/31463.Far_From_the_Madding_Crowd

Forster's Aspects of the Novel It was written as a response to the argument that to write a realist novel today is to deny the subjectivity, the uncertainty, that is part of 21st century life. In the view of James Wood, realism, far from being dead, lies at the heart of every type of fiction. He begins by demonstrating that apparently ""objective"" narrators of realist novels are rarely any such thing. He discusses ""free indirect style"" in depth (but he doesn't seem to give Jane Austen the same credit for its development that David Lodge does), and protests against E.M. Forster's famous distinction between flat and round characters. As he moves through his topics (detail, character, consciousness, language and dialogue, among others)he cites examples from a plethora of fictional works, including the great modernist classics of France and Russia and more recent titles by the hallowed trio of Bellow, Roth and Updike. In the end he reasons that most authors of fiction are striving to tell the truth--to say something about what life is like--and that the result, whether post-modernist or magic realist, is in the end a form of realism.I'd read a few of his essays previously but found them dry. This was quite different: lively, thought-provoking, and ultimately convincing. But then, I'm never much in sympathy with those whose mission is to exclude or dismiss; my literary tent is a big one. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Feb 04, 2010","Feb 16, 2010","Feb 04, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1355465.How_Fiction_Works

From what I’d heard about “I Am a Camera” I supposed this would be a novel of exteriors; the opposite is the case. Part cultural commentary, part meditation on mortality, perhaps most of all A Single Man is a novel of consciousness. Set in the Southern California of the early sixties, Isherwood’s relates the story of George, a 58-year-old gay man who teaches literature at San Tomas State College. George lived for many years with a partner, but Jim died in an accident a few years ago, and now George is alone. His lover’s death, together with the terminal illness of another character, has triggered George’s fears about his own mortality; he is frequently, deliberately aware of his own luck in being yet alive. The story is framed at both ends by a great deal of anatomical detail; in between we have a single day in George’s life. Though the events are for the most part without drama, there’s not a slack moment in the novel; George’s consciousness, his rather expressive character, and the tempo of Isherwood’s prose combine to keep one turning the pages. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Feb 04, 2010","Feb 04, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16842.A_Single_Man

However, I can't say II find reading Robinson's fiction extremely pleasurable, and would much rather have been reading this than so many other books. However, I can't say I think Home was as successful as Housekeeping or Gilead. The novel takes place during the same time frame that Gilead does, during the civil rights era of the sixties (which is relevant despite the fact that the little town of Gilead is far from the marching and sit-ins). It's fascinating to look at the same fictional events from different points of view. In Gilead everything is from the first-person perspective of Ames, an old Congregationalist minister whose health is at risk. The main character in Home is unquestionably Jack Boughton, the son of Ames' best friend, a frail old Presbyterian minister with whom Ames likes to argue about theology. Jack is the black sheep of the Boughton family and perhaps of the town, a troubled, alcoholic man who is trying to stay dry and to mend his ways, but who has serious questions about his chances. The problem with Home is that Jack, though the most important character, is not the viewpoint character. That role falls to his sister Glory, whose character never convinces. She is made use of by her creator rather than coming to life for her own sake. (Might that fact itself be a metaphor?) In another author I might speculate that Glory's failure was connected to her sex; there are novelist, including women novelists, who write more easily about men than about women. (And of course the reverse is also true.) But having read Robinson's brilliant novel Housekeeping, I know that's not the case here. Whatever the reason, it's a disappointment, and keeps Home from being classed with its predecessors. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jan 23, 2010","Jan 23, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2924318-home
