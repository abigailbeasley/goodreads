Maybe it will become a tradition or a curse. I got this book as a Starting off 2024 the same way as 2023, with my first read being a two-star ! Maybe it will become a tradition or a curse. I got this book as a gift before my upcoming trip to New Zealand, and I believe I had reasonably mid expectations going in for a sequel book (to the original Clanlands book in Scotland) that is effectively a companion read-along to a TV show sequel (Men in Kilts 2) to a TV show spinoff (Men in Kilts), inspired by the origin TV show of these two actors meeting (Outlander). If that was confusing to read, you can possibly imagine that just how far down the rabbit hole of this fandom this book certainly contributed to its lackluster quality. While I can’t vouch for how someone who has seen these actors on multiple shows and loves them would be better able to imagine their intonation and banter, as someone who picked up this book as a New Zealand travelogue, it was barely readable. The format involved switching between the two authors, often recounting the same story multiple times with just a slightly different perspective, but not enough to actually make it worth reading twice. The form almost appeared designed for a talk-back of the corresponding TV show, Men in Kilts 2, so perhaps an audiobook format would rescue this unfortunate style, but probably not. There were weird gaps in detail, like how they were supposed to be driving a caravan across the country, but then randomly took flights between the North and South Islands with no explanation of how the caravan met them there in their tight timeline (forgivable, knowing that this is to produce a TV show, but confusing if read as an actual log of travel). Even more than the repetitive, confusing dialogue style was the fact that this book was almost completely devoid of content about New Zealand save for some long passages about massacres (and truly, only massacres) that seemed as if they might have been taken verbatim from a history book and editorialized with a cheeky tone. And don’t even get me started on the cheekiness — the most salient feature of the entire book was the incessant, repetitive dialogue where the two characters made the same jokes and pranks about how grumpy, stinky, and wimpy the other was. It was completely over the top and felt manufactured. While there were a few scenes (even if clearly partially fabricated or over-dramatized) in the book that caught my attention (Sam stumbling through the steampunk village at dusk, learning the culture around Māori tattooing), by and large this book contained endlessly long descriptions of extreme outdoor adventures one might take in New Zealand with limited information on, well, New Zealand. While I guess I might come across a few places in New Zealand, and think, “hey — I read about that in the book,” this could have been achieved through a variety of different means of higher quality. I am genuinely curious what made the original Clanlands such a success, but not curious enough to slog through another book....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Dec 31, 2023","Jan 07, 2024","Dec 25, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/123204609-clanlands-in-new-zealand
