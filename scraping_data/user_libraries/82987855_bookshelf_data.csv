It has taken all these years for someone's story to cross my too-narrow awareness, to pull my ears to their words, my eyes to the terrible screen of their experience, and thankfully to their survival built one meal at a time, no matter the time and horror between. Chantha Nguon is a relentless warrior woman as her circle of women taught her to be. . .and she became just about the last woman standing out of her family. Yet she remembered - she kept all those memories of their wise words, the tastes and smells they created, the songs they sang, and their brave and rash actions - keeping all these in her heart. She was battered down on every level - she remained focused on the one goal: to survive. She did. She got back up, she remained, she persisted, and when the goal was achieved, she looked back and began to make spaces into which others could move forward and hold a place. She writes mixing heartbreak and sensual joy. She paints a bleak picture, with flashes of intense winks of smell, taste, textures and sounds shining from the bleak frames. . .bright bits of her own hopes, foundation for her remarkable patience and resilience in the face of utter terror.Her use of the ""recipe"" format delighted me. Through that she touched through my heart to the hearts of anyone who has ever personally prepared my next meal - most likely a loved one - this is a format that can be understood in most any language. And with a stroke of genius she turns it into a metaphor for her basics - ingredients and actions: what is needed to take down a society, what is needed to build it up, what is needed to survive, what is needed to thrive.We didn't know we missed her voice until we heard her story, songs. . .and to remind us of our human connection she generously invites us to her table with one of her family's most sacred truths: their recipes for surviving. *A sincere thank you to Chantha Nguon, Algonquin Books, and NetGalley for an ARC to read and independently . #SlowNoodles #NetGalley...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Mar 30, 2024","Apr 03, 2024","Mar 30, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/173404032-slow-noodles

Exactly as the NY Times stated - The Autobiography of Malcolm X is a brilliant, painful and important book. What carried the deepest import to me was the resounding testimony of his time, his experience, his witness of all that happened in his life and those of his ancestors - all that weighty black history that never made it to a page in a white world. He is making sure and certain that the truths he carries forward DO make it to ears that will hear and hearts that are open. He WILL be heard. And, he did it with courage and the sure knowledge that he'd be giving his life for that truth-telling.I will be thinking of this testimony for the rest of my days, and forever wondering what part of my privileges, liberties and freedoms were bought at the cost of his.

(More Light, More Light is this reader's favorite so far.)It is always of interest how a book lands its name, and this one, mercifully, has the explanation given at the very beginning, before Part One. The author, a poet in his own right, observes that Shakespeare and scripture are woven tightly within Hecht's work, and that Hecht himself said like Shakespeare's late romance Tempest's character Ferdinand, he experienced a rebirth through a ""late romance."" Hecht's marriage to his second wife was the wave that carried him to a rebirth in his career.To readers, this book is a persuasive encouragement to include and consider the works of this highly regarded poet in their academic and leisure studies.

Apparently, they all seem to be tied to stations.In the 60's my grandfather pawned all he could, every weekend, in order to dress fancy and catch a bus from Pomona to Los Angeles, where he would often hang out at the Union Station. As he was my part-time babysitter date nights for my super young parents, it was me and him, watching ""rassling"" on a behemoth TV with a tiny screen so close his knees touched the screen. I heard so many stories about the Union Station - that was the sole reason I hoped for this book to read. I wanted to compare stories. . .The characters were interesting - the setting is post WWII, dealing with consequential outcomes of political positions from the past reconciled with reality after. Transitions are always awkward, but in some cases deadly in John Russell's world - dark forces trying to determine allegiances, whose on which side and when. . .all the while trying to keep a normal life moving forward (?how many times did my Dad yell out the car window on road trips, ""I just wanna have a NORMAL family!!!!"").

So when Ruby Vaughn (making her debut in this author's debut offering to readers) showed up, I accepted the call.Ruby has resources, an elderly (but dear) partner, and a rare bookstore (lucky her). Times are tough, though, the conclusion of the Great War leaving societal debris in its wake. Short-staffed she has to deliver a special order herself, and finds the location is quite close to the home - a fancy one - of someone from her past. When she shows up on the doorstep, a reunion is had. Before long she realizes there's something off-putting. Within a page or so, murder has occurred, and she is stuck, and this reader was engaged.Particularly enjoyable for me was the introduction of a new kind of person from the occult world affording me a dictionary moment: a pellar. I found this is a good witchy sort - a healer, a diviner and breaker of spells - including curses. As the title of this book gives out, a curse is involved in this tale and so Ruby has a basket full of challenges.As this is a mystery with many parts and pieces to unwind, I will leave you here with my hearty recommendation to, if you are intrigued, read it!

The minute this is in print, I'm getting a copy for me and friends.Don't get me wrong. I'm not looking to leap out of my religious choices (imposed 67% by life choices of generations past, parents devout, and personal alliances seasonally and pendulum affected). I have been very conscientious, I have been wholly lapsed, and I have been comfortably ambiguous. This author brilliantly gets me. She gets my children - most of who have jumped entirely out of religion's grasp (for now) - because of the rule-yness, the in-or-out mindset and the untimeliness of some of the culture concerns in religious organizations of today - particularly the one with which we are affected.On the other hand - and Amy Leach does The Other Hand so brilliantly! - she doesn't discount a whit the joys, delights and blessings of regularly exercised faith, hope and charity. In fact, she adds to it with frilly giggles, lacey delights and heart-y guffaws. There are hilarious aspects of religious life - especially those in which ones are anxiously engaged from age 0 to 130 - if - IF - one can see the funny, and not punish those enjoying or providing the mirror and its uber-truth view.No one ""shoulds"" on others as thoroughly as Religious Folk, especially of the Christian brand (but maybe all brands could be included here). I read this book as Amy Leach's Great Big Grand statement: Don't Should On ME! She gazes out to her readership with raised eyebrows - 'You with me?' - I'm shout-replying: Yep! Me, too.Other bonuses: MUSIC! Lots of musical considerations, along with animal and botanical love, and an obsession with language that provided many paths down which to travel on philosophical bends.A delightful read - truly a smorgasbook, can be done in bits and pieces, over time (I recommend the Sabbath (however you do that), after services.

And to drill down even further - Hair in American Presidential History. Ahh. Can't pass that up!The author, Theodore Pappas, has done his research!

Politics are mentioned, and controversies or scandals are not shied away from, but they are not the focus, folks - this is a book about Hair. on. the. Body. Politic. !! This is a book you'll want to see - ebook or physical - because of all the nifty pictures - they support and expand the author's focus in each section. An audio version would lose an important element of what makes this such an entertaining read. I'm thinking this will be a perfect gift for my political friends and family.

Place: Madison County, North Carolina. Set between WWI and II, Laurel finds herself mostly alone, as her brother Hank has found a town girl who says she will accept him despite the curses that float around the cove they live in, and his witchy sister - on the condition that the new couple, once coupled, doesn't live in the cove. From early in the book, early upon rising Laurel prepares for the day ahead:The cliff loomed over her and though her eyes were cast downward she felt its presence. Even inside the cabin she could feel it, as though the cliff's shadow was so dense it soaked through the wood. Nothing but shadow land, her mother had told Laurel, and claimed there wasn't a gloamier place in the whole Blue Ridge. A cursed place as well, most people in the county believed, cursed long before Laurel's father bought the land. The Cherokee had stayed away from the cove, and the first white family to settle here had all died of smallpox. There were stories of hunters who'd come into the cove and never been seen again, a place where ghosts and fetches wandered. But Laurel's parents didn't know these things the spring her father crossed the state line separating Cocke County and Madison in search of cheap land, found a hundred acres for the price of twenty in Tennesse.I've fallen for Ron Rash's use of language. . .am loving how he spins a web of words.An eerie story, where the reader will be handed an unexpected skull, learn of the now extinct Carolina Parakeet, hear music in the spooky cove, there played on silver flute, weaving a connection between a well-traveled stranger and a girl trapped before she was even born; then a seaward moment on Leviathan under its original name, a plan and a dream; then comes a barbed reckoning - poisoned warp of bias.A haunting tale, a reminder of all those silent brothers and sisters whose stories we've never heard and can only conjure with layered maybes.52:4...more",Notes are private!,2,11,1,"Mar 08, 2024","Mar 09, 2024","Mar 08, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11807189-the-cove

She gains deep satisfaction in teaching MVSL (Martha's Vineyard sign language) to others proving deafness isn't an indicator of a person of less intelligence or capability - it is simply an educational hurdle to overcome. Although she'd like adventure and discovery in her future, she realizes that's not her lot in life.It is at this point the plot turns, and Mary Lambert has the opportunity for her dreams to come true, but she finds it will be at a cost that she isn't certain she's ready to pay. Conflict of interest, troubles communicating in a newly developed sign language, different than the Martha's Vineyard sign language present problems.But this is Mary Lambert we are talking about. . . .thoughtful and quietly determined, she finds a way through.

I missed her books for myself, and for my own kiddos. . . and that I regret. Although my own kiddos said they had found Katherine P all on their own because they'd all five read Bridge to Terabithia, and later plunked me down on a movie night to watch the movie version of her tale. To find and read all her books is an item on my bucket list. The grandkids and I started with Jacob Have I Loved.It was an instant reach for an opportunity to read Stories of My Life when it came across my shelves. . . and Katherine's life has clearly been at the back of some of the most inspiring, and funny, and heartfelt scenes in her writings. Her tribe shows up all the time. Now that I have her actual backstory, my bucket list fulfillment will be doubly satisfying.If you've loved her books, you'll love her life stories. Find it and settle in for a lovely read. You'll travel far and near, climb family trees up and down, and out to some branches, hop to visit friends and a particular celebrity (who was the last to kiss Robert E. Lee!), go to school, church and on dates with her, watch how marriage negotiations fare, see her writing chops grow and blossom, meet beloved pets and see her humble receipt of many well-earned awards. Above all, you'll see love of her own family and the human family shining through her words, lighting up her books. If you've never read Katherine Paterson's works (and a few are authored with her husband John, and others), even if you don't have kidlets around, read this first, and then look at her impressive booklist at the end; choose one after reading this. . .especially if you have a fondness to dip into YA or middle-grader genres.

She skillfully draws them, their parts and members, and dresses them fully in their agrarian goals - grains and fruit are stars in this part of the world - and grounds all in the virtues they held: benevolence, service to others and self-reliance. She works her way through the years chronologically and arrives at her own front door. She considers her own leaving of the homeplace to an opposite shore, always looking back over her shoulder at what was left behind, and to where she ultimately believes she will return. From here the book and read becomes even more compelling.Questions are posed about the effect of her family and her life (whisper suggesting you consider the lives of you and your own family on wherever you find yourself with this read in hand) on the land they have ""cultivated"" (meaning from which they've removed value however that is defined). At its most basic level: who and how many persons in the past had to die in order for the land to be procured? How was that justified (and now did the benevolence or equity weigh in)? On other levels how did it play out over time in resources used and bettered or used and depleted? How did it work out in generations sticking (staying in the community built), or loss of cultural capital to other more attractive urban areas? The author asks deep and abiding questions that are relevant to every acre in the world that finds human feet planted - she begs a reader to take a longer look and consider if they really know everything they think they do.In the two generations that have occurred since my birth in the 50's, there has been a complete turning upside down of history, the roles of the players, and a change of that two-faced mask worn. Manifest Destiny becomes a death sentence for whole nations, pioneers, pilgrims and explorers are no longer honored but are vilified and all motives for migration translate to declarations of war. While all the defensive hackles rise, it is well worth the exercise to take a deep breath, pet them down and soberly reckon on all ""history"" doesn't reconcile. Ponder and consider changing the frames we keep around what we know, and readjust as realizations squeeze in. This invitation is important and timely, and is the pressing question this author leaves with the reader. A worthy read and one I'll take with me as I walk, move and contemplate in the spaces I call home, where my ancestors called home, and those roads my children and their children have yet to travel. *A sincere thank you to Grace Olmstead, Penguin Group Sentinel, and NetGalley for an ARC to read and independently .* #Uprooted #NetGalley...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Feb 22, 2024","Mar 05, 2024","Feb 22, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/54712660-uprooted

So much rAn engaging listen was provided by this audio version of Charles Dickens' classic A Tale of Two Cities, with Christopher Tester as narrator. So much rests on the voice, timbre, tone, lilt and lyric performance of narrators, they are truly the foundation in every read/listen undertaken. The best book in the world, read by a less than appealing narrator can turn the listening experience sour. That was NOT the case in this read/listen for me.This was my first go with CD's famous book - so at the same time, I engaged eyes to read and research along with the listen. In a way an adept narrator - who soaks into and intentionally backs into the fullness of the tale being told - becomes a mentor to the reader. A reader who has given up all irritations, thrown over all peeves and settled into full abdication in a read/listen then is teachable - a vulnerable place, but one which is full of potential horizon-widening and bookish joy. In this experience I took away all of that, from both Charles Dickens' tale, and Chris Tester's performance of it.*A sincere thank you to C.

As a family historian, it inspired me and impressed me with her meticulous rendering of complex dialog wrapped around often troubling situations. Although this was not the usual read for me, there wasn't a moment I questioned authenticity or genuine portrayals. I descend from the South, too, and many of these speech patterns shape my thoughts at times. That said, there is explicitness that might set some readers back, and there are trigger topics present.Not an easy read, but a mighty one, well-researched and presented. Bravely done, too, as sometimes when writing about family, the ones who might take most umbrage may be the very ones you face across the table every holiday. Secrets spilled for strangers who feel no sting at their revelation probe heart-deep when close relatives have never heard them. Characters are many, all on courses of collision and consequence. This isn't a book that urges a reader to ""like"" or categorize them as good and bad. Rather, on one hand it pleads for consideration of each character's motivations, intentions and history, and on the other hand seems unconcerned should the reader not get the message. Those back stories and flashes back, given in parts, pieces and differing POVs create the book as a whole. By the time a reader gets to the end, the author provides an epilogue with her own path and process to the creation of this book, a powerful conclusion on its own.*A sincere thank you to Kim Coleman Foote, Zando Projects, SJP Lit, and NetGalley for an ARC to read and independently . #ColemanHill #NetGalley...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Feb 15, 2024","Feb 17, 2024","Feb 15, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/129527470-coleman-hill

We saw and heard footage terrible and awful about people on the other side of the world in a war our friends and family members were going off to fight for reasons we were beginning to see were hopeless.

And Anywhere Else wasn't showing up. . .Vinh Chung was one of eight children, with parents and some other extended family members who had sacrificed all to climb on questionable vessels tossed into an indifferent ocean. Where the Wind Leads: A Refugee Family's Miraculous Story of Loss, Rescue and Redemption unfurls his family's story: what the family's situation was before the war, after an end of it was unpacked to be even more life-threatening to his people, and how they decided as a group that they had this one wet, dangerous option. The tale is breathtaking - spread thickly with terrifying circumstances, next to impossible logistics, rapacious and murderous dangers in the real form of pirates who had even less to lose than they did, and covered over with the incredible bravery of each - right down to quiet babies, life-giving men, women and children.When purchase on a friendly shore is finally obtained, the trials begin with an entirely new flavor of difficult - starting with new languages needed for basic resource procurement. The author, thankfully, provides all of ""the rest of the story"" for readers who at this point are very invested in these real, live people - not characters of fiction. And to that end, this was an eyes (ebook) and ears (audio) experience for me - a BuddyRead with Carla (thank you, dear girl!), and we were rewarded with many, many photographs of these courageous people, who are now eagerly engaged in many great causes for the good of others and their own families.5 shining stars!52:19...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Feb 09, 2024","Mar 09, 2024","Feb 09, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18126604-where-the-wind-leads

And then there is now, the clarity of changed mind, changed thinking and awareness of wrongs imposed, witnessed and allowed. It's all here in this book. As a reflection of what was, this author writes what she knew in her world as she created this fictional world.The writing of Will Tweedy's 14-year old life in 1906 in his home town of Cold Sassy, Georgia is full of the wonder of age 14. There is death, love, irritating relatives, surprising announcements, close calls with girls, train tracks, and real tragedies with his most beloved family members. Despite all, there is real joy here, hope and a map for getting through the hard stuff - no matter who you are, or how you are - there is always a way through.That said, there is language to offend, events that can trigger on many levels, and it can be as simple as colloquial accent, emphasis, and grammar. If that is a deal breaker, beware this read. But if you can allow it to be the reflection of the time that it was, to help understanding how we got where we have, empathy may accrue as with every read that moves a reader forward. 52:14...more",Notes are private!,2,8,1,"Feb 08, 2024","Feb 11, 2024","Feb 08, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40389231-cold-sassy-tree

""If these walls could talk,"" was one of my first and still favorite ""wonders"" about places, buildings, and spaces in this world. To understand someone once felt inspired enough, excited enough to change a natural space into a living/work human space to further life endeavors and efforts for survival and development is an amazing, complex ponder. As equally amazing is the realization that those same spaces could in short or long periods of time be found lacking even one live person who still tends that fire - the space is abandoned completely. Such a situation is compelling to me, and here's a book full of it!Covering all the continents and with beautiful, atmospheric photographs, the author walks a reader through areas on each of them: East Asia, Central Asia, Indian Continent, Middle East, Africa, Europe, North America, South and Central America, Australasia and wraps it up with Antarctica.The author presents reasons for towns, villages and lived-in spaces being abandoned, and his reasoning is well-considered and delivered with breathtaking, haunting photographs supporting the observations offered.This is a book to get lost in, which will trigger no end of new thoughts on far off places.

Couldn't get into it.Years have gone by, things have changed quite a bit. . .I pulled this up to listen and settled in wonderfully. Captured I was - I cannot even explain, save to say some sad things had happened, things where I wished things had gone differently on all sides (mine included). I understood the spontaneity of Harold's long walk to Queenie, and loved all the people he met along the way - even Dog. The press was being the press, of course.Maureen was hard to love until she wasn't, and please send me a Rex for my next door neighbor! This read and experience in finding value in a read previously rejected more than once, is that it is true - we change, and when we are ready for a particular read, we'll be moved toward it. If you crack a book open and it doesn't appeal, set it aside. If you're second-guessing, read a little further, but if it still doesn't appeal, give yourself permission to move on. And the other side of that coin is - when you've previously rejected a book, be open to the idea that maybe, one day it will catch your thoughts again. If so, you lose nothing by giving it another go. It might be the right time. Be open.As for this one, it was a 5 star bullseye for this open heart.52:29...more",Notes are private!,4,15,1,"Feb 04, 2024","Feb 05, 2024","Feb 04, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13227454-the-unlikely-pilgrimage-of-harold-fry

He's had so much written about him, there are organizations devoted to gathering everything he said, did and in which he was mentioned or involved. So one more book about Lincoln may just be redundant. . . is Steve Inskeep's new book in that category?ABSOLUTELY NOT. This author has mined a specific area of Lincoln's reasoning process and found 16 moments and the events and people who pushed him to exercise and utilize that process. Steve Inskeep has had a career reporting on the world of politics, and so has eyes and ears tuned to those who navigate that world - willingly or unwillingly. American politics was the world Lincoln was yanked out of in a theatre - he'd been a veteran politician for around 33 years. Lincoln last walked the earth the author now walks 159 years ago - can the author accurately cast his net back over 159 years of context to explain the inner mind of a man who was famous for what he didn't say? After reading this book - he has done it: Lincoln through a different lens showing me connections and events I didn't know about that led to consequential outcomes I do know about.The author's first clue to a reader starts with the title of his book: Lincoln was all about admitting and permitting differences between him and his opposing parties - his gift was making sure observers, listeners, voters were clear about what those differences were. Vision is always assisted by clear contrasts, and this author uses his 16 examples of Lincoln catching and examining for himself and others moments of differing - times when differing moved him to intentional action: to move deeper into his position; to move closer to his opponent's; to take action demonstrating his position; or creating a circumstance requiring his opponent to take action; and at times saying and doing nothing in response.The author focuses on sixteen persons who are varied and wide-ranging in their relationship and role to Lincoln to better illustrate this reasoning process: Joshua Giddings - Provocateur Stephen Douglas - Partisan (a judge, political opponent) Owen Lovejoy - Extremist Joseph Gillespie - Nativist Thurlow Weed - Fixer Duffy Green - Conspiracy Theorist William Florville - Outcast (his long-time barber) William Henry Seward - Editor (Lincoln cabinet, put AK on US maps) Jessie Fremont - Emissary (wife of John C. Fremont; she was influencer on antislavery and women's issues) George B. MacLellan - Strategist Lean Bear - Cheyenne Leader George H. Pendleton - Dissident Frederick Douglass - Activist Mary Ellen Wise - Soldier (after spouse died, dressed as him - fought for the remainder of pay denied after her gender was revealed) John A. Campbell - Justice Mary Todd Lincoln - First Lady & his wifeDiffer We Must: How Lincoln succeeded in a Divided America is a thoroughly engaging read - not a biography, although it has enough backstory to establish context for each of the sections in which differing issues the above people engaged with Lincoln are considered. Warts and all, the author builds a persuasive case in each section.Lincoln was a different kind of president, handling one of our most complicated periods with less support and resources afforded persons holding that same office since 1861. Studying his successes (and failures) isn't a waste of time. Thanks to this author for a different kind of book about Lincoln - it's time to consider Lincoln's motivations - the whys with who and how, and ponder what can be our take-aways for now?I highly recommend this read about Abraham Lincoln - for those who don't know much about the man, and for those who think they know it all - here's an opportunity to visit or revisit one who gave his mind, service, and both his and his family's life for this country. *A sincere thank you to Steve Inskeep, Penguin Group, and NetGalley for an ARC to read and independently .* #DifferWeMust #NetGalley...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Jan 30, 2024","Feb 05, 2024","Jan 30, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/75574785-differ-we-must

The reality of that life stands in stark contrast to After Anne reimagines and presents Lucy Maud Montgomery's life with a focus on her life choices. The reality of that life stands in stark contrast to the ebullient Anne Shirley, she who we love to imagine is eternally spreading her relentless cheer and optimistic (and chatty) powers throughout Prince Edward Island. The truth telling of this book doesn't take away from Anne, rather it casts a look beyond Anne's bright profile to the woman with the pen, at the desk, writing, writing, writing. Faced with the life choices we all have to make, she made them in a hasty response to pressures perceived as urgent. In time, consequential outcomes snowballed for her in ways many of us who are fans of Anne may not have been aware. This author provides background, references for further research if desired and gives opportunity for consideration of not just the social and cultural pressures of choosing partners, family creation, where and how to live, but also the added pressures created by fame, publishers, reader expectations, and family expectations when wealth accumulates. I was truly grieved at the idea there were people close to her who'd never cracked her books open, but used her money. Having been raised in a time where a woman should take care of others rather than say no, she gave in to their demands. She wanted to write for adults, but publishers refused to look at those manuscripts, saying she was a child's author only - I wished for her to be able to achieve her dreams. I read this while my 10-year-old granddaughter and I are halfway through Anne of Green Gables, and readings of it with her are the delights of my Tuesday and Thursday mornings. Having read After Anne, I mourn a little as I feel this joy, wishing some part of LMM receives that collective joy as affirmation and validation from those of us yet living and enjoying her work, and mightily wish that eternity somewhere will give her a great big do-over, or at least a selective re-sort.

The read wasn't altogether a pleasant one, as the characters - all - were not trustable, likeable people. I'll grant you that the world they lived in was certainly pitiless and cruel, and no one was altruistically trying to create a nicer world for others in this story. The abrupt ending didn't prevent me from developing a silky sympathy for this woman who worked hard, fought hard and won during her beautiful years and appreciating the brief report of her fading lonely years. Once finished with the read, modern technology helped me find her images, videos and voice, which truly did reduce me to tears. For that, I am grateful - in-person connection through shows must have been a deeply moving experience if she can affect me so far from her time amongst mortals.*A sincere thank you to Daisy Goodwin, St. Martin's Press, Macmillan Audio and NetGalley for an ARC to read and independently .*...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jan 25, 2024","Feb 08, 2024","Jan 25, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/127305805-diva

Still, I read.

The steamy jungles, the thwacking copters, the blood, the yelling, the smells, I was there. All those bullets had me ducking. All that death and outrage tore open the spaces of my memories, hearing Walter Cronkite disillusioned before our eyes and politicians protesting mightily while the coffins came off the planes night after night after night. The confusing change about fighting morphing from a great idea to a stupid one. Kristin Hannah brought it all back, with a new nugget we didn't even think about: The Women. damn!

It would have helped me relate better to members of my own family. In John Elder Robison's shared experiences I heard the echoes of similar happenings through the years past, all labeled as disobedience, abnormalities, and willful defiance. People grow, adapt and change, but some things remain - this book grew my understanding, and pointed me to other resources - for which I'm grateful.John Elder's lively growth and open-hearted honesty in his reports of his journey were forthcoming and interesting: from siblings (not yet useful, but possessing potential), to building exploding guitars for KISS (I went to those concerts - awesome pyrotechnics!), from to Boss-of-Many to Boss-of-Self, marriages that work until they don't (it happens), babies that join up and create a new interesting considerations, and parents departing this life. How to manage all those life situations is a challenge for all of us, but the added aspect of Asperger's clearly increases and deepens that ravine crossing any given path on life's journey.I've added Tony Attwood's book to my TBR, along with John Elder Robison's other books, his brother's books (Augusten Burroughs), and his mother's memoir (Margaret Robison).This read has started a deeper education for me in this particular area - as I mentioned at the start - it's better late than never.52:27...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jan 20, 2024","Jan 30, 2024","Jan 20, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/454856.Look_Me_in_the_Eye

Here is the tale of a rebel, a heroine and humble human who stood her ground, making sure she was heard the way SHE wanted to be heard.This well-researched book covers aspects of her life and career that haven't been shared in the past, and a bright light is focused on the aspect of race relations in her living, working and musical spaces - despite all she overcame with grace and beauty.

The setting is in Vermont, at a fancy spot named Grafton where an US version called Bake Week, run by Betsy Martin (who feels a lot like Mary Berry with attitude) and six contestants gather for the filming of the show.

What's wrong with that? This is in newly formed Pakistan, only a few years from Partition - that massive forced migration resulting in over a million killed in the wild rush to the designated corners of British maps for citizens of the retiring Empire - Hindus to one side, Muslims to another, to be done by a date certain; afterwards all hell breaks loose until those corners are reached. No plan, no assistance, no help. Just ready, set, go - or be killed by the lawless and self-appointed monitors of culture. Our two lovers? Each come from different parts of the caste system established by centuries of murderous imposition. Their families will not be pleased. Juliet? Romeo? Maybe. A little. Add to the two lovers their two friends who are also quite fond of each other - these four friends are kept in their places through generations by the social systems that keep women in their place, workers in theirs, and the rich and powerful on top of them all. Even in a more modern day, with cell phones and internet, the inner structures of the ancient rules weigh heavy on those who dare to love outside the lines.A transporting story, evocatively written with colors, smells, and tastes that almost convince a continental jump in space. But mostly this is a love story that lives in secrets held. Love. . .of a time gone by, of partners hoped for, paths exchanged in opposite journeys, and a time-stopping breath where love, joy and sorrow abide as one.*A sincere thank you to Nigar Alam, Penguin Group Putnam, and NetGalley for an ARC to read and independently .* #Underthe TamarindTree #NetGalley...more",Notes are private!,1,10,1,"Jan 14, 2024","Feb 17, 2024","Jan 14, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/63342502-under-the-tamarind-tree

He joined a Peace and Dignity Journey (PDJ for short) race in 2004, so there has been some time for him to finish school and sort through his experiences. These runs focus on native lands and communities. The run starts in Alaska, goes through Canada, Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona, Mexico and Central America. He learned much from his companions in the run (none were known to him prior), and the peoples he met in villages, at firesides, in memorial ceremonies. Native communities vary widely, and broadening his horizons on many levels.Included in Spirit Run is his background and that of his family that migrated from Mexico in search for a better life - and Noé's thoughts. He frankly ponders the decisions of prior generations to which he's been subjected and opines about life in these United States on persons of mixed heritage. The writing is choppy, but this is a first book - there were things I wanted more of, and experiences and opportunities which merited a deeper exploration. It was almost two books, but I understand that sometimes a writer wonders if this is their one-shot. . .I hope we see more from this author. What the author adds to the dialogue/discussion about migration, the working class and heritage is important. It has particularly moved my thinking on the working class, all layers of working class society members and their ever-present challenges, and reconciliation of what the original dream was compared with the reality that unfolds over time.52:49...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Jan 12, 2024","Jan 14, 2024","Jan 14, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/49411424-spirit-run

A story of everything lost, but everything gained. With incalculable sacrifice, struggle and mind-bending exceptions to every rule Emil and Adeline Martel had been taught, accepted and applied in what was needed to live an honest and faithful life. It wasn't heaven that was sought. It was that last green valley, encircled by snow-capped mountains that would hold their family safely - that last destination: home. Finally. Then the calendar turns 1944 and Hitler brings them the years that would now test every truth they had ever held dear.The Martels were ethnic Germans, from families who'd been German in German territories for centuries. As their homeland was invaded by Nazis who were carefully reshaping, pruning local and national politics by moving populations (isolating, re-establishing, disappearing), the Martels and their extended family and friends were caught in the crosshairs. Moved away from their homeland for a decade or so to ""establish"" a farming community, war moved in. Here the book opens with the first of many of the forced migrations of this family and its parts at the hands of cruel military leaders who were likewise living a threatened existence by Hitler's whims and inner circle.I must admit it was a difficult read - there came a point when all seemed helpless, that I gave myself permission to check the end to ensure at least someone made it through. . .otherwise I didn't think I could continue. I was reassured and I'm glad I persevered. The end notes were well worth the read, too, explaining authorial purpose, motivations and process.A tale about strength: one doesn't know it's there until it's needed. A tale about faith and how it is carried in the heart (believed or unbelieved), and the key that opens all. A tale about love and endurance and fear-facing resilience.If that's not 5 stars (+), I don't know what is.52:22...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Jan 12, 2024","Jan 31, 2024","Jan 12, 2024",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/55961582-the-last-green-valley

That is to say, this daughter of The Joneses. . . (Yes! Those Joneses for who the saying ""keeping up with the. . ."" was first used) using her wealth, talent and restraint was able to have her cake and eat it, too. In other words, she overcame society's barriers against women writing novels, and still remained one of the accepted bastions of that peculiar and exclusive club (as defined by Mrs. Astor).She was upper-class, but the limits placed upon her by family and their place in that refined world often appears to have worked against her before she married out into a measure of freedom. She went to her mother as her wedding drew closer for information on how it all was supposed to go after the wedding. That first night - that forbidden topic for all her formative years - surely now she'd get some clues. How? What to expect? Her mother snapped hard and said she couldn't believe Edith was that ignorant, and stormed out leaving her daughter uneducated and anxious. These and other topics, such as scandals that proved knowledge was attained sufficient to be provocative to others show up in this biography curiously deemed for children. As an adult of many decades myself, I found this book delightful but there was little here to which the child in me would have related and been interested.This surprising biography is cataloged as juvenile literature. I know very few under-twenties that are looking to find out about the life and life-shaping experiences of Edith Wharton. She's rather an acquired taste among readers of a certain age, in my view.Connie Nordhielm Wooldridge's The Brave Escape of Edith Wharton is fair, interesting and just-the-right-size for learning in brief about a very complicated, talented writer. This is not a deeply-delving academic study of Ms. Wharton's works, but rather draws out life events, persons of interest, and the whir of society's seasonal expectations that shaped the particular demographic to which EW was writing. She had her secrets, and she had no problem with the people who didn't ""get"" her. She didn't really care about them at all. She reached under, around and over to those who had ears to hear her words, and eyes to see her point.A great read for anyone who has read and enjoyed Edith Wharton's works and wants to know more about Herself....more",Notes are private!,4,8,1,"Jan 09, 2024","Mar 03, 2024","Jan 09, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7571916-the-brave-escape-of-edith-wharton

The book iAunt Jane of Kentucky is truly a book from long ago, about life in Kentucky at the end of one century and perched on the edge of a new one. The book is woven through with elder wisdom offered by Aunt Jane to her younger visitor who in relaying Aunt Jane's stories to the reader proves a much more sophisticated point of view. . . at one point using 'Desdemona and her bridal sheets' as an inspiration in response to one such story.This is a collection of tales of a community in Kentucky, using the dialect of the region, and specific struggles, challenges, joys and sorrows of women living then and there. Quilts, gardens, cooking, life events and getting through them, all find a way to the reader - laced with the author's strong opinions on women's rights. Eliza Calvert Hall (her writing pseudonym) in real life was a mover and shaker with suffragette efforts to change the profile of the rights of women in the US.Chapter names are telling as to what Aunt Jane will be opining on within:I. Sally Ann's Experience (a charming, yet sharp snap about the unfair and abusive laws having to do with few to none women's property rights, encouraging women to raise their voices to continue making changes)II. The New Organ(dealing with religion and the ""to sing or not to sing"" aspect, along with the conflict about whether instruments should be allowed or not - especially ones as conspicuous as organs)III. Aunt Jane's Album(the daily work of a woman's hands - especially in sewing, weaving, knitting the entire family's needs in the form of textiles, clothes, and bedding - are essentially the journals, diaries, and ""albums"" of a busy woman who rarely has time, skill or money to put pen to paper)The rest are stories about members in the community and often have women dealing with the foibles, endearing and difficult, of their menfolk - IV. Sweet Day of RestV. Milly Baker's BoyVI. The Baptizing at Kittle CreekVII. How Sam Amos Rode in the TournamentVIII. Mary Andrews' Dinner PartyIX.

It would be too long to have it include all that the book does, but that was what I longed for. . . still, the movie taking the book in brief was also hard to watch (lotsa kleenex needed), but breath-taking as well. . .with different take-aways than the book, still good.All in all many stars more than 5, for the bravery of all in the face of it all including all....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Jan 07, 2024","Feb 08, 2024","Jan 07, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4588.Extremely_Loud_Incredibly_Close

She had a mother whose fond memories, usually referenced in French, was the preferred parent, although she died in Evelyne's childhood. Her papa seems to be a persona non grata, not present in her Book #1 life, but with enough mentions that I suspect/hope a future book will feature him.

A good ponder needs to be put on it, like warmth and a good quilt benefits that which it covers (which brings to mind Millicent and her wonderful snapping quilt in this book).Building the Panama Canal involved 2 continents, a number of nations, centuries, unnumbered ideas, and then all the bodies that lived, bred, died, experienced that joy of life we all claim as humans - all those who had the unfortunate address before, that would become the parts and pieces of what was the Panama Canal after: a very BIG topic to take on. It is to our advantage that Ms. Henríquez took her pen to it, and the result is a bustling, well-researched, deftly-told tale. While arching narratives were necessary (after all, it is a canal being built over land and communities already long established, and cures for malaria being sought!) and took up pages to cover and educate a reader, she always comes back to her people, her characters and provides each a satisfactory way out or parting from their engaged readers.This read is educative, wide-horizoned and broad-shouldered - you'll want to go see this earth-changing project, maybe get a Panama hat of your own (remember they come from Ecuador!), or at least pull up a map or two.*A sincere thank you to Cristina Henriquez, Ecco, Harper Audio and NetGalley for an ARC to read and independently .* #TheGreatDivide #NetGalley...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Dec 31, 2023","Jan 12, 2024","Dec 31, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/181110028-the-great-divide

However, Harold Fry's reputation through his travels has preceded my reading of him. . .I've had reports of him through other readers I follow - and he's on my list. Maureen has beat him, though, as to actual reading, and in a way, I'm now looking forward to how it will affect my read of Book 1, and then Book 2 about ""Queenie"" who I now only know from Maureen's quest to settle and resolve her dangling life conundrums.This is not a long read, but it is a powerful one. Maureen is cranky, opinionated, full of judgment and has a manifest destiny sized sense of territory (hers, that is). She's on the fierce side, but tends to think of herself as open-handed and fair-minded (she isn't really). She's easily irritated, although she sees it as helping others mend their social flaws - a favor to them, really. As her journey progresses, though, one develops an attachment, a fondness for Maureen. Well, I did. She seems, in a way, quite like me. In this book, Maureen is running away from home. And like Blanche DuBois, she is depending on the kindness of strangers, and she doesn't like it a bit. Not a bit.A great read if you've ever thought things were one way only to find out they are not; or if you've mid-lifed and turned everything upside down; or if you've just got to get out of where you are. Take this book along. It might help to see someone else working through their crisis while you work through yours. As for me? Ah.

And here I am putting off committing my  to print because I want reasons to keep reading over sections. . . .but the time has come. . .Jessica Hepburn starts out explaining her purpose in writing - her love of lists, and keeping track of things. She's had a rough road, but there are two major life loves that have helped her through it all: Adventuring and Music - and the best of all her worlds are the combining of both. She explains that she's not the one you'd think of as the athlete, but that she is the only woman to have completed the ""Pond to Peak Challenge,"" which is to say English Chanel swum, London Marathon run, and the Sherpa's Chomolungma (you may know it as Mt Everest) climbed. In addition, she walks and walks and walks and walks - throughout the world. Getting through the sad, the happy, the worry, the warp and the weft one foot in front of the other. She's claimed the title of Adventure Activist - and her main point to you, dear Reader, is to become one, too. That therein lies the way through this life.But wait, there's more! That's only half of her message - the other is AMAZING - MUSIC! Remember she loves lists? All of that stuff she did (and still does) in the previous paragraph? She did them as she listened to MUSIC! She's got 8 of her playlists for your  (as your homework is to think about building your own): * Songs of Childhood* Songs of Home* (If You Still Believe In) Love Songs* Sad Songs* Happy Songs* Songs for a Wonderful World* Songs of Faith and Survival* Songs to Die toI wish I could list them all for you, but then you might not have all the fun I did as I went through and found every one and added them to my lists (or didn't if they didn't hit my spots). I cried as I listened through the sad songs, and a few of the songs to die to. . .others had me up dancing, bouncing around and startling all my home mates. It was a blast! (""?did she just samba through the kitchen?!"" ""yep, she's doing laundry to the Girl from Ipanema, just clear the way through."")The author's passion for music has been fed over the years by a world treasure that I (a music person) had never heard of: BBC's program, running since 1942 - every week - 3000+ programs to listen to, called Desert Island Discs wherein guests are invited to be interviewed and respond to a scenario, always the same for all these people famous and not, professional and not, in all walks of life - the list is impressive. The scenario is this - If you were sent off to a desert island, never to return and could take 8 pieces of music to listen to, 1 book, and 1 luxury (an inanimate luxury) - what would you take with you? This scenario sparks the most surprising interviews, weaving in the reasons why they make the choices they do - and the final question, which is the reason for the title of this book - of the 8 choices if you had to save only one of those pieces of music from the waves - which would it be and why? I've found the program and am now a new fan and listen every day (the archives have my favorite Jimmy Stewart - so lovely to hear him and others who've already gone to their Islands. . . .) I will indeed save Jessica from the waves. . .this book is a delight. One of those that you can take in bits and pieces - to help you get to that new place you want to go for a long walk, or swim across, or climb near or far. Her words may trigger for you the right tune to soothe, amplify and acknowledge the hireath that's overcome you of late. She may not have exactly what you like, but she's got the wisdom to point you in the right direction. Adventuring with Music is her recipe for getting through this life. . .(I actually have images of you all out there moving, dancing, bouncing as you read this. . .it's quite nice. . . )Lastly, a note for those who only go by genre tags. This book is tagged with nonfiction and Autobiography & Biography genres. It's so much more than that, in my opinion - this is also Music / Art / Outdoor Recreation / Performing Arts / Sports & Recreations / Travel / Women's Health (she talks about her IVF struggles and the grief of leaving that battlefield unwon).With my wand I grant more than 5 stars.

Here we have an example of these in the stories told by an author of those days - adeptly gathered like ripe fruit by Tan Twan Eng and reimagined and extended. The House of Doors is one of those - featuring a version of W Somerset Maugham himself, and a few of his stories from The Casuarina Tree.Tan Twan Eng skillfully picks up the trail, and widens it, showing readers a deeper view, one that explains (a little) the blindspot of white society - self-centeredness, no room for 'others,' through characters such as Lesley as they watch consequences crash on all levels in Penang, as Japan and China fight for dominance around the people who've always lived there no matter what they were called, by whoever had settled in amongst them. The story is haunting, showing much of what we miss as humans even during times we are closest to history-changing events (as ever, by whoever is doing the writing/record-keeping).One of the aspects I most enjoyed was the speed with which I connected with the characters. . .all of them in some way. . .Lesley and her intentional blinders with Robert, Willie and his midnight swim, Arthur and his house of doors (oh, I'd love to see that!), and Sun Wen with his best and brightest love - the one that will crush him in the end. . .I will be thinking of this story for a long time. . .and have already started reading The Casuarina Tree.*A sincere thank you to Tan Twan Eng, Bloomsbury USA, and NetGalley for an ARC to read and independently .* #TheHouseofDoors #NetGalley...more",Notes are private!,1,6,1,"Dec 17, 2023","Dec 28, 2023","Dec 17, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/65215270-the-house-of-doors

Natalie Grueninger has done it. I've opened the book, started it, and stayed in to the end. It helped that I've read 3 other books about Anne this year. . .but this one felt more about the real Anne, herself. Who was this woman who fired the imaginations and passions of the people in her time, who has kept her place filled with her presence to the degree that even one, such as I would know her name, her place and the changes she effected on the world? This author answers that big question better than any so far, to my thinking. It was a dangerous time to be a woman, a daughter of a wealthy family with a long line of nobles, dangerous to be beautiful, feisty and possessed of ambitious ideas. Anne rocked it, and paid the price - yet despite the sad turn her journey took, her last acts of sacrifice were for those she loved who remained. Her restraint and dignity worn so successfully to the very moment her head was parted from her body passed that hope on to her Elizabeth, who honored her mother in the best ways she could, on the quiet, but carrying forward the torch her mother lit for her way ahead.*A sincere thank you to Natalie Grueninger, Pen & Sword, and NetGalley for an ARC to read and independently .* #TheFinalYearofAnneBoleyn #NetGalley...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Dec 15, 2023","Dec 19, 2023","Dec 15, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61817724-the-final-year-of-anne-boleyn

The shadows draw near, as always when the Nativity tale takes a turn to the dark and those mindless soldiers heed the edict of wicked ""King of the Jews"" - King Herod's relentless evil again plays out (and in every Christmas retelling we kill those poor boys again. . . .in front of their mothers, their families. . . . ) and here comes a brave girl who jumps into the middle of it with her true love's last gift. . .Total fiction.

It's time to reconsider, revisit and be brave enough to revise some of these stories we are telling ourselves. As for me - I'm a big fan of Wallace Stegner, with all his flaws. Just like I love Scarlett O'Hara. I just can't say GWTW is my favorite book anymore. Angle of Repose - another all time favorite. But it's clearly time to rethink and reposition - just like how you love your racist Granny. She's who she is, and to the extent you can change things, do. But, most of my racist Grand Folks are long gone, and the best I can do is sort through their stories, and place them in context, hear the words but never forget to listen hard to the spaces in-between, and the parts of stories they leave out - that's what you learn later or from other sources. Still important to pay attention to, though.That is what this book does. It takes the works of Wallace Stegner (and the contemporaries he played with) and thoughtfully sorts through different aspects. Outting his White Guy leanings, his blindspots, while considering each carefully. Flags are raised in places I hadn't even considered, and advocacies and championing are recognized in other writings.

It is certain that everyone should reconsider, revisit and readjust / realign / reject the ""truths"" and ""histories"" that have come down through the generations - because times, they are (and always have been) a-changin'. . . .*A sincere thank you to Mark Fiege, Michael J.

It is intimate, endearing, Trust the Bluer Skies is part journal, part child's memory book, part poetry, and is an earnest log of intentional living. It is intimate, endearing, profound and in many places, absolutely arresting.As one begins to read, it feels a little itchy, a little too personal. It is the record of a family who has traveled from their residence in Western Canada to the homeplace in one of their family tree roots (Matos is the family name in this line) - in Portugal. It is clear that this is, if not an annual event, regular enough to sustain relationships with family and community members throughout the decades of the author's life. On this particular trip paulo brings his wife, his 4-year old son Koah, and their newest edition, Amari, a baby sister.The writing is delicious and wide-ranging, and is always, always written to the son who is most often in his company. paulo is showing Koah around where they meet family - grandfather (who is not long for the world - a mighty contrast to the bursting offspring paulo brings to visit) and grandmother, uncles, cousins, neighbors. They work on language acquisition, songs, poems, stories, and recipes are carefully shared and documented. There are activities alone together - paulo and Koah, and those with other group mixes, mother and sister, grandparents and others. They stroll and explore the cemetery to discuss life and death, travel to celebrate tasty treats (but the best are the homemade ones), beautiful views and walkways. Experiences while carnival-ing, shopping, harvesting, cooking are shared. For a book about one trip over a season, the intentional documenting, with its lyrical movement enthralled me. I imagined Koah picking this up at 10 yrs old, or 17, or 27, or 67. . .what an absolute gift to him this will be, right down to what he was eating and drinking, and how he got chicken pox (as did Amari), but recovered. . all captured in these pages. A gift.The author gently presents the problems of long extended family visits - they show the contrasts in family life. How one family becomes very different over time and the various members as they start and stretch their own families and lives outside the original (and who is to say which is the original?!) ""footprint,"" developing and adopting parenting methods far afield from that first model. Even worship and faith traditions change, some chose other nations, cultures and languages. All of these are shown in this tender book - yet tolerating the differences and suffering them to exist happens precisely so they can be together again for this too short while.It was the end that wrenched my heart with the truths paulo shares with his four-year old - who will not understand fully for many years - that each visit is a new one, building new experiences with the loved ones who've remained, missing the ones who have not. The visit next time will not be the same - because we (the visitors) are not the same. That's the truth for all of us (Koah, visitors and readers), and the beauty of this book. Here is one father spreading with words his love, honor and respect for this little boy he knows will outgrow him faster than he will be able to bear, as he did in his turn to those who had nurtured him. But he leaves for his children, and all of us, his passion and reverence for daily living, and the value of gathering - arriving - sharing time together - and departing: to do it all over again, and again. What we can take from these efforts are so well illustrated in Trust the Bluer Skies, I'm grateful to have read it.All the stars.

This saga shows the power of families and how every member's action / reaction / expansive reach or crippling implosion affects every member, from infant to oldster, from child to parent.

I feel like I remember Peter Pan stealing Wendy's shadow? Brilliantly placed Last Take-away #5 - Daughter's answer given to Mother, many pages later, as life-changing revelations unfurl, an airline flight adds physical distance to the psychological stretch between them: A shadow represents either the blocking out of light or the other half of a person. When a character loses their shadow, they've lost a part of themselves and have to search to get it back.From me go all the heart-hitting stars for this one.

Warm fuzzies, and a spirit of hopeful anticipation fill me for the season ahead in exchange for the time I've spent with Jessie and the ""lost"" Marco out there in the Universe.*A sincere thank you to DP Conway, BooksGoSocialAudio, and NetGalley for an ARC to read and independently .* #StarryNightNotAllWhoWanderareLost #NetGalley...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Nov 30, 2023","Nov 30, 2023","Nov 30, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/50362841-starry-night

There were a number of episodes featuring these beautiful images and figures and I've been intrigued all my life. To find a book such as Rebecca M. Valette has written and provided to further educate people on them, from a Navajo perspective and artist was irresistible for this reader.Clitso Dedman, is not this artist's birth name. It is the name Americans used as his uniqueness and various successes as one who was willing to learn white ways created a conspicuousness that stayed with him throughout his life. He could explain and translate for whites talking to native peoples, and could go the other direction just as nimbly. The author explores his origins in his clans, and the experiences he and his family had when Indian School attendance was imposed on his people. She provides her deeply researched information and obvious passion in Clitso's abilities and the ways he found to thrive in a system and environment where many did not. His exceptionalism is not portrayed at the expense of his fellows, but rather to show the unusualness of his spirit. Along with his personal experiences, the author provides context in both place, nation (Navajo / USA), and is very clear that the diversity of the first nations was thoroughly quashed by the imposition of America and other nations to constantly regard all first nations into one homogenous tribe. Although Ms. Valette's focus is on the Navajo culture and peoples generally, and on Mr. Dedman particularly, she shows in her endpapers the many different versions, tribes, clans and people who also engaged in making images of these dancing gods. . . the figures I called (and loved): kachina dolls.It is a welcome addition to our world that this book was written, recognizing missteps, and casting a long glance at the histories we've been taught. In that process we are sure to find others who need recognition and proper attribution for their labors, art and sacrifice.

Anne was sassy and forthright, and for a while, Henry was into that, until he wasn't, and had ears to hear only what the nay-sayers were nay-saying.I learned much about Anne's life, to wit: * her ordinary destiny changing markedly after spending time in France (note to self: spend more time in France). It was after she'd been France'd that Henry paid her any mind - and when he did it was Significant; * why falcons? (It's was a heraldry thing, and in her ancestry. When Henry booted her up to a marquis she chose the white falcon as her symbol, so Falcons all around was the hue and cry!); and  * how she changed English/Western culture from Catholic religious foundations to a Protestant track. . .and that came from Anne's influence on Henry. News to me! After Henry, it went back to Catholic, but because of her mother, when Elizabeth I gained the crown, she quickly showed her allegiance to her beheaded mother by dismantling all the fence mending her siblings had done during their short reigns with the Catholic establishments of the day.

It seems as if hardly anyone kept promises to him throughout his life, but he has wrapped himself around the commitments he makes as a standard and measure of his purpose. Prior to leaving for his tour of duty in Korea, his best friend Jacob Hampton asked Blackburn to watch over his new wife, Naomi, and the affirming promise went deep. She definitely needed protection as she was from the other side of the tracks, and Jacob was from people who had fought hard against their marriage. In fact, Jacob and Naomi had eloped to make it so.

Some time passes until KN can get there, but when he does, he meets ""Dan,"" an Indian Elder.From there this book reports on the walks and talks between Kent (a white man) and Dan (an indigenous man) who, knowing that KN is an author, hopes that the Indigenous point of view can be put in front of readers so that the disparities, the errors and ""histories"" that have been in print, media and cultural landmarks can be shown for what they are: false, misleading and demeaning toward First Peoples as a whole.

The author lines up what Harry and Bess walked away from and to where they went back. One day a president, the next, an ordinary citizen. Secret Service now hanging with Eisenhauer, the Trumans were now lone rangers, unsecured. With no money. No job. Unemployed. Still he was able to take out a loan to bridge the gap he was suffering for having served the people for 8 years, and they still had a wedding anniversary to celebrate. And so they went. Harry drove all the way, Bess was the unheeded navigator, and while they weren't always recognized, they certainly weren't getting away with their great escape. Soon it made the news and the cat was out of the bag! All these years later Author Algeo took the time and did the research to track the route, the stops and even hunts down people, vendors, and sites visited (or their offspring) to get the whole story.

Kiki de Montparnasse (fka Alice Ernestine Prin) was the living, breathing personification of the ""bohemian"" style/culture the artisan community that grew in the Montparnasse district of Paris. It was home to poor artisans of an alternative kind - not the Montmartre district of an earlier generation. These were other types works of art that umbrellaed over poets, photographers, writers, and others whose expressions were off any traditional track - in their artistry, politics, economics, and social interactions.Mark Braude's book focuses on Kiki and her circle, which changes wildly and whimsically throughout her life. But one of the most conspicuous of her champions is Man Ray, the multi-media artist whose work stars in the works of Dadaism, amongst others. She was his muse, or at least live-in model for 8 years of their lives, and to read of their time together reads like caged tigers on vacation. . . one that lasts until the interest and food run out. Not the least to blame for that scarcity is the impending shadows of nations battling overlapping their playgrounds.I'm drawn to these artists that dared to live a bohemian life. . .while many conclusions of books like these make careful note of woebegone, poverty stricken and abandoned deaths (?as if that's what they deserved for these less traditional choices?), I find many who chose traditional paths meet their ends in exactly the same uncelebrated obscurity. We are all going to die. Must there always be a party?

It proves to be an uneasy odyssey into what it means to descend from the troubled people and evolving government of the early United States which imposed a rigid dichotomy on the humans in their society: white skin / black skin, free / enslaved. Woven in the writing was the quest to find her people in the cryptic records of their people who afforded those enslaved with few of the markers we associate with identity - names, family names, efforts to note uniqueness between members. As in many great efforts, when others in the same search join forces more ground is gained, and she found that as time progressed. Complicating her searches and efforts were the traumatic scars of family life that happens, and those who want to talk about it, and those who want to forget and fear the backward consideration as harmful to the group as a whole. The author leads readers through her many winding paths, sharing family tree charts, photographs of the generations that are currently leaving footprints in the world, and those who've been long gone, and about who we wonder. Was it consensual? Was it a price paid for some favor or kindness? Was there love in the creation of these people upon whose shoulders we stand? and what if there are truly bad actors in the mix . . . how does one reconcile all of that?A haunting, question-filled work of Sankofa by the author that is worthy of consideration for all of us - any of us who have ancestors who have been long in the land most likely have skin in this game. . .literally and should not turn aside perturbed.

It was 1939. The world had just been through the Great War, thinking that was it, lesson learned, and leaning forward in 1939 it was becoming clear that WWI was a WW""I"" with more to follow. The author was making a political statement, but it was being made to me, a person-totally-out-of-context, but still I was doing my best.And, to the very end, I stayed with it, and found it thought provoking, wonder-why provoking, and the more we got into getting into governmental fights over the moon mining rights - I really did keep thinking of the earth with the moon stuck in the Atlantic, like a lopsided sundae melting all over continental plates - my percentage of disbelief to suspension was becoming more and more imbalanced. But, I was warned after all. This book about the moon stuck to England, had been introduced by an Abyssinian professor 1000 years later, holding only the journal of aforesaid Edward. Indeed.

This was a topic I thought I was well-read on. . .but no. I soon saw that there were large, land-mass related gaps in my understanding about WWII. I thought: Interment camps? US. Death camps? Germany. No! It was happening in other countries as they one by one responded to the response to WWI as troubles that would become WWII were ripening. While this book is not a broad stroke vision of what was happening globally, it becomes apparent as a reader digests Mr. Parkin's well-researched book, that the US was not the only country responding to ""refugees"" (however they were defined) by quick, gather-them-up-and-sort-later methods that had no consideration for family units, individual liberties, or above-board fairness. Other countries were engaged in their own meticulous head-counting to see who was Dangerous and who wasn't.Focusing on one of the many British Internment camps settled on the Isle of Man, Hutchison Camp, the book explores what the catch was. The author worked diligently, giving clear and accessible references to those who desire further information. This camp would eventually hold people who had escaped with the help of British citizens in the Kindertransport rescue efforts (get that? they were being rescued by the British to keep them from the terrors of war!!), bundled together with political prisoners of every stripe, including Nazis. Whether an accusation was true or not was not considered at the start and if it was later done, the process was very late in the game.Yet, and it is a thoughtfully considered ""Yet,"" Hutchison Camp would become a place of positive changes for many of its internees - and Mr. Parkin satisfies readers by considering the life stories of a number of persons. Centered in this collection of life stories is that of an artist, Peter Fleischmann, who used a number of aliases through his long, helpful life, ending with the name he is now known by, Peter Midgley. This read is fascinating and thought-provoking. Highly recommended for those interested in WWII, or social situations wherein people are moved involuntarily from homelands of centuries prior.

A ""natural mutilation."" One after another a similar view is presented. . .and where were the women? Everyone of those men had a mother, and likely sisters, daughters and life partners who were women, who would mind the kids, cows, and home fires. It is enough to get this reader's blood boiling and more than a little pissed off. And history marches on, with 98% of male philosophers writing the tomes that carry philosophy forward, busy writing that 2% of non-male philosopher voices into silence and obscurity.

It is always a joy to pick up a story and read an adventurous, rollicking story about a place I know so well, shorelines, waterways nestled hard up against tall pines and craggy cliffs. It doesn't take much to imagine shipwrecks in that wild coast. As for the Peter Iredale wreck mentioned? My son bears a scar on his left knee from a deep slash delivered by the steely metal bones of all that remains of that ship during a family beach trip many years ago. No imagining needed. It's there, all right. The dual timelines provided views of Astoria and its close-knit community that helped a reader appreciate the vast differences in how we've changed as people - use of resources, treatment of people, change of lifestyles, commercial centers waxing and waning. I warmed up to the characters easily, starting with Pablo, the pup, Amity and Jo, dear Effie, and then Olivia and Naomi.

It comes down in many versions to begin with, based in the still-with-us problem of family dynamics. What do you do when blended family members' attractions to each other cross lines? Still a problem. But Phaedra's original family adds its layer of complexity, too. What to do with the Minotaur as a sib? and a sister who aids and abets that sib's murder? This retelling puts a different twist on it, telling the story from a feminist perspective - focusing on where women were in the mix of community power and roles of responsibility. Medea is included in the character cast, and I did enjoy Phaedra's nurse/companion Kandake - providing a full range of immortal-royalty to rags rainbow of class.Particularly interesting to me was the Night Chorus, quite like the Greek chorus in a play. . .I both read and listened to this book, and in the audio version the Night Chorus was surprising and compelling - I began to anticipate their turn.

Jazz was dogged, determined and finally brought us both around to the Big Solve.Truly, though, my favorite part was the very end, where Harry Whittaker, the author's son, has written in the Acknowledgements, a son's note about his mother that is very dear:As mentioned in the foreword, this novel was written in 2006. At that time, I was thirteen years old, and I can't possibly begin to guess at who Mum would have wished to thank. Therefore, I will take this opportunity to acknowledge the author herself. The true testament to Lucinda's indomitability is the fact that she wrote no fewer than five novels during her illness. What's more, through The Seven Sisters series, Mum rose to global stardom, and has become one of the world's most renowned storytellers. The books, however, were always secondary to her family. Throughout her tragically short life, I do not believe that she ever, once, put herself first. In that, and all respects, Lucinda was the best Mum in the world.

From this small literary outcropping comes Fair Rosaline - an engaging reimagining of a larger story of which Juliet's time with Romeo is just a part. The mood grows darker and far more dangerous. Another compelling example that blurred lines between good and evil, hero and villain, are alternately clarified in the telling of a tale, depending on the voice with which it is carried.A very enjoyable read, and by way of side bar - this was a treat for my inner Bard: the dialog between speakers felt apt (if not wholly correct) for the time of Shakespeare's writing.

This one took me to Trinidad, Blanchisseuse, specifically - with a handy beach for washing women in the 1700's. (Hence the name which means ""washerwoman"" in French.)The title is all in this book, truly. Marcia Garcia is a tough nut, but wants so much to be a tender one. She has no one, not one who'll allow her that privilege. She is charged with tasks her entire life - until she isn't. Her fight is robust and she is all in from the first page to the very last sentence in this book, and for that I admired her wholly. Marcia is not warm and cuddly of spirit, although to the children in her charge she appears to be the most nurturing, but even then, she holds all to the tight, restrained standards that have been imposed upon her. She is fighting her battles with her needle and thread and daily breath. All she wants to do is get out, get away, find a peace that she knows is somewhere, for herself and her children.The writing of the book needs mention - lovely, and filled with the five senses - especially smell. Careful attention to color, fragrance, textures against skin, tastes and mouth feel, the feel of hair moved by wind, bones in bodies. The author, with words as ingredients created atmosphere in the spaces characters spent their moments on the page. Those details fired my own interpretations, and powerfully placed me in that space.That old saying, ""You never miss the water 'til the water runs dry"" is wrapped around this story, and hit my heart - I'm often wishing hard for something to resolve itself, get out of my life, and then when that happens. . .I miss it so. . . we are kindred spirits in some ways, Marcia and me.A fitting read for this Autumn day, when I got to go to Trinidad, and see the beach of the washerwomen.

PLUS if you are one who leans with interest toward historical timelines. . .well. This book is for you.After a heartfelt prologue that lays out her intentions for the reader, Marta McDowell has gathered her topics - the gardens of the White House in Washington D.C. under the various presidencies served - arranged and vase-ed them into eight time periods. Generously interspersed with illustrations, maps, plans and photographs through each era, each section is of its time, touching on the president's milieu, from family to staff to public response to the changes each brought to our First House - all without a drop of politics. It was a joy to be able to think about our national home without the push and pull of that stormy thundercloud. This is a lovely book about gardens, our history, specifically White House history, and the many, many hands that have loved the house(s), the lands and have loyally served their country by creating a jewel in our collective crown.A wonderful read.

An unnamed narrator who is wife to a husband with his own ideas. 3. Her friends, some of whom have children. 4. Yearnings that need expressing - Our Narrator may be unnamed, but she's full of maternal conviction. There are many parts of life's happy aspects -a Pie of Happiness if you will. Very few of us get the whole pie. We mostly just get a few slices. Our Narrator gets love and a circle of friends. As for her shot at posterity, she's had a number of misses, and is hurting hard about it. To find her way out of her maze of Sad, she's taken on the four chickens in the world most likely to become well-known and have a book written about them: Gloria, Darkness, Miss Hennepin County and Gam Gam. On one hand this book is about them. On the other, it is not. Their adventures shaping a life altogether are earnest life at its best - fails, successes, deadlocks, compromises and miracle cures at just the right time.

She's given some freedoms and exercises them as she explores how far she can go in this new world. Some things don't change, though, and everything is relative, right? As a former prostitute, and now a fancier concubine, she decides to free some of her friends from her former life and from there the story rushes forth.There's a chance at love, at more freedoms, and a fulfilling new role she'd never expected.

Cumin? coriander? black pepper? ginger? mace? orange peel?) ◾ Histories Profound! (Egypt, Italy - in all its ages, Greece, Slavic nations past and present, UK before UK was, and its Colonies, and after, Scandinavia and its contributions, all the European bakers waving their rolling pins. . .) ◾ Pastries Astound! (Linzer Tartlets, stollens of all types, Italian breads and cakes, fruitcake! Caribbean Christmas cake aka Black Cake)  ◾ Cookies Surround! (Speculaas, marizpan - marchpane in England, pepper cookies, Moravian Stars, mincemeat cookies; gingerbread from the 1200's to now, and an exploration of the Gingerbread Man's Christmas associations) ◾ Candies Homebound! (Origins of Torrone, Christmas corn from long ago, dropped by Santa down chimneys - switched teams somewhere an age ago - we now see it every Halloween and call it ""candy corn"") ◾ Spices Redound! (history of spices and herbs with recipes using each, sugar and sugar plums (candy coated almonds and seeds - a Roman beginning: think Jordan almonds) ◾ Crafts Unwound!

After her brothers Joseph A sobering, yet inspiring read.Rosemary was born the third of nine children born to Joseph Kennedy, Sr and Rose Fitzgerald. After her brothers Joseph Jr., and Jack, Rosemary proved to be slower in her developments. By the time the later siblings made their achievements clear, everyone began to realize that Rosemary was different, slower, and in time began to get in the way of family goals. The author tells a compelling story about the family from which the country couldn't look away, of unfolding circumstances resolved furtively when her conspicuousness could prove fatal to the rising political dreams of the patriarch of this powerful clan. How to contain this beloved child who was, at 23-years old, beautiful, sexy, gullible, eager for fun, and childlike in her understanding? Rosemary needed treatment, needed to be safely out of the way. Rosemary was at the heart of this vibrant, brash, up-and-coming family who would make its mark in so many ways on this nation's development. Each family member knew Rosemary before the operation at age 23 - and they knew Rosemary after. A devastating difference. She could have lived her best life. Instead, ambitious parents - especially her father - listened to doctors who recommended a new technique. . .a little scoop of brain, and all that troublesome behavior will be removed. It was a new technique. The doctors weren't really done with the experimental stages, but convinced Joseph Sr. . .and Rosemary suffered. They made a mess of the job, and Rosemary lost independence, kept in facilities (albeit very nice ones, specially made for her) for the rest of her long life. Having Rosemary in their lives, and processing what happened to her help formulate some of the best advocates for the disabled our nation has known: Eunice Kennedy, Ted Kennedy, President Kennedy - never alone, always with millions of others fighting along side them.In the close of her book, this author captures echoes of multiple tragedies, observed in hindsight by Eunice Kennedy in 2007, about Rosemary's affect on their brother:You will not be surprised to know that I believe that those were also the experiences that shaped President Kennedy. Truthfully, I believe Rosemary’s rejection had far more to do with the brilliance of his Presidency than anyone understands. Yes, he was our country’s greatest champion of what we used to call “mental retardation.” To this day, his legacy of innovation in creating NICHD, The University Affiliated programs, and the President’s Council remain unmatched in American History. But beyond the specific work he did for people with intellectual disabilities, I believe it was Rosemary’s influence that sensitized him . . . Remarkably, I think I can say that not one author among the thousands who have written about him has understood what it was really like to be a brother of a person with intellectual disability. And tonight, I want to say what I have never said before: more than any one single individual, Rosemary made the difference.Larson, Kate Clifford. Rosemary: The Hidden Kennedy Daughter (pp. 230-231). HarperCollins. Kindle Edition. I was deeply touched by the last lines of the Author's Note at the book's end: As the mother of a disabled child, I am grateful to Rosemary and to her siblings, particularly her sister Eunice, whose advocacy continues to give us the language to forge ahead with more conversations and action on behalf of the mentally ill and the disabled.A thought-provoking read....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 20, 2023","Aug 23, 2023","Aug 20, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23719479-rosemary

He is a product of his focused acquisitions of art and items preferred, through practice and talents gained - the indulgences of a lifetime, perfected. He has been able to achieve this by enablers, also lifelong, and a society that imposed manageable punitive measures Breitwieser was willing to suffer in exchange for a release into the art-filled wild in which his collecting would resume. And, at book's end, apparently that is so. He's out there, folks and museums of art and treasure!The author assures the reader that he has spent over a decade preparing for this book's publishing - and the many contributors to that information in the form of conversations, interviews, referenced reports and official documents mentioned. Still, there is a note of wonder, of reluctant admiration that rises up from the read, a slight perfume of shine. Rogue praise and recognition. That's where I get tangled up. For me the overall flavor of this read has the Bad Guy as being the stubborn, ignorant (I don't think so!) mother who destroyed evidence, waving a flag of ""boys will be boys."" Meanwhile any girls (mater and/or mates) who follow or cover for Stephane Brietwieser are still 100% on the hook of their own accountability, wrapped in their own choices and consequences - getting no breaks for art passions, jack knife skills, or agility.

Even better is the specific discussion about Bears Ears National Monument in San Juan County, Utah.Filled with interviews of stakeholders, residents of differing cultures, political bents, religions, as well as those who have striven within governmental office on both sides of the discussion - To monument or Not To monument - which is better? Who is benefitted? Who ""Wins"" and for how long. . .Because the discussion is specific to a place many readers may not be (or may be and need reminding of) familiar with, these expansive sites and landscapes are beautifully presented with stunning, evocative photography pinpointing the subject of discussion. Included are photographs of those individuals participating and contributing their views within this debate. For me this book has been an education, engendering a witness of hope in the process with which these community members are engaging. From here, I can continue to learn more about Bears Ears (two buttes set slightly apart and from afar look like the top of a bear's head coming up and out of the earth).We need more of these discussions in our communities to air out our differences and disagreements - to speak with voices and words, peaceful actions and meaningful work - and a book with all of that is a great place to start.

Durian Sukegawa has pulled me into this story in a way that I miss with some of the anime story lines that currently fill the shelves everywhere. . .I'm sure that is my issue and certainly dates me. At the heart of this story is a bakery that specializes in dorayakis. These are a 2 pancake stack with a sweet bean paste between them. . .typically about the size of a donut.The bakery is manned by Sentaro Tsjuii, a baker with a past and empty spots in life. So when an elderly woman (Tokue) challenges him with her ability to pull off a better sweet bean paste than he does, he bites. While he's convinced her recipe is better, he soon realizes her skills come from a long life and she has something to teach him. She's hired, with some reluctance, but she soon shows him that she's not only better at that task, she's also better for business. Soon he's depending on and enjoying her mentoring. These main characters are joined in time by a young runaway teen (Wakana) who adopts these two in her need for refuge, but stays because she falls in love with Tokue's doraykis, and how her prescient and relevant wisdom bridges the ages and experience of these three very different people.Soon problems arise because of the crumpled hands Tokue has - and customers begin to notice and complain. From there the story about these characters becomes troubled, as all good stories do.Here is where I stop so you will be able to savor this book should you crack it open.

Especially endearing is his love for Stacey, spouse of many years and adventures.Altogether, a delightful read!*A sincere thank you to Henry Winkler, Macmillan Audio, and NetGalley for an audio ARC to listen to and independently .* #BeingHenry #NetGalley ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,2,"Oct 14, 2023not set","Oct 20, 2023not set","Jul 28, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/65215014-being-henry

A Tongue-in-Cheek study of our country's national parks, presented in a loosely regional way (wouldn't usually think Crater Lake and Joshua Tree and Mt Rainer might be in the same region, but that may just be me), counterposed sarcastically with complaints logged in visitor books at those parks. Sounds like fusion foods (taco won-tons, or kung-pao sketti) doesn't it? Still, I produced chuckles and side comments aplenty in response as I read along.Amber Share shares her art as she traverses around the country - this is graphic-ish, and the text is interesting and just hits the basics, with occasional highlights. I moved fast through the book, and enjoyed seeing places I'd been to often included, and accurately portrayed. I also found places I put on my bucket list for later  and research.One thing I noted and appreciated: the author mentioned in the proper languages and names, the First Nations place titles. She paid careful, respectful attention to this aspect of English names over places that had long been known to caretakers and stewards of other ages, nations and peoples. Kudos for that!Added to my bucket list because of this fun read:See a sunrise from Cadillac Mountain - Acadia, MaineCheck out Harper's Ferry - West VirginiaSee the bundle of sticks Lincoln is holding - Washington DCFinally go to Crater Lake rather than driving by it - Oregon (home state)Are the Channel Islands as awesome as they sound? - off So.

The youngest voice is Melody's, the baby around who they all gather.

Time to make a change. In fact, way past time to make a change. Keggie Carew is delivering her passionate message. It is a voice in the wilderness that rang true in my ears.Since that first bright morning Genesis talks about - no, it would be much much earlier - the first time there was a humanish creature contemplating exactly what to do with that non-humanish creature - that was the day it all started. The day we imposed our will to dominate, and this book invites you to sit awhile and listen. The author moves fast, so wear your running shoes, and bring a thick-skinned slicker, because she's going to deliver many stripes to your humanness, and your family's penchant for abusing the earth. All well and truly deserved. She's shaking your shoulders and boxing your ears - why???? To get your attention, that's why!!!The topic of this book is ANIMALS and how we've paid back their many known and unknown generosities. Don't let your defensiveness deprive you of a message you've needed for a very long time. Just settle in. The author does a very neat job of good cop/bad cop all by herself.From topic to creature to extinction to remedy to love to selfish willfulness to tragedy to resolve to wonder to creature to death to life to creature. to them. to you. to me. to us. for me, by that last page it felt very, very Shakespearean. I will be thinking about this book for a long time, and in my world of e-books and audiobooks, this is one of which I want a hard copy to read Bible-like before sleeping - so my resolve to DO something to help the survivors of our eons long massacres can continue for our children, and their kits, cubs, chicks, larva, calves, whelps, hatchlings. . .Beastly presents opportunity for much long thinking. . .and in-for-the-long-haul thoughts.

As a reader, it was the depth and breadth of the story Phyllis Biffle Elmore tells that kept it in my days, to read a little at a time over months this year. The combined wisdom, tragedy, courage and fierceness that comes back to us in all these chapters, and those within each memory. . . all caught up in the bits of clothes - worn over a long life and gathered in a bag, to be thoughtfully chosen for just the right spot in a quilt of souls for some particular person to treasure.Quilting now is very different, boutique-y, arty, for walls and shows - a very different animal. My favorite quilts are the ones of scraps, bits from someone's stash to piece in a similarly thoughtful way, but still is so far removed from the true quilts of the past and the beauties made by Lula Horn.Five pointed stars, quilted and bound up with gratitude for sharing this deeply rooted family tree and its many resilient leaves....more",Notes are private!,0,6,2,"Jan 09, 2024Jul 17, 2023","Jan 11, 2024Dec 06, 2023","Jul 17, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/62882056-quilt-of-souls

And there's no bud little enough nor sad-coloured enough for Kester not to callen it the beginnings of the blow. . .""So starts out Mary Webb in her book about Prudence Sarn of Sarn, a place in Shropshire, England. I found a page overlapping poetry and flowers, Blossom vs Bloom vs Flower vs Blow which helped me out in the above-given start of the book: Blow, in this sense, has an archaic or poetic flavor except in the combination ""full-blown"". Usually it suggest a bursting into flower or bloom and often, especially in the noun, connotes a great display of blooms. . . . .Blow, by far the least frequent of these terms in such use, implies a BURSTING into beauty or perfection.On one hand this is a very old book - almost 100 years ago written, and the subject era is centuries before that - YET, it has a young woman in a community with a flurry of other young women working toward the community good and at the same time are thinking about young men, any men and pairing up. About parties, about family life to come, or not, or those who choose a different direction. . .all those same concerns wherever people are, then and now. Party games happen, songs and music of its time and day, skirts flouncing, clothes that make the woman or the man, and worries over giving trinkets, kerchiefs or whatever the love currency of the day is. . .The storyline wrapped around a girl, flawed and anxious. She is hare-shotten in a time that has no surgical remedy. Those around her ensure she is constantly reminded of it. Not out of any kind of sympathy or compassion, just a knock in the heart to remind her that she needs to be tough, pragmatic and understand she's not one of the pretty or even normal girls in the world. Her's will not be the fate to be a mother: because she's not lovable (read: not f**kable, not even kissable). Who would kiss that mouth?I fell in love with Prue, her bravery and her belief that her one crumb of happiness could carry her through life, and it did. . .until her argument was shut-down in the best way all such arguments can be shut-down. . .and *boom* ?*blow?*. . .waaaay better than a crumb. . ....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,"Jul 15, 2023","Sep 14, 2023","Jul 15, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/779509.Precious_Bane

She's humanity at its best, too. Only maybe even more loveable. Then there are about 99+ more characters, including humans and non-humans (earthly and non-earthly).

Stan's deepest fear, proved true, over and over: he's a deathmonger. You know that guy, the black cloak and bony pointing finger? And this terrifying possibility: it is catching. To know Stanhope is to die (before your time, probably). What does a caring human do when they land on this realization about themselves? What is the right thing to do? Essential questions are posed, and the story goes, steady on. Words flow, bouncing from page first to page last by life's currents and wind. As you wonder on Stanhope's trajectory and responses to it, you'll inevitably ponder on your own.Oh, in case, fellow Reader, should you worry about open-ended or woebegone conclusions, toss that worry behind you.

Prior to reading this book, my knowledge was limited to knowing George VI and Elizabeth (from Scotland) were Elizabeth (from England) II's parents, Himself possessed of a stubborn stutter, played by Colin Firth on the Big Screen, and Herself being a Darling Ancient Granny who looked like she could wield a mean ""fish eye"" even from under those size-of-a-toaster hats.When the title came into view, my nose wrinkled and my thought was, ?Really? saved the monarchy? Aren't royals forever, over there? Well, this side of the read (long, well-researched, forthcoming and very readable) I'm convinced. This truly would have been a terrible world if those two hadn't set up certain possibilities on that little island of this world during that exact time. I couldn't begin to convince you, dear reader, so won't try. However, to bring up what they gave you and I (and we probably aren't even UK citizens) is the opportunity for peace in a way that never would have happened if all had gone as it was ""planned"" to go. That is to say giving King Edward VIII (David, Duke of Windsor, Hubby of The Wallis) the throne on his terms (i.e. Queen Wallis) and his continued rule as a Hitler/Nazi fan, buddies-forever paperwork had already been started when the people of England pulled that plug (thank you!). But there had to be someone willing to step up (and there were), but Bertie (George VI is his king name) and his Elizabeth were not headed for a kingly track at all. . . but abdication changed it all. They stepped up to the plate and dedicated themselves and generations of their family to the monarchy.The author had been given access by the Royals (esp Elizabeth II) to the letters, journals, diaries of the many, many players in all these periods of the lives of George VI and Elizabeth from the start to the finish of both of their lives. It was interesting and thorough, with great photos to give context and insight into their work and dedication, as well as the incredible challenges they faced: world wars, colonial empire imploding, economic struggles and on-island questions about the monarchy construct and its relevancy. This book doesn't try to answer any of those - it simply provides a reader the view in the window (balcony?) as to what they faced. More than once my still small voice was yelling ""RUN!""Highly recommended for anyone who follows the Royals or is interested in that particular period of England's history.

The rush of excitement, to thrills brought on by the idea of wealth and unlimited resources, and having every nagging bill paid, with more to spare. . . .followed by those gathering arms pulling all that gold into YOUR pot, not theirs. . .the hunching over, beady eyes watchful for a wandering hand that might try and slide some away from your pile. . . it was all very dragon-in-the-gold-tolkieny. . .Both husband and wife have their versions of the above joy-to-excitement-to greed-to. . .the stunning realization that now that this has happened, you'll never be the same as you were the moments before the possibility of winning the lottery flashed your existence to pieces. Whether you win or lose, doesn't matter. Your piddly bit of life's pie is pale and tasteless in the whole scheme of things. Your happy partnership is anything but. . .I had to shake my head hard after this read, this quick, lightening strike of a read.

I go back to it over and over, and he says it best himself, so I will leave it in his hands:“My Nobel appeal: it’s hard to put the whole world to rights, but let us at least think about how we can prepare our own small corner of it, this corner of literature where we read, write, publish, recommend, denounce, and give awards to books. If we are to play an important role in this uncertain future, if we are to get the best from the writers of today and tomorrow, I believe we must become more diverse. I mean this in two particular senses.Firstly, we must widen our common literary world to include many more voices from beyond our comfort zones of the elite first world cultures. We must search more energetically to discover the gems from what remain today unknown literary cultures, whether the writers live in faraway countries or within our own communities.Second, we must take great care not to set too narrowly or conservatively our definitions of what constitutes good literature. The next generation will come with all sorts of new, sometimes bewildering ways to tell important and wonderful stories. We must keep our minds open to them, especially regarding genre and form, so that we can nurture and celebrate the best of them. In a time of dangerously increasing division we must listen. Good writing and good reading will break down barriers. We may even find a new idea, a great humane vision around which to rally.”...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jul 10, 2023","Jul 12, 2023","Jul 10, 2023",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/36655283-my-twentieth-century-evening-and-other-small-breakthroughs
