It is a testament to the power of the novel that I, for one, cried at that ending.I started the book with more than a little scepticism because -- well, surrealism --, but within 30 pages I was totally hooked.I read it in French; there are, I believe, three translations in English. My internet research suggests that the earliest of these, ""Froth on the Daydream"" by Stanley Chapman, may be preferable, though judging the calibre of literary translation is a tricky game at best. American readers may prefer the more recent translation, ""Foam of the Daze"", by Brian Harper.Jazz, the fantastical musical-olfactory invention of the pianocktail, death by water-lily, eels in the plumbing, the central doomed love-story of Colin and Chloé, Colin's friend Chick's fatal obsession with the works of ""Jean-Sol Partre"" -- heck, one can list the ingredients of this magnificent book without ever coming close to conveying its magic.You will just have to seek it out for yourself.

But then, somehow, it took off (for me, at least). Which surprised the hell out of me, to be honest. Because normally I just can't abide descriptions of furniture, and rooms and stuff -- I tend to skim right over it. Perec spends an inordinate amount of space in describing the furnishings, when he's not making up amusingly wacky lists, or telling another shaggy dog story about some guy getting fleeced or murdered or jilted in some suitably exotic locale. Then there's the whole Oulipian constraint machinery because, you know, Perec. Apart from a bunch of ruminating about jigsaw puzzles, the big one is that the apartment building is laid out like a 10 x 10 grid, the chapters move around on this grid following a knight's tour trajectory. Then there's some other stuff about matching the constraints to the chapters according to a Graeco-Latin square design, though to be honest it's not clear that those particular constraints add a while lot to the soul of the book.Because yes, the book most decidedly has a soul. It's not just the kind of sterile, cerebral Oulipian exercise you might be imagining. Literary references out the wazoo, fun to spot if you enjoy that kind of game. A surprisingly poignant central trio of characters (the jigsaw jokers).Oh, and quest stories. This book has an inordinate number of quest stories. Mostly they do not end well.What I'm not managing to convey here is how much fun this book is. Clearly Monsieur Perec was a wicked smart dude.

But I certainly couldn't write about them as accurately and hilariously as he does. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Feb 28, 2013","May 26, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13159149-paris-i-love-you-but-you-re-bringing-me-down

But I never got over the nasty taste in my mouth induced by some really mean-spirited drive-by ad hominem assassination of someone I guess Dennett still holds a shiv for -- Stephen Jay Gould. The odd thing is that, on the issues in question, intellectually I would side with Dennett rather than Gould. But continuing to attack an opponent after the person in question is dead and in no position to mount a defence strikes me as being both unnecessarily shrill and betraying an unattractive insecurity of his own at some level. Anyway, if you can overlook the nastiness of the chapter attacking Gould (in which the arguments may have merit, but the tone is unforgivable and inappropriate), this is a pretty decent book.The last quarter of the book is the weakest, where his arguments linking consciousness and evolution simply fail to gel, in my opinion.

Maybe because the whole thing feels too much like a cerebral exercise -- the characters are there just as a means of exploring the fallibility of memory, not because there's a story that needs to be told. I like a good story myself.Update: 2 months later.Oh dear. This ""critically acclaimed"" ""novel of ideas"" turns out to be just the kind of book that exposes me for what I am. The kind of reader who finds a certain kind of serious ""novel of ideas"" to be essentially unreadable. I like Rosecrans Baldwin (for reasons I'll explain below), I could see him straining to write a serious novel that would receive critical acclaim, I was rooting for him to succeed. And possibly, for some subset of discerning readers, he has. Those readers will need more patience than me. I found the characters uninteresting, the structural devices a little too forced, and the prose was way too solemn for my taste.Here's the thing. While he was writing this novel, Rosecrans Baldwin spent 18 months in Paris working for a French ad agency. He documents this (often surreal) experience in a much looser, almost gossipy account called ""Paris, I Love You, But You're Bringing me Down"". That book is terrific -- in it, he manages to nail the absurdities of Parisian life hilariously.I hate to say it, but the book that was presumably written as a diversion ended up being far better than ""You Lost Me There"". Not an entirely fair judgment, of course, since I never did manage to finish that earnest ""novel of ideas"" (insert weak ""He lost me there"" jokelet ad lib). I am, of course, a confirmed philistine*, and your mileage may vary.*: Despite my philistine status, I make no apologies for holding all authors to the minimum standard of writing a book that the reader will actually, you know, want to keep reading.

Sentence by sentence, chapter by chapter, she is never less than smart and beguiling, so reading her books is usually pretty enjoyable. Her writing skill reminds me a bit of David Foster Wallace, which is to say that she can generally manage to pull off any stylistic challenge and make it look effortless. Like DFW, she is also extraordinarily smart, though not quite as ostentatiously so (which is a relief). So one is rarely bored by what she has to say.I read NW in January. Upon finishing it, I was motivated to read her earlier novels -- White Teeth, which I had around the house for ever and never gotten to, and The Autograph Man, which I had picked up somewhere for three dollars. I read ""On Beauty"" last summer, and her superb essay collection, ""Changing My Mind"", a few years ago (link to ))Of the four novels, the least known (The Autograph Man) was the one I liked best. White Teeth was impressive, amazingly accomplished for a debut novel, fun to read, but ultimately it left me unmoved. This could be just a failure on my part to engage with a key character who we first see in the process of botching his suicide. Though I do think that the characterization in White Teeth was weak (a flaw that is not repeated in the subsequent novels). In On Beauty Smith was apparently working out some kind of convoluted homage to EM Forster's Howard's End. It was skillfully executed, but I never managed to care, even remotely, about the extra-marital adventures of the adulterous academics. Nor about the idiocies perpetrated in the name of political correctness in the academy, a target so obvious it fails to be interesting.Why I liked The Autograph Man: the characters had just the right level of weirdness to be convincing, without giving the impression each one was there to express a specific point of view, and I enjoyed the somewhat rambling, shaggy-dog, nature of the story.

Though the book's portrait of the cracks in a foundering marriage between two Brooklyn hipsters (well, late 1960s hipsters) didn't resonate with me nearly quite as deeply as it obviously did with Franzen, it was pretty impressive. As the story opens, the privileged contentment of Otto and Sophie is broken when she is badly bitten while feeding a stray cat. This seemingly trivial incident triggers a series of events that shatters the couple's complacency and leaves the stability of their marriage in question. Fox tells this story in a way that really gets under your skin, presenting her characters with a kind of merciless acuity. The writing is economical (the book is under 200 pages) and brilliant - the rising sense of tension as we watch Fox's ""desperate characters"" unravel is extraordinary. Franzen is right - this book is well worth your attention. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Jul 31, 2012","Aug 12, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/96544.Desperate_Characters

The reasons for me to dislike it were numerous -- its enormous literary debt to the Harry Potter and Narnia books, (neither a series that I have ever been able to finish), third person narration from the point of view of the main protagonist, Quentin, who remains a total git from start to finish, and whose companions share the sense of jaded superiority of the charmed inner circle of ""The Secret History"" and the kind of annoying nihilism of the characters in ""Less Than Zero"". But the fact is, once I started it, I couldn't stop. I read the thing in just two sittings. So I have to give points for that. The writing is adequate, with occasional set pieces that soar (sometimes literally -- my favorite part was when the students are transformed into Canada geese for their migration to Brakebills South). The pacing could have been tighter. Characterization was often perfunctory (Quentin's parents, in particular). The ""hero"" is pretty much a jerk throughout, exhibiting precious little in the way of emotional growth for a Bildungsroman.But, for some reason, ""The Magicians"" still worked for me. Despite its obvious flaws, I really enjoyed it.Other s make the criticism that the book is nothing more than a ""ripoff"" of the Harry Potter and Narnia books. This seems to me to miss the mark. Grossman has indeed borrowed many elements from the worlds of Hogwarts and Narnia. But he has used them to fashion a story that is indisputably original. One that may not be completely to the liking of Potter or Narnia fans, however.Your mileage may vary, but it would be wrong to dismiss ""The Magicians"" out of hand....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Aug 12, 2012","Aug 12, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6101718-the-magicians

Two aspects irritated me -- I thought several of the author's chosen analogies were dreadful -- clunky and not particularly apt. The silliness of the metaphor that humans are Homo Duplex -- ""90% chimp, 10% bee"" -- is just so jarring that it distracts the reader from the argument. Similarly, I found his other recurrent metaphor, that for our rational and intuitive mental processes -- ""The mind is divided like a rider on an elephant, and the rider's job is to serve the elephant"" -- to be severely deficient. And the less said about the unfortunate phrase ""taste buds of the righteous mind"" the better. Not to mention crimes against the language like ""groupishness"", ""Durkheimogens"", or the ""hive switch"".However, though I did find these stylistic tics annoying, in the end they are minor flaws in a book which was fascinating, highly readable, and thought-provoking. I found it considerably more interesting than I did ""The Happiness Hypothesis"". The first third of the book, about the origins and dimensions of moral intuition, is very much the author's home turf, and he writes about it lucidly and authoritatively. The second section, which attempts to explain the development of human moral sense in evolutionary terms, was not fully convincing (to me). But it was thought-provoking and well-written -- the arguments are laid out clearly, so the reader can judge them on their merits. On the topic of religion, Haidt's arguments are considerably more interesting, and expressed with far greater civility, than the shrill invective doled out by the anti-God group of Dawkins, Dennett, and Harris.The last couple of chapters in the book, in which the author examines the polarization and loss of civility that has crept in to American political life in the last decades, are fascinating. In particular, his explanation for the difference in moral priorities between liberals and conservatives rings true. Both sides battle it out, on a variety of social and political issues, each convinced they occupy the moral high ground, increasingly dismissive of their opponents. Whether or not you believe Haidt's claim that this very human trait of moral superiority is a logical result of evolutionary pressure, its potential to be destructive in the political sphere is obvious. The author (wisely) offers no magic solution to the ever-more bitter polarization of the American electorate, concluding instead with what is essentially a call to the better angels of our nature. The question posed by Rodney King, back in 1992, has never been more relevant - ""Can we all get along?""

But, based on the quality of the writing in the ""Wolf Hall"" books, I would.You wouldn't think it possible to tell the story of the Tudors and make it fresh. But Mantel succeeds once again, brilliantly.Added on edit after finishing:The last 50 pages of this are frightening, and frighteningly good. James Wood offers far more insight into what he calls Mantel's ""novelistic intelligence"", also on the topic of ""authenticity"" (where he makes a compelling case that fiction can offer a kind of authenticity that actually surpasses historical accuracy) than I ever could (though I found myself agreeing with everything he wrote, and the examples he cites are the same ones I would cite), so here is a link to his  -- I think it is accessible even in you don't have a New Yorker subscription.

There's nothing here to change my impression that Gibson is smart, and a fundamentally nice guy. But pieces like the 1993 essay about his impressions of Singapore for ""Wired"", or two essentially similar 2001 pieces about the futuristic appeal of Tokyo as a setting for his fiction were probably only modestly interesting when first published and have not improved with age. As coiner of the term ""cyberspace"", Gibson is probably doomed to suffer a lifetime of being asked to write pieces that try to predict the future. Does reprinting such efforts really address some deep-seated need among the reading public? I doubt it. To his credit, Gibson adds a little coda to each such dated piece, in which he signals his own embarrassment at serving it up again. One senses this book was the brainchild of some enthusiastic soul working for his publisher. It is a fundamentally misbegotten effort.If you have yet to discover the fun to be had in reading Gibson, try ""Neuromancer"". Or ""Pattern Recognition"". Or ""Spook Country"". Or any of his fiction.

He has already written two perfectly decent books about the English language - ""Defining the World"" and ""The Secret Life of Words"". The first was about the OED; I haven't read the second. He is obviously interested in English, given that he keeps coming back to it. He is thorough and methodical, meticulous in acknowledging the work of others. His sentences are grammatical.Unfortunately, they are also, for the most part, exceedingly dull. Some authors write about language with a passion that is infectious. This is not Hitchings's way. His preferred style is a kind of restrained reasonableness that would be laudable if only it weren't so terribly dull.The final six chapters, in which he focuses on the state of modern English, were more lively than the historical material that forms the core of the book. Unfortunately, given the total of 28 chapters, these represented only about 20% of the book. Earlier chapters had titles that titillated (""Bishop Lowth Was a Fool!"", ""Of Fish-knives and Fist-fucks""), but did not live up to their promise. I want to give it a third star, but I can't.

The thin gruel of that effort, with its dull, forgettable main protagonist left me with an appetite for a real story, with characters that would actually engage the reader's interest. And yes, stretching this tortured metaphor a little farther, Hensher's book satisfied my craving - it's a hearty beef stew (or maybe a bouillabaisse), with a large cast of characters, satisfyingly complex plotting, written with a kind of malicious affection. The book is set in the fictional seaside town of Hanfield, a kind of smug, upper-middle class enclave. The story opens with the abduction of a child in broad daylight; the subsequent investigation and media frenzy shatters the complacency of locals. As the story progresses, Hensher digs below the surface, exposing the foibles of his characters with a certain malicious glee, but also with affection. The development is more tightly controlled than in the somewhat undisciplined ""Northern Clemency"", and the writing is excellent. A good story, well told.

Not even WrestleMania. So how did they while away those long winter evenings? Episodes of Mr DThe Victorians didn't have internet porn or reality TV. Not even WrestleMania. So how did they while away those long winter evenings? Episodes of Mr Dickens's charming serialized novels were maddeningly infrequent, and publicly ostracizing those judged to be morally inferior, though fun and necessary, was hardly a full-time pursuit. Fortunately, there were people like George Washington Moon, ready to fill that entertainment vacuum. Like many an educated Victorian gentleman, George read the august Dean of Canterbury's essays instructing lesser mortals on the proper use of the Queen's English. AND HE FOUND THEM WANTING. A lesser man might have sneered inwardly over his glass of port and left it at that. But George knew that this would be a dereliction of responsibility. He owed it to the world to set things right. He became a man with a mission. The Dean's crimes had to be exposed to the world. As he explains so forcefully in his introduction to this hilarious piece of sustained invective, nothing personal against the Dean, it's just that""He who hunts down and pillories a slang phrase, a vulgarism, a corruption of any kind, is a public benefactor. In the fulfillment of the sacred trust which rests on him as an educated man, he adds a stone to the bulwark of his nation's safety and greatness.""He's just doing his duty to protect the Empire. Furthermore, he reminds us that ""The power of sneering was given to man to be used; and nothing is more gratifying than to see an idea which is proving a nuisance, sent clattering away with a hue and cry after it, and a tin kettle tied to its tail"". All this is by way of a warmup, alerting us that things might get a little bloody once he really hits his stride. Which he does, for 154 well-argued, magnificently contemptuous, pages. G.W. Moon is relentless. The Dean never stands a chance. The whole fracas was the Victorian equivalent of a PayPerView televised cage match between Stone Cold Steve Austin and ""The Rock"". Hulk Hogan versus Rowdy Roddy Piper. Bret Harte versus Shawn Michaels. Alexis versus Krystle. Moon unleashed his invective in instalments, after each episode, the Doctor would gamely try to defend himself, only to be further bloodied in the next round. AS the fight unfolded, all of Britain's educated class watched from the sidelines, thoroughly enjoying the spectacle. In the words of ""The Phonetic Journal"""".... to those who enjoy a controversy, conducted with consummate skill and in excellent taste, by a strong man, well armed, it is such a treat as does not fall in one's way often during a lifetime."" So the mauling of the Dean was accomplished in instalments, avidly followed by the entire educated class of Britain, and later by the intellectual class in the U.S. One senses that his death, in 1870, must have come as a welcome release. The chapters by G.W. Moon form the core of this book. An appendix contains several s of the Dean's book by independent sources, as well as s that address both the Dean's book and Moon's critiques. The verdict is fairly uniform -- the body lying bleeding on the mat at the end of the final round is that of the Dean.I'll confess to a fatal weakness for this kind of thing. A literary cage match between two public intellectuals? About English usage? Where the rules of decorum must be observed, so that the nastiness has to be polite (always the most fun)?

Is it now obligatory for intellectuals, having established their reputation in one discipline (maybe even two) to try to dazzle us further by writing essays (or, God forbid, entire books) about completely random stuff in which they appear to have no particular expertise?* I expect to find Professor Schama writing about history, or art, or art history. I'm not so sure I care that much about what he has to say about travelling, cooking, eating, and I am absolutely sure I don't want to read his writing about baseball. And while he is obviously within his rights to include the transcripts of lectures he was invited to deliver on some honorific occasion, omitting them might have been wiser. Because, frankly, that one lecture ""Gothic Language: Carlyle, Ruskin and the Morality of Exuberance"" might have been terrific when delivered in person with Professor Schama's indisputable panache. But, in print, it seems so ridiculously overblown that it borders on parody, like some kind of academic in-joke. You don't need to show off for me, Professor Schama, I know you're smart as all get out, and it's just kind of embarrassing for everyone when the compulsion to rub our noses in it gets the better of you. For example:as an introduction,  You always remember where it was that you first read the books that changed your life.I first read Macaulay: The Shaping of the Historian in September 1976 in rocky, Medusa-infested coves on the Aegean islands of Hydra and Spetsai. might be a perfectly true statement, but it doesn't endear you to the reader. It's a little ... obnoxious, perhaps. Not that pleasing the reader is the be all and end all, but a few of these essays provoke the question of whether they were written to be read, or just admired.So I didn't care much for the recipes, the baseball essay, the fluffier travel pieces; it's a matter of personal taste. I'm too much of a philistine to be interested in essays about Macaulay, Carlyle, and Ruskin and their views about how history should be written. It was a nice gesture to include an essay about your history tutor at Oxford, but very few people are likely to read it all the way through. Before I seem to be a complete grouch, let me say clearly that some of the essays in this book are extraordinary. Ten of them are sublime. These are the essays focusing on the visual arts. Schama's writing about art is hypnotic - you want him never to stop (even when Ruskin is involved). These essays make up about a quarter of this book. They alone are well worth the entrance fee. If someone could persuade Professor Schama to stick to his strong points and write another dozen such essays, I for one would be happy. I am not ever likely to be interested in Professor Schama's recipes. Not for ice cream, not for cheese souffle, not for bolognese sauce. But if he writes about art, I'll read every word. ########################################################### *: Well, not completely random stuff -- one standard gimmick is to travel somewhere a little off the beaten path (or not) and cobble together some kind of impressions piece. It appears to be a common belief that such pieces are necessarily fascinating (public intellectual in exotic location = searing insights etc etc); the results are often fodder for the Sunday supplements, but rarely attain a shelf-life beyond that. I guess what I'm suggesting is that not every newspaper or magazine article merits inclusion in a collection like this. It seems unfair to single Professor Schama out for criticism in this respect; I have on my desk Updike's hefty ""Higher Gossip"", a collection of pieces that weighs in at 500 pages. Mostly, it's great stuff, but I would have much preferred the skinnier, 350-page collection struggling to get out, the one that omitted Updike's thoughts about golf, dinosaurs, cosmology, Mars, and Einstein, and where the editor's gentle reminder that transcripts of past speeches often age badly had been heeded.And why, in the name of God, is Steven Pinker now writing books that attempt (in a highly dubious, completely unreadable fashion, if you ask me) to analyze the history of human violence.

It's on page 389, it's called ""Why Women Aren't Funny"", it's as stupid as it sounds, and it makes Hitchens seem like a complete tool. Upon reading it, you may be tempted to engage in a little confirmation bias, remembering a certain perceived shrillness in his contribution to the whole God debate thing. And wasn't he the guy who trashed Mother Theresa?Slow down there. Time for a reality check. A few salient facts:1) Mother Theresa undoubtedly had it coming (just ask Sinead O' Connor).2) That dumb ""Why Women Aren't Funny"" is the ONLY DUD ESSAY IN THIS BOOK. Which means that Hitchens is batting over 99% here. Think about that for a while. When was the last time you came across a nonfiction collection with those kinds of numbers?3) Yes, he can be scathing. But, to an impressive degree, it's only when provoked.4) A defining feature of these essays, particularly those dealing with other authors, is their generosity of spirit. Frankly, this surprised me a good deal, because it didn't square with my preconceived notion of Hitchens as a kind of super-erudite arrogant asshole. He is indeed super-erudite. He can be a contrarian - it's a position he obviously enjoys. But he is not a jerk; quite the opposite, on the basis of these essays, at any rate.5) A major part of the considerable appeal of this collection is just the fun in seeing such an intelligent mind at work. I recycled that sentence from my  of Zadie Smith's essay collection, but it's true a fortiori in Hitchens's case.Among these essays, my clear favorites are those in which Hitchens discusses the work of other writers. There are about 30 of these, focusing primarily on English authors (though Flaubert, Marx, and Stieg Larsson make an appearance, as do Updike, Nabokov, Bellow, Twain, and Upton Sinclair). These essays benefit not only from Hitchens's apparently boundless erudition (lightly worn), but from his obvious desire always to educate the reader about the best qualities of the work under discussion. His introduction to Rebecca West's ""Black Lamb and Grey Falcon"" is simply astonishing. I cannot imagine a better introduction being written. To anything. Ever. Unless there's divine or demonic intervention. Maybe not even then. At the time, I didn't pay all that much attention to Hitchen's death.

His ability to write with extraordinary force and clarity has been demonstThis seems like a stunning misstep by the normally brilliant Steven Pinker. His ability to write with extraordinary force and clarity has been demonstrated repeatedly in two separate areas of expertise -- linguistics and cognitive science. Unfortunately, the brilliance of his earlier books in those areas is nowhere in evidence in this regrettable dog's breakfast of a book. I found it almost unreadable - poorly argued, undisciplined, self-indulgent, and - despite its grotesquely bloated length (800 pages) - support for its main thesis is woefully inadequate, dependent on a highly selective interpretation of existing data and completely unconvincing. Pinker can sling the statistical jargon (Poisson processes, power laws, the gambler's fallacy, the Gini coefficient) like a pro, but all the jargon in the world cannot make up for his recurrent habit of over- or mis-interpreting data whose limitations he consistently glosses over. The jacket cover breathlessly promises ""more than a hundred graphs and maps"". Any graph is open to misinterpretation. Three of the most common ways of doing so are (i) selective interpretation (ignoring or explaining away the data that don't fit one's preconceived ideas) (ii) inappropriate extrapolation beyond the range of available data and (iii) failure to acknowledge the data's limitations, such as likely sources of bias, or extreme sparsity of information. Pinker commits each of these errors, with such numbing frequency that one loses all respect. We are seriously asked to draw conclusions from a graph of the ""rate of battle deaths in state-based armed conflicts between 1900 and 2005"" (Figure 6-1) while being instructed to ignore the figures for the first and second world wars. After all, ""the world has seen nothing close to that level since"". This kind of rubbish insults the intelligence. Or you could look at Figure 7-28. Lest you be distracted by the actual data, Pinker has helpfully superimposed some very impressive looking solid lines documenting his cheerful belief in the rise of vegetarianism. These are much darker than the actual data points, presumably in the hope that the reader might be distracted from noting their complete lack of fit to the data. Worried about racially motivated killing of black people? Here are the yearly data (number of such killings) from 1996 to 2008:5,3,3,4,3,3,3,4,1,2,1,1,1Pinker's gleeful trumpeting of a five-fold reduction seems to rest on a pretty flimsy foundation to me. Not to mention being a little premature. But nothing as inconvenient as facts, or their absence, can stand in the way of a man who has already decided he knows the answer. The threat of nuclear holocaust? Exaggerated, because - as any fool can see - nuclear weapons have never been used in wartime since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. One imagines this argument must be of great comfort to those who survived those particular ""anomalies"". Just as Pinker's breezy insistence that the only meaningful way to interpret the number of people killed in a given conflict is relative to the world's population at the time is surely meaningless to anyone who has lost a family member in battle. It's at best breathtakingly insensitive; some would find it deeply offensive. To anyone who respects the scientific method, this is a horrifyingly bad book, one which completely obliterates Pinker's credibility.

According to his introduction, Cardiff tried to follow the structure that Updike himself had imposed on the previous six collections; the pieces are organized into five main categories. These areReal Conversation (stories and poems not included in previous collections, ~ 50 pages)Book Chat (book s, pieces about writing and the work of other authors, ~ 150 pages)Gallery Tours (s of specific art exhibitions and pieces about the visual arts, ~ 150 pages)Pet Topics (idiosyncratic pieces, spanning a range of topics that piqued Updike's interest, ~ 50 pages)Table Talk (pieces about Updike's own writing, the literary landscape in general, transcriptions of invited addresses ~ 80 pages)In total, it amounts to a hefty 500 pages. By the time I got to the end, I found myself wishing hard that Cardiff had stopped after the first three sections. 500 pages in hardback is hefty to have to carry around and the last two sections did not sustain my interest. I believe that essays reflecting an author's personal enthusiasms need to do at least one of two things (preferably both) to succeed: (i) transmit the sense of enthusiasm (i.e. make the reader understand what sparked it) (ii) provide the reader with some fresh insight. I thought the great majority of pieces classified as ""Pet Topics"" failed -- I get it that Updike was interested in dinosaurs, Mars, specific places in Massachusetts, and (God forgive him) golf, but what he wrote about these topics didn't manage to spark my interest. ""Pet Topics"" is the weakest part of this collection. The ""Table Talk"" pieces were a little more interesting, I particularly appreciated the inclusion of Updike's recommendations on book ing. But I have to think that his ""x-years later"" assessments of his own earlier works will be of interest only to those who have read and enjoyed the works in question. And though I know that including transcripts of an author's presentations is standard practice for this kind of collection, I'm not sure these transcripts necessarily make interesting reading. For instance, Updike's commencement address to the Amherst class of 1993 is interesting only in a negative sense - it seems completely anodyne and totally irrelevant. Nonetheless, the pieces in this section will likely be interesting for true Updike junkies.The good news is that the first three sections of this book (350 out of 500 pages!) are pretty much uniformly terrific. I've quibbled enough (some might say too much). So let me acknowledge what a joy it is to read Updike's book s, that his generous assessments of the works of other authors are inspiring. His writing about art and artists may not match the pyrotechnics of, say, Simon Schama, but it is lucid, persuasive, unpretentious, and highly accessible. The first three sections of this collection are a reminder of Updike's particular strengths, and of how much he will be missed. If the book stopped there, I'd give it 4 stars, but the weaker material towards the end prevents me from doing so....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Nov 30, 2011","Feb 07, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11258707-higher-gossip

This might not sound all that interesting, but the way O'Nan tells this story is riveting, and very moving.If all his books are this good, then he is one of the most under-rated novelists writing today. His portrait of Emily will linger with you long after you have finished this extraordinary book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jan 21, 2012","Feb 06, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9412055-emily-alone

John Jeremiah Sullivan was someone I had never heard of until I stumbled across this collection in the bookstore, but I'm happy to report that his writing has an idiosyncratic charm that puts him right up there with the big guys.As with any collection of essays, there are a few duds in this collection. Sullivan's pieces on Axl Rose and on Michael Jackson seemed meandering, a little self-indulgent, with no obvious point. But these are the exceptions. They are more than offset by the essays ""Upon This Rock"", ""Lahwineski: Career of an Eccentric Naturalist"", ""Mr Lytle"", in each of which Sullivan takes a topic about which I had no prior knowledge or interest and writes about it in a way that is spellbinding. Besides a fluid, unassuming writing style, Sullivan's gift is to write about obscure topics in a way that engages the reader's interest and sympathy.Reading the jacket cover for ""Pulphead"", I see comparisons to the essays of David Foster Wallace. This seems partially correct to me -- Sullivan has the same ability to take the most unlikely subject and make it fascinating to the reader, and like DFW, he writes with great empathy and without condescension. He does not, however, display the self-consciousness that plagued DFW, nor does his writing suffer from the kind of stylistic tic that can result when an author worries too much about the impression he may be making. He does not match Foster Wallace's brilliance, but he is definitely smart and compassionate enough to merit your attention. John Jeremiah Sullivan is an author worth looking out for.

Those dealing with foreign economies (Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Germany) appear to be based on visits Lewis made to the countries in question between late 2008 and mid 2011. My Irish cousins were dismissive of his account of the Irish economic meltdown, characterizing it as a ""drive-by piece based on a five-day visit"". I don't agree. Even if his visit to Ireland was short, his account of events seems essentially accurate to me. There is a whole slew of books available by now documenting the various abuses and excesses that led to the global financial meltdown (including Lewis's ""The Big Short"").

I have no doubt that the research reported on in this book is genuine, if only because of its excruciatingly tedious nature. Frankly, it's hard to get excited (or even to stay awake) about work that uses word-counting as its primary tool, particularly given Doctor P's fawningly enthusiastic invocation of factor analysis as a legitimate statistical method. Even a reader willing to overlook this (serious) deficiency is likely to be bludgeoned into a state of anesthetized indifference by the pedestrian prose and the sheer banality of the conclusions. It probably didn't help that I read this book immediately after finishing ""Thinking Fast and Slow"". Daniel Kahneman's clear, careful, measured exposition reminds us that work in experimental psychology can be reported with lucidity and elegance. The mix of anecdotal evidence, statement of the bloody obvious, and somewhat dubious over-generalization found in this book has to be considered a disappointment. And the whole obsession with pronoun usage seems entirely overblown, and not at all convincing. Upon reflection, and after reading Trevor's excellent, take-no-prisoners , (http://www.goodreads.com//show/...) I have to agree with his assessment and downgrade this to a single star. I will spare Pennebaker the indignity of the ""intellectual con artist at work"" shelf, if only because I kind of feel sorry for anyone whose life work involves research as pathetically boring as his appears to be. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,"Dec 28, 2011","Feb 05, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10890464-the-secret-life-of-pronouns

With his characteristic understated prose and perfect pitch, Toibin examines themes of exile, loss, and regret. Most of the characters in these stories have made a choice to leave their place of origin (Ireland, Spain, Pakistan - in most of the stories Toibin is interested in exploring the regrets that such a choice can bring. In ""Two Women"", a film project brings highly successful set designer, Frances, back to Dublin, where a chance encounter forces her to confront memories of the only man she ever truly loved; the narrator of ""One Minus One"" relives the emotions triggered by his return home to Ireland to be there for his mother's death; Carme, in ""The New Spain"" returns to her grandmother's home in Menorca, after an eight-year exile in London, where she is forced to come to terms with her family, and her grandmother's death, in the new Post-Franco Spain. Although regret about the road not taken is a dominant theme, most of Toibin's characters achieve a degree of resolution. As always, Toibin's writing is superb; his skill when writing about women is particularly impressive. I liked all but one of these stories, but two in particular stand out: ""The Silence"" and ""The Street"". One brilliantly imagines a confessional encounter at dinner between Lady Gregory and Henry James, the other is the story of a taboo relationship between two Pakistani men working in Barcelona. Toibin's ability to write about such disparate characters in a way that is utterly convincing is one of his major strengths. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Feb 04, 2012","Feb 06, 2012","Feb 04, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7823598-the-empty-family

Over the last few years I've given a fair amount of thought to efficient strategies for language acquisition, as well as to the challenges of switching among languages. I don't have any simple answers.Neither does Michael Erard, which is probably a point in his favor. In researching this book he set out to investigate the phenomenon that he refers to (excruciatingly, in my view) as ""hyperpolyglottery"". Acknowledging the difficulties inherent in judging such concepts as ""fluency"" or ""mastery"" (particularly in the case of historical figures), Erard adopts a working definition of a ""hyperpolyglot"" as someone who exhibits mastery of at least six distinct languages. By studying a number of hyperpolyglots, he hopes to gain insight into the process of language acquisition.The results of his research are frankly disappointing. The book introduces us to a number of reasonably entertaining characters, though one of its primary conclusions seems to be that claims of ""hyperpolyglottery"" (it hurts me to type that ""word"", it's so ugly) are invariably exaggerated. The tribe of those claiming extraordinary linguistic capacities is rife with impostors and self-promoters. And the evidence provided by the small number of people whose linguistic abilities seem genuinely exceptional amounts to little more than a series of case studies.

I've always felt that Barnes's cleverness is his Achilles heel -- too often his writing feels like an exercise designed to demonstrate how accomplished he is, but remains devoid of emotion. Most of the stories in this collection manage to avoid this trap. A possible exception is the set of four linked pieces ""At Phil and Joanna's"", each of which is basically an extended conversational riff among a group of old married friends - these are technically impressive, maybe a little too much so to be genuinely affecting. In contrast, the stories ""East Wind"", ""Trespass"", and the title story pack a real emotional punch. There is the usual quota of emotionally stunted middle-aged men trying to make some kind of connection, not always successfully. But at least Barnes writes about them with a measure of sympathy, rising above the almost clinical detachment that characterized ""The Sense of an Ending"". These are stories with heart, in sharp contrast to the emotional vacuum at the core of that book.

A surprising number of goodreads ers appear to have taken the bait, and chastised Ms Goodman for not actually living up to the hype. Quite a few objected to the particular reader who did the audio-book. This doesn't seem completely fair.The Cookbook Collector is a decent, but flawed, novel. The two main protagonists, sisters Emily and Jess, are well-developed, interesting characters, and Goodman does a good job of making us care about what happens to them. Other characters are less convincing. In particular, neither of the sister's love interests came to life in a credible way -- both seemed little more than an assortment of tics/stereotypes. Plotting was more than a little predictable, and using the 9/11 attacks as a plot resolution device seems regrettably lazy. On the plus side, Goodman writes convincingly about the dot.com culture and is often quite funny. But ultimately, there is too much of an air of wish fulfillment about the story to make it much more than a pleasant, but forgettable, read. But, what do I know?

Need to give it some distance.OK. here is the . warning - it's one of those subjective/personal ones.########################################################################At 54 years of age, I don’t have a particularly coherent narrative version of my own life. Some of the more obvious events stand out in relief, but there are discontinuities, there are periods where everything seems to flow together, and there are many, many gaps - weird lacunae of years at a time. Did I really do nothing but work my butt off between the ages of 35 and 45? Kind of seems that way now, more’s the pity. Oh wait, didn’t I co-author a book in there somewhere? I’m proud of that book, less so of the friendships I allowed to wither on the vine during the process of writing it.Any narrative cohesion that does exist in my version of my life story comes, I have no doubt, at the cost of accuracy, because it just represents the fact that I have been able to reshape those parts of the story mentally to fit some kind of narrative arc with which I am satisfied. I think we all tend to do this, which is why all memoirs need to be filed, once and for all, under the rubric of “fiction”, and why maybe, at long last, we need to stop beating up on the unfortunate James Frey. (And why I should probably give my bete noire, Frank McCourt, a pass for one of my least favorite memoirs, “Angela’s Ashes”; though my  of that book continues to annoy certain people so much that I am reluctant to change it at this point).Proust, and assorted neuroscientists, would have us believe that our sense of smell plays an important role in generating our memories. I can’t really argue the point, but in her latest work, “A Visit from the Goon Squad”, Jennifer Egan taps into something that seems to me to be far more powerful, and far more relevant to most of our experience, when she identifies music as playing a key role in shaping memory and the resulting versions of our lives that we carry with us. Certainly, in my case, this is true. Whatever my memories, real or invented, music has a way of keeping me honest.Sometimes the associations are of my own making. Thus, for instance, all I have to do is to hear the Al Stewart song “Year of the Cat” to be transported immediately (and viscerally) back to the winter of 1978-1979, where this particular album formed the background to my relentless onslaught on functional analysis and probability theory as I studied for my joint master’s in Math/Statistics at University College back in Cork. Or flash forward a few years to when I was grappling with my doctoral problem in Chapel Hill, both “breakthrough” ideas, those that formed the core of my eventual dissertation, came to me to the soundtrack of Jackson Browne’s “The Pretender”, which blared from the record player in my office in Smith Building at 3 in the morning.Sometimes the musical associations are laid by others. For instance, it occurs to me that - no, the period between 35 and 45 in my life was not completely given over to work. There was the disastrous 7-month interlude when I dated Marty, one of the most charming, but completely messed-up, drunks inhabiting the Bay Area during the spring and summer of 1998. The guy was mad, bad, and dangerous to know, and he had a complete thing for the music of Celine Dion. So that if I want to be transported back to the particular state of vulnerability and fury that characterized our entire relationship, all I need to do is put “The Power of Love” on the stereo, and it all comes flooding back. By the same token, if I want to remember my first unrequited crush (on that oh-so-cute music teacher in Gaelic camp when I was 15), the slow movement of Beethoven’s 7th (in my defense, I was 15, it all seemed very tragic to me at the time) will take me back there every time.But it’s the cues we are unaware of that are perhaps the most powerful in keeping our memories honest. How else to explain my recent experience, driving back up 280 to SF a few days before leaving for Paris? With no warning, the radio station began to play the song “Driver’s Seat” by Sniff ‘n the Tears, and the effect on me was so profound I had to pull to the side of the road until the song ended, after which it still took me several minutes to recover. Because I was no longer on 280 or anywhere near it. I was in my room in Craig Dorm in Chapel Hill, in September 1979, newly arrived the previous week from Cork, feeling that mix of trepidation, promise, fear, and possibility that characterized that whole first year in Chapel Hill. Only these musical cues, lodged in our psyches like so many time bombs, have the visceral power to take us back in quite the same way.What does any of this have to do with Jennifer Egan’s book? Everything, really. Because she captures that power utterly and completely, with something approaching genius. Which may be why this book left me flummoxed at the outset. But which is also why I can give it no fewer than 5 stars.

It's discoveries like this that make the wholesale scanning of old books into that insatiable e-library in the clouds a worthwhile exercise.A note of clarification. According to the goodreads rating definitions, 5 stars mean that a book was ""amazing"". Not necessarily brilliant, or even good. Just amazing. There are books that amaze us by their badness. For instance, any collection of the poetry of the unforgettable William McGonagall. Or the infinitely hilarious English as She Is Spoke: Being a Comprehensive Phrasebook of the English Language, Written by Men to Whom English Was Entirely Unknown. This book more than earns its place in the pantheon of truly bad books. The question is, does it manage to be so appallingly dreadful that it achieves its own kind of greatness? I believe that it does. Though it falls short of threatening McGonagall's tenacious hold on the crown of the world's worst writer, there are passages that are simply breathtaking in their badness. I will limit myself to quoting just three in this , but I sincerely hope that these will convince you to seek out the entire online text (a skimpy 50 pages that house a stunning gallery of crimes against the language). Should you do so, please don't try to read more than a few pages in one session. Such a high concentration of linguistic mayhem could be enough to unhinge the mind. A little background for what follows. Angus McDiarmid is a hunting guide who works on the estate of the Earl of Breadalbane. A visiting Gentleman is so taken with Angus's unique descriptions of his surroundings that he arranges to have them published, in their original form, with no editorial interference.Here follows the evidence that I believe qualifies this slim volume for inclusion in the Pantheon of Shame:Exhibit A - (taken from the dedication)To the right honourable Earl of Breadalbane.May it please your Lordship,With overpowering sentiments of the most profound humility, I prostrate myself at your noble feet....With tumid emotions of heart-distending pride, and with fervescent feelings of gratitude, I beg leave to acknowledge the honor I have to serve so noble a master...That your Lordship may long shine with refulgent brilliancy in the exalted station to which Providence has raised you, and that your noble family, like a bright constellation, may diffuse a splendour (sic) glory through the high sphere of their attraction...That's some pretty inspired grovelling right there, if you ask me.Exhibit B - from the introduction by the Gentleman instrumental in the book's publicationWith a due tenderness for the Author's reputation, not a word nor a letter has been altered from his manuscripts; ....His speech, bold, rugged, and abrupt, as the rocks which defy all access but to the wing of the eagle and the vulture, bids equal defiance to those who would scan his meaning by the regular steps of criticism. Like the torrent shooting impetuously from crag to crag, his sentences, instead of flowing in a smooth and equal tenor, overleap with noble freedom the mounds and impediments of grammar, verbs, conjunctions, and adverbs, which give tameness and regularity to ordinary compositions. Exhibit C - the first paragraph of Angus's striking and picturesque delineationsOf the different remarkable curiosity flowing from the excellencies of the cataract at Edinample, which partly perspicuously to the view of the beholders; its finitude confined between high wild rocks of asperity aspect, similar to a tract of solitude or savageness; its force emphatically overflowing three divisions; but, in the season of the water dropping from the clouds, its force increases so potently, that these divisions, almost undiscoverd, at which its incremental exorbitance transcended various objects of inquisitiveness, peradventure in manuscript, in such eminently measure, that its homogeneously could not be recognish at the interim, except existing in emblem to the waves of the ocean in tempestuous season.

Thirty years later, both are living (unbeknownst to one another) in the Seattle area. Mary, who now goes by the name Louise, is raising a 16-year old son, Jason. Bobby, now known as Nash, runs an alternative book store for his friend Henry, who is dying of cancer. Mary has always intended to tell Jason the truth, and turn herself in, ""as soon as he is ready"". But Jason is a smart kid. What if he figures things out for himself first?Spiotta develops the story beautifully, essentially using it as a vehicle to explore questions of identity, as well as providing a fairly astute analysis of the 60s and 90s counter-culture. The novel is not as tightly constructed as it could have been -- a couple of story arcs (Henry's deteriorating health and the glib explanation offered for it, the May-December attraction between Miranda and Nash) added little. And while the main characters were believable and interesting, some of the minor characters (Miranda’s boyfriend Josh, Jason‘s loser geek neighbor Gage, Mary/Caroline’s travel companion Berry) were just cartoons. But these are occasional lapses - for the most part, Spiotta tells the story with subtlety and skill. Intentionally or not, it's the story of Mary and Jason that forms the emotional heart of the book; Nash is not unsympathetic, but he's not very interesting either. The book raises some very interesting questions, and Spiotta is an engaging and skillful writer. For those who enjoy that kind of thing, there are regular doses of “High Fidelity”-style geekishness, mainly centering on Jason’s obsessive interest in -- The Beach Boys. Spiotta delivers these with such brilliance that it’s hard not to be beguiled - the choice of the Beach Boys as the focus of Jason’s obsession is inspired. It also allows the hilarious scene in which, to Jason’s mounting horror, a slightly buzzed Mary reminisces about the time she danced with Dennis Wilson in a grungy surfer bar in Venice Beach. Despite its minor flaws, I really liked “Eat the Document”, for the skill with which Spiotta unfolds the story, for the pitch-perfect portrayal of the relationship between Mary and Jason, for the acuteness of her examination of the counter-culture of both generations, and for the interesting questions it raises about the construction of personal identity in the U.S. Predictably enough, I wasn’t particularly keen on the whole demonization* of the big pharmaceutical company story arc, but I can’t necessarily criticize it as coming out of left field.* When I was typing up this  in the horrible Microsoft Works word processor, it refused to allow me to type this word, changing it each time to ""deionization"". Is this some kind of new sinister automatic bowdlerization feature that is being included with Microsoft programs?

THAT TITLE'S ALREADY TAKEN.Because, as every cultured person knows, ""The Tain"" (pronunciation ""Thoyne"") is the name given to the most important story in ancient Irish literature, the collection of tales also referred to as ""The Ulster Cycle"", or ""The Cattle Raid of Cooley"". I sputtered with indignation at the thought that someone would steal the name of Ireland's best-known legend for some weirdo post-apocalyptic novella about a race of wraith creatures that humans have subjugated by trapping them in mirrors. Then I learned that ""tain"" is a legitimate English word meaning ""the tinfoil used as backing in mirrors"" and I felt pretty stupid. SORRY, CHINA! Like any self-respecting national saga, the (Irish) Tain lacks a single definitive version. Most versions draw on two different ancient manuscripts, from the 12th and 14th centuries, respectively, but its origins are far older. Some of the language dates back as far as the 8th century, and most Celtic scholars believe the the story had a long oral existence before eventually being committed to writing by monastic scribes. Both the content and the style of the narrative place the events in a timeframe that predates the introduction of Christianity to Ireland in 432, possibly as far back as the first century.Most Irish people of my generation are familiar with the 1969 translation of the epic by the poet Thomas Kinsella (with brush drawings by Louis de Brocquy). I read the Kinsella translation at some point when I was in college, largely from a sense of obligation. Its brilliance was completely wasted on me at the time. I recently stumbled across a more recent (2007) translation of the Tain, by the poet Ciaran Carson. I really liked Carson's translation of Dante's Inferno, so I was interested to see what he would make of the Tain. So this past weekend I sat down with both the Kinsella and Carson translations, to reacquaint myself with the legendary exploits of the Celtic heroes of the Tain. Like any self-respecting national saga, whole chunks of the Tain are unreadable. But much of it is hilarious; I had forgotten how weirdly entertaining the story is. A successful national epic will presumably reflect the concerns of the listeners -- people who make a living by taking to the sea in boats worry about sea-monsters, lost ships, threats of a maritime nature. In Argentina, cattle are central to economic survival, no surprise then that the gaucho is the hero of Argentina's national epic, Martin Fierro. Cattle were important in pre-Christian Ireland as well -- at its heart the Tain is the account of a cattle-rustling expedition gone terribly, terribly wrong.The story of the Tain is straightforward; its particular charm lies in the telling. Here are some of the details I find totally kickass:The opening scene, in which Ailill and Maeve, the king and queen of Connacht get swept up in a competitive enumeration of the wealth and possessions each has brought to the marriage, is referred to as the ""pillow talk"" scene. Maeve loses the competition by a bull and vows to get even; this is the McGuffin that launches the whole disastrous expedition to steal Donn Cuailgne, the great Brown Bull of Cooley, from the neighboring kingdom of Ulster. The men of Ulster are all laid low by ""the pangs"". Because of a previous incident, involving a distinct lack of chivalry towards a pregnant lady, nine generations of Ulstermen have been cursed to suffer the pains of childbirth for five days and four nights ""at their moment of greatest difficulty"". So, just as the marauding Connacht army reaches their border, all the men of fighting age take to their beds, howling as if each was about to give birth to twins. Oops, make that ""all but one"" of the men. For unspecified reasons, the hero CuChulainn (aka the hound of Culann the blacksmith, aka Setanta) is exempt from the curse, so it falls to him to keep the marauders at bay until his fellow Ulstermen have recovered from the pangs. It's roughly 30,000 to 1 out there. In other words, a completely unfair set up. The Connacht soldiers don't stand a chance. CuChulainn isn't your average 17-year old. He's Ireland's version of Hercules. Super-endowed physically, not particularly bright, poorly developed emotional control, no impulse control, the boy has some serious combat skilz. With a couple of nifty superpowers thrown in. That cloak of invisibility, for one thing. Those heightened sensory powers. But the worst thing you can to is to make him angry, because that can trigger the  riastradh, (the twisting, or contortion), a Hulk-like physical transformation that is followed by a killing frenzy. Kinsella translates this wonderfully as the ""warp spasm""; in a rare misstep, Carson tries too hard and comes up with the the ""torque"" (he wants to evoke the kind of Celtic collar known as a torque, but why?). The killing frenzy proceeds by repeated implementation of the ""thunder-feat"", wherein enemy soldiers are taken out in increments of 100. I can't imagine that there's not already a video game.CuChulainn's deadly kill-weapon, the Gae Bolga, totally rocks (as does its name). And the passage where he ultimately has no choice but to use it to disembowel his beloved childhood friend Ferdia is simultaneously devastating (OMG, he is forced to kill his best bro Ferdy) and provocative (explicit homoerotic imagery in ancient Celtic texts, who'd a thunk it?) There's also an entertaining array of secondary characters -- backstabbing relatives and courtiers, wild women with the gift of prophecy, assorted figures from Celtic mythology, including the very nasty shapeshifting morrigan, a kind of unpleasant Celtic valkyrie you wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley.Both the Kinsella and Carson translations are highly readable. There are slight differences in their choices of what to include. Kinsella's coverage is greater, because he includes full translations of certain key remsceala (backstories), where Carson limits himself to summarizing them briefly in his endnotes. Both authors comment on the particular difficulties posed by certain sections of the manuscript, those written in the specific verse form known as rosc. These sections are apparently so obscure that both authors felt obliged to include an explicit disavowal of accuracy for their attempted translations. Carson tries for a greater fidelity to the original verse form, which makes for a much choppier, less intelligible translation. Obviously I can't judge the accuracy of either translation, but I thought both authors did an impressive job in terms of clarity, fluidity, and readability. Neither translation seems clearly superior - they are just different.I feel obliged to include a caveat. There are certain aspects of the text that make some portions eye-glazingly unreadable. Two features in particular come to mind. The first is a kind of listmania -- the number of warriors taken down by Cuchulainn is enormous, and the authors of this manuscript want you know each one by name. This leads to this kind of incandescent prose:These are the names of their chiefs and commanders: two Cruaids, two Calads, two Cirs, two Ciars, two Ecelss, three Croms, three Cauraths, three Combirges, four Feochars, four Furachars, four Casses, four Fotas, ....(varying numbers of 18 more family names)...., ten Fiachas and ten Fedelmids.The second issue is related. In Carson's words,  the Tain is obsessed by topography, by place-names and their etymologies . It's hard to convey just how deep this apparent obsession runs. At times it seems as if the entire manuscript is nothing more than an effort to come up with a (dubious) etymology for the name of every topographical feature of the Irish landscape. Lethan came to his ford on the river Nith in Conaille. Galled by Cuchulainn's deeds, he lay in wait for him. CuChulainn cut off his head and left it with the body. Hence the name Ath Lethan. This kind of stuff is both extraordinarily dull and highly questionable, particularly when one takes into account that the word ""lethan"" means ""broad"". One begins to suspect that the brave warrior ""Lethan"" might not have existed at all. There are huge swaths of this kind of material scattered throughout the Tain. The good news is that it is eminently skippable.  Bearing this caveat in mind, I think anyone would enjoy the Tain....more",Notes are private!,0,58,2,not setnot set,"Aug 14, 2011not set","Aug 13, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8016498-the-tain

I recently re-read Nevil Shute's ""On the Beach"", whose vision of the aftermath of a nuclear war had chilled me when I read it as a teenager. It didn't hold up well -- the understated, stiff-upper-lip, dignity of his calmly accepting Australians as they waited for the nuclear cloud to waft their way seemed implausible, and hopelessly naive. Where was the rage? Where were the crazy people. A significant fraction of the population is constitutionally incapable of going gentle into that good night. A world after nuclear war might not be as savage as that in ""The Road"", (I'd like to think not, but really I want the question to be purely academic) but it's a safe bet that some degree of civil unrest would be part of it. I've owned ""A Canticle for Leibowitz"" for ever, but only just got around to reading it. I was pleasantly surprised. Miller spins a fine story (it's actually a sequence of three novellas, spanning several centuries), and his vision of how things might unfold after a cataclysmic nuclear war is chillingly plausible. What I hadn't expected was how funny the book is. This is a book that fulfils all our expectations of good literature: it tells a good story, and tells it well - the author creates a world which is both completely alien and entirely convincing. The story is an important one, touching on deep moral questions. Finally, though we might find the author's view of the human race as a species trapped in an endless escalating cycle of self-destructive violence depressing, the power of this story does not allow us to dismiss it out of hand. This book may not change the way you view the world, but it will stay with you long after you read it.""A Canticle for Leibowitz"" is generally considered to be a classic in its genre (which the back cover helpfully identifies as ""modern speculative fiction""). You'll get no argument from me on that score. You may wonder, as I did, about the apparently endless fascination the Jesuits exert on authors of ""modern speculative fiction"". (I think it was Manny who first raised this question). Don't let the Jesuits put you off. This particular post-apocalyptic story deserves to pass the test of time.

It's one of those books that has a definite low-key charm throughout and that ends up affecting you to an unexpected degree by the end. It tells the story of the decline of an aristocratic Sicilian family following Garibaldi's unification of Italy in 1860. The entire narrative spans half a century, but the vast majority of the action takes place in the months immediately surrounding the dissolution of the Bourbon monarchy of Sicily and Naples, focusing on the fortunes of Prince Fabrizio, the leopard of the title, and his family. The story is essentially Lampedusa's reimagining of his own family history, with the central figure of Prince Fabrizio corresponding to his great-grandfather. Upon its publication, the book managed to give offence across the entire political spectrum -- the Prince's skeptical ruminations on his fellow aristocrats, the clergy, the champions of the Risorgimento, and the Sicilian peasantry may have cut a little too close to the bone for comfort. Despite, or perhaps because of, the controversy it provoked, ""The Leopard"" went on to become (one of?) the top-selling novels in Italian history. The 1963 film based on the book, with Burt Lancaster in the title role, directed by Luchino Visconti also met with critical acclaim. Sadly, the author died of lung cancer in 1957, before the book was accepted for publication (he had received two rejections, with one editor declaring the manuscript to be ""unpublishable"").Although the fortunes of the Sicilian aristocracy might not seem like a particularly promising subject to engage the reader's interest, ""The Leopard"" is unexpectedly captivating. It works for a couple of reasons -- the main character is drawn with great affection, but also with depth and subtlety -- you enjoy spending time in his head. There's a slightly melancholy tone throughout the work that also adds to the book's appeal. It's easy to understand why ""The Leopard"" has become a minor classic.

My love for Bel Canto is boundless, irrational, indefensible; that book just affected me in a way that very few books do. State of Wonder didn't move me in quite the same way, but I greatly enjoyed it and have no hesitation in recommending it.I have an innate tendency when ing to take the good stuff for granted and give undue emphasis to minor faults. I want to try to avoid that here, so let me begin by pointing out some of the things I like about Ann Patchett's writing in general, and this book in particular.State of Wonder is 350 pages long. I read it in a 24-hour period. Not quite in a single session, but close. I mention this because I think it's germane -- if a book draws me in to the extent that I really don't want to stop reading, then the author has at least succeeded at the most fundamental level, she has told a story that's interesting enough to hold my attention. Sadly, this is something we can no longer take for granted -- many contemporary authors no longer seem to feel any serious obligation to tell a decent story that an intelligent reader might reasonably enjoy. (I’m apparently channeling my inner Franzen here). There are honorable exceptions, of course -- I used to look forward to each new book by Margaret Drabble (in mid-career), Anne Tyler, Iris Murdoch, because I knew that even in their less successful efforts they would still not neglect their responsibility to tell a good story. Other authors have been added to my “old reliable” list over the years, but not that many: Colm Toibin, David Lodge, Peter Carey. Jane Smiley rarely disappoints, Kate Atkinson writes these ludicrously entertaining, hugely complicated stories about her sad-sack characters and keeps you glued to your seat every time. “State of Wonder” clearly establishes Ann Patchett’s right to be on the list*. The story is structured in an obvious parallel to Conrad’s “Heart of Darkness”, a flourish that would be a setup for failure in the hands of a less talented writer. Patchett makes it work beautifully; her ability to convey the rising sense of tension and foreboding experienced by the main protagonist, Marina, as she travels deeper upstream into the jungle is scarily brilliant. Along the way, there are some extraordinarily beautiful passages, my favorite being the description of Marina’s attendance at a performance of  Orfeo et Eurydice  at the opera house in Manaus (a tribute to Fitzcarraldo?). I really like the way Ann Patchett writes -- she has a kind of unobtrusive brilliance that makes it look effortless. “State of Wonder” covers a lot of ground, physically and emotionally, and there‘s a slightly feverish quality to the narrative, particularly in the later parts of the book; but Patchett is such a smart and engaging writer, I was hooked by the story, and didn’t want it to stop. So the occasional implausibilities in the plot and the sense that a few of the characters came straight from central casting, or were little more than mouthpieces, didn’t seem like fatal flaws. “State of Wonder” is not a simple book -- the complicated emotional journey that Marina traverses as she completes her physical journey into the heart of the jungle forms the core of the book, but along the way Patchett raises interesting questions about the interplay between stewardship of the planet’s natural resources, scientific ambition, women’s reproductive freedom, and corporate responsibility. It’s an ambitious agenda; occasionally the mirroring of the global and personal issues feels a bit forced, and the key character of Dr Swenson was (for me) a bit over the top. But even if Patchett isn’t completely successful in tying everything together, “State of Wonder” is a terrific story, wonderfully told. * I feel obliged to add a slight digression to talk about gender imbalance. Women are far better represented on my personal list of go-to authors, and I’ve often wondered why this should be. I think it’s that most contemporary male authors seem too susceptible to lapsing into a kind of solipsistic obsession about their dicks (Updike, Roth), or their own cleverness (Amis, Barnes, McEwan), or both, and they often end up reneging on that obligation to the reader, to tell a decent story. Then, of course, there are the myriad “authors” who would like to deny that any such obligation exists in the first place.

MacIntyre is a decent writer, but I think he falls into the trap that bedevils many non-fiction authors -- all the time and energy spent doing the research causes him to lose perspective. The story is endlessly fascinating to him, but he forgets that some pruning of the details is needed in order to shape the narrative for the reader. But pruning is something that MacIntyre seems incapable of -- even the most peripheral actor is this tale gets at least two pages of backstory, which often does little to advance the real story. Every chapter of the book is stuffed with irrelevant detail. Ewen Montagu, one of the main protagonists, came from an extremely wealthy family, a fact which is largely irrelevant to the story, but which nonetheless gets about 8 pages of text as MacIntyre gushes on about the number of family servants, the decor in the family mansion, their glittering social contacts etc etc. Discussion of the difficulties in acquiring a cadaver that can be used to fool the Germans is expanded (bloated) by inclusion of completely irrelevant biographical information on everyone consulted in the process, what everyone ate or drank at any given meeting, the temperature of the sherry, the mood of Montagu's stepmother, a digression on the history of grave-robbing, and any other random tidbit that showed up in MacIntyre's notebooks apparently. This kind of thing will either charm you or drive you up the wall.Operation Mincemeat was an important, and fascinating, episode from the second world war, but it surely could have been told in fewer than 400 pages. That said, the book is not a bad read, and the occasional lapses into grandiosity of the kind ""that single (hotel) register entry could have changed the course of World War II"" are mercifully rare.

In particIn addition to the usual list of difficulties encountered when learning any foreign language, French has a few specific wrinkles of its own. In particular, there are certain verb tenses that have fallen into disuse, so that they are no longer used when speaking, but may still be encountered in written French, particularly in older texts.Most intermediate French students will have seen at least one of these, the so-called ""simple past tense"", or passé simple. Although it has been completely replaced by the perfect tense, the passé composé , in spoken French, it is still reasonably common in modern texts, though it can come across as being slightly pompous. Given that it's still used in modern writing, inclusion of the passé simple as part of the curriculum seems entirely reasonable.But the passé simple is not the only French ""literary tense"". No, indeed, there are four others: the passé antérieur (now replaced by the plus-que-parfait, or pluperfect), the imperfect subjunctive (now replaced by the present subjunctive), the pluperfect subjunctive (now replaced by the past subjunctive), and the so-called second form of the conditional past (something clearly dreamed up solely for the purpose of making life more interesting back in the days before television and video games).This past week, in my French class, we read part of Perrault's ""Comtes"", as a way of introducing us to the whole morass of French literary tenses. So I was moved to go out and buy my own copy, which I've been reading over the weekend, and enjoying thoroughly.  [image]Many of your favorite Disney tales are included: ""Sleeping Beauty"", ""Cinderella"", ""Tom Thumb"", ""Puss in Boots"" (oh wait, wasn't he in ""Shrek""?), as well as ""Little Red Riding Hood"", ""Bluebeard"", and a handful of others. But don't necessarily expect those Disney happy endings. The Perrault version of these tales errs heavily on the side of cruelty and brutality. There's more than one's fair share of incest, cannibalism, and good old-fashioned gore. For instance, that hunter or woodsman who arrives to save Little Red Riding Hood and her grandma at the end of the Brothers Grimm version? Completely absent from Perrault. In his view of the world, wander from the path to chase butterflies or talk to wolves and you'll come to a grisly ending. The illustrations are the original drawings by Gustav Dore, and are terrific.  [image]Finally, on the topic of ""Little Red Riding Hood"", I came across the following photo, which dates from the winter of 1968, my first term at boarding school, and which I present, in all its horrifying detail, without further commentary. The psychic scars run too deep*. But can you guess which of the characters depicted is now one of Ireland's best-known architects, a figure of international renown?

By writing this elegant, concise, clear account of the central role that metaphor plays, not just in how we speak and communicate, but also in how we think, you have liberated me. For about two years now I've been walking around with a kind of Sisyphean pebble in my shoe, a constant, niggling, low-grade annoyance that resisted all my efforts to resolve it. You see, there's this other book, Metaphors We Live By by George Lakoff (Mark Johnson is listed as a second author on my edition, published in 2003, and presumably a reworking of the original 1979 version by Lakoff). It's an important book, because by all accounts Lakoff and colleagues were the first to identify the central importance of metaphor, their ideas gained widespread currency and have had a huge influence on how other researchers think about language and cognition. So for an armchair linguist like me it seemed important to read it and absorb its message. The problem was, for the life of me, I couldn't get through it. Every month or so I'd pick it up again, read another 20 pages (or possibly the same 20 pages as before), give up in disgust and eventually give myself over to the anodyne comforts of whatever drivel I could find on VH1 or Bravo (Top 40 celebrity feuds, The Real Housezombies of XXX, whatever.....) ""So what?"", you may well ask. ""Just leave it and get on with your life"". But this inability to get through Lakoff and Johnson bothered me, to an irrational extent. It gnawed at me. You see, getting through graduate school was one of the hardest things I've ever done, and there were times when it seemed impossible. The program I was in took particular pride in crushing souls, with the faculty doing their utmost to extinguish any ember of self-esteem that might linger in the wretches they actually allowed to graduate. (These people were seriously fucked up.) But I managed to get out in a reasonably intact state, having learned (or so I believed) that, if nothing else, one ability that I had was that, eventually, no matter how difficult or abstruse the material, I could ultimately manage to figure it out,  if I just read it often enough . It might take weeks, even months, but eventually the penny would drop. Having that confidence in my own ability turned out, of course, to be hugely advantageous later on in my career, because all those motivational speakers and professional ""coaches"" are completely right - believing you can do something is half the battle. So my complete failure to make any headway with Lakoff and Johnson was seriously messing with my self-image. At times I could convince myself that maybe it was they were to blame, not me, but then my inner demon of self-doubt (called Jed, after a particularly insidious bastard in my graduate school class, who got his kicks from trying to make everyone else feel stupid) would sneer that I was just making excuses.James Geary has done me (and the rest of the world) an enormous favor, essentially by writing the book that L & J should have written in the first place. Key concepts are introduced and identified as such. The exposition proceeds in a logical, orderly fashion. The examples are interesting, persuasive, insightful, and actually help the reader better understand the concepts being discussed. The man is organized and engaging; he writes with fluidity, humor, and grace. Occasionally his enthusiasm gets the better of him, but for the most part he is careful not to overstate his case. He never condescends to the reader, and his enthusiasm is infectious. As a result, he achieves an authoritative tone, something that Lakoff, an inferior and far less disciplined writer, never manages, despite being the originator of many of the ideas discussed. In fact, after reading Geary's book, some of the major deficiencies in L & J become glaringly obvious. If you find it heavy sledding, it is their fault, not yours. (I'll go into more depth in a separate  of L & J). A little more about ""I is another"". A list of the main chapter headings gives a fair idea of its scope (including it here is lazy, but hopefully informative)-Foreword : Why I is an OtherMetaphor and Thought : All Shook UpMetaphor and Etymology : Language is Fossil PoetryMetaphor and Money : How High Can a Dead Cat Bounce?Metaphor and the Mind : Imagining an Apple in Someone's EyeMetaphor and Advertising : Imaginary Gardens with Real ToadsMetaphor and the Brain : Bright Sneezes and Loud SunlightMetaphor and the Body : Anger is a Heated Fluid in a ContainerMetaphor and Politics : Freedom Fries and Liberty Cabbage Metaphor and Pleasure : Experience is a Comb that Nature Gives to Bald MenMetaphor and Children : How Should One Refer to the Sky?Metaphor and Science : The Earth is Like a Rice PuddingMetaphor and Parables and Proverbs : Mighty Darn good LiesMetaphor and Innovation : Make it StrangeMetaphor and Psychology : A Little Splash of Color from my MotherBackword : The Logic of MetaphorThe gist of Geary's message is that metaphor is ubiquitous and fundamental, not just as an intrinsic component of language, it also plays a basic role in cognition. How we perceive our world, and how we think are hugely influenced by metaphors. Sometimes this influence is obvious, but it can also happen well below the radar of our consciousness. Humans are highly suggestible, capable of being ""primed"" to react in certain ways, whether it's through framing by subtle nuances of language, or by the less subtle manipulation of metaphor engaged in by politicians, marketers, or anyone else trying to elicit a particular emotional response. Geary's examples are interesting and thought-provoking, and their cumulative force is entirely persuasive.If you think metaphor is something just for poets, think again. In normal conversation, we utter one metaphor for every 10-25 words, which corresponds to about six metaphors a minute. Read this book - it's well worth your time.Still not convinced? Here's one final example. Have you ever wondered about the language used to describe the behavior of the stock market? When things are trending upward, the kind of metaphor used will generally attribute agency to the market - ""The NASDAQ climbed 20 points"" - as if of its own volition. This description is more likely to elicit optimism in investors, because climbing is an activity resulting from an internal drive that is presumably likely to continue in the future. Being told, however, that Dow ""plummeted"" suggests that prices are non-living, non-volitional entities, whose movements are controlled by external forces (an example of what is called an 'object metaphor'). Research shows that the use of agent metaphors to describe stock movements causes people to be more optimistic about future market behavior and invest accordingly; the same information presented using object metaphors leads to more pessimistic investment responses.

My first reaction was ""God help us all! Now that the academicians have entered the field, they will suck all life out of his body of work and bicker querulously in the ashes"". It's not quite as bad as all that. Some of the essays in the book are definitely egregious crimes against language and the laws of nature. But not as many as you might expect. The truly dreadful stuff stays pretty much localized to five or six of the 17 contributors. Let's get this out of the way with one cheap shot (I can't resist).Stuff like: Unexpectedness also is a key feature of the referentiality of this particular footnote. Despite the fact that there is no sub-footnote anchor in footnote 6, footnote 6(A) can be considered to be also referring to the preceding note 6 on the basis of the numbering scheme. The narrative thus subtly and ambivalently simulates self-reflexivity as second-order narration.One has to wonder what might drive a person to write a dissertation on the use of footnoting in the work of DFW. And how it might feel. Yes, I know -- it's unkind to mock the poor souls who feel forced to churn out that kind of stuff in their desperate pursuit of tenure, but surely patronizing to pretend that it's anything other than lethally boring.If, like me, you're a general reader who just happens to like DFW's work a lot, your question may be whether the whole book is written in the peculiarly incomprehensible jargon used by academics when writing for other academics. Not entirely. About one third of the articles seemed indisputably like gibberish to me - simultaneously incomprehensible and worthless. Another third were a little heavy on the academic jargon at times, but at least one came away with the sense that the author may have had something useful to say. The remaining pieces would be accessible to anyone who had read the particular DFW work being discussed.What aspects of the Wallace canon (besides his deployment of footnotes) have attracted the scrutiny of these bright young academic minds? A little of everything: several contributors examined the philosophical underpinnings of various works, others looked at the ""new sincerity"" DFW is alleged to have brought to the post-postmodern landscape, and at his effectiveness as a journalist and non-fiction reporter. These essays were generally relatively lucid and reasonably accessible. As topics got more weirdly specific and arcane, intelligibility took a dive. Claims of similarity between DFW and Laurence Sterne were interesting, if not entirely persuasive. I certainly don't begrudge the editor (David Hering, a graduate student at Liverpool) the fun it must have been to work those Sierpinski gasket diagrams into his paper. A fractal analysis of Infinite Jest? Why not? Connie Luther, in contrast, trod much more treacherous ground in her efforts to provide a mathematical analysis of the deforming function of post-modernity (sic). Some exercises are best left to the mathematical professional, or - better yet - not undertaken at all. Because they are fundamentally BOGUS. Kiki Benzon just disappears into the morass altogether, with her muddled prose and her fatal tendency to bandy around terms like orderly-disorder, chaotic indeterminacy, strange loops, intermediariness, turbulent flow, as if she knew what they meant. Matt Tresco's willingness to make sweeping generalizations about autism, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders was startling, but not in a good way. Finally, what to make of Gregory Phipps's insistence on reading layer after layer of meaning into the behavior of John Wayne, the only Canadian student at Enfield (the tennis academy in Infinite Jest)? Gregory is pursuing a degree at Magill - should his contribution be regarded as some kind of French Canadian rebuttal? His essay is singularly odd. Because I have a very low tolerance for academic bullshit, I thought this book would upset me more than it did. But several of the essays were at least readable, and the better ones left me eager to revisit the work in question. Which is, I think, a marker of some degree of success. So I rate this 2.5 stars out of 5, rounded down to 2, because I recognize that DFW is not for everybody, something which must be true a fortiori about academic analyses of his work....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Dec 15, 2010","Jan 31, 2011","Dec 15, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8556384-consider-david-foster-wallace

In 2009 it was Richard Holmes's ""The Age of Wonder"", the following year it was ""The Emperor of All Maladies"".Universally admired, winner of a Pulitzer prize, this book annoyed me so profoundly when I first read it that I've had to wait almost a year to be able to write anything vaguely coherent about it. The flaws that I found so infuriating a year ago seem less important upon a second reading. Though I still think it is a poorly conceived book, executed in a manner that lacks all restraint, it's nowhere near as terrible as I remembered. As I recall, the aspects of the book that most annoyed me were:(a) the author's anthropomorphism of cancer -- a stupid, unhelpful, and ineffective metaphor. In general, I detest this practice of attributing personalities to diseases. Perhaps it's a necessary psychological strategy for oncologists. But it's particularly inappropriate in the case of cancer, as it perpetuates the incorrect belief that cancer is a single disease, as opposed to a ""shape-shifting disease of colossal diversity"". For the same reason, it makes little sense to speak of a ""war on cancer"", as if it were a sentient villain with plans for world domination, one that can somehow be vanquished if we just find the magic formula. Mukherjee correctly deplores this view as simplistic and reductive, but he then proceeds to adopt it hook, line, and sinker. It's a baffling and unfortunate choice, because its inherent deficiencies lead to a kind of narrative incoherence, as well as a damaging lack of clarity about the nature and scope of the book. It's a symptom of Mukherjee's vagueness of purpose that he often refers to the book as a ""biography of cancer"", as if that phrase had meaning.(b) A complete, fatal, inability to leave anything out. There is a certain type of non-fiction writer who seems hellbent on inflicting everything he or she learned while researching the book on the misfortunate reader. No detail is spared. Everyone the author spoke to during the five years researching the book gets a mention, it would seem. As do a bunch of dead folks, some of them very dead, not all clearly particularly relevant.If, by doing this, the author is trying to impress with the breadth of his research, then he fails. Leaving everything in is the simple, intellectually lazy, option. Where non-fiction is concerned, the reader has a right to expect the author to take the trouble to shape his material into some kind of coherent whole, recognizing that while some details are critical, others are not, and pruning accordingly. All too often, though, authors forget this. Their enthusiasm about the subject leads them to lose perspective: ""the reader needs the whole story and will be thirsting for all the gory details; it would be criminal to leave anything out"".Well, actually, NO. We want you, the author, to point out to us what's important and what's not.  (c) The author includes stories of his own patients' experience with cancers of various types. I have nothing against this per se - it's entirely sensible to do so. However, it requires delicacy and finesse to report on his patients' stories without seeming exploitative or emotionally manipulative. Writers like Jerome Groopman and Oliver Sachs regularly navigate this terrain with grace and sensitivity. Mukherjee, a much less experienced writer, repeatedly crosses the line into bathos and melodrama. The language is overly dramatic; one senses also that Mukherjee succumbs to the oncologist's fallacy of believing that cancer is intrinsically ""worse"", or more serious, than all other ailments. Actually, I guess that's already evident from the book's title.(d) He has a particularly unfortunate habit of prefacing each chapter with at least one ""literary quote"", and when the book reaches a new section (there are six in all), he tends to go hog wild and give us a whole page of quotes. These seem like a minor distraction at first, but their cumulative effect is to leave the reader with the impression that (i) it is very important to the author to let the world know that he is a well-read, Renaissance dude (ii) chances are the author is a bit of a poser. The bard, the bible, St Thomas Aquinas, Sophocles, Kafka, Hegel, Voltaire, Plato, Sun Tzu, and William Blake are all mined for a portentous snippet or two about mortality and the evils that the flesh is heir to. Not to mention Gertrude Stein, Jack London, Czeslaw Milosz, W.H. Auden, Hilaire Belloc, D.H. Lawrence, Lewis Carroll, Conan Doyle, Italo Calvino, Woody Allen, Solzhenitsyn, Akhmatova... . Using just the right quote to frame an argument, or introduce a topic, can be an extremely effective device, but its effectiveness diminishes rapidly with overuse. One gets the distinct impression that the author ransacked some quotation website in the mistaken idea that sprinkling them copiously throughout the manuscript would magically confer some kind of gravitas. I reached my eye-rolling moment on page 190, introducing part three, when Doctor Mukherjee felt impelled to quote T.S. Eliot:""... I have seen the Eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker.And in short, I was afraid.""  (e) As I mentioned, I think the structure and organization of the material leaves much to be desired. The writing is generally adequate, if a little verbose, though one tic of the author's drove me nuts. Each of the apparently infinite number of characters in the book is introduced in Mukherjee's characteristically breezy style, then immediately fixed in amber by means of a trio of adjectives. Accurate information about the personality and character of many of these historical characters being limited, one suspects that these adjective triplets may well have been chosen at random from a thesaurus. This kind of thing:childless, socially awkward, and notoriously reclusivewealthy, politically savvy, and well-connectedwealthy, gracious, and enterprisingambitious, canny, and restlessself-composed, fiery, and energeticproud, guarded, and secretiveflamboyant, hot-tempered, and adventurouscool, composed, and cautiousintellectual, deliberate, and imposingcharming, soft-spoken and carefuloutspoken, pugnacious, and boldimpatient, aggressive and goal-drivenbrackish, ambitious, dogged, and feistysuave, personable, and sophisticated (impeccably dressed in custom-cut Milanese suits)brilliant, brash and single-mindedlaconic and secretive, with a slippery quicksilver temperObviously, Dr Mukherjee is an adherent of the ""Adjectives are Your Friends"" school of writing. If this kind of tic bothers you, be warned that it really runs rampant in this book. In the general scheme of things, it's a minor detail.Enough caviling. What has the author accomplished in this book? I think he has written an overly detailed*, partially complete**, suboptimally organized*** account of the evolution of our understanding of cancer and the development of treatment options to counteract it. The result is a very readable account, though I imagine some of the second half of the book may be hard for non-scientists to understand. In general, he seems to get things right, though there are a few lapses -- most notably in his discussion of the use of mustard gas in WWI. I can find no corroboration of his statement that ""in a single year it left hundreds of thousands dead in its wake""; one wonders if he may have confused 'casualties' with 'fatalities'. His ability to explain biomedical ideas in terms a layperson can understand seems decent, though not exceptional. I don't think the writing is of a caliber that deserves the Pulitzer prize, but what do I know?*: ""overly detailed"" - to give just one example, was it really necessary to devote a page and a half to ing Lister's introduction of antiseptics? And in a book which appeared to be focused on diagnostic and therapeutic options, why devote 40 pages to the link between smoking and cancer with the emphasis firmly on the legal and regulatory aspects?**: eye-glazing detail about kinase inhibitors, but nothing about anti-angiogenesis agents (Avastin was approved around 2003, as I recall, so it's clearly well within the time horizon)***: a person could get whiplash from all the zipping up and back down the historical timeline, for no obvious reason.Thank you.

Elif Batuman is apparently well-connected enough to have Roz Chast do the artwork for the book cover. She also seems to have a remarkable talent for self-promotion. This book has generated a considerable amount of buzz, and some near-hagiographic s. I don't quite understand why. If one wanted to view things uncharitably, Ms Batuman spent seven somewhat aimless years as a graduate student in comparative literature at Stanford without ever really figuring out why she was there. She did prove quite adept at ferreting out travel grant money, which she used to make various trips to Russia and other former Soviet republics. This book is essentially a travel memoir - the record of those trips. Like most travel memoirs, it is interesting only in spots. Two of the book's seven chapters are quite well-written and manage to sustain the reader's interest (the author's attendance at a conference about Tolstoy held at the Tolstoy estate, a trip to Saint Petersburg to visit a reconstruction of an ice palace first built in the reign of Catherine the great). But that's as good as it gets. Ms Batuman once spent a dismal summer visiting Samarkand. Inexplicably, she insists on telling us all about it. In excruciating detail, spread over three chapters. It takes up almost half of the book and is indescribably tedious. As a general rule, other people's travel memoirs are most interesting when things go wrong, but Ms Batuman's account of her summer in Samarkand almost made me stick pencils in my eyes, just to make it stop. Fortunately, the Kindle has an off switch. Two other chapters, the author's ruminations on Dostoyevsky prompted by a trip to Venice and an account of a conference devoted to Isaac Babel that she helped organize at Stanford, were readable, but not particularly interesting. Ms Batuman, or her editor, should have realized that departmental gossip, though it might be catnip for graduate students, is of almost no interest to anyone else. One point needs to be addressed. Elif Batuman does not want you to think of this book as just a collection of travel pieces. Seven years in graduate school have apparently given her higher aspirations. So she places this really bizarre section at the end of her introductory chapter, in which she essentially seems to be claiming profundity by association. This kind of thing: What if you read ""Lost Illusions"" and ... you went to Balzac's house and Madame Hanska's estate, read every word he ever wrote, dug up every last thing you could about him - and then started writing?That is the idea behind this book. Say what now? Is Ms Batuman suggesting that simply attending a conference on Tolstoy held at the Tolstoy estate will provide deep insight into his work, or magically improve the quality of one's writing about Tolstoy? This seems charmingly naive, not to say stupid. Or is she just trying to assign some kind of retrospective meaning to her seven years at graduate school? At any rate, the book is studded throughout with Batuman's assorted drive-by thoughts about various authors, most of them Russian. These are largely innocuous, with the exception of her ""analysis"" of Dostoyevsky's ""The Possessed"", which is an embarrassment from start to finish. A plodding, blow-by-blow summary that stretches for pages, is followed by a summary of what her Stanford professor told the class about it, leading in to her infatuation with charismatic classmate Matej, a smouldering Croatian cliche straight from central casting whose ""narrow glinting eyes and high cheekbones"" cause her to lose control altogether: ""a long-limbed, perfectly proportioned physical elegance, such that his body always looked at once extravagantly casual and flawlessly composed"".  Matej alternates between smoldering and brooding, reducing his classmates (male and female) to a state of drooling concupiscence, eventually triggering some kind of epiphanic advance in Batuman's understanding of ""The Possessed"" (was the trigger his two-pack-a-day habit, the discovery that his great-uncle was a cardinal, or just the shock of finally landing him in bed?) It's to Batuman's credit that her discussion of ""The Possessed"" avoids the usual mind-numbing academic jargon -- an unfortunate side effect is that its utter banality becomes impossible to conceal. I cannot agree with those more enthusiastic ers who suggest that Batuman offers particularly keen insights. She clearly enjoys reading, but is not especially adept at engaging the reader's enthusiasm. Unless you have a particular interest in obscure Uzbek poets, or the tedium of life in the former Soviet Union, this much-hyped book is likely to disappoint you. ...more",Notes are private!,0,75,1,"Dec 11, 2010","Mar 06, 2011","Dec 11, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6763627-the-possessed

Mykle Hansen's  HELP! A BeNormally I'm not beguiled by first-person narratives, especially when the voice is that of an obnoxious boorish narcissist. Mykle Hansen's  HELP! A Bear is Eating Me!  is an honorable exception. Despite having a protagonist of unparalleled loathsomeness, unblemished by even a hint of concern for others or a scintilla of self-awareness, this book charmed the pants off me. The title is sheer genius, and completely accurate. As the story opens, its truly despicable antihero, Marv Pushkin lies pinned under his all-terrain vehicle somewhere off-road in Alaska. The rest of the 120-page story is structured as an ongoing monolog from Marv to the reader. If you think about it for a second, you realise that Mykle Hansen set himself a nearly impossible challenge. A first-person narrative in the voice of a complete jerk that still manages to engage the reader is a pretty tall order. I'm happy to report that the author rises to the occasion, magnificently. I read H! ABiEM! in a single afternoon. It was hilarious. And written so smoothly that you ask yourself ""how did he do that?""Lying trapped and helpless isn't the only trial Marv has to survive. There's that angry bear whose cub he ran over with his Rover who takes revenge by gnawing off his extremities. He also suffers several hallucinatory visitations, both human and ursine, as he self-medicates to counter the mounting pain. This makes him the quintessential unreliable narrator. The character of Marv works as a (hilarious) caricature, but the thought does occur that Hansen may have sacrificed the potential for greater emotional impact by making him so relentlessly loathsome. Most readers will be ambivalent on whether to root for the bear or for Marv. Scrooge's four ghostly visitors ultimately cause him to undergo a change of heart. Lear's misadventures in the storm teach him compassion and effect a reconciliation with Cordelia before he dies; Gloucester learns to see more clearly as a result of his blinding.  HELP!

Upon the insistent recommendation of several friends who rarely steer me wrong, a few yearBefore reading this book I was not a fan of Rebecca Solnit. Upon the insistent recommendation of several friends who rarely steer me wrong, a few years ago I bought a copy of her earlier book about Eadweard Muybridge (""River of Shadows"") and found it completely unreadable. I could sense that Solnit was smart, but it was as if she were speaking in tongues - wading through her prose was sheer torment. So I ditched it.About a month ago I heard her speak about this latest book on a local radio program and she was so incredibly smart and passionate and articulate, and her thesis was so appealing, that I felt compelled to give her another chance. A Paradise Built in Hell was well worth it. It's an extraordinary book -- fascinating, thought-provoking, and ultimately persuasive in supporting Solnit's thesis. And although her style is still somewhat undisciplined, and the material could have been more tightly organized, I found these aspects less annoying than in the previous book, probably because they seemed to be primarily a manifestation of her infectious enthusiasm for the material.Viewers of ""The History Channel"" will be familiar with its habit of broadcasting a regularly scheduled ""Apocalypse Week"", during which they attempt to goose the ratings by scaring the bejasus out of their viewing audience. A typical day's programming during Apocalypse Week takes one possible way in which the world might end (megavolcano explosion, meteor impact, nuclear holocaust, deadly plague, climatic catastrophe, the Rapture, Armageddon as prophesied in the Book of Revelations, insert your own favorite apocalyptic nightmare here ...) and develops it in depth. The cynicism and idiocy with which these scenarios are fleshed out cannot be overstated (e.g. alleged ""experts"" pontificate on whether emergency services are likely to be overextended, or whether planes will fall out of the skies, in the immediate aftermath of the Rapture; or the apocalypse is linked to the prophecies of Nostradamus, or the Mayan calendar; boundless idiocy runs rampant). Certain themes are common to all apocalyptic scenarios, however- in particular, a complete breakdown of the social order, with people reverting overnight to atavistic stereotypes, resorting to looting and hoarding as they fight tooth and claw for limited resources. This projected behavioral model is also popular with government and law enforcement agencies, e.g. to justify the aggressive intervention by armed law enforcement personnel with broad powers and orders to shoot to kill (think of the official response to Hurricane Katrina). It's based on a depressing and frightening view of human nature.In A Paradise Built in Hell Solnit mounts a spirited argument that this pessimistic view of how people respond to catastrophe is fundamentally wrong. Instead, she argues, disasters are far more likely to bring out the best in people -- there is a natural desire to help one another, which is actually easier to put into action, given the relaxation of social barriers that often prevails in the wake of a disaster. You might go for years just nodding at that neighbor across the street, but after the earthquake/fire/blackout the two of you may just end up having a real conversation. Solnit grounds her argument in five specific case studies: * the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 * the 1917 explosion of the munitions ship Mont Blanc in Halifax, Nova Scotia * Mexico City's 1985 earthquake * the World Trade Center attacks of 2001 * Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath. There were instances where a bad situation was made worse when those in power, through fear or panic, resorted to extreme and unwarranted measures (General Funston's imposition of de facto martial law following the SF quake, where soldiers were given license to shoot to kill anyone who did not cooperate satisfactorily; FEMA's and law enforcement's response after Katrina, where citizens were treated as likely criminals rather than people who needed to be helped). The fear-mongering narrative of barely contained pandemonium often finds traction with the media, but is rarely accurate. By detailed examination of the five case studies, Solnit makes an extremely convincing argument that the ""natural"" response to disaster is increased cooperation, a sense of solidarity and future possibility, indeed a degree of exhilaration among most survivors. All five examples are interesting, but her discussion of the WTC attacks and Hurricane Katrina stand out as exceptionally measured, thoughtful and thought-provoking. This is an extraordinary, wonderful book, which I recommend to everyone....more",Notes are private!,0,41,1,not set,"Nov 27, 2010","Nov 27, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7970496-a-paradise-built-in-hell

Just compare the 2007 and 2008 collections, edited respectively by David Foster Wallace and Adam Gopnik, to see just how much difference a guest editor can make (DFW leaves Gopnik in the dust, unsurprisingly). So I was somewhat reassured to see Christopher Hitchens as this year's invited editor. After all, Hitchens can be regarded as a kind of literary Simon Cowell -- someone who projects the image of being way too self-satisfied with his own gleefully obnoxious persona, but who's nonetheless possessed of reasonably good judgment, with a refreshing unwillingness to suffer fools gladly. Although one might be repelled by his personality, the chances of his serving up a plateful of dud essays seemed remote. At the very least, he seemed likely to have high editorial standards and a broad range of interests. So I had high hopes for this year's anthology.Which were, unfortunately, not quite met. The 2010 collection of ""best"" essays is not a complete failure. Many of the contributions are excellent, though there are few that I would classify as outstanding (Steven Pinker's ""My Genome, Myself"" is an honorable exception, though I had already read it twice - in the NY Times when it first appeared, and in the 2010 anthology of Best American Science Writing; James Woods's New Yorker piece on George Orwell, ""A Fine Rage"", also shines, as does Jane Churchon's exquisite ""The Dead Book""). But there were many pieces that simply failed to take off, in that the reader could only observe the writer's passion for his subject, but was never moved to share it (""Brooklyn the Unknowable"", ""Rediscovering Central Asia"", ""Gettysburg Regress"" all proved too soporific for me to finish). And I remain puzzled as to the reason for including the longest essay in the collection, a 24-page profile of former Washington DC mayor, Marion Barry, whose relevance in 2010 would appear to be non-existent. Retired ophthalmologist John Gamel's beautifully written piece ""The Elegant Eyeball"" was spoiled for me by being about a decade behind the times as far as available treatments were concerned. I thought Zadie Smith's recent essay collection  Changing my Mind  was astonishing, but ""Speaking in Tongues"" is not the essay I would have singled out for inclusion here. Fans of David Sedaris will be more delighted than I was by inclusion of his piece ""Guy Walks into a Bar Car"", but my Sedaris-fatigue is well-documented, so your mileage may vary. A breakdown of essay by general topic/type is revealing:# of pieces concerned with writers/writing - 8 of 21# of pieces that are autobiographical - 10 of 21Even allowing for some double counting between those two categories, that's still an awful lot of navel-gazing for a 250-page volume. And this is ultimately what prevents this collection from being anything more than adequate. Perhaps if writers understood that the world of writers and writing is nowhere near as infinitely fascinating to the general reader as it apparently is to them, there would be a greater chance of producing an anthology of pieces that are genuinely interesting.I thought Christopher Hitchens might have the breadth of vision to produce a genuinely dazzling collection this year. I was wrong. The 2010 anthology is not an embarrassment.

But, although Allison Hoover Bartlett writes well, she never quite managed to convince me that this book was anything other than a magazine article that got out of hand. John Charles Gilkey, the serial book thief at the center of the story, is not completely dull, but he's not as interesting as the author seems to believe and certainly not interesting enough to warrant a 250+ page book. I think that the time and energy Bartlett spent in researching the topic caused her to overestimate its general appeal. She's not the first non-fiction writer to fall into that particular trap, and I'm sure she won't be the last. (A tip to all non-fiction authors: IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU. If you notice that you are starting to a take a prominent role in the story, it's a dead giveaway that your story may be getting away from you. In olden days there was this priesthood of people known as editors who would step in and point this out to you, to save you from yourself. Sadly, this kind of editor (intelligent, engaged, firm) appears to have gone extinct, so let me say this explicitly here. If you're writing non-fiction, please stay out of the picture. Repeatedly insinuating yourself into the narrative will not make me like you more - instead it's likely to reduce the quality of your reporting and irritate the hell out of most readers. So, unless you're Richard Feynman, resist the temptation to make yourself a character in the narrative. We all have a boundless need to be liked; please don't pander to yours by gatecrashing your narrative). Allison Hoover Bartlett's failure to resist this temptation weakens this book significantly, though not fatally. The failure of the book to ignite my interest stems from something that was essentially beyond the author's control. The problem is that John Charles Gilkey's kleptomania is the only faintly interesting thing about him, and it's not as fascinating as you might think. According to the jacket blurb, ""Gilkey steals for love -- the love of books"". This is accurate, strictly speaking, but it's also highly misleading. His obsession centers only on books as status objects and has nothing whatever to do with their intellectual content or with the joy of reading. He could just as well have focused his energy on stealing collectible paperweights. Or Pez dispensers. The realization that Gilkey steals books, not because he wants to read them, but because he thinks they will enhance his status, is ultimately what made this book fall flat for me. Despite Bartlett's borderline obsession with her subject, for me the book amounted to little more than a meandering account of the petty misdeeds of a small-time, singularly uncharismatic, drifter. When the account eventually just petered out, it came as a relief.I'm making it sound worse than it is. Bartlett writes fluidly and the story is not completely without interest.

Series editor This annual selection is generally a good bet, though there have been some recent bum years (http://www.goodreads.com//show/...). Series editor Jesse Cohen minimized his risk this year by prevailing on Jerome Groopman to serve as guest editor. Dr Groopman's own science writing is familiar to readers of the New Yorker; he is also author of several best-selling books. For me, seeing his name on the cover of this anthology was an immediate guarantee of quality - I'm pleased to say that the collection lived up to my expectations. In his otherwise excellent introduction Dr Groopman introduces the metaphor that the book might be thought of as a ""symphony of science"". It's not a particularly fortuitous choice (one suspects it may have been forced on him by the series editor), but he struggles gamely with it to the bitter end. I prefer his introduction to a previous, similar, anthology (http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33...), in which he laid out his criteria for inclusion: ""the articles ... have novel and surprising arguments, protagonists who articulate their themes in clear, cogent voices, and vivid cinema. They are not verbose or tangential. They are filled with simple declarative sentences. ... I suspect none of the articles was easy to write. Each shows a depth of thought and reporting that takes time and considerable effort.""  These are admirable criteria, indicating an editor who keeps the reader's welfare firmly in mind. And, with very few exceptions, the articles in the 2010 anthology satisfy them, so that the collection is accessible, thought-provoking and fun to read. I came away with the impression of a slight bias in favor of biomedical research (only weakly confirmed upon closer inspection of article categories), and a relatively narrow spectrum of sources:New York Times : 5 New Yorker : 3Science : 3Salon.com : 2Wired : 2and one each from The Atlantic, The Boston Globe, Harper's, Discover, The Nation, The New York Review of Books, Scientific American, and Science News.This reliance on sources from what might be termed the ""north-eastern establishment"" prevented me from awarding a fifth star - one thing I look for in this kind of anthology is to be led to articles I might not otherwise come across, and on this criterion Dr Groopman let me down. But this sin of omission was a relatively minor disappointment, given the high quality of the articles that were included. Some of the contributors are famous scientists(Steven Pinker My Genome, My Self, Steven Weinberg The Missions of Astronomy), some are established science writers (Elizabeth Kolbert, Benedict Carey, David Dobbs), all but a few* contributors write clearly and engagingly. My favorite articles were Elizabeth Kolbert's contribution about the link between climate change and the extinction of entire species and Sheri Fink's account of the agonizing triage choices that hospital staff faced after the onslaught of Hurricane Katrina. But there were at least a dozen other articles that were strong contenders. This is an excellent anthology, which I have no hesitation in recommending. * : I read Daniel M. Wegner's How to Think, Say, or Do Precisely the Worst Thing for Any Occasion three times and found it as devoid of substance on the third reading as on the first.

The jacket blurb aFINAL REVIEW: October 23, 2010 ""Proofiness"" by Charles Seife is a well-intentioned book that suffers a definite crisis of identity. The jacket blurb and author's introduction promise a guided tour of the seamy underworld of statistical malpractice, that is, an account of the most common ways data are misrepresented or misinterpreted in the media, either through carelessness or because of a deliberate effort to mislead. Seife is not the first author to consider the issue of misleading data analysis; his book carries on a tradition that dates back as far as Darrell Huff's ""How to Lie with Statistics"", with contributions from Edward Tufte (""The Visual Display of Quantitative Information""), or last year's excellent ""The Numbers Game: The Commonsense Guide to Understanding Numbers in the News, in Politics, and in Life"" by Michael Blastland and Andrew Dilnot. There is a major gap between what ""Proofiness"" promises and what Seife actually delivers. The first hundred pages are roughly what one might expect: graphical deception by use of misleading labels or scales, comparison of apples and oranges (e.g. dollar amounts unadjusted for inflation, absence of an appropriate control group, regression to the mean), cherry-picking of data, the tendency to interpret mere random variation as systematic, nonsensical conclusions obtained by extrapolating beyond the range of observed data, overstatement of the precision of measurements, the way in which humans are hard-wired to misinterpret risk and deal poorly with calculations involving risk. Seife's exposition of these topics is lively and clear (with the major caveat discussed below). About halfway through the chapter on risk, however, he makes a major detour. His discussion of the malfeasance of those involved in the Enron debacle, the Bernie Madoff pyramid scheme, the failures at AIG, Citigroup and other institutions, and the subsequent bailout efforts has almost nothing to do with statistical trickery, focusing instead on the public policy and regulatory issues raised by the financial meltdown. The next chapter, ""Poll Cats"" does return to the issues involved in conducting accurate sample surveys and presenting the data appropriately, with a reasonably clear discussion of systematic error versus random error. However, the following two chapters, ""Electile Dysfunction"" and ""An Unfair Vote"", taking up some 80 pages, really have little to do with data-related issues. Instead they provide a  of events surrounding the Florida vote count in the 2000 presidential election, the six-month circus that took place before Al Franken was eventually declared winner in the 2008 Minnesota Senate race, and a  of historical and present-day gerrymandering efforts whenever congressional redistricting comes up for discussion. Not that Seifen's  of the relevant events, and the issues they raise, is not interesting - it just seems to belong in a different book, as does the appendix in which he discusses electronic voting. In making this criticism, I take the view that fraud, malfeasance and corruption stemming from poor public policy, faulty regulatory mechanisms, or inadequate enforcement of existing protections, really are subjects for a different kind of book than that initially described by Seifen. Though the author does return to his initial remit in the final two chapters (discussing abuse of probability and statistical arguments within the judicial system, and for propaganda purposes), overall the book does not make a coherent whole.The caveat mentioned above, regarding Seife's exposition methods, is a major one, and prevents me from giving this book my endorsement, despite its good intentions. It's evident right there in the book's faux-cute title, ""Proofiness"". I wish I could say that the author offers a rigorous definition of exactly what he means by this invented term, but he doesn't. It remains unhelpfully vague throughout the book. Sadly, it's not the only example of authorial neologism run amok. ""Disestimation"", ""Potemkin numbers"", ""randumbness"", ""regression to the moon"", and the horrendous coinage ""causuistry""; each of these is a neologism that adds nothing to the discussion. Many of them lack a clear definition, or when a definition is offered, the term just seems to muddy the waters. For instance, Seife uses ""disestimation"" to mean ""overstatement of the precision of a number or measurement"", indicating an error related to precision. But the 'dis'-prefix clearly suggests a systematic error, as does the parallelism with ""misestimation"", which statisticians routinely use to indicate a systematic error. And while one applauds the author's efforts to educate his readership about the error of mistaking correlation for causation, the term ""causuistry"" is simply an abomination. I'm not sure where this recent trend for authors to invent their own faux-cutesy terminology, where none is needed, originates (possibly Malcolm Gladwell bears some of the responsibility), but I wish it would end. Though I am sympathetic to the author's stated aims, his execution was such that I cannot endorse this book. A better bet would be ""The Numbers Game: The Commonsense Guide to Understanding Numbers in the News, in Politics, and in Life"" by Michael Blastland and Andrew Dilnot. ***************************************************initial comments below:One of the benefits of retiring from my career as a statistician is that I no longer feel it's my personal responsibility to alert friends and colleagues to the myriad ways they are being misled or deceived by the kind of abominably poor summarization of data that's pretty much the norm these days. It's just as well - who wants to be that guy, the crank at the table who people start to inch away from surreptitiously, avoiding eye contact all the while?Not that I endorse misleading or deceptive data presentation - far from it. Now more than ever, as we all struggle to make sense of the avalanche of information that constantly assails us, the capacity for critical, intelligent interpretation is vital. So it's important to be able to see through the most prevalent fallacies in data interpretation, not to mention data presentation strategies deliberately intended to mislead. Sadly, just mentioning the word ""statistics"" has a demonstrable eye-glazing effect on all but the nerdiest adults. This latest book by Charles Seife has the laudable goal of overcoming the MEGO* reflex and educating the reader about some of the most common types of statistical malpractice out there, continuing a tradition established by such authors as Darrell Huff (""How to Lie With Statistics""), John Paulos (""Innumeracy"") or the authors of last year's highly successful  ""The Numbers Game"" (Michael Blastland and Andrew Dilnot).I will write a more complete  of this book in due course. For now, I can only remark that, although I was completely predisposed to like it, Charles Seife has already committed crimes against the language that are regrettable, to say the least. The hideous coinage ""Proofiness"" is an obvious example; the abominable term ""disestimation"" is another. It remains to be seen whether these lapses are merely aesthetic, or whether Seife is guilty of the greater sin of coining faux-cutesy terms with definitions so fuzzy that they're meaningless. *** MEGO = ""my eyes glaze over""** a Gladwellian tic that has, unfortunately, been widely copied....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Oct 05, 2010","Oct 23, 2010","Oct 05, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7972148-proofiness

My classmate Seamus Higgins and I had the day off class, but we weren't free to roam at will. Instead, we made our way to the German Embassy, where we were guests of honour (with a third student, Willie O'Brien, from one of the snooty Dublin city prep schools) at an award ceremony, the three of us having scored highest in the country in the previous year's Inter Cert German exam. The book was a handsome prize (though my German wasn't actually good enough to read it for another five years, when I spent a year in Berlin). But it wasn't the best part of the very formal, slightly awkward ceremony, at which we had to make fractured small talk with the cultural attache and the ambassador, while trying to manoeuver the delicate hors d'oeuvres and alcohol-free sparkling grape juice. I had only just turned 15, and found the whole occasion a bit of an ordeal. But it all became much more tolerable when the ambassador broke the big news, that there was a second part to the award, namely a fully paid 4-week trip to Germany for the following September (including tickets to the Munich Olympics).It was the beginning of a highly enjoyable, and lucrative, relationship with the German government, who subsequently paid for not just that month's initial visit, but also bankrolled the first year of my Master's degree at the Technical University in Berlin.Those were the good times.What's that?

Other defects include lack of a discernible plot, grievously bloviated prose, and characters that don't even achieve the status of caricature.

In September 1968, at the tender age of 11, I left the warm (over-)protective bosom of I'm the product of an Irish Catholic boarding school for boys. In September 1968, at the tender age of 11, I left the warm (over-)protective bosom of home and family -- not just one, but two grandmothers, and a housekeeper to fuss over me while my mother saw patients -- and became one of the 80 or so boys in the first year class at a Franciscan boarding school, about 25 miles north of Dublin, and 160 miles from home. The experience, particularly the first year, was incredibly brutal*. But it was also entirely necessary, and completely transformative. I can trace back almost all of what I consider to be my defining character traits to that first year at Gormanston. I wouldn't consider the time I spent at boarding school the ""best years"" of my life, but it was definitely formative. The survival strategies I learned there pretty much set the pattern for the rest of my life.So I approached Skippy Dies with reservations, and a certain amount of trepidation. The defining characteristic of life in a boys' boarding school is tedium - would Paul Murray be able to capture the tedium accurately and still write an interesting book? Would reading it stir up a bunch of memories best left undisturbed? And could the book possibly live up to the considerable hype that it has generated?It turned out to be pretty amazing. Paul Murray does indeed get boarding school life down right - he completely nails it. His more significant accomplishment is to have written a book whose appeal transcends the specificity of its setting. Skippy Dies is a sprawling, ambitious doorstopper of a book, with an extensive cast of characters (jocks, nerds, priests, lay teachers, parents, drug dealers, psychopaths), not unlike a Dickens story. Fortunately, Murray has the skill to bring these assorted character to life and to tell a story that grabs and keeps the reader's interest. The main focus of the book is to present the events that led up to the death of 14 year old Skippy and to explore its effect on the school community. Along the way, Murray considers a huge variety of disparate themes, ranging from string theory to ancient Irish burial mounds to trench warfare in World War I. Not to mention the pervasive adolescent obsession with sex. At times it seems as if these are mere digressions in a book that's already quite hefty, but the author knows what he's about, and pulls the various threads of his tapestry together to a powerful and satisfying conclusion. With so many balls in the air, you keep expecting him to crash and burn, but he doesn't -- the writing is superb throughout, the story never flags, you don't want it to stop and are a little bit sad when it does. What do we ask of a good novel? A question with as many answers as readers (a pointless question if you live in Toronto and are called Buck). I take a slightly old-fashioned view. If an author can create a vividly imagined world, make me care about his characters, and tell a good story that moves me, then I'm a happy camper. Paul Murray does all of these things in this terrific book, and does them so brilliantly that the story transcends the specificity of its particular milieu. Other ers have suggested that the book is likely to appeal only to male readers - I couldn't disagree more.This is a terrific book. The Man Booker judges should hang their heads in shame for their failure to include it on this year's shortlist.*factors that worked against me included my age (at least 2 years younger than anyone else in my class), my generally spastic performance at all sports (even more unforgivable was my unwillingness to even pretend to care about sports) and - fatally - showing up on the first day only to realize that I was the only kid in the school still outfitted in short pants.

Collateral damage to the unlucky host can be anything from mild trauma to death. Nobody really understands what is causing this epidemic of demonic possession which has spawned a plethora of ""demonologists"" in a broad assortment of flavors.

With DFW it's the slightly manic, ever-looping association of ideas as his brain connects his current thought to stuff you would never have imagined. Franzen seems unable to dodge the unevenness trap - brilliant for long stretches, interspersed with material that is either preachy, superfluous, or both.*Less powerful than ""The Corrections"" because his characters are less universal. Arguably they are all stand-ins for Franzen's own concerns and insecurities. Which are not uninteresting. But neither are they super-interesting. *Why are they all so uptight? Even when kicking over the traces, nobody seems to be having much fun.*So much emphasis on life's constraints and limitations. A ""great"" book/author should leave us with a heightened sense of life's possibilities? (Should it?)*Despite the superficially broad canvas, at the 400-page mark it feels really, really claustrophobic. *Clear pluses - writing is smooth; invariably, just when you feel you'll never get out of a particular dull patch, Franzen delivers something that's not just good, but kind of awesome.It's hard to provide a coherent summary. In its favor, ""Freedom"" is a very enjoyable read, it's structured very smartly (though this is obvious only in retrospect), and benefits from Franzen's ability to nail aspects of the culture with enviable precision. Its mixture of small-scale concerns (the Berglund family dynamics) with larger societal issues is laudable, ambitious, not entirely successful, but certainly a worthy and interesting effort. It does suffer from some of the Franzen tics mentioned above. The variation in quality (some characters are superbly realized, others remain flat), occasional bloating (Franzen's particular hobby-horses relating to the environment and population control get quite a workout), and restriction in focus (to a very narrow section of white, upper middle class intellectuals and their concerns) prevent it from being a great novel. There's also that sense of claustrophobia, bordering on joylessness, that hangs over much of the central part of the book, though this is mitigated somewhat towards the end, which was surprisingly powerful and quite moving.It is, nonetheless, a very good novel. Franzen cannot be blamed for the extraordinary hype that it has generated, and it shouldn't be held against him.

At the end of that year I was completely fluent, but noticed an odd phenomenon, that I felt like a slightly different person when I spoke German than when speaking English. Since then I've also learned Spanish to a high degree of fluency, and the same observation holds. In both cases, the main difference that I perceive has to do with humor, and the way the language I'm speaking affects my sense of humor. So I've always been interested in the extent to which language affects thought. The notion that it does is what linguists refer to as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Belief in Sapir-Whorf reached its peak in the first half of the 20th century, but since then the notion that language affects cognition has been discredited by almost all mainstream linguists.In ""Through the Language Glass"" Guy Deutscher mounts a careful, very limited defence of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. He considers three major areas - the link between language and color perception, how different languages deal with spatial orientation, and the phenomenon of differences in noun genders across different languages. His examination of the link between language and color perception is extensive and thought-provoking - he traces the development of linguistic theory on color perception from British prime minister Gladstone's commentary on the relative paucity of color terms in Homer's work, through the Berlin-Kay model (stating essentially that languages all tend to split up the color spectrum in similar ways) through very recent experiments suggesting that the existence of a particular color distinction in a language (e.g. the existence of separate terms in Russian for light and dark blue) affects the brain's ability to perceive that distinction. Deutscher's account of the evolution of linguistic theory about color perception is a tour de force of scientific writing for a general audience - it is both crystal clear and a pleasure to read.Two factors contributed to my eventual disappointment with this book. The first is that, even after Deutscher's careful, eloquent, persuasive analysis, one's final reaction has to be a regretful ""So what?"" In the end, it all seems to amount to little of practical importance. The second disappointment pertained only to the experience of reading this book on an Amazon Kindle. Reference is made throughout to a ""color insert"" which evidently contained several color wheels as well as up to a dozen color illustrations.

The cruelties and resentments of village life are recurrent themes in their work -- a good illustration is one of de Maupassant's earliest and best-known stories,  Boule de Suife , which paints a devastating picture of the meanness and nastiness that characterizes the behavior of the powerful towards those they perceive as being lower in the social pecking order. It's not a particularly uplifting view of human behavior, but de Maupassant is so convincing that you don't doubt him for an instant.I haven't read any other fiction by Penelope Fitzgerald, but ""The Bookshop"", a novel of only 120 pages (but of staggering brilliance), immediately places her in the same league as de Maupassant.

But only a fool would ignore the recommendations of readers as smart as Montambeau, Jason Pettus, and my good friend  Ben Harrison, and I'm not a complete idiot. So this past weekend I finally sat down to read Winesburg, Ohio, curious to see if it could possibly meet expectations.God, I loved this book! In the two dozen or so linked vignettes that make up his account of the small town of Winesburg, Anderson gives voice to the lonely, the dispossessed, to those, whose own emotional inarticulacy has made them outsiders in their own town. In the book he uses the term ""grotesques"" to refer to his characters, a term I found unfortunate, because these people are no more grotesque than you or I. Each of us, at one point or another in our lives, has surely suffered from the same inability to communicate that affects the characters in Winesburg; each of us has experienced the status of being an outsider, felt that there is nobody else on the planet that speaks the same language as we do. There is a universal recognizability to the characters of Winesburg that contributes greatly to the book's emotional power.Some readers react negatively to what they perceive as an overwhelmingly negative tone throughout the book. I think this is a fundamental misreading. Although Anderson's portrayal of small-town America as it changes from an agrarian to an industrial society is undoubtedly dark, it is by no means hopeless. By allowing his surrogate, the young reporter George Willard, to pass on the stories of the lonely denizens of Winesburg, he is affirming the importance of the stories, and of their protagonists. There is a sweetness in the telling of these stories that is reminiscent of Carson McCullers in ""The Ballad of the Sad Cafe"" or ""The Member of the Wedding"".I think the reason I react so strongly to the stories in Winesburg, Ohio is partly because I can identify with the outsider status of many of the protagonists. Not so much in my current life (though there are those occasional days), but there was that first year in high school, without a doubt the most miserable year of my entire life. Having skipped several grades in primary school, grown up in a household where my title of golden boy was unquestioned, I was completely unprepared for the jungle of a boys' boarding school in which I was two years younger than all of my classmates. That first year was Lord of the Flies brutal, completely miserable, and probably the most formative of my life. Two important lessons I took away from it were confidence in my own ability to survive a tough situation, and - crucially - the capacity for empathy. If you've ever suffered as an outsider, I think there are two ways it can turn out - the resentment can turn inward and fester, or - more positively - the experience leaves you with a life-long ability to empathize with those in an outsider role. Ultimately, there is a compassion at the center of Winesburg, Ohio that is anything but pessimistic, and that gives these stories their extraordinary power.Winesburg, Ohio completely earns its status as a classic. If you haven't already read it, I urge you to do so. Soon. ...more",Notes are private!,0,32,1,"Aug 22, 2010","Aug 24, 2010","Aug 22, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/470727.Winesburg_Ohio

There are few things more satisfying than starting out your day by shutting out perky cincinnatipatti, even though you immediately plow your winnings back into playing more online games. Of course, if you want to stand a fighting chance in the whole online Jeopardy caper, you'll need to buckle down and face a harsh reality. That ""U.S. Presidents"" category comes up with disturbing regularity and eventually you realise that it can't be ignored. You need somehow to get up to speed on the 42 presidents pronto, assimilating the various tidbits of common knowledge that cincinnatipatti and her ilk had their entire high school years to soak up. What to do?Well, to get the basic information down, you could do worse than acquire a copy of ""To the Best of My Ability"" (The American Presidents) . It's published by DK, a company I had previously associated with travel guide books. The DK travel books are typically pretty decent - they all follow a common template, are written at an intermediate level of detail, and incorporate lots of pretty pictures. TtBoMA can be thought of as a kind of high-level guided tour of the U.S. presidency. Following a brief introduction by general editor James McPherson, the book is divided into two parts. The first section, running about 300 pages, comprises 42 essays, one per president from Washington to George W. Bush, written by ""the nation's finest historians"". The remaining 150 pages are given over to brief accounts of the electoral campaigns and results for each presidential selection (written by Richard M. Pious) and - one of the book's major strengths - the full text of every inaugural address through 2001. My edition of TtBoMA was published in 2004. The book jacket promises ""engaging thoughtful analyses""; a ""handsomely illustrated volume"" that ""brims with fresh anecdotes, stylish prose, and sharp analysis - a treasure!"" ""Treasure"" is pushing it, but the essays are pretty decent for the most part. With only 7 pages per essay, and all of those ""handsome illustrations"" clamoring for space, in-depth analysis is not really an option, so most of the contributors focus primarily on the main events of each presidency, providing context and explaining consequences as well as the prescribed chapter length allowed. Given the constraints, TtBoMA was much better than I expected. There are unavoidable structural limitations - some presidencies were more eventful than others, and some presidents were more complex. For example, even the combined contributions of both Harrisons are nowhere near as interesting as those of Lincoln or FDR. Omitting some of the handsome illustrations in favor of additional text would have been a welcome improvement in many cases, as would relaxation of the allocation of equal length to each contribution. Devoting equal space to the month-long tenure of William Henry Harrison and to the Lincoln presidency hardly seems sensible. But these are minor criticisms. To the Best of My Ability was an interesting, engaging read, and served its purpose nicely. If it weren't for the odious baseball and football categories, I'd be mopping the floor with the other online Jeopardy contestants.Regrettably, the book has been of little help in boosting my performance in online Trivial Pursuit, a game whose questions are just a bit too ... trivial ... to be dealt with in a serious book.

Though I'm a fan of the series overall, I find it hard to give this book more than three stars. It may be a case of familiarity breeding contempt, but for much of the book I found the recurring characters - Maisie and Billie, in particular - more annoying than charming. Maisie's work as a private investigator has her crossing paths with all kinds of lowlifes and yet here we are, seven books in, and not even once has an uncharitable thought crossed her mind. So much accumulated virtue amounts to a kind of terminal dullness, and one finds oneself longing for the relief provided by Maisie's more frivolous pal Priscilla, who - fortunately - does play more of a role in this latest instalment. Unfortunately, it seems clear that Ms Winspear identifies too closely with her boringly virtuous heroine, falling into the 'protagonist as author avatar' trap.Apart from this criticism, the book benefits from Ms Winspear's undeniable talents - tight plotting (marred in this case by an over-reliance on coincidence), an interesting basic story, spiced up with the results of the author's extensive historical research (one of the most attractive features of the entire series). Ms Winspear even addresses one of my persistent gripes about previous books in the series - the emotional void in Maisie's personal life. However, I found the way in which this was done so disappointingly ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" that I rounded down my rating from 3.5 to 3 stars. This whole 'smart lady detective falls for smooth aristocrat' trope has really gone far enough. The obsession of lady detective story writers with vapid British aristocrats is a phenomenon that continues to baffle me.Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the book, just felt that it wasn't Jacqueline Winspear at her best.

As someone with over 120 books on my ""words-and-language"" shelf, I'm a confirmed language geek. Even the remotest byways of language have the potential to fascinate me. Though my interest in language is purely amateur, it is of long standing. (When I was learning Spanish a couple of years ago, my classmates were completely spooked by my enthusiasm for the subjunctive, which they deemed ""unnatural"".) The point is, where books about words and language are concerned, my bar is pretty low. I'm predisposed to like anything written by someone who is enthusiastic about language, generally willing to give the benefit of the doubt.So a language book has to suck big time for me not to like it. Secret Language manages this by fitting squarely in the category of total pointlessness. For the life of me I can't figure out why this book was written, or what the author was trying to get across. The title seems to promise a unifying theme; I'm sure Barry Blake hoped for something more coherent than this dog's breakfast of a book. There are two main problems. First, the author's inclusion criteria are far too broad. Under the rubric of ""secret language"" he drags in so many different topics that the result is an incoherent blur. Major chapter headings include:1. From Anagrams to Cryptic Crosswords2. Talking in Riddles3. Ciphers and Codes4. Biblical Secrets*5. Words of Power6. Words to Avoid7. Jargon, Slang, Argot & Secret Languages8. The Everyday Oblique9. Elusive AllusionsThis doesn't look too bad, but there's less to it than meets the eye. The book runs to about 300 pages, so you might reasonably ask ""How will Barry Blake manage to tell us something coherent and interesting about so many subjects in such a short book?""The answer is simple. He doesn't. He flits from one topic to the next, like a slightly deranged hummingbird on speed, with about as much impact. Any risk of saying anything of substance is minimized by darting rapidly from one topic to the next. The remarks that do make it in are, with rare exceptions, astonishingly banal. Here, for instance, is what Barry has to say about internet argot: The invention of the internet has given rise to an extensive argot among those communicating by email, instant messaging, and other social media. There are a number of rebus-type substitutions for syllables such as B4 'before', C 'see', M8 'mate', U 'you', abbreviations such as LOL 'laughing out loud', and emoticons such as :-) for 'smile' and :-( for 'sad' (if they are not transparent, turn them 90 degrees clockwise). Similar abbreviations are used in texting by mobile phone. Pretty edifying stuff, eh? There's a similar paragraph telling us how internet spammers like to incorporate deliberate misspellings in words like Ciali$ or V1agra to thwart email spam filters, whose inclusion I'll spare you, because the boredom in transcribing it might actually be lethal.The basic problem is that most of the book is like this - the author has very little to say that's original, his writing style makes for heavy sledding, and whatever enthusiasm he might feel for his subject isn't evident to the reader. I found the final chapter, ""Elusive Allusions"", in which the author explains such difficult linguistic conundrums as the reason Ah-nold is referred to as the ""Governator"" and the origins of phrases like ""Achilles heel"" and ""Trojan horse"", particularly irritating.*: The inclusion of a chapter devoted to such rubbish as ""bible codes"" and the like is dispiriting.

There are obvious additions or deletions, depending on whether one is talking about biography, current affairs, history or popular science.

Avoid academic jargon as far as possible. # Incorporate figures, graphs, and diagrams intelligently - this can often eliminate huge swaths of verbiage.# Choose good examples.

Many of the problems can be traced back to the fact that Dr Iacoboni seems to have believed that, since he wasn't writing primarily for neuroscientists, it would be acceptable to: # give perfunctory descriptions of experimental work,# sum up results only in the vaguest of qualitative terms (effects are almost never expressed quantitatively) # over-interpret data to fit pre-existing hypotheses# fail to discuss limitations of experimental work, or give fair discussion of competing interpretations.Judged as an overview of a body of scientific work, the book fails miserably. Note that I am not saying that the conclusions presented are wrong*. But the summarization of data is so vague and sloppy that the reader is unable to judge whether or not they are valid. This leaves one in the unsatisfactory position of being asked to take it on trust ""from the expert"". The problem there is that everything about Dr Iacoboni's style leads the reader in just the opposite direction - the way this book is written raises warning flags on almost every page. It begins with his hagiographic introduction to some of the key researchers in the area, all - not coincidentally - Italian like himself. Referring to them as the ""Fab Four"" was not a good idea. And this kind of blather only serves to antagonize the reader:""maybe this talent for deep insight is why [he:]... reminds me of Albert Einstein""""He is one of the 27 members of the exclusive Club dei 27 (www.clubdei27.com), wherein each member personifies one of Verdi's 27 operas""Intuitions of these uber-scientists are ""incomparable"", ""uncanny""; their talents are unique, special, almost not of this world. ""Now we can add neuroscience to the list of Parma's world-class exports."" DUDE - I'm all for a little local pride, but there's such a thing as overkill. Most readers will be unable to suppress the eye-rolling reflex, you lay it on so thick. And by the same token, please don't keep dragging your lovely daughter Caterina into the damned book. I don't care that she's in sixth grade, gets a lot of homework, is passionate about her ballet lessons; nor do I care about your lovely wife. If you're feeling guilty that you may have neglected your family while working on this book, take them to Disneyland or something. Don't drag them in as bit players. I wouldn't be anywhere near as cranky about the extraneous stuff that the author drags in if it weren't for the serious omissions. But failure to provide adequate detail about experimental results in a book that runs to 300 pages is a major problem. Also, is there some problem about figures and summary tables, criminally absent from this book? Almost every discussion of experimental work in the book could have been improved (and shortened) by a suitably chosen summary table or graph. It's really not hard. Even the newspapers are doing it nowadays. I could go on, but you get the general drift. The book is an annoying mess, and I remain completely baffled by those s that described it as an ""accessible account"". Only if your expectations are very low indeed would this book not be a disappointment. Mirror neurons may indeed play a critical role in the future of neuroscientific research, but a decent, accessible account of their importance is still outstanding. This book fails on almost every level.*: though conclusions about a putative link between mirror neurons and language acquisition seem clearly overstated; the imagined linking between single-cell results and imaging data appears based on little more than anecdotal data in a handful of subjects. The author remembers to include the mantra ""correlation is not causation"" every 20 pages or so; unfortunately he appears to take this as license to ignore it completely for the intervening 19 pages. Rampant speculation abounds. ...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Aug 10, 2010","Aug 14, 2010","Aug 10, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6680624-mirroring-people

I do admire her - she is ideologically committed, writes with passion, is on what I consider the ""correct"" side of the various social issues that concern her. And yet ... somehow I always end up with these niggling reservations that prevent me from endorsing her books wholeheartedly. In the case of ""Nickel and Dimed"", probably her best-known work, the niggling reservation was the artificiality of the whole endeavor - the knowledge that the whole exercise of adopting the role of one of the ""working poor"" was undermined by the existing safety net Ehrenreich had available in her actual life. Though it didn't invalidate her message, it seemed (to me) enough of a distraction to weaken the effectiveness of her presentation.Her recent book, ""Bright-sided"", has much to recommend it: Ehrenreich's willingness to question received wisdom and dig deeper for answers, her characteristically clear thinking, expressed in clear and forceful prose. Her central target in ""Bright-sided"" is a U.S. trait that is both a strength and a weakness - the uniquely American faith in the power of positive thinking. In the opening chapter, which I found the most powerful in the book, Ehrenreich describes her experience as a breast cancer patient. There is an extensive, well-organized network to which someone just diagnosed with (breast) cancer can turn for support. One of the most prevalent messages promulgated within this ""support"" network is that maintaining a positive attitude towards one's disease is imperative. Ehrenreich argues persuasively that, in many cases, this rigidly enforced dogma of positive thinking (to the extent of asking patients to view their disease as a ""gift""), is in no way supportive, and actually ends up making people feel guilty about a bad situation beyond their control. Nonetheless, the belief that maintaining a positive attitude can actually affect the course of one's disease remains prevalent, accepted unquestioningly by the majority of cancer patients, despite an almost complete lack of objective scientific evidence to support it. In subsequent chapters, Ehrenreich shows how variations of the same belief, which is essentially little more than magical thinking, have taken hold in different aspects of American life, and different sectors of U.S. society. The popularity of books like ""The Secret"", the practice of advising people who have been laid off to ""take control"" of their situation through positive visualization, the explosive growth of the ""motivational seminar"" business, the rise of evangelical churches peddling the message that ""God wants you to be rich"" -- all are manifestations of the same fundamental belief, not just in the importance of a positive attitude, but in its ability to bring about change. Ehrenreich believes (and I agree with her) that it's essentially a steaming heap of crap. The prevalent faith in positive thinking not only exaggerates its potential benefits, its effects can be actively detrimental. For instance, the amazing lack of outrage within the lower classes at the obscene excesses of the super-rich is due in no small measure to the belief that, with hard work and luck, anyone can achieve a similar measure of financial success*. This leads to a focus on the individual's own status, but works against genuine social change, of the kind that might make a real difference. And, of course, the recent financial meltdown had its origins in the exaggerated confidence that blinded investors to the (real and substantial) risks of subprime mortgages, or versions thereof, repackaged in the guise of assorted shady financial instruments. Throughout the book, Ehrenreich makes her case articulately and persuasively.Why only three stars? Because I think the book is about twice as long as it needs to be. The point that Ehrenreich wishes to make is not particularly difficult, nor is it sufficiently important to warrant 225 pages of exposition. Much of the material in the middle chapters feels redundant - crowding in one more anecdote about yet another ridiculous motivational speaker, long after the point has been made. The phrase ""methinks the lady doth protest too much"" flitted unbidden across my mind, leaving me feeling slightly guilty, as Ehrenreich's books usually seem to do.Though it's a little bloated, ""Bright-sided"" is nonetheless well worth your consideration.* : In the words of a 1996 Brookings Institute study:  Strong belief in opportunity and upward mobility is the explanation for Americans' high tolerance for inequality. The majority of Americans surveyed believe they will be above mean income in the future (even though this is mathematically impossible).  ...more",Notes are private!,0,101,1,"Aug 10, 2010","Aug 21, 2010","Aug 10, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8072044-bright-sided

There's a point fairly early on in Mr Peanut where he hits his stride, and for about the next 100 pages, he delivers some of the best material I've read in quite some time. I was fully prepared to polish up that fifth star. And then, for no apparent reason, quite bafflingly, Mr Peanut started to slide, eventually skidding out of control completely, leaving me very disappointed. With a sense of frustration that an author with such obvious talent should spiral out of control so abysmally. It prompts the same question as so many other overtly 'literary' first novels -- what in God's name do editors do these days? Isn't a major part of their job supposed to be to save gifted authors from themselves? Ross can write vividly, and with great insight. It appears, however, that he has difficulty in knowing when to stop. This book is reminiscent of a different product spokesperson - it just keeps going and going and going, looping back on itself like one of the main protagonist's beloved Escher drawings. By the time it's all over the reader is left feeling like the unfortunate Marilyn Sheppard, that is, with the sense of having been bludgeoned repeatedly around the head with a blunt instrument until any possible whimper of protest has been silenced.OK. I'm exaggerating slightly. But it depresses me that a writer as obviously smart as Adam Ross would choose to screw up what could have been a brilliant first novel by dragging in one lame postmodern gimmick after another. As the story opens, David and Alice Pepin's marriage is coming to a dramatic end, brought about by Alice's fatal anaphylactic reaction to ingesting the peanut mentioned in the title. Did she succumb to a bout of suicidal depression, or was it ... MURDER.... at the hands of the strangely detached David? Police detectives Ward Hastroll and Sam Sheppard are very interested in speaking with the grieving widower. As the author starts in on the series of flashbacks exploring the couple's marriage and how they reached that opening tableau, things seem to be proceeding along entirely conventional lines. So naturally it must be time to dip in to our bag of grubby used postmodern gimmicks .... drumroll, please ..... ah, yes - it's the trusty ""story within a story"" device. See, it turns out that the circumstances of Alice's death correspond in every detail to the plot of the book that David's been working on for lo these many months. The fog of doubt enters the reader's brain (on its little cat feet) - OMG! Is what we are reading the true account of what actually happens? Or are we reading the story within the story? I'm sooooo konfused. Fine. So the author seems to feel it necessary to jazz up his story with this entirely superfluous narrative gimmick. He wouldn't be the first. Auster, Borges, Flann O'Brien ... this trick goes all the way back to Cervantes. It doesn't add a whole lot, but it's relatively harmless. A minor annoyance. But, unfortunately, the shenanigans don't stop there. Apparently not just one, but both, detectives investigating the case have marital problems of their own. So the exploration of the Pepins' marriage is repeatedly interrupted by digressions whose inclusion is simply bewildering. The slow foundering of the relationship between Alice and David is mirrored by a (frankly implausible) impasse between Detective Hastroll and his wife, who just pulls a Bartleby one fine morning and refuses to get out of bed. For the next eight weeks. Subsequent developments are not good, and Ross wastes a good 30 or 40 pages in serving up this ridiculous subplot. As you roll your eyes and try to ignore the sheer irrelevant vapidity of this digression, things suddenly get infinitely worse. Does the name of the second detective, Sam Sheppard, ring a bell? Why, yes. Detective Sheppard is none other than the infamous Doctor Sam Sheppard, Cleveland's 1950s version of O.J. Simpson, found guilty of brutally bludgeoning his beautiful pregnant wife, Marilyn, to death in 1954. After 10 years in jail, his conviction was overturned on appeal, but he never really recovered, and died in 1970. Sam Sheppard was a real person (widely believed to have been the inspiration for ""The Fugitive""). By the time Alice meets her anaphylactic end, he has been dead for about 40 years. So his resurrection as Detective Sheppard in Mr Peanut is an obvious artifice, introduced for the sole purpose of allowing Adam Ross to indulge in a further digression, specifically a lengthy, highly detailed reimagination of the circumstances surrounding the murder of Marilyn Sheppard. This indulgence goes on for approximately 100 pages (hard to judge exactly on the Kindle). Nobody at Knopf seems to have questioned the reasoning behind dragging in this huge chunk of fundamentally extraneous material, on a topic that's already received more than its fair share of attention. Assorted other tropes are deployed, not always to good effect. There's the sinister Mr Mobius, who (you'll never guess) keeps reappearing at various stages throughout the narrative, exuding a kind of Hannibal Lecter-ish menace, as he bargains with ""Detective"" Sheppard to see portions of David's manuscript. Then there's David's fascination with Mobius strips and Escher prints, loaded with symbolic import. It's a bit sophomoric, but in the scheme of things these are minor annoyances.What pulls this whole mess back from the brink is this: Ross's examination of the marital difficulties of his fictional couple, Alice and David, is astoundingly good. So is his reimagination of the inner life of the Sheppards; it's intuitive and astute to the point of being a very convincing interpretation of the available data. (The interlude involving Hastroll's marriage is just an embarrassment, from start to finish).The real problem may be that Ross doesn't have much confidence in his own ability. His account of the foundering marriage of Alice and David is extraordinary. The book he should have written would be about half as long as Mr Peanut and remain focused on this central relationship. It could have been brilliant. Instead he has given us this inferior bloated mess, in which he tries much too hard and sabotages himself at every step. Nevertheless, I strongly recommend that you read Mr Peanut, despite its multiple flaws. Because when he isn't shooting himself in the foot, Adam Ross writes astonishingly well. You will never again think about marriage in the same way. ...more",Notes are private!,0,49,1,"Jul 21, 2010","Jul 27, 2010","Jul 21, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6893663-mr-peanut

I did not like ""ThThe evidence that I am a complete Philistine continues to accumulate, as yet another acknowledged classic sails right over my head. I did not like ""The Good Soldier"", for various reasons. Here are a few:# The plot was an awkward mixture of implausible contrivance and overwrought melodrama, and seemed fundamentally not credible, from start to finish. The basic setup (Serial philanderer Edward cheats on controlling Leonora and cavorts with Florence, the slutty wife of the book's narrator John) was OK - this kind of love quadrangle is hardly unusual. But the way the plot unfolds from the basic premise seemed ludicrous, even allowing for the fact that the account of events is being delivered as the recollections of possibly one of the most unreliable narrators in all of 20th century fiction. The plot was little more than a series of random, largely implausible events, lurching from one improbable crisis to the next. Prussic acid capsules in the vanity case? Suicide by penknife? Telegram-induced catatonia? Give me a break. # The silliness of the plot had a lot to do with the complete lack of depth of the protagonists. You never get the feeling that any of these characters are real people, so their weird antics never seem like anything other than the jerky behavior of cartoonish puppets. Though most puppets have more character than these annoying stick figures. The most annoying of the stick figures being, hands down, the idiot narrator, John Dowell. A man allegedly so stupid that he doesn't notice his wife is cuckolding him with his best friend and hero  for 8 years . Or that her ""heart condition"" is pure invention and that she's healthy as a horse. Who is apparently the only person on the planet unaware that she committed suicide by ingesting prussic acid. There was an enormous sense of relief upon finishing the book, because at least one didn't have to suffer the idiocies of the obtuse narrator any longer. (Dowell wasn't just idiotic; he was also completely without charm, probably a virgin, and likely a closet case)# My final objection to the book was the profusion of passages like this one: And, proud and happy in the thought that Edwardloved her, and that she loved him, she did not even listen to whatLeonora said. It appeared to her that it was Leonora's business to saveher husband's body; she, Nancy, possessed his soul--a precious thingthat she would shield and bear away up in her arms--as if Leonora werea hungry dog, trying to spring up at a lamb that she was carrying. Yes,she felt as if Edward's love were a precious lamb that she were bearingaway from a cruel and predatory beast. For, at that time, Leonoraappeared to her as a cruel and predatory beast. Leonora, Leonora withher hunger, with her cruelty had driven Edward to madness. He must besheltered by his love for her and by her love--her love from a greatdistance and unspoken, enveloping him, surrounding him, upholding him;by her voice speaking from Glasgow, saying that she loved, that sheadored, that she passed no moment without longing, loving, quivering atthe thought of him. Between this book and ""Mr Peanut"", it's been a bad month for marriage. But at least ""Mr Peanut"" was interesting.

Surely, even the virtuous, feisty, wise Maisie HAS NEEDS. But I'm not holding my breath. Much as I enjoy Jacqueline Winspear, it's clear by now that she's more interested in studding her books with those colorful period details mined from the bowels of the Bodleian than broaching a topic as indelicate as allowing Maisie a bit of nookie more than once a decade. Not that we don't enjoy those lovingly researched period details - they warm the cockles of our BBC/Masterpiece Theatre/PBS-loving hearts. In general, Ms Winspear has a fairly light touch. Her books are fun to read, and this latest instalment is no exception. It seems churlish to point out that it would have been better to relegate the whole dead baby/bereaved mother subplot to whatever Dickens story it escaped from. A writer as talented as Ms Winspear has no need to resort to that kind of emotional manipulation.added, July 16th, 2010:Now that I've had a few days to digest ""Among the Mad"", I feel I should add that I think it's one of the best in the series. The main plot (escalating acts of terrorism by a wounded WWI veteran, involving the release of nerve gas, first targeting members of the government, then the general public, with a down-to-the-wire manhunt to find him before his planned New Year's Eve finale) could be taken from today's headlines. The slow buildup of tension is extremely well done - Winspear has a gift for pacing, and her account of the interactions among the various parties involved in the chase (Scotland Yard, the Special Branch, government research labs, Maisie and her assistant) is entirely convincing. You could turn on your TV on any given Tuesday evening and find an episode of NCIS* whose plot is virtually identical to that of ""Among the Mad"". The forensics would be much glitzier, and the threat would be some kind of bio-weapon, but the themes and issues explored would be remarkably similar. We are used to thinking of Ms Winspear as someone who brings the past to life in her stories - the themes explored in this particular story still resonate in 2010. *: another guilty pleasure of mine; comparison with NCIS should be considered as high praise (but it's frankly a relief that Maisie Dobbs doesn't have an iphone, particularly if you're a closet Luddite like me). ...more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,"Jul 12, 2010","Jul 13, 2010","Jul 12, 2010",,Audio CD,view (with text),/book/show/3690427-among-the-mad

There is quite a range to these stories, but they can be loosely grouped into three (roughly equally represented) categories:# stories set in a vaguely dystopic future# stories set in the present with a setting or premise that is unusual or a little extreme# stories set in the present with a completely quotidian setting An example of the second category is ""Finesse"", in which a totalitarian dictator needs to undergo a risky operation to survive, and finds that the doctor most capable of performing the surgery successfully is a woman he consigned to a ""detention camp"" years before, Another example is ""Flesh Remains Flesh"", a story about an over-zealous taxidermist who comes to a bad end. The stories in this category explore the same territory favored by Roald Dahl in his stories for adults. Many writers have a tendency to stick within a single, relatively narrow, category, so Faber's willingness to stretch is admirable. All of the stories in the collection are accomplished; four or five are exceptional. Interestingly, it was the least flashy stories that were most successful, in my opinion. A recovering drug addict tries to reconnect with her son who's been placed in foster care (""Serious Swimmers""); a new mother is overwhelmed by parenthood (""The Smallness of the Action""); a computer gamer's horizons are extended by an encounter with a tiny neighbor (""Mouse"") - in each of these stories, and the title story, Faber reminds us that even the quotidian dullness of everyday existence has its moments of unexpected grace. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Jul 12, 2010","Jul 20, 2010","Jul 12, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/123064.Vanilla_Bright_Like_Eminem

It started with the very first word in the book, freshly minted for the occasion by the author. You read it and experience an involuntary recoil of revulsion at the sheer tin-eared ugliness of it. For God's sake, Kathryn Schulz, please don't title your opening chapter ""Wrongology"". If the first word in your book already makes my flesh crawl, that's hardly a good sign.I chose this book based on a fawningly positive NY Times  by Dwight Garner, who obviously suffers from some kind of unhealthy crush on Kathryn Schulz. According to Dwight, KS ""flies high in the intellectual skies, leaving beautiful sunlit contrails"". Now, I get off on the ozone rush of huffing a beautiful intellectual contrail as much as the next reader, but I'm afraid in this case Dwight is letting his slobbering fanboy worship cloud his judgement. Kathryn Schulz is not stupid, but she's certainly no intellectual goddess. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem, but given the direction she chose to take her investigation in this book, the reader begins to wonder if her choice was a wise one and (I hate to say it) if she really has the intellectual chops for the task she sets herself. I think it would have been a perfectly straightforward matter to come up with a reasonable working definition of ""being wrong"", one would that cover the great majority (say 95%) of situations that are of practical interest. Had Kathryn Schulz chosen to adopt this kind of pragmatic approach, she would have written a considerably shorter book and, I think, a much better one. Unfortunately, she has chosen instead to wax philosophical about epistemological difficulties in coming up with appropriate definitions of concepts such as ""knowledge"", ""being right"", ""error"", and if one wants to bump it up a meta-level, knowledge of errors (one's own and those of others). Not surprisingly this turns out to be a rabbit hole, and not a particularly interesting one. Schulz's choice to explore these questions has the immediate effect of lengthening the book considerably and burdening whole sections with the kind of jargon only a professional philosopher could love. A case in point: the First Person Constraint on Doxastic Explanation , which is apparently the phrase philosophers use for the phenomenon that anyone pressed to defend his/her beliefs will say that it's because they are true. Flawed logic, conflict of interest, reason clouded by emotion -- these problems may be immediately evident to other people, but we are notoriously bad at detecting them in our own thinking. To her credit, the author acknowledges the clunkiness of the philosphical jargon; I just wish the replacement she proposes - the 'Cuz It's True Constraint didn't set my teeth on edge with the faux-folksiness of that 'cuz. But this reflects a problem with Schulz's style that bothered me throughout the book. Maybe it's a consequence of her time as a reporter for Rolling Stone, but she never seems to find a consistent register. As she flips back and forth from discussing scientific results to illustrations from popular culture, this failure to establish an appropriate register becomes jarring. Whether it's her choice to write ""fuck up"" when ""screw up"" would clearly have been more appropriate, or sentences like this one, about Hamlet: ""It's not as if the prince dillydallies for fourteen scenes over whether to order the BLT or the chicken salad"", I just did not enjoy Schulz's writing style.Which is a shame, really, because buried in there among the superfluous philosophical baggage and the rambling mess of her own prose, she has some genuinely interesting points to make. In particular, her observation that making mistakes is an intrinsic part of human nature, and is an essential component of scientific enquiry, is important, if not particularly novel. However, Schulz is not the first person to have considered the questions in her book. A considerably clearer, more focused, discussion can be found in the excellent ""Mistakes Were Made"" by Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson. The rambling undisciplined character of Schulz's writing prevents me from giving her book more than two stars. The disappointment is that, with some decent editing, she could have written a far better book....more",Notes are private!,3,83,1,"Jun 30, 2010","Jul 07, 2010","Jun 30, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7811050-being-wrong

My residual I had a sufficiently positive impression of Dan Ariely from his first book, Predictably Irrational, to be willing to give this one a try. My residual impression from the earlier book was of a smart, likable guy, with a knack for designing clever experiments to capture the irrational side of human behavior, particularly when making decisions with economic consequences. This area of investigation has risen to prominence over the past 5 to 10 years, there is now a flood of titles on the market, which shows no sign of abating in the foreseeable future. Predictably Irrational holds up well against the competition: it covers a lot of ground in reasonably concise fashion, and is quite readable. Each chapter's primary message is grounded in, and illustrated by, specific experiments conducted by Ariely and colleagues, and this is the book's particular strength. Given the strength of Ariely's first book, and the relatively short interval since its publication, it would be truly surprising if this second book reached the same high standard. ""Sophomore slump"" is a real phenomenon (just a manifestation of what statisticians would call ""regression to the mean"") and Professor Ariely is not immune to its effects. A er predisposed to be critical of the author might argue that this is a sequel that is short on substance, presenting results that are either (i) blindingly obvious (e.g. that people need to believe their work is meaningful to feel motivated), (ii) needless and not particularly illuminating amplification of ideas already presented in the first book (overvaluing of ownership and the power of anchoring),or,(iii)material presented previously, and better, by other authors.That assessment seems unduly harsh to me - the sequel shares some of the positive qualities of the original - primarily Ariely's clear and engaging style, which guarantees readability at the very least. Unfortunately, an engaging style doesn't quite make up for some of the book's obvious weaknesses. The material in the earlier book was fascinating because most of the results were surprising -- counterintuitive or non-obvious -- but the experimental work was strong enough to be persuasive. The experimental foundation of the work discussed in the second book is noticeably weaker across the board, at times barely rising about the level of anecdotal data, with the author displaying a regrettable propensity to issue pronouncements of a general nature solely on the basis of his own personal experience. Even if one disregards the relative weakness of the empirical evidence to support them, claims made in the second book are simply not as interesting as the earlier work - either they are immediately obvious, or restatements of material likely to be familiar to anyone who has done any prior reading in this general area. Finally, there is the unavoidable impression that a significant portion of the material is nothing more than padding (the book is studded with space-filling sidebars that are notably lacking in content: examples include a one-page explanation of the myth of Sisyphus, complete with stick-figure diagram, a verbatim transcript of an online rant about the 2008 banking bailout, graphs that were superfluous, cartoonish, or both). The most egregious padding is Ariely's inclusion of what seems like an endless stream of personal anecdotes from his own life, a feature that severely tests the reader's patience and is an implicit acknowledgement that this is a book based primarily on anecdotal evidence, rather than hard science.With these caveats in mind, I quite enjoyed the book. But I can't give it a resounding endorsement. Instead, I would steer readers to: Predictably Irrational ,  Stumbling on Happiness and  Nudge . Cumulatively they afford an accessible account of the same material that is more thorough and more rigorous than that in Professor Ariely's somewhat disappointing sophomore effort....more",Notes are private!,1,62,1,"Jun 30, 2010","Jul 02, 2010","Jun 30, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7815744-the-upside-of-irrationality

It's just as easy to give you the uncoded description. ""The Imperfectionists"" tracks the terminal decline of a fictional English language newspaper (headquartered in Rome), as its continuing slide into financial insolvency makes its extinction inevitable. The book is structured as a series of vignettes of the paper's key staffers, from obituary writer to editor-in-chief. This device allows Rachman to give a kaleidoscopic view of his main character, which is the paper itself, or more precisely the specific constellation of talent, personalities, relationships, financial conditions and just random luck that have combined in the past to allow the paper to thrive and which now guarantee its demise. This approach is not without risk; for instance, I thought the individual-viewpoint stories in ""Olive Kittredge"" never coalesced to a coherent whole. Somehow (alchemy? magic? witchcraft?) Rachman avoids this trap - TI flows smoothly and irresistibly to its foregone conclusion.What makes TI irresistible is the brilliance of Rachman's gift for characterization. Collectively, the motley crew of staffers in this newsroom accommodate every dysfunction in the manual, and a few the psychiatrists haven't yet gotten around to classifying. With one or two exceptions, each of Rachman's characters is desperately unhappy. Many of them seem close to some kind of edge. I found them all completely believable and totally fascinating. The irony in Rachman's portrait is impossible to miss -- newspaper readers form their worldview by reading and trusting the words of these deeply flawed people. Rachman's particular gift is to sketch each character's flaws with the relentless clarity of the anonymous, omniscient narrator, but to do it with obvious warmth and affection. He's worked with these folks, at least with their real-life counterparts at the (now defunct) International Herald Tribune, and he loves them.Ultimately, The Imperfectionists is his extended eulogy to the profession of newspaper reporter and it has the charm and the power to move us that the best tributes attain. There is an elegaic feel to the book which makes it a pleasure to read, even as Gotterdammerung approaches and things in the newsroom are getting progressively darker. Thus, the recent book that TI most closely resembles is Stuart O'Nan's exquisite (and underrated?) ""Last Night at the Lobster"", a low-key, extremely moving account of the last day at work for the staff of a NE Red Lobster restaurant chosen for closure by the corporate beancounters. Rachman's story has a little more razzmatazz (naked bodies and naked ambition, suave Roman suitors, fancy cocktails), which makes it more fun to read than the O'Nan book. Fortunately it achieves this without lapsing into predictability, while maintaining the warmth and heart at its core. Rachman is so obviously fond of the characters he's created, warts and all, that he charms you into liking them too.

You'd think that just once, even if only by oversight, maybe one of the sad-sack characters that populate A Strange Commonplace might experience a moment of joy, however fleeting. But no*. It's not that kind of book. It's got a cast of characters who are mostly a bit lost, beaten down by life, struggling to connect meaningfully and failing miserably. It's hard to feel sorry for Sorrentino's procession of losers, as their typical response to life's vicissitudes is a mixture of self-pity, pettiness, resentment, revenge, and cruelty towards others. There's not a likeable one in the bunch.The book's structure is relevant, so let me describe it here. It's a collection of 52 stories, each about 2 to 3 pages long. Each story sketches an incident in the lives of the protagonists; there is some overlap among the characters across different chapters, though it's not always easy to figure out who's who. This seems to be deliberate, as Sorrentino often fails to tell us a character's name, using some kind of character tic or clothing item as an identifier instead. Geography is another unifying factor, most of the characters grew up in Brooklyn; the sketches range from the 1940s to the 1990s, suggesting that Sorrentino is writing about his own cohort. There is one further nominal degree of structure; for each of the first 26 chapters, there is a story with the same name in the second half of the book. In some cases, there is an obvious connection between stories that share a name. More often than not there is no discernible connection, so the reader is left wondering.With a structure of 52 chapters, most of which are only 2 pages long, this book is not given over the the major emotions. You won't find raging passions, towering rage, soul-consuming jealousy (more's the pity). Instead, the reader is suffocated by the slow accumulation of repeated acts of self-destruction, meanness and cruelty, fueled by resentment and petty jealousy, leading to alienation and quiet desperation.What does this pack of losers get up to? Pretty much the same dreary smorgasbord of predictable bad behavior that any gritty account of the mean streets is expected to deliver (gritty realism, and a predilection for messing with form and structure, seem to be Sorrentino's thing). The younger protagonists pick on the weak and worry about their status within the pack before graduating to date rape and adultery. Nameless wives sit around and hit the bottle while waiting for their philandering husbands to come home. Dentists take advantage of their anesthetized female patients; brothers engage in mutual cuckoldry. The older characters sit in run-down apartments, alienated from their children and former friends, hoarding sleeping pills as a fallback. It's not exactly what you might call a laff riot. Things looked pretty bleak at the 30-page mark, and I almost gave up at that point. But every time I was tempted to do so, Sorrentino would serve up a chapter so good that it kept me reading. For years, Gilbert Sorrentino occupied a peculiar spot on my mental literary map - just at the edge of the dark deep impenetrable Unread Forest. I knew of him, had never read any of his work, but had somehow acquired the impression that he was hip before anyone else was hip. I was a little bit scared of him, to be honest. So reading ""A Strange Commonplace"" was an effort to fill a gap. I suspect it may not have been the best place to start -- the relentlessly gloomy view it presents, as well as the limitations imposed by the structure made it a hard book to like. And you can scoff at my 19th century views all you want, but there is absolutely no f---ing way that this book can reasonably be classified as a novel. Even though that's exactly what the back jacket proclaims it to be, don't fall for it. It's a collection of profoundly dreary mini-stories, sharing only a very tenuous link, about a bunch of unsympathetic losers engaged in a variety of obnoxious behaviors, both self-destructive and mutually damaging. I give it 2 stars, and resolve to give Sorrentino another try. Suggestions are welcome.*: edited July 7th to remark that there is actually one moment of joy that's described in the book - the first half of one of the stories called ""Snow"" describes the joy and wonder that a young boy experiences as he caroms down a snow tunnel his father has made. He slides into his Dad's arms as his mother cheers him on. Let's see how the story ends: The child begins to laugh joyously in the crepuscular gray light of the magical tunnel, laughing since he does not know, nor do his mother and father, in their youth and beauty and strength, that this will never happen again, and that the family is almost finished and done with. His father wears a white silk scarf with blue polka dots. That scarf shows up again in other stories that detail the bitter disintegration of a marriage. These stories were written at the end of Sorrentino's life, about which I know nothing. But I certainly hope that when my time comes, I exit with a less jaundiced view of human nature.A Strange Commonplace might make an excellent gift for the bitter, disillusioned loser in your life....more",Notes are private!,-2,4,1,"Jun 21, 2010","Jul 06, 2010","Jun 21, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/647356.A_Strange_Commonplace

Study it closely, absorb its lessons and - unless you're a complete nitwit - you will be sought after by hostesses from Buckinghamshire to Balmoral. General editors Vera Mendel and Francis Meynell and music editor John Goss approach their task of assembling their survival manual for the weekend guest with a kind of brook-no-nonsense, Cold Comfort Farm sensibility that is refreshing. The result was sufficiently popular to warrant 17 reprintings of the first edition between 1924 and 1928. The editors point out that any self-respecting guide of this sort should undergo a major revamping every five years; a greatly expanded second edition was published in 1929 - my copy is a version of the second edition.

Only the most robust friendships are likely to survive an honest game of ""Russian Sledges"" though, so attempt it at your own risk.An extra helping of that goofy British charm is provided in the chapter ""Travels with a Donkey"", which gives advice on how to do just what its title promises. Subsequent chapters on birds and the night sky by season should prove invaluable to people like me who are generally oblivious to their physical surroundings. A chapter on Food and Drink mixes eccentricity with sound practical advice, including cocktail recipes from Satan's whisker to the Rajah's peg. Recognizing that things don't always go as we might wish, the final two chapters address ""the law and how you break it"" and administering ""first aid in divers crises"". Whether you want to ""stay the hicquet"", gain relief from the ""windy spasm"", or know what to do before ""hobnailing the liver"", it's all here in one handy reference volume.

If I'd taken the trouble even to scan the table of contents I would have recognized the impressive scope of the essays in this collection. I had always thought of Martin Gardner as a mathematician - a characterization that manages to be both severely reductive and inaccurate (he did not have formal training in mathematics).The 47 essays in this excellent collection show Gardner as a supremely engaging Renaissance man of science. He had an apparently boundless curiosity about the world around him, as well as an exceptional gift for writing about the ideas that engaged his interest. He was justly famous for his collections of mathematical diversions and puzzles, but these were just a tiny fraction of his total oeuvre.

I guarantee that there will be at least ten or a dozen pieces that will knock your socks off.

The Past Change?""), a demolition of supply-side economics (""The Laffer Curve""), a devastating critique of ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", an essay on Coleridge and ""The Ancient Mariner"", one on ""White, Brown, and Fractal Music"", and the famous essay, first published in The New York Review of Books, in which Gardner delivers a blistering  of his own book ""The Whys of a Philosophical Scrivener"".In addition to Gardner's clear style and perpetually enquiring mind, two other features of his writing stand out. He is never one to suffer fools gladly and has a low tolerance for fuzzy thinking: ""This is Teutonic baloney"",""It is hard to know which deserves the stronger condemnation: Freud's childish credulity or the shameful way his daughter and other guardians of the orthodox analytic flame have done their best to prevent it from becoming public knowledge"".He is also entirely fearless: ""There is a curious mistake in (Stephen) Hawking's discussion of Newton's cosmology"", ""Nowhere does (Allan) Bloom seem aware that American philosophy has for half a century been tramping to the beat of British skepticism and empiricism.."". As a result, his essays about assorted manifestations of pseudoscience are particularly entertaining, while sacrificing none of their cogency.I have an online subscription to Scientific American. I sure hope it gives me access to Gardner's extensive contributions to the magazine over the years. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,Jun 2010,"Jun 10, 2010","Jun 01, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/415075.The_Night_Is_Large

For starters, our boy Forrest has an I.Q. of 75. Played - apparently not much of a stretch - by Tom Hanks, on a natural stop along the career arc that took him from the simpering idiocy of Bosom Buddies to the affront to the intelligence that is The DaVinci Code. You might reasonably ask what type of banality one should expect from a film with voiceover by someone with an IQ of 75. Well, this type: ""Life is like a box of chocolates""""Stupid is as stupid does""""We was like peas and carrots""In the book, Forrest is an idiot savant; in the movie he's just an idiot. But a special idiot, apparently, one whose exploits include, but are not limited to •	Winning a football scholarship to the University of Alabama, becoming an All-American and meeting JFK in the White House •	Graduating college in 5 years (unclear how, exactly) •	Enlisting in the army, going to Vietnam and winning a Medal of Freedom, getting to show his wounded buttock to LBJ. •	Meeting Abbie Hoffman, John Lennon, Nixon, Dick Cavett. •	Becoming a ping-pong champion, traveling to China •	Meeting Nixon, discovering the Watergate burglars, triggering the Watergate scandal •	Becoming super-wealthy from his shrimp boat •	Becoming super-duper wealthy from a fortuitous early Apple investment •	Starting the jogging craze, the smiley button, the expression ""shit happens"", the fad for pet rocks, and anything else of cultural import during the 70's. We are appraised of each of these events by Forrest's droning voiceover. Throughout the malodorous mulligatawny of muddle-headed, meandering misadventures that constitute the “plot” of this mess of a movie, we are expected to believe that our slow-witted friend, by obeying orders and never questioning authority, passes through the 60's and 70's going from one success to the next, meeting with world leaders and presidents, leaving his Gump-stain on all the major milestones of the age. For bathos, the tale of his lady-love, a hippie-stripper-peacenik-drug-addict-crazy woman, is interwoven - it's basically a downhill trajectory for her, culminating in the final indignity of succumbing to complications from AIDS, as one more desperate milestone is crammed in to the festering goulash of the plot. Before her final exit, we learn she has fulfilled her plot obligations by popping out a Forrest Junior, played all too convincingly by the nauseatingly cute personification of perky moppet-dom, Halie Joel Ozspawn. Let's see, what's the message here? It seems to be that an idiot can not only survive, but prosper and excel, in the U.S. of A. An idiot can, in fact, be directly involved in every development of political or cultural significance in the U.S. over a two-decade period. We know this, because the idiot tells us so himself. So here's the thing. This emotionally manipulative tapestry of implausibility was a huge success - both financially and critically. How could a string of ever-more incredible tall tales, narrated by a simpleton, end up being so universally acclaimed? I think there are two reasons, neither of which reflects particularly well on the movie, or on the public who gave it such a rapturous reception. First, the fundamental message - idiot not only makes good, but becomes a huge success - is one which, however stupid, is enormously appealing to the American public. A society which is deeply anti-intellectual at its core, where accusing someone of being ""elitist"" is considered a major body blow, sufficient to shut down all further debate, is apparently all too happy to lap up the myth of the success of an imbecile like Forrest. Never mind that in real life, Forrest would end up soiling himself in the corner of whatever Dickensian mental home the state of Alabama had consigned him to. Second, the moviemakers have made a very canny calculation, figuring - apparently correctly - that since the solipsism and self-obsession of the Baby Boomers knows no bounds, one recipe for success is to pepper the movie with scenes guaranteed to manipulate a Boomer recognition response. Thus, Boomers are given a double treat in this movie - they get to take a guided tour of the nostalgic highlights of their two most formative decades, in the company of an amiable dullard to whom they can only feel superior. What’s not to love? Forgive me if I, for one, reject the implied message that obeying orders and unquestioning obedience to authority pave the way to success, in this, or in any decade. Because, no matter how charmingly the simpleton might peddle it, crap is still crap. And there’s no pony hidden in the steaming heap of manure that is “Forrest Gump”.

I'll admit - sometimes the problem is my own stunning lack of physical coordination (my clumsiness knows no bounds). But I do feel oppressed by the tyranny of bad design - the completely non-intuitive nature of the new microwave, the constantly metastasizing collection of remotes, all those unexplored capabilities of my cell phone, the appalling hideosity of Windows XP. This makes me a sucker for books like this one, where the fundamental emphasis is on the contribution of poor design to bad results. The book is a compilation of real-life histories, each chosen to illustrate Steven Casey's basic message. This is straightforward; attributing disastrous outcomes to ""human error"" is often not the complete story - in many cases the real problem turns out to be poor design decisions that make no allowance for the way that people actually interact with technology. So when a software glitch in the Therac-25 machine used to administer radiation therapy to the misfortunate patient in the title vignette causes the machine to deliver a dose of 25,000 volts in a proton beam powered by 25 million electron volts with the protective shield inactivated, the radiotherapy technician receives no signal that anything has gone wrong and proceeds to repeat the mistake twice more, thereby sealing the patient’s eventual death warrant.In the collection of twenty anecdotes that make up this book, almost nobody comes to a good end. Russian cosmonauts perish when the safety valve in their re-entry module proves inoperable under actual emergency conditions, workers at an Idaho nuclear power plant inadvertently dislodge a rod during routine maintenance and trigger a meltdown, pilots crash planeloads of passengers due to (avoidable) confusion based on ambiguous or false information received from the instrument panel, and in Bhopal over 2500 people die as a toxic cloud of methyl isocyanate descends over the sleeping city. In other news, a four-month old baby dies immediately in the ICU when her nurse inadvertently connects an EKG lead to one from the IV pump; an 8-year old boy narrowly escapes invasive, potentially disfiguring, surgery when an alert radiologist figures out that the apparent lesion detected by his senior colleague is actually an artifact caused by leakage of X-ray contrast dye onto the film; at the San Francisco watering hole The Peppermint Twist several customers lose their esophagi after being served a delicious glass of the cleaning liquid Eco-Klene in lieu of the featured happy hour special, the watermelon shot.Not all of the incidents in the book are fatal. When the captain of the oil tanker Torrey Canyon collides head-on with the Scilly Isles, the only victims of the ensuing 31-million gallon oil spill are the flora and fauna along the beaches of the south of England and the north of France. The chaos that ensued in March 1992 when a hapless Salomon Brothers trader engaged in programmed trading filed an order to sell 11 million shares of stock (instead of 11 million dollars worth) was limited because he did so just a few minutes before the closing bell. However, in September 1923, when Commodore Donald Hunter ordered radio operators further down the food chain to “correct” their position readings based on nothing more than the certainty that his calculations and gut instinct were more reliable than their “new-fangled technology”, things did not end well. Seven destroyers and 23 sailors had their lives cut short as a result. Casey’s recurring point is that each disaster was not just a result of human error, but of human error caused by poorly designed technology. Most of the design errors fall into depressingly predictable categories: unintelligible or counterintuitive instrumentation, systems without the necessary communication channels, failsafe mechanisms that proved not to be, alarms that failed to trigger or that triggered so often they were ignored in a genuine emergency, a failure to recognize how behavior in a hierarchical situation can shut down crucial communication links. The examples Casey provides are all reasonably clear illustrations of his message. And yet I was somewhat disappointed by the book. His writing style is clear, but so pedestrian that the word “plodding” comes to mind. Given the richness of his material, one can’t help wondering how much more vividly these stories might have been presented in the hands of a better writer. (Somehow it came as no surprise to learn that the book’s title, which is probably the best thing about it, is attributable to Ray Cox, the patient who died as a result of the accident in the first vignette, and not to the author). Another disappointment is the author’s failure (which he acknowledges to be deliberate) to provide any analysis of each; though he does present the facts of each case clearly, a little commentary would have been welcome.Set Phasers on Stun covers similar ground to Donald A. Norman’s classic  The Design of Everyday Objects  and Simon LeVay’s  When Science Goes Wrong . It is a distinct improvement on the latter, but fails to reach the incisive clarity of the former.

But mass rejection is not the appropriate response here. Because - no surprises - this anthology is like every other collection you've ever read, an entirely mixed bag. In with the many steaming turds are nestled more than a few nuggets. One thing needs to be clarified up front. I'm not sure what the blurb in the book description is referring to, but it's certainly not this particular anthology. There's nothing by Zadie Smith, murakami, or .. in this volume.

Vollmann (on W.G.

A fairly healthy loathing for the writing of Rick Moody and Rich Cohen, based on previous experience. The two pieces here only reinforce that loathing. Certain pieces (Tayari Jones, Scott Jones, Michelle Tea) smacked too much of enforced diversity for my liking; the 40-page piece by Michelle Tea pretty much begged to be put aside, so I did. Eula Biss, in contrast, showed that it is possible to write about race-related issues sensitively and without preachiness. David Orr and William T. Vollmann convinced me that the authors they wrote about were worth my consideration; Ed Park and Ben Ehrenreich did not, with Park's essay being particularly impenetrable. Tom Bissell, Ginger Strand, Sam Lipsyte, and Jonathan Lethem were charming, funny and articulate; the same cannot be said about Peter Lunenfeld, whose linkage of Gidget to Robert Musil was just a tad precious. Richard Powers had little of substance to contribute on the subject of genetic testing, though there was a lot of sound and fury. Stephen Elliott's contribution contains these lines:""I lived in Amsterdam. It was 1992 and I was a barker for a live sex show called the Casa Rosso. I was dating a hooker from Australia and then Miriam, a Surinamese cabaret dancer whose husband was in jail for murder.""This will either set you to devouring the essay in question, or to running screaming into the night. I have not read the remaining essays, nor do I intend to. It seems safe to assume that their primary appeal is to the demographic of snotty record store clerks described so well in Nick Hornby's ""High Fidelity"".The piece by Rick Moody is simply atrocious. ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Apr 25, 2010","Apr 25, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6092501-read-hard

Those lists of  weirdly specific phobias ,  bizarre methods of divining the future ,  beastly adjectives ,  crash blossoms  -- they keep me entertained for days. In line at the post office, I make up words in my head, or concoct fake but amusing typos. I construct weird little ditties which then stick in my head like the hook of a power ballad by REO Speedwagon. To someone with a word addiction, the internet presents a constant, boundless, temptation. All those time sinks, the verbal equivalent of YouTube for logophiles, we have them all bookmarked. What's that you say, somewhere there's a list of  all the words that David Foster Wallace had circled in his dictionary? How could a person not go visit? Before you know it, another hour wasted, hungry cats circling, and the dishes still not done. But my interest in words and language is strictly that of an amateur. That’s why you won't find me writing books on the topic. I have your typical INTJ's respect for technical competence, which is to say that I expect someone who writes a book about a given subject to know something about it. This is obviously a very regressive view, in an age where everyone's an expert on everything, courtesy of Wikipedia. But you know, people with an amateur interest in physics, or astronomy, or some other ""hard"" science generally have enough awareness of their own limitations to stop them from writing books on quantum physics or string theory. Amateur wordlovers and armchair linguists, on the other hand, apparently feel no such inhibition. After all, they've been using words their entire life, so why shouldn't they write a book?Two particular topics seem to hold a fatal attraction for armchair wordlovers. The first I’ll call “folk etymology”. Since uninformed speculation about the origins of common words and phrases is free and easy, almost anyone can come up with a rambling script that (choose one):1. purports to establish that virtually every English slang term in current use is derived from a Gaelic/Sanskrit/Klingon root (take your pick) 2. perpetuates the usual grab bag of linguistic urban legends that pollute the internet 3. adds another two cents to the mountain of rampant speculation about the origins of a handful of expressions that might reasonably be termed “the usual suspects”.It is mandatory for books in the third category to include at least four pages of tedious speculation about the origins of the term ""OK"", just as it is customary to pad those in the second category with demonstrably false (mis)information presented as fact (rule of thumb is related to wife-beating, posh is an acronym for ""port out, starboard home"" on ships to India, news is an acronym signifying “North-East-West-South, saved by the bell originated with precautions taken by people who feared being buried alive, and other popular linguistic urban legends). The canonical example in the first category is the appalling, shameful, How the Irish Invented Slang, a monument to a certain kind of sloppy “scholarship” so wilfully anti-intellectual it flirts with mental retardation. The basic fallacy is an inability (or unwillingness) to distinguish between random similarities in spelling and a genuine etymological connection, leading to such obviously bogus claims as the statement that “jazz” and “bunkum” have Gaelic roots. A (relatively restrained) debunking may be found  at this link. The second lexicological McGuffin is the slippery concept of “words in other languages that have no exact equivalent in English”, often referred to as being “untranslatable”. This is like catnip to word-fanciers; in addition to Christopher Moore’s book, there are several others out there with the same basic premise. Howard Rheingold’s They Have a Word for It dates back to 1988; in 2005, an English author called Adam Jacot de Boinod came out with “The meaning of Tingo” in similar vein, and subsequently followed it with a sequel, “The Wonder of Whiffling”. Books in this general category all follow the same approximate formula – lists of putatively untranslatable words in various languages, interspersed with comments by the author of varying length and insight. They all face the same fundamental challenge, not always successfully – since the author cannot possibly master every language for which an example is quoted, he cannot guarantee accuracy of content based on personal knowledge and is forced to rely on external sources. It doesn’t always work out as well as you might hope. “The Meaning of Tingo”, for example, is generally recognized to be riddled with inaccuracies; a distressingly high proportion of entries have no discernible basis in fact and are, at best, amusing flights of fancy. This inconvenient truth is not acknowledged explicitly by the author, but becomes clear if one reads the comments at the author’s website, or s of the book at Amazon. There are a few warning signs, however – an uncritical embracing of the linguistic urban legend involving the number of Eskimo words for snow, inclusion of the Russian (non)-word for falling out of love, “razliubit”, as well as a generally unquestioning tone of acceptance that borders on the naive.I regret to report that Christopher Moore’s contribution to this particular sub-genre is also notable for its general air of credulity. His scholarly approach appears to have been little more than to find and ask one native speaker for each of a variety of languages. The results are amusing, but don’t inspire much confidence. There is a suspiciously high number of words of alleged Scandinavian and Teutonic origin which purport to describe the unique sense of “coziness at home” felt by inhabitants of the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Sweden, Norway – it makes a person wonder if there isn’t some kind of concerted conspiracy by inhabitants of these countries to present a more positive view of life in winter than can realistically thought plausible. “Razliubit” also makes an appearance, with no indication that its status as genuine is mired in controversy. And, in the one area where I have some personal ability to make a judgment, I estimated that about half the words of “celtic” origin included were problematic in some way. But then the introductory sentence to that chapter gives a clear indication of where the problems are likely to lie, not just for the chapter, but for the entire book:“Gaelic is an ancient Celtic tongue with an oral tradition that spans almost two thousand years and reflects a crofting lifestyle that remained virtually unchanged in all that time.”The magical, mystical celtic twilight strikes again! With this sentence Moore unwittingly points out the flaw that undermines his own endeavor – ultimately the kind of “untranslatable word” that is likely to make it into his book is that which confirms whatever preexisting romantic notion he has about the language and people concerned, accuracy be damned.But then I realize that this is the unavoidable flaw in every book in this category. If it bothers you, steer clear. If not, be my guest – you may find these books funny and diverting.

Which is exactly what this kind of book should do. It does, of course, sneak in two chapters about prepositions (para, con, sin, a, de, en, & por), but that's unavoidable, as they are essential in the formation of various modismos and expresiones especiales using ser & estar.

Its structure and content are no secret - it's right there in the title. The road trip in question took place as DFW was winding down the book tour for  Infinite Jest ; David Lipsky had been assigned to interview him for Rolling Stone. That interview never came to fruition - instead, Lipsky brings us this account of their 5-day road trip from March 1996. I thought I'd devour it in one sitting, but it actually took a while to warm up to it - the first 100 pages meander somewhat and are a little repetitive. But then, as the two men get more comfortable with each other, Lipsky hits his stride - the unwinding, ongoing conversation gets more and more interesting. The final 100 pages are fascinating, moving and bittersweet - as is so often the case with DFW, you come away with the mixture of exhilaration and sense of privilege that comes from experiencing him at his best, and his suicide is all the more heartbreaking. This may not necessarily win him any new fans, but for someone like me, with a long-standing intellectual crush on DFW, this further chance to experience his wit, smartness and decency seemed like a blessing. David Lipsky has done a good thing by sharing the story of his time with DFW. He seems a little uncertain about how best to structure the narrative, and I wouldn't say that all of his choices are ideal. I mean him no disrespect, but the parts that worked best were the straight transcripts of their conversation, with minimal interruption. For the most part, his efforts to sprinkle in atmospheric details were sporadic, unhelpful, at best boring and at times profoundly irritating. For example, [Silverware sounds, beeping sounds, working restaurant: talk and hum]. Dude, who gives a s**t? Nobody is reading this book to hear your description of Denny's. But actually, writing this book can't have been easy for Lipsky; to do it well, he had to keep his own presence as muted as possible. (Though I guess that's no more than taking a reporter's role, rather than an author's) It's to his credit that he does this reasonably well - I'd be lying if I said that his occasional commentary is particularly insightful. In fact his questions over the first 100 pages seemed vapid and/or tactless; this problem did not persist, and he does a good job of drawing DFW out in the later parts of the book. There were a few instances where Lipsky was downright obnoxious - badgering the writer repeatedly about some third-hand rumor that Rolling Stone had fed him about a possible heroin addiction in his past. DFW denies it point blank at the outset, but Lipsky keeps gnawing like a jackal; after a while you realize that it takes him the better part of the entire trip to understand - finally - that having an addictive personality (i.e. prone to addiction) is not the same thing as being an addict. But, to be fair, nobody is going to come off looking smart when interviewing David Foster Wallace. Though Lipsky should probably have read IJ more thoroughly beforehand, given he was about to spend several days with the authorAT this point some of you may be rolling your eyes and muttering that I must have drunk the DFW Kool-Aid. Guilty as charged, I suppose. I can only point out in my defence that no other author has this effect on me.Concretely, what might one expect to learn about DFW from this book?He was clearly hugely ambivalent about the potential price of success, fame and the associated hype - this is a recurrent theme throughout. There's some biographical material about his earlier life that may be unfamiliar, assorted trivia about his taste in movies and TV shows, but the true pleasure is in the journey, getting to spend more time with DFW, if only figuratively.Isolated remarks or information that stuck with me:(on the literary scene in New York)  the enormous hiss of egos at various stages of inflation and deflation  (while confessing his fondness for Alanis Morrissette)  Sheryl Crow made me want to vomit, from the very beginning. I liked that the omniscient DFW misidentifies Frank O' Connor, author of ""My Oedipus Complex"", ""First Confession"" among other stories, as ""Frank O' Hara"". It humanizes him.I loved that he pissed off his editor by printing out the first draft of Infinite Jest single-spaced in 9-point type, to try to make it seem shorter than its actual length, and that the editor screamed at him and forced him to print him a fresh copy, double-spaced.Throughout the conversation, Foster Wallace also gives a pretty cogent explanation for the type of deliberate complication of the reader's experience that is an integral part of  Infinite Jest . For anyone specifically interested in hearing him talk about his writing, one of the best bets is still Laura Miller's 1996 interview in Salon.com:http://www.salon.com/09/features/wall...DAMN.

If you think it's a stroke of genius by Ian McEwan to use this troglodyte as a heavy-handed symbol of the kind of behavior that's causing global warming, then good for you. Let me know if you still feel that way after 300 pages spent with your nose forced into every appalling detail of Beard's ghastly descent. Personally, it felt like torment to me.Don't get me wrong. McEwan's got the writing chops. There are whole paragraphs that are hilarious, or exquisitely written, or both. But my guess is that when you turn the page that begins the final section, you'll just wish the whole damned thing was over already. I was really pissed off that McEwan pulls a Don Giovanni at the end, denying the reader the emotional catharsis of describing the gory details of Beard's downfall.Two other aspects that bothered me: Though McEwan has obviously done his homework to the extent of crafting sections about physics that are entirely plausible, I'm not sure to what end. It all seems a little pointless.The notion that Beard is some kind of irresistible babe magnet is just too ludicrous to swallow. He's a pig. I sincerely doubt that Nobel prize is going to overcome his swinishness.This book is another example where McEwan's talent seems to have been mischanneled. This is an intermittently amusing, but ultimately repulsive story which showcases McEwan's cleverness, but seems empty at its core.ADDENDUM: When I think about it, this book was never going to work for me, as I detest books where the reader gets stuck in the mind of a particularly obnoxious character.

And over on Amazon.com people seemed enthusiastic. So I e-mailed him that I would read and  the book, but that I would get my own copy. I was really hoping it would be great so that I could give him a helpful .Max Wiseman (get it?) is a successful Manhattan prosecutor with a problem. He is constitutionally unable to rise above life's minor irritations. The entire book is told in the first person from within Max's head. The book's fundamental conceit is that Max has become so disgusted with life, and with human behavior, that he has decided to kill himself. But before he does he is going to fly across country to kill the kid who made his life miserable at Camp Pokahiney when he was 10. This structure immediately creates certain expectations in the reader: that Max's encounters with random strangers on the road will lead him to meaningful growth, personal fulfilment and give him the strength and wisdom to go on; that instead of Max killing the bully, they will reconcile and achieve a weepy camaraderie, etc etc. These expectations remain largely unfulfilled. I can't actually decide whether that's a point in the book's favor or a mark against it, but there's not too much evidence of growth or the attainment of self-knowledge. Max starts out as a hypocritical jackass and pretty much ends the same way. Though the author sprinkles in a few episodes later in the book whose obvious purpose is to provide evidence of growth, they don't ring true. As the narrative progresses, from his first run-in with airport security screening through assorted bouts of nastiness with employees at the airline, car rental, hotel checkin, hospital, redneck bar, post office, family restaurant, we are presented with a wearying roster of instances wherein Max demonstrates yet again his inability to take heed of the advice not to sweat the small stuff. Inside Max's head, everything is a big deal; every minor inconvenience or perceived lack of bubbling enthusiasm on the part of a customer service rep is a major affront. So he is regrettably prone to escalating normal, tedious interactions to unpleasant screaming rants. He never explicitly screams ""Do you know who I am?"" at his hapless targets, but that sense of entitlement is never far below the surface. This makes Max's alleged disillusionment with human behavior a bit hard to take. Apparently his disappointment doesn't extend to his own behavior - early on in the book the author takes 4 pages (count 'em, 4) to express Max's disgust about another passenger's acting up when a flight delay is announced; fifteen pages later a drunken Max is berating the airline's customer service rep at the top of his voice, with no apparent consciousness of the irony. The author clearly views Max as a kind of likeable everyman, apparently not realizing that the character he is describing is a completely unsympathetic, supercilious, anti-social jerk. The ongoing transcript of Max's thoughts make it clear that his fundamental attitude towards other people is a kind of sneeringly hostile superiority, which combines with his poor impulse control to lead to another unpleasant outburst, which then feeds back to confirm his jaundiced worldview. It's all very exhausting, because most of these blowups are about nothing at all. The occasional decent actions that the author plonks in towards the end of the book ring false, because Max never manages to rise above his utter negativity about the everyday details of life, or to realize his own role in the creation of his hellish existence. So that's pretty tedious. That last paragraph makes the book sound truly awful. But it's not actually all that bad. At times it's pretty funny -- anyone can relate to Max's internal reactions to the indignities of modern travel; the problem arises when he loses control. You can sense the author is well-meaning; unfortunately the character he has drawn is not the character he thinks he's drawn (or meant to draw). He is also a poor judge of when to stop, throughout the book he repeatedly develops a given idea or joke at far greater length than necessary. Either he thinks the reader is a moron, or he can't help himself (undoubtedly the latter). There's an earnestness there that is kind of admirable, but there's also a kind of naivete which derails the portrayal of his main character and which contributes (IMO) to an underestimation of his readers.Not that the folks over at amazon.com care one way or another. The 8 out of 8 readers who gave the book a five-star rating obviously share none of my reservations. They found the book uplifting and funny as all get out. And who knows? You might too. I have my curmudgeonly image to protect, to I'll give it 3 goodreads stars (which would be 4 stars over on Amazon). That third star is awarded, however, out of a conscious need to encourage beginning writers.Additional minor gripes: the inclusion of a wise old black taxi-driver, an entire scene in a redneck bar in Dallas culminating in a drunken brawl, a drunken encounter with two standard-issue redneck Texas lawmen, a stereotypically bigoted Southern waitress, beatific good Samaritans who happen to be salt-of-the earth family farmers struggling to save the farm from the evil bankers, an infant sentenced to crib death merely to illustrate the cruelty of fate. Can you spell ""c-l-i-c-h-e""? Also, although ""illogicalness"" is apparently a valid word, it is a very ugly one. I mention this only because of how often it appears in the text.P.S. It didn't help that I was reading this book in parallel with David Lipsky's ""Although of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself"", his account of a road trip with David Foster Wallace.

However, since the worst stories tended to be longer (""High Wire"", a meandering, rambling account of the relationship between two addicted narcissists - it goes from barely alive to diseased to moribund, taking 50 pages and some non-negligible portion of your life - is simply unforgivable) I choose to round this down to a two-star rating overall. The collection is somewhat redeemed by the stories ""Honeymoon"" (3 pages) and the final story, ""The Archer"".

This is just not my cup of tea at all, thanks very much Doctor Holt. The eery detachment. Isolation and imminent apocalypse. The spooky Borgesian narrators, barely recognizable as human. The recurring failure of characters to connect. Yes, yes. It's all very accomplished. But one feels that one is being told these stories by a robot and hearing them through layers of cotton wool. Terrence Holt is a practicing M.D. at UNC Chapel Hill -- given the preternatural detachment he shows in these stories, it makes you wonder about his bedside manner.

Well, let's take a closer look:O Λoγoς!: It's just Poe's ""Masque of the Red Death"" updated with a Borgesian tic, and a title that manages to span two languages, neither of them English.My Father's Heart: Dude keeps Daddy's heart beating in a glass jar on the mantel. Didn't Roald Dahl already do this one, with considerably more wit and without overdosing on the doom and gloom? Unoriginal and boring.Charybdis: This is the ""Major Tom"" story. Dude trapped on a mission to Jupiter; accident nixes return. Serial ship's log entries, each with a complete lack of affect. The possibility that these entries are actually being generated by the ship's computer HAL cannot be ruled out. Either way, why should anyone possibly care?A few more outer space episodes...It will come as no surprise to find that the last story in the collection is called ""Apocalypse"". It's possible that the 80-page novella that rounds out the collection and gives it its name will redeem the general pretentious bleakness of the remaining stories. But I seriously doubt it.

Earlier books of his that I've read had several aspects in common - a definite sympathy for the underdog, the skewering of those in power in a plot involving some element of the fantastic (zombies, magic powers, the occult, ancient druidic ritual).In ""Next"", Hynes forgoes the fantastic element in a book which is more ambitious and more serious than its predecessors. The territory is familiar - the protagonist, Kevin Quinn, an editor at the University of Michigan's Center for Asian Studies, is low man on the totem pole and has suffered his share of the petty humiliations that are the stuff of academic life. Just turned 50, Kevin is in full midlife turmoil; as the story opens we see him in midflight, bound for an interview in Austin, tormenting himself about various concerns, both personal (should he leave Ann Arbor, what about his live-in girlfriend, isn't he already over the hill?) and global (nervousness about being blown up on the plane, on the bus, at the mall). A spate of recent terrorist bombings in various European cities just adds to the general sense of menace - Quinn is particularly shaken by the fact that one of the suicide bombers in Glasgow was also named Kevin.The entire book unfolds within the confines of Quinn's head, following his day's itinerary through Austin, with multiple flashbacks as he revisits every relationship of his adult life, the women he pursued successfully and those that got away, the deaths of both his father and his grandfather. Severe claustrophobia is inevitable. Despite some snappy writing by Hines, who never loses his sense of humor, no character is interesting enough to sustain a full 300 pages. But of course there's that ever more noticeable drumbeat of menace as the day wears on. So one keeps on reading. Reviewers have debated whether or not the (extremely powerful) final 50 pages ""justify"" some of the slackness in the earlier parts of the book. I can't really answer this question, as it seems silly to me. What I can say is that you will finish the book, and you won't leave your seat for the final section.Though I wish I felt differently, in the final analysis I think that James Hynes didn't quite pull off this ambitious effort.

Even the superficially unpromising pieces have something to offer. The final essay, an appreciation of David Foster Wallace, is altogether terrific. Her remarks about DFW's deliberate choice to make his writing difficult for the reader are smarter than almost anything else I've read on the subject. She obviously loves his work, but not to the point of foolishness. The three essays in which Smith remembers her father are probably the most powerful - simultaneously moving and funny. My favorites among the remaining pieces tended to be those about writing, especially the essays on Kafka, Barthes and Nabokov, E.M. Forster, with the piece de resistance being that DFW appreciation. The sections ""Seeing"" (essays on film) and ""Being"" were less interesting to me, but that's largely because I have no particular enthusiasm about film.I didn't find the lecture on her ""craft of writing"" valuable, but that's obviously a matter of personal taste. Other than the silly Oscar weekend piece, the two least successful essays (for me) were ""Two Directions for the Novel"" (Buck disagrees with me apparently) and ""Speaking in Tongues"". The former seemed to be an exercise in inventing categories when there is no obvious need to do so. The latter, based on a lecture given in new York in December 2008 (in the exuberant aftermath of Obama's election), makes some interesting points, but seems already outdated. A number of the arguments seemed to reflect little more than a combination of wishful thinking and selective interpretation of the historical record. For example, Smith argues that greatness in a leader typically results from an early exposure to two radically different cultures/wordviews, and that the ability to function well in both worlds leads to a flexibility of mind that is characteristic of all great leaders. Given the date of the lecture, her ruminations are clearly motivated by the successful Obama campaign. However, though we may hope, it seems clearly premature to accord Obama the stature of a ""great"" president. And one only has to think of FDR to figure out that the ""reconciliation of two competing worldviews"" as a youth is completely bogus as a prerequisite to be a successful leader in later life. Patricians get a bad rap - they too are capable of empathy and ""flexibility of mind"".But I'm doing that thing I do when confronted with excellence - focus on a few minor flaws without having made it clear how brilliant I think the work as a whole. (Depending on your point of view, this reflects my total bastard nature, or is just a charming INTJ tic; I suspect the people I worked with may not always have found it charming) . So let me be clear - this is an entirely superior collection. Why are these essays so much fun to read? One of Smith's major strengths is that her criticism tends to be concrete and specific. Thus, even though she can fling the litcrit jargon around with the best of them, it's never obnoxious, probably because she writes so clearly. You may find yourself wondering why academics can't manage to match her clear style, until you remember that they are playing by a different set of rules, under which the last thing anyone wants to do is actually write in a way that's easy to understand. Zadie Smith is definitely someone with flexibility of mind. Some of these essays are so lucid and witty and smart, it's hard not to just dissolve into incoherent fanboy burbling.

In the family box at the opera, Newland Archer and the Countess Olenska were exchanging furtive glances. Meanwhile, out in the streets, entire cohorts of street urchins were busily pulling themselves up by their bootstraps, overcoming bullies, cheats and other forms of adversity, aided only by their innate pluck, preternatural cheerfulness, the benevolent intercession of a rich patron and the long arm of amazing coincidence. Bootblacks, newsboys, peddlers, buskers and a variety of other impoverished urchins all realised the American dream, leaving their humble origins behind and rising to a life of financial security and middle-class respectably. We know this is so, because Horatio Alger tells us. Over and over again. Incessantly. Mark the match boy, Phil the fiddler, Paul the peddler, Ben the luggage boy, tattered Tom, ragged Dick, Jed the poorhouse boy, and Mark Mason the telegraph boy, and scores of others – each of them living proof that all you needed to succeed was hard work, a chipper attitude, an honest disposition, and concern for your fellow man. Oh wait! There was one other critical ingredient for success: some rich older gentleman had to intercede on your behalf and take you under his wing. This might seem like a potential obstacle, but not in Alger’s world, a place where 5th Avenue was chock-a-block, day and night, with elderly affluent patrons on the lookout for a suitable urchin to sponsor. Save a child from under the wheels of a carriage, return a lost watch, perform some other act of conspicuous bravery or honesty, or simply turn out to be a long-lost relative, and you were in like Flynn.I’ve just made it through three of Alger’s “rags to riches” tales - Ragged Dick, Struggling Upward (Luke Larkin’s Luck), and The Cash Boy. You need read only one, because Alger just wrote the same book over and over again. Much like P.G. Wodehouse, he had found a winning formula and he stuck to it. To my surprise, they weren’t nearly as bad as I expected. If one is able to overlook the essentially Republican worldview and cast a tolerant eye on Alger’s fondness for coincidence as deus ex machina (he’s hardly alone in this), there is a certain anodyne comfort in the story’s soothing familiarity. Even if you know at the back of your mind that it’s a complete crock.You might also want to suppress the disturbing biographical tidbit that Horatio Alger had to resign his position as minister to the Unitarian congregation in Brewster, Cape Cod, following (uncontested) allegations that he had molested a 13-year old and a 16-year old boy. According to Wikipedia, “All parties involved agreed to keep matters quiet – the parents of the boys reluctantly”. Alger later moved to New York, where he “was immediately drawn into the world of impoverished young bootblacks, newspaper boys and peddlers”, spending much of his time with the boys, often inviting them back to this small apartment.Somehow, I’d feel better about these books if I didn’t have that last piece of information. What might have been naively optimistic now has an indelible note of creepiness. But maybe everything was as wholesome as Alger’s cri-de-coeur, “Friar Anselmo” suggests:  Title: Friar AnselmoAuthor: Horatio AlgerFriar Anselmo (God's grace may he win!)Committed one sad day a deadly sin;Which being done he drew back, self-abhorred,From the rebuking presence of the Lord,And, kneeling down, besought, with bitter cry,Since life was worthless grown, that he might die.All night he knelt, and, when the morning broke,In patience still he waits death's fatal stroke.When all at once a cry of sharp distressAroused Anselmo from his wretchedness;And, looking from the convent window high,He saw a wounded traveller gasping lieJust underneath, who, bruised and stricken sore,Had crawled for aid unto the convent door.The friar's heart with deep compassion stirred,When the poor wretch's groans for help were heardWith gentle hands, and touched with love divine,He bathed his wounds, and poured in oil and wine.With tender foresight cared for all his needs,--A blessed ministry of noble deeds.In such devotion passed seven days. At lengthThe poor wayfarer gained his wonted strength.With grateful thanks he left the convent walls,And once again on death Anselmo calls.When, lo! his cell was filled with sudden light,And on the wall he saw an angel write,(An angel in whose likeness he could trace,More noble grown, the traveller's form and face),""Courage, Anselmo, though thy sin be great,God grants thee life that thou may'st expiate.""Thy guilty stains shall be washed white again,By noble service done thy fellow-men.""His soul draws nearest unto God above,Who to his brother ministers in love.""Meekly Anselmo rose, and, after prayer,His soul was lightened of its past despair.Henceforth he strove, obeying God's high will,His heaven-appointed mission to fulfil.And many a soul, oppressed with pain and grief,Owed to the friar solace and relief.(Confession: for years I used to confuse Horatio Alger and Alger Hiss, referring to any kind of rags-to-riches story as “your typical Alger Hiss” story, until a friend took pity and corrected me.) ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Mar 20, 2010","Apr 02, 2010","Mar 20, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/162849.Ragged_Dick_and_Struggling_Upward

Because everyone deserves a chance, so I gave you one.But you blew it, bro. Big time. Turns out you had absolutely nothing interesting to say. Maybe you were just following the advice someone passed on to you in some benighted Creative Writing workshop - the old chestnut ""Write what you know"". But you know what, if someone did tell you that, they need to be beaten severely around the head with a cluestick. Because it's totally bogus. It encourages people like you, who are not completely without talent, in the misguided belief that the world needs further documentation of the angst-ridden antics of you and your hipster buddies. That more trees need to die so that even more time can be wasted writing about what is probably the world's least interesting and most overexamined cohort. But here's the thing. It's hard for me to imagine anything duller than yet another fifteen stories in which all the characters resemble you and your friends.  I don't care that you didn't manage to sleep with the goth chick . Or how it made you feel. For crying out loud! Don't write about ""what you know"". Make something up, would you? Better yet, join the Peace Corps. Go teach some kids in China. Help out in Darfur.

The assumption seems ill-founded and says more about the author's potential insecurities than anything else. So, the book is sporadically witty and makes a number of decent points.

Her evident desire to tie up all the loose ends and leave no one unaccounted for is a distinct handicap, as some parts of the book are too obviously there for that purpose only. Just as she did in the first book, Russell takes on the big questions of spirituality, morality, the challenge to faith posed by an apparently capricious God, against a backdrop of extreme psychological upheaval (in Emilio's case) and the cataclysmic social and political changes triggered by the earlier mission to Rakhat.She does a better job than I had anticipated, but the inherent predictability of certain story arcs dooms the sequel to be less exciting than the original. It doesn't help that the crew members on the return trip are considerably less interesting than the original gang. I'll forgive her the hokiness of the plot device used to get Emilio on an outbound vessel for a second time. But a major reason that ""Children of God"" is less compelling than ""The Sparrow"" is that Emilio is really the only character worth caring about, and his ultimate fate, though emotionally satisfying, is entirely predictable (Spoiler: His return visit to Rakhat allows him to realize a certain capacity for forgiveness, which gives him a degree of peace. Which of course gives nothing away - given that she went to the trouble of writing a second book so as not to leave us with the brutal image of Emilio tortured and despairing, there's no other possible outcome for the second book.)Though it doesn't match the brilliance of ""The Sparrow"", it's still well worth reading - Russell is still smart, thought-provoking and well able to tell a good story, skillfully and with finesse. ...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Mar 13, 2010","Mar 18, 2010","Mar 13, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16948.Children_of_God

As finance minister, Charlie McCreevy's credo was a textbook statement of macroeconomic illiteracy: 'When I have the money, I spend it, when I don't have it, I don't spend it'. This childish mantra, ... obliterating at a stroke everything that governments worldwide had learned about the need to restrain a runaway economy by spending less and boost a flagging economy by spending more, was the economic equivalent of bulimia: binge and purge, binge and purge.As the Celtic tiger lies puking feebly into the gutter, surrounded by the debris caused by the bursting of one of the worst real-estate bubbles on record, the Irish economic boom has come to a painful, screeching halt. By August 2009, the month when the Irish prime minister finally dropped his ""Celtic tiger as a template for economic development"" speech from his speaking portfolio, the level of debt among Irish households was the highest in the EU, GDP was predicted to shrink by 13.5 percent in 2009 and 2010, Government debt had almost doubled in the preceding year. With a fifth of its office spaces empty, Dublin had the highest vacancy rate of any European capital and was rated as having the worst development and investment potential of 27 European cities. The Irish stock exchange had fallen by 68% in 2008....The litany of depressing statistics goes on. In this book, Fintan O'Toole, a political commentator and columnist for The Irish Times, sets out in chilling detail the particular combination of factors that led to such a catastrophic end to Ireland's economic boom. Chief among them are:* the enduring failure of successive governments to enact anything even remotely resembling regulatory controls on the banking and financial sectors * a culture of cronyism and turning a blind eye to financial malfeasance of the most blatant kind - even when the taking of kickbacks by those in office was established beyond doubt by several investigative tribunals, penalties were nugatory to non-existent* the Ahern government's continued feeding of the construction bubble through the creation of ever-more ridiculous tax incentives* failure to invest profits during the boom years in areas that might provide long-term stability, such as infrastructure and higher education (probably the most depressing part of O'Toole's litany of governmental ineptness is the section that documents the abysmal ranking of Irish graduates in the areas of computer science and information technology)Even though I've lived outside of the country for the last 30 years, I'm still an Irish citizen, and I found this book thoroughly depressing. O'Toole's jeremiad is not particularly well-written - one senses it was written in haste, and the editing is remarkably sloppy. Writing style may have fallen victim to his passion at times; nonetheless, he paints a picture which is quite clear and thoroughly depressing. I'd like to think that those shown to be particularly venal will pay the price -- I don't need Fintan O'Toole to tell me that this is altogether unlikely.This will be of interest to anyone with some connection to Ireland, probably not all that interesting to anyone else....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Mar 10, 2010","Mar 12, 2010","Mar 10, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7711297-ship-of-fools

No matter. I disliked it thoroughly -- I found these stories almost unreadable. The marketing hook for this collection (in the jacket blurb and the worshipful introduction by Russell Banks) is a biographical one. Gallant was born in Montreal to English-speaking, Protestant parents, an only child who was shipped off to a French Catholic boarding school at age four. Her father died early, her mother remarried, but from an early age, in Gallant's own words, she was ""set afloat"". Russell Banks assures us that this background, the experience of being forced at a very early age to navigate the straits dividing Catholic/Protestant, franco/anglophone, children/adults, men/women, of being, as he puts it ""situated simultaneously inside and outside her given worlds"", places Gallant at the Borderlands, the ideal site for a writer of short stories*. The stories in this particular collection are undeniably somewhat autobiographic, and are firmly situated in the Quebec of Gallant's youth. That doesn't necessarily make them interesting, or good. I found them dull, and ultimately claustrophobic. After the sixth or seventh exploration of the stultifyingly provincial concerns of the singularly joyless Quebecois that populate these stories, I'd had enough. I'm happy for Mavis Gallant that she managed to escape, and to live in Paris for the last 50 years. I can understand why she might feel impelled to pick at the scabs of her childhood. But I don't want to watch. Most of the characters in these stories live lives that are circumscribed or emotionally stunted. It's entirely possible to write gracefully about the way cultural pressures or tribal differences can limit or distort people's emotional well-being -- William Trevor has been doing it his whole life. But there's a humor and affection for his characters that rescue Trevor's stories from total bleakness. There's not much affection in Gallant's representation of the milieu she grew up in - the stories read more like the work of someone who is settling scores, or still trying to work through the legacy of her own idiosyncratic childhood (the prevailing narrative voice is that of an adult reinterpreting earlier events from childhood). Even though Gallant is adept at characterization, you get the feeling that she never warms up towards her own characters. She definitely failed to make me care about them. Giving myself permission not to read the remaining six or seven stories was a great relief. * the common fallacy of confusing an eventful biography with good writing; clearly, an eventful life is not necessary to be a good writer (Flannery O' Connor, Emily Dickinson, the Brontes), neither is it sufficient.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Mar 08, 2010","Aug 13, 2011","Mar 08, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/233792.Varieties_of_Exile

By now the ingredients in the mix are easily identified:Insanely complicated plotting - generally about five different strands unfolding in parallel; Atkinson switches from one to another with enormous skill and obvious delight. It's a bravura performance - she's brilliant and she knows it, but one wonders why she feels the need to have so many balls in the air. Typically there's at least one plot strand that is completely dispensible (e.g., the drug-dealing brother in WWTBGN - no way did this need to get as grand guignol as it did). My impression is that Atkinson has a relatively short attention span and that she does it partly to keep herself amused, partly because she can't resist showing off.Key protagonists who are all damaged in some way, haunted by one or more horrific past events. Despite an apparent lack of connection at the outset, their paths are destined to cross and recross as the story develops with all plot strands converging in the remarkably bloody denouement.Despite the general gloom and doom, Atkinson tells her story with intelligence, wit and great humor. She is a terrific writer - the defining characteristic of her books is compulsive readability. Her talent allows her to get away with stuff that would crash and burn in the hands of a less skilled writer - most egregiously, a willingness to rely on the most improbable of coincidences as a device for plot resolution. After reading WWTBGN you realise that the degree of suspension of disbelief asked of the reader is shamelessly high. Actually, you kind of know it while you're reading as well, but you don't care - Atkinson hooks you so effectively that stopping is not an option. Her brilliance will also distract you from minor issues with her characterization. Ultimately it doesn't matter - you can't NOT care about what happens to the people at the center of WWTBGN. It's not just the four main protagonists either - you end up emotionally invested in everyone's fate, even the walk-on characters and the dogs. I should say that, while her reliance on coincidence is an obvious weakness, in the general scheme of things it's a very minor one. Her plot resolutions are in no way facile - quite the opposite, they are complicated, well-thought out and emotionally very satisfying, even given the elevated body count. There are several twists at the end of WWTBGN that I certainly didn't see coming, but which were really satisfying The over-reliance on coincidence isn't my main reason for knocking the rating down a star. Asking me to believe that Jackson couldn't figure out the difference between trains bound for Edinburgh and London was ridiculous enough to get a half-star penalty; the other half-star was deducted for Joanna's interminable mumbling of nursery rhymes in moments of stress, a facile and tedious device which represented a surprising lapse for a writer of Atkinson's talent. Although ""When Will There Be Good News"" shares some characters with ""Case Histories"" and ""One Good Turn"", it can be read and appreciated independently on its own merits. I think it's the strongest of the trilogy. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Mar 07, 2010","Mar 08, 2010","Mar 07, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6547808-when-will-there-be-good-news

She was smarter than most of her neighbors and family and - this was her mistake -  she made no particular effort to hide the fact . Although her husband made no objection to the extra income she brought in through dressmaking and keeping chickens, he may not have welcomed the independence it allowed her. Neighbors commented on her air of ""superiority""; another trait that made Bridget a bit ""weird"" was a disturbing tendency to look men straight in the eye, which was said to be a characteristic of pagan women. Had Bridget been born in 1970, none of this would have been an issue. Sadly for her (and maybe this was her mistake), she was born a century earlier. Even so, the events that led to her death in March 1895 were extraordinary. On Monday March 4th, she developed a cold, which lingered and progressed to a bronchial infection. On the evening of Friday March 15th, when Bridget's illness still hadn't cleared up, her husband and family became distraught. Convinced (so they later maintained) that the real Bridget had been “taken by the fairies”, and that they were dealing with a changeling, they proceeded to drag her from her bed to the fireplace, where they forced her to swallow herbal remedies and then held her over the fire repeatedly, challenging the spirit that possessed her to come out. The results of the ordeal by fire were predictable – Bridget died of the resulting burns. At this point, her crazed relatives came to their senses enough to realize they had a problem on their hands. So three of them buried the body in a nearby bog, while the others worked on their cover story. This was that (in line with a still prevalent superstition) Bridget had in fact been carried wailing from the house by a fairy horde, but that she had promised to reappear the following Sunday evening at the nearby fairy fort on Kylenagranagh Hill, where her family could, if they had the courage, rescue her. (A white horse may or may not have been implicated)Bridget’s disappearance, the bizarre coverup story, the subsequent discovery of the body, elicitation of the true facts, and the trial and conviction of the family members instrumental in her death, were major news for the rest of the year. Beyond the shock value of the irresistible details of the case, the political situation at the time ensured that the trial took place under the full glare of the media spotlight. In particular, events played directly into the Tories’ hands during the ongoing debate over Irish Home Rule, confirming lingering fears about the backward and superstitious Irish peasantry. The Bridget Cleary story is the subject of not just one, but two, books. Both appeared in 2000 (one can only imagine the mutual chagrin of the various authors involved). Of the two, the book by Angela Bourke (“The Burning of Bridget Cleary”) is shorter by 200 pages, and infinitely better. Ms Bourke does an excellent job of presenting the facts, with just the right amount of background information to place them in context, without taxing the reader’s patience. The result is a decently written, lively, interesting book.The same cannot be said for ""The Cooper's Wife is Missing : The Trials of Bridget Cleary"" by Joan Hoff and Marian Yeates, whose strategy to “go long”, is frankly misguided. Bridget’s story is interesting, but nothing about it merits a 450-page tome. The best that can be said is to pay the authors the lukewarm compliment of acknowledging their extensive research, while deploring their fatal inability to be selective about what to include. The ability to synthesize effectively is critical for any non-fiction writer, but is conspicuously absent in the Hoff and Yeates book. In particular, the ecclesiastical maneuverings of Archbishop Croke and his interactions with Nationalist hero Charles Kickham are completely tangential to the story – the extensive discussion given them by Hoff and Yeates betrays a woeful lack of focus.Angela Bourke: 4 starsJoan Hoff and Marian Yeates : 2 stars ...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Mar 03, 2010","Mar 04, 2010","Mar 03, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1086565.The_Burning_of_Bridget_Cleary

I can't imagine who he, or his editors, thought would find it readable, let alone interesting. The autobiographical stuff is an undisciplined hodgepodge, whose disjointed nature is not improved by the self-congratulatory tone that is always close to the surface. Even more tedious is his infatuation with his self-constructed rebel persona, leading him to include innumerable, not particular edifying, anecdotes of his victories over assorted academic bureaucrats. And of course his field research is invariably conducted in the seediest of local dives, home to colorful badass natives who naturally gravitate to chat with his own renegade self. A little of this kind of self-congratulatory reminiscing goes a very long way.But what really torpedoes the book is his inclusion of a smattering of linguistic theory in almost every chapter. One imagines the author believes that he has provided enough explanation for this material to illuminate the book's overarching argument (that the development of Creoles displays enough common features, regardless of location and contact language, to provide strong evidence to support the idea that language development is innate, hard-wired, and strongly age-related).

Impressive, no? But then, one should probably bear in mind that totals like this are not achieved without separate index entries for Tori and Candi Spelling. And therein lies the basic problem with this book. Don't get me wrong - Professor Yagoda is a genial guide, he writes perfectly decent prose that won't set your teeth on edge. But somehow the effort of cramming mention of more than 600 memoirists into just 270 pages of text (without committing any errors of fact) seems to have consumed almost all of the author's creative juices. So that the vast majority of the book is long on fact, with little or no analysis. Which makes it about as interesting to read as the TV guide.It's a pity, because when Ben Yagoda does engage in analysis, his comments are astute - for instance, his remarks about the different ways in which truth is manipulated in ""The Glass Castle"", ""Running with Scissors"", and ""A Million Little Pieces"" are right on target. What this book does provide: a comprehensive history of the memoir, if by history you mean essentially a catalog, with varying amounts of interspersed commentary. The organization is somewhat eccentric; quite reasonably, Yagoda doesn't hem himself in with a strictly chronological presentation, but his chapter division along thematic lines suffers from having poorly defined themes, which he seems to ignore anyway. I still can't figure out how Ulysses S. Grant, P.T. Barnum, and Mark Twain migrated from Chapter 4 (The United States of Autobiography) to Chapter 6 (Eminent Victorian Autobiography), or why Yagoda felt it necessary to split his exploration of truth and the fallibility of memory into two separate chapters. Actually, there is a plausible explanation, which is that Chapter 5 (""Interlude: Truth, Memory and Autobiography"") was inserted as a kind of lollipop for the reader, to break up what would otherwise have been a pretty lengthy dry stretch.What this book doesn't provide: much of what our corporate buddies like to refer to as ""added value"". It's short on analysis, and I found only three of its eleven chapters engaging. The first chapter considers memoirs published over the past 30 years, providing a comprehensive and brilliant taxonomy. The 'message' that emerges as the book progresses, that none of these subgenres is new, is hardly surprising. Before there was Augusten Burrowes there was Edmund Gosse, the embarrassing narrative liberties taken by Rigoberta Menchu had parallels in the fake slave narratives published in the early 19th century, works like ""My Left Foot"" and ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" had their antecedents in the story of Hellen Keller. Ben Yagoda reminds us effectively that there is little new under the sun, and that readers have a special affinity for stories they believe to have a basis in truth. For my money, those seemed like pretty sparse insights for a book of this length. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Feb 25, 2010","Feb 25, 2010","Feb 25, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6402552-memoir

Sommers is generally astute as an interviewer, though his need to be liked sometimes gets in the way. (The whole enterprise was sponsored by ""The Believer"", so one assumes that the tone of upbeat niceness that prevails was an inevitable consequence).For me, the best interviews were with Philip Zimbardo, Joseph Henrich's arguments that morality is intrinsically related to culture, so that there can never be any absolute standard of fairness, and Joerg Haider's view that moral values are arrived at through a combination of intuition and emotions, with reason having little to do with it.As another er has commented, Chapter 1 (we don't have free will, gasp!) ended up being a major letdown. I'm personally not all that interested in the morality of chimps, so Franz de Waal's contribution didn't do it for me.

If I tell you that this book is a collection of essays about a dozen or so e""It must be beautiful : great equations of modern science""I know, I know. If I tell you that this book is a collection of essays about a dozen or so equations that occupy a central role in 20th century science, most of you will start edging quietly towards the exits. We all know what to expect: no matter how good the intentions of the editor and contributors, the chances that it's intelligible to the general reader are infinitesimally small. Each author's goal was straightforward - to present his or her equation and to ""explain"" it to the nonspecialist reader. A ""good"" explanation should place it in its scientific context, which typically involves explaining its practical and theoretical implications and the reason it's considered important. Four of the eleven essays achieve this goal admirably, providing a reasonably understandable account in lucid, well-written prose. Three more fell in the ""honorable effort"" category - though the authors weren't entirely successful in explaining the science, the essays were interesting nonetheless (authors in this group tended to distract the reader by focusing on the scientific personalities rather than the science; at least they managed to be reasonably entertaining). Of the remaining four essays, two were disappointingly murky - the authors seemed unable to write about the science in an accessible manner (it seems only fair to point out that some equations were undoubtedly intrinsically harder to explain than others, so the authors may not be completely to blame). The remaining two chapters had no business being in the book at all, in my opinion, as the ""equations"" they dealt with were essentially bogus (details below). The central eleven chapters are flanked by an introduction by the editor, Graham Farmelo (who also contributed an essay on the Planck-Einstein equation for the energy of a quantum) and concluding remarks from Physics Nobel laureate Steven Weinberg. The dullness of Farmelo's introduction is more than compensated for by the lucidity and intelligence of Weinberg's contribution. One of the reasons Farmelo fails to impress is his insistence on trying to justify the book's title, despite its being a complete red herring. Even if we could agree on just what exactly constitutes ""beauty"" in an equation, it wouldn't apply to every equation in the book by any stretch of the imagination. Not that it matters - the equations are what they are, some appear elegantly simple, others are messy - whether or not they attain some ill-defined notion of beauty is highly debatable, but essentially unimportant.So what do you get for your $16.95 (possibly less, as the book was first published in 2002)? Arranged in approximately descending order of quality:""The Best Possible Time to be Alive"" : Robert May's extraordinarily lucid account of the use of the logistic function to model the dynamics of animal populations, how some parameter values lead to a stable equilibrium, while others lead to chaos, is completely brilliant. I'd give my right arm to have written anything remotely as smart just once in my life.""Understanding Information Bit by Bit"" : Igor Aleksandr gives an excellent account of the two equations that form the basis of Shannon's Information theory - clear, succinct, and (I think) quite accessible to the general reader.""Equations of Life"" : John Maynard Smith on the mathematics of evolution (he offers a game theory formulation)""The Rediscovery of Gravity"" : Roger Penrose explains the Einstein Equation of General RelativityLess successful, but still pretty good, were - Peter Galison on the more famous Einstein equation: E = m c-squared ""Hidden Symmetry"" : Christine Sutton on the Yang-Mills equation (which governs motion in the Yang-Mills field) - one can think of it roughly as an extension of Maxwell's electromagnetic equations to include the isospin of the relevant particles.In ""Erotica, Aesthetics, and Schrodinger's Wave Equation"", Arthur I. Miller devotes far more time to discussing the (difficult) relationship between Schrodinger and Heisenberg than to exposition of the equation that bears their names.Frank Wilcek's discussion of the Dirac equation can best be described as confusing, with occasional appeals to mysticism. I got the impression this might be unavoidable. The first essay in the book, dealing with the Planck-Einstein equation for the energy off a quantum, was written by the book's editor, Graham Farmelo. It is, unfortunately, one of the weakest. Farmelo seems unable to give a clear exposition, so he falls back on the old standby of giving the reader lots of biographical tidbits from the lives of Einstein and Planck, respectively. The book contains two other essays, neither of which has strong justification for being included. I'm guessing that their inclusion is probably a reflection of a certain kind of political stance shared by the majority of the contributors and the publisher, Granta. One of the pieces discusses the realization by chemists Mario Molina and Sherry Rowland that repeated use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) was contributing to erosion of the ozone layer. Which is a fine and interesting topic, except that there is no relevant equation to describe or quantify it, so that there is no particular reason for it to be in this book. The ""equation"" in the remaining chapter, given over to a discussion of the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence (SETI) is not, strictly speaking an equation at all. Rather it is a formula, proposed by astronomer Frank Drake, to develop an estimate of the number of radio-emitting civilizations in the galaxy. Drake's suggestion was to take it as the product of a bunch of other factors (seven in all), many of which are also unknown and must be guessed at. Drake's equation may have appealed to the likes of Carl Sagan, but as an expression of any kind of scientific reality it has no validity whatsoever. I found its inclusion in the book just plain weird.Despite my reservations, the four ""good"" essays in the book are so astonishingly good that I strongly recommend it....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,"Feb 16, 2010","Feb 17, 2010","Feb 16, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/587159.It_Must_Be_Beautiful

There is also significant overlap with Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson's excellent ""Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me): Why We Justify Foolish Beliefs, Bad Decisions, and Hurtful Acts"". Joseph T. Hallinan's background is in journalism, not science, so this book is primarily a synthesis of the work of others. Hallinan won a Pulitzer during his time as a writer for the Wall Street Journal, and ""Why We Make Mistakes"" provides ample confirmation that he has the necessary writing chops. I think he does a spectacular job of synthesizing results of the relevant research. He's an unobtrusive but authoritative guide, steering the reader through the material with admirable clarity and focus. He has a journalist's talent for providing just the information needed to get the point across, often within the framework of a funny or thought-provoking example. Basically, Hallinan does what we hope any good nonfiction writer will do - he provides a comprehensive, coherent summary of a relatively extensive body of research, drawn from a wide variety of sources. He not only makes it accessible to the general reader; the wit and verve with which he pulls it off make the book a delight to read.To me, the most striking part of the book was the discussion of the phenomenon of overconfidence and its consequences. Think of it as the Lake Wobegon effect - as Hallinan puts it, ""we all walk around with the private conceit that we are above average, and in that conceit lies the seed of many mistakes"". Some of these mistakes can be catastrophic - as for instance when the overweening confidence of a handful of self-anointed financial ""masters of the universe"" proceeds unchecked to the point of triggering a complete meltdown of the financial sector. (A fascinating recent New Yorker article by Malcolm Gladwell makes a strong case that those executives whose errors of judgement were most instrumental in bringing about the meltdown still refuse to acknowledge that they did, in fact, make mistakes). The potential for catastrophe is greatest in situations involving systems with a high degree of technological complexity where the price of failure is high - flying a commercial airliner, for example, or performing emergency trauma surgery. Possibly one of the most chilling results reported in the book is the percentage of survey respondents who agreed with the statement:""Even when fatigued, I perform effectively during critical times""Only 26% of pilots agreed. Among surgeons, the agreement rate was 70%. There's an episode of ""Malcolm in the Middle"" where the boy genius is being prepped for appendix surgery. When the surgeon leans over to make the incision, he finds the elaborate checklist Malcolm has carefully scrawled in magic marker all over his stomach. You have to think the kid was on to something.

Finally, after years of hectoring by my friends, I gave in and bought a cell phone. But, for the life of me, I can't remember my cell number, and I have an apparently irresistible tendency to use it to take unwitting photos of my left foot (anyone with a fetish for such photos, I'm sure there's a website for you out there). So I undertook this substantial book about google in the hope that Auletta might provide enlightenment not just about the company, but also about their position in the current information technology landscape. By and large, he delivers. This wasn't the most enthralling non-fiction book I've read in a while, nor the best-written (let's just say charitably that Auletta's style is serviceable - forgettable, without too many direct assaults on grammar and syntax, though he does seem constitutionally incapable of avoiding the well-worn cliche). But it was entirely readable, and gave what seemed to me to be a fairly comprehensive account, in language that was understandable by even a techno-neophyte like me.By all accounts Auletta had unprecedented access to insiders at Google, including its two boy-wonder founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin. His account seems laudably neutral - one senses that, if anything, he found Page and Brin less charming as the project went on, but by and large he withholds overt judgement on the behavior of the key players, except for occasional comments about a certain naivete that permeated the company's management. These comments seem entirely justified, even reserved, given the facts.I had two main questions before reading the book -* How did google get to be so dominant?* Should I (and by extension, all of us) be worried about the future?Auletta gives a matter-of-fact answer to the first question, which turns out to be not all that interesting (basically, after tooling around for years, the company hit on a magic formula for linking the placement of ads to search results, and for charging advertisers - once this monetization scheme - google adwords - was in place, profits soared).The second question is, of course, harder to answer - predictions being notoriously unreliable, especially where the future is concerned. The sheer amount of information that can already be collected on an individual through google searching is sobering, and data privacy initiatives in the U.S. lag well behind similar efforts in Europe and other countries. Furthermore, with initiatives like its new smart phone, Google buzz social networking app, and its commitment to launching an ultra-high-speed access internet connection in selected markets, the company has made it clear that it has no intention of ceding dominance any time soon, and that it is willing to take on major players such as Apple and Facebook. Although Auletta is unwilling to say it in so many words, it's fairly clear that he expects the company to stumble as it faces these new challenges. Given the picture he paints, it seems almost inevitable - even companies with exceptional management teams in place would find the challenges of such extraordinarily rapid growth formidable. But the weaknesses in Google's management structure, the relative lack of structure in many cases, and their faith in technological solutions, with a blindness towards the human dimension of the problems the company faces, has already led to missteps, and is likely to continue to cause significant problems for Google.Still, if one message comes through loud and clear from Auletta's account, it's that it would be a major mistake to underestimate what Google may yet accomplish.

With all the sweaty desperation of a couple of cheap strippers, here comes the distinctly unsavory father-and-daughter vaudeville team of David P. and Nanelle R. Barash, bumping and grinding towards you, tipping you a leering wink as they try to lure you with their patented gimmick - the special high-tech e-vo-lution-ary reading lens.Gentle reader, run for your life! It's not just that this pair of brachiate mouth-breathers have nothing of interest to impart. Much worse, they are possessed of a sensibility so crass, a vocabulary so crude, cognitive deficits so far-ranging, that time spent in their company cannot end well. The severely limited cognitive ability of this pair can accommodate neither complexity nor subtlety, nor nuance of any kind. Which renders those fancy ""evolutionary"" lenses they are peddling as reductive as a pair of cheap 3D glasses from a 1950s creature feature.   Men just want to screw as much pussy as they can get away with, women are just looking for a sugar daddy who will provide for their babies, and blood is thicker than water. Because, as the Barassholes so charmingly explain: ""Females are egg makers; males are sperm squirters.""And there you have it folks. In that crassly reductive nutshell you have the entire Barash key to literary interpretation. Sprinkle in assorted references to rutting stags battling it out for dominance, peacock's tails and other elaborate courtship rituals, repeat the terms ""gene"", ""DNA"" and ""evolution"" often enough to keep the humanities folks guessing - and they got themselves a gimmick! The Barasshole's opinion of their readership is apparently not very high. They take care to point out that the ""American writer Kate Chopin""'s name is pronounced like ""that of the renowned composer"". And the blindingly obvious is pointed out with numbing frequency:""Aha!"" says the reader: a mother helping out her own offspring.""Aha!"" says the evolutionary biologist: genes helping themselves.In other breaking news, parents find the death of a child incredibly upsetting. Oh, and the bond between a step-parent and a child is often more problematic than that with the child's natural parent. So Othello is reduced to an enraged silverback, lashing out to maintain his alpha male status. Lady Dedlock seeks out her illegitimate daughter to effect a joyous reconciliation. The Dursleys are mean and spiteful to the stepchild Harry Potter. See how simple it is? Genes explain everything. All of literature is made clear viewed through the awesome prism of evolutionary psychology. The genetic advantage that accrues to the house of Atreus by having Agamemnon kill his daughter Iphigenia would be what, now? The stupidity and arrogance of these authors is simply breathtaking. Equally disturbing is their vulgarity. The analogy of strippers in a titty bar is not inappropriate - the kind of leeringly reductive ""analysis"" that this knuckle-dragging duo specializes in leaves the reader feeling coarsened, if not actually violated, and in need of a cleansing shower. Other crimes to be found in this book include assorted atrocities against the language (please don't make me go into details), as well as a disturbingly cavalier tendency to blurt out complete plot details of books the reader might still have been planning to read.This book is deeply offensive and insulting to the intelligence.

It's fun to read, executed with charm and flair (some might say chutzpah, and one has to admire the authors' sheer nerve in dreaming it up. Hell, you'll even learn a thing or two. A selective biography of Russell (with a few minor alterations), with cameo appearances by the various mathematical and philosophical luminaries who worked on the logical foundations of mathematics early in the last century. These were some tormented individuals; several became unhinged in later life (Frobe, Cantor, Godel), others struggled with a family history of mental imbalance (Russell, Hilbert). So the story is not dull. The authors' effort to explain the issues involved is a valiant one, but cannot avoid falling victim to the intrinsic limitations of the form. In the end, the most the reader can hope to take away from a graphic novel like this is a cartoon understanding of what all the fuss was about. Judged on its own terms, the book is a success - it's entertaining and well executed. The inherent limitations prevent me from giving it more than three stars, however. Anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the fundamental issues raised in the book will need to look for answers further afield. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,Feb 2010,"Feb 02, 2010","Feb 01, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6493321-logicomix

His subsequent effort, ""Doing our own Thing"", was a major disappointment - self-indulgent, undisciplined, and essentially pointless. So I would have skipped this one (a cover blurb that squeezes the chestnuts ""rollicking tour"" and ""rousing celebration"" into the same sentence is generally not a good sign). Did I really need reassurance from yet another linguist that it's OK to split an infinitive, or to end a sentence with a preposition? But then there was Manny's recent rave : http://www.goodreads.com//show/....My reaction?  Modified rapture  at best. There's a kind of forced flashiness to McWhorter's style that I don't particularly enjoy. Calling English a dolphin in a family of assorted types of deer (the Germanic relatives of English) gets the point across, but the metaphor is nowhere near as clever as McWhorter seems to think, and spinning it out across two paragraphs (""antlered, fleet-footed, big-brown-eyed variations on a theme"" - yeah, dude, we know what the word ""deer"" means, as if you hadn't already enumerated ""antelopes, springboks, kudu, and so on"" earlier in the sentence) is irritating, to say the least. For the first 60 pages of this book, McWhorter sets out to answer the question of why English favors the use of ""be"" and ""do"" as auxiliary verbs in constructions like ""I'm watching TV"" (actual present, as opposed to the habitual present ""I watch TV"", a distinction which confuses the bejasus out of most non-native speakers), in questions (""do you watch""?), or negative statements. None of its immediate relatives, either on the Germanic or the Romance side, uses such a construction. Fair enough, it's not a completely boring question, though it's hardly the major mystery he makes it out to be either. I figured out the answer to this at about age 5, when I first started to learn Irish (Gaelic) -- it's a Celtic thing, see? So that extended first chapter, in which the only point that is being developed is that the Celtic languages (Irish, Welsh, Scots Gaelic) influenced English syntax, hardly qualifies as a major revelation. Unfortunately, McWhorter beats it into the ground like the proverbial dead horse. For 60 pages. You start the second chapter with a sense of profound relief only to find - unspeakable horror - that he's not done. More statement of the profoundly obvious.I guess this is the major reason for my inability to share Manny's rabid enthusiasm for this book. Like so many of his colleagues, McWhorter expends a lot of effort in addressing what I consider to be obvious linguistic strawmen - the notion that linguistics is just about etymology, the red herring of grammatical hypercorrectness, the idea that vocabulary is the only measure of influence of one language on another, the spectacularly uninteresting strong form of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. It's as if he's writing for a readership consisting exclusively of people who have never undergone the intellectual exercise of learning a second language. Because if you've ever gone through that particular struggle, it seems to me that you're guaranteed to have thought about language deeply enough to make much of the material in this book seem like little more than a statement of the bloody obvious. And yeah, what the hell - it's a book about language, so I'll bitch. The shorthand term McWhorter uses throughout, that English employs a ""meaningless do"", seems  infelicitous  at best. ...more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,Feb 2010,Feb 2010,"Feb 01, 2010",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3143472-our-magnificent-bastard-tongue

It would have to be included on any short list of 'classics of science'. I have docked a star to reflect the fact that it's not always easy reading - there's that verbose quality to its style that characterizes most writing from the Victorian era. That said, I should point out that ""The Origin of Species"" is completely understandable to any general reader willing to give it a careful reading. You don't have to be a biologist to follow Darwin's argument. Two aspects of the book are astonishing; both underscore the brilliance of Darwin's accomplishment. The first is just how right he got things; the second is that he managed to fit all the major pieces of the puzzle in place with no knowledge of the actual mechanics of heredity. Mendel's work on genetics adn the elucidation of the structure of DNA would subsequently flesh out the details of the scheme proposed by Darwin; one has to bear in mind the actual state of knowledge in Darwin's time, and the prevailing intellectual climate, to appreciate fully the revolutionary nature of his argument. Upon re-reading the book this past weekend, I was reminded of certain endearing aspects that I had forgotten. One is Darwin's willingness to point out, and try to answer, what he perceived as the potential weaknesses in his argument. This is another: ""Believing that it is always best to study some special group, I have, after deliberation, taken up domestic pigeons"". Not quite as glamorous as the beasties he got to see from The Beagle, but he's continually observing, gathering data from any source available, always asking questions. You gotta love this book.

But then, coming in at well over 400 pages, it's clearly written for true W and C fans, a group which doesn't include me. I just picked it up on a whim because it was marked down and I have little or no impulse control where books are concerned. In the general scheme of things, my level of interest in Coleridge and Wordsworth is doomed to remain at a fairly modest threshold. But this is certainly not Adam Sisman's fault - this is a decently written, reasonably engaging account of the relationship between C and W. The level of detail certainly suggests Sisman has done his homework - it's to his credit that he writes like a human being and not an academic.Well, OK.

I still think he's a whiny, tree-hugging, milquetoast whose work manages to be both uninspired and uninspiring. Finding out that he was also apparently an insufferable, pompous jerk doesn't rehabilitate him.

What puzzles me is that it would have been equally jarring in 1994, when this book was published, and Fry is smart enough to know this, so it's obviously a conscious choice that he made. It's unclear why he did so, because it detracts quite a bit from the enjoyment of the book. It's a toss-up which was more offputting - the incessant vulgar misogynistic musings of the splenetic, Kingsley Amis wannabe narrator or the paragraphs of ridiculously mincing poofter-talk inflicted on the reader.

Buried somewhere among the thickets of impenetrable prose, run-on sentences and sundry atrocities against the EnglishThis book is an incoherent mess. Buried somewhere among the thickets of impenetrable prose, run-on sentences and sundry atrocities against the English language is a semi-decent idea. But Alfred W. Crosby sorely lacks the skills to bring it to light. It's rare that a book can actually make me flinch, but AWC managed it on every other page. Two sample paragraphs convey the flavor of the writing: Pantometry  is one of the neologisms that appeared in increasing numbers in the languages of Europe in the first half of the second Christian millennium, words summoned into being by new tendencies, institutions, and discoveries. Milione and America are others. A general surge of more in the 1200s rendered a thousand thousand obsolete and inspired a convenient replacement: milione. Columbus and Amerigo Vespucci and the like created the need for America two centuries or so later. These words were sparks thrown off by the wheels of Western society veering and grating against the sides of old ruts. The veerings and gratings are the subject of this book, but first we must examine the ruts, that is to say, the view of reality that most medieval and Renaissance Western Europeans accepted. We can begin by putting aside the word rut. The raison d'etre of this book is to describe an acceleration after 1250 or so in the West's shift from qualitative perception to, or at least toward, quantificational perception. Most particularly, we want to ferret out the source of that acceleration. The latter half of the assignment is daunting, and before we begin we must discuss just what we are looking for lest we convince ourselves we have found it before we get to it. This is ""scientific"" writing at its worst - bloated (inclusion of the neologism ""America"" has nothing to do with the point he is trying to make; the second paragraph could be written simply as ""This book aims to describe an acceleration in the West's shift from qualitative to quantitative perception that occurred after 1250, and to pinpoint its source""), meandering (what does that third sentence mean, anyway?), and inelegant to the point of ugliness (""quantificational""?, that hideous ""wheels and sparks"" metaphor, with its dreary corollary, that the book is about ""veerings and scrapings"". The book is easily twice as long as it needs to be, and there is much meandering, repetitive bloviation which tends to obfuscate, rather than illuminate, whatever argument the author is trying to make. His credibility is not enhanced by glib, fanciful, and largely inaccurate characterizations of the nature of mathematics and of science. Although he acknowledges the central role of commercial and related accounting activities as an impetus towards improved measurement, he stints it implicitly by giving it only 20 pages of text, while devoting fully 60 pages to music and painting as stimuli. This seems frankly skewed, as does his failure to discuss scientific developments in an adequate fashion. But this is an author who has no evident understanding of mathematics or the scientific method, who is unable to distinguish between true progress in mathematics, numerology and mathematical mysticism. This leads to paragraphs like the following:""India, the home of Buddha, has produced and continues to produce a disproportionate number of brilliant pure mathematicians. The West has produced most of the good applied physicists, engineers, and accountants. (This may or may not be true of late, but I am speaking historically).

No matter how brilliant their accomplishments, at any family gathering, we know who is going to be center stage. He's not just your average doctor, he's a surgeon. Specializing in endocrine cancer. This astonishingly good book isn't his first - he's written two others, ""Better"" and ""Complications"". Of course he's a Harvard professor. Oh yes, he does a little magazine writing. For the freaking ""New Yorker"", for crying out loud. His essay in the June 1st 2009 edition analyzing the cost of healthcare Annals of Medicine  is considered to have been most influential in the legislative debate  Sidney awards . He heads up the WHO's ""Safe Surgery Saves Lives"" program. Did I mention the MacArthur ""genius"" award? The kind of brother any sibling would be justified in resenting.I have no idea what kind of a surgeon Dr Gawande might be (though a reasonable guess would be that he is a very good one). I can say that, based on his New Yorker articles, and on this book, that he is an excellent writer. Like his colleague, Malcolm Gladwell, he has the ability to write about material that could easily be boring in the hands of a less gifted author in a way that is clear, engaging, and thought-provoking, without ever being condescending. This serves him well in this book, whose general topic is achieving success in areas of endeavor that are intrinsically complex, where success requires a high level of interdisciplinary cooperation, and where the consequences of failure are catastrophic. In 2006, Gawande was approached by the WHO to help develop a global program to reduce avoidable deaths and harm from surgery. His initial (quite sensible) reaction was to have nothing to do with it, but he eventually agreed to help. What followed from that request is one of the fascinating stories that make up this book, and the author does an excellent job of telling it. That story on its own makes the book worth reading. But Gawande takes things a step further, arguing that the kinds of challenges that make surgery a risky and complicated business are characteristic of many modern endeavors. Launching a manned space shuttle, building skyscrapers that don't collapse, discovering, testing and manufacturing a novel cancer drug, flying a commercial jet -- these are all examples of activities whose successful execution requires the coordinated efforts of experts spanning a huge range of expertise, and for which the consequences of failure are serious, possibly catastrophic. As the author points out, advances in technology have led to systems that are so technically complex that no one person is capable of understanding the entire system - we live in an age of hyper-specialization. Yet we have faith that such systems will work every time we enter high-rise office building, board a plane, or are admitted to hospital. How can we be sure that our trust is warranted?Gawande explores three cases in great depth - airline safety, building construction, and hospital safety (with separate discussion of critical care procedures and surgical interventions). By examining the ways complexity is addressed in the first two cases (both of which have excellent track records), he identifies general principles that should carry over generally. I won't give them away here, except to say that he makes his case in a way that is both articulate and convincing. Shorter vignettes are included to support his arguments, and they make for fascinating reading. His comparison of Walmart's and FEMA's relief efforts after Hurricane Katrina was particularly interesting, as was the explanation for David Lee Roth's notorious ""no brown M & Ms"" contract rider. This is a terrific book - well-written, interesting, and thought-provoking. I read it in just two sittings. ...more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,not set,"Jan 24, 2010","Jan 24, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6667514-the-checklist-manifesto

It just seemed like a surefire trigger for righteous indignation.  Helpless, righteous indignation. And what good is that - it's the stuff that heart attacks are made of (note: not ulcers - they come from bacteria) - feeling angry about stuff you have no control over just leaves you out there on the heath, shaking your fist at the uncaring deities above.Well, actually, it turns out that the exercise can be quite cathartic. John Lanchester's explanation of the economic meltdown of 2008-2009 gets my 5-star rating for a number of reasons:* it's short, but comprehensive - in just over 200 pages, he tells you not just what happened, but how and why* it's brilliantly written - Lanchester, a novelist and regular contributor to ""The New Yorker"" and ""London Review of Books"", hits the ideal combination of explanation and analysis. When he started his research from the book, he did so as a smart, intelligent outsider, with the curiosity and bullshit-detecting skills of a keen reporter, all of which makes him an ideal guide. * the author's ability to explain complicated technical material in a way that is succinct, but crystal clear* even though some of the book's implications are pretty depressing, Lanchester is authoritative, clear-sighted, and extremely funny* his ability to place events in the relevant historical and cultural perspective is impressiveBefore reading ""I.O.U."", the only other work by Lanchester that I had read was his debut novel ""The Debt to Pleasure"" (which won the Whitbread award, among other prizes). That book had a certain appeal, but was also quite disturbing. This latest book is a terrific accomplishment, and I have no reservations about giving it my highest rating. One of the metaphors that Lanchester concludes with is borrowed from climate scientist James Lovelock, who observed, about 20 years ago, that what the planet needed was the equivalent of a small heart attack. Such an episode, in an individual's life, is often beneficial, because it forces the person to fact unpleasant facts and to adopt a healthier lifestyle. In Lanchester's view, the recent economic crisis, is the equivalent of laissez-faire capitalism's small heart attack. We have the chance to insist that our governments change the rules to make sure that it truly can never happen again, because even if there is only the ghost of a chance that it can, it will; that's the nature of modern markets. Failure to make the needed changes at this point is the equivalent of celebrating our release from hospital with a carton of Rothmans, a bottle of tequila, and a supersized Big Mac with jumbo fries.

Mallon would have done well to pay attention to the (relatively simple) elements that make this book so terrific:1. Andrew Carroll includes entire letters, not just snippets.2. The quality and variety of the letters included are phenomenal.3. Carroll keeps his own editorializing to a minimum. His 8-page introduction is eloquent and succinct, infinitely preferable to Thomas Mallon's repeated, rambling interruptions. Expanding a little on the second point - a major part of the book's charm stems from the inclusion of letters from people in all walks of life, famous and unknown, rich and poor. Carroll is an exemplary editor - almost every letter included in this book packs a punch. The usual suspects are here, certainly (Groucho, Winston Churchill, Mark Twain, Flannery O' Connor, ""Yes, Virginia""). But how refreshing that the letter from John Cheever is a hilarious update to a friend whose pet the Cheevers were catsitting (it didn't go well), or to read F.

For once I actually agree with the Booker jury selection. This is an extraordinary book.We all carry in our heads a certain view of Tudor England, and of the events that happened in the time span of this book (1528-1536). Before reading ""Wolf Hall"", my mental picture of this particularly tumultuous period was, I suspect, largely an amalgamation of different films and television miniseries, together with whatever I had retained from high school history (I had, perhaps fortunately, never been exposed to the vulgar charms of ""The Tudors""). In particular, there was the lingering legacy of ""A Man For All Seasons"", and the inherent Irish antipathy to the name Cromwell. There was a tendency to think of this, one of the most important decades in English history, in cartoon terms: Thomas More as the universally loved hero-martyr, Thomas Cromwell his vile, conniving nemesis, Henry VIII an appetite-driven caricature. Hilary Mantel's account of the period in question is brilliant, subtle, and so utterly convincing that one is forced to jettison that cartoon version of events. Her decision to present the story from Cromwell's point of view is an inspired choice. The changes that rocked England in the 1530s were seismic, and were fundamental in shaping the country's subsequent history. Mantel reminds us that, though the will of the king may have been a key driver of change, its actual implementation was hugely complicated, defying any reductionist identification of good guys and bad guys. Her rehabilitation of Cromwell as someone of great intelligence, drive, subtlety, pragmatism, and enormous political skill is entirely convincing. Only someone with this combination of talents could have managed to accomplish as much as he did. Thomas More fares less well in Mantel's account; the halo awarded by Bolt in ""A Man For All Seasons"" doesn't hold up under her scrutiny.The writing is terrific, though her occasional lapses into contemporary business speak are jarring (fortunately, these are rare). One would be hard put to pick a more tumultuous, or decisive, decade in English history. The characters are driven, complex, subtle, larger than life. It all makes for fascinating reading. One longs for the sequel, and the inevitable TV miniseries.

But, with the exception of ""Zilkowski's Theorem"" and ""The Confessional Approach"", they aren't particularly good either. Iagnemma blows the cover of his gimmick right there on page 3 of the title story by inclusion of a Venn diagram that in no way illuminates what he is trying to say (and the line of mathematical notation that follows the accompanying ""more precisely"" is complete mumbo-jumbo, what one can only regard as placed there cynically, for ers at the same mathemtical level as the L.A.

This book evolved as a result of his continuing efforts in that role for the next 16 years, synthesizing material from weekly bulletins, op-ed columns and various articles in the popular press. Park is refreshingly clear that he is not writing for other scientists. His target audience is the general, non-specialist, reader and one of the many appealing qualities of this book is his skill in writing at an appropriate level for that target readership. I liked this book a lot. It lacks the stridency and tone of superiority that mar Damian Thompson's ""Counterknowledge"", and the writing is more disciplined than that in Shermer's ""Why People Believe Weird Things"". Although it covers similar ground, Park's book has more of a hard science focus than the other two, possibly reflecting his background as a physicist. Other welcome features in the book, traceable to the author's role as public affairs liaison, are a discussion of the role of bad science reporting in promulgating scientific nonsense and consideration of the interface between science and public policy. The material in ""Voodoo Science"" is thus a useful complement to Shermer's book (I don't really recommend ""Counterknowledge"" - Thompson does an adequate job, but his supercilious tone throughout makes him insufferable). To give an idea of the scope of ""Voodoo Science"", it seems easiest to give the chapter headings:1. It's not news, it's entertainment (science coverage in the media, with particular attention given to cold fusion)2. The belief gene (science as a strategy for sorting out the truth)3.

Gladwell's particular talent is to take a subject which might seem initially to be irredeemably dull and to poke at it from all sides until he locates the particular angle which will allow him to tell a story, simultaneously entertaining and edifying his readers. There's a little more to it than that, of course: in particular, a seemingly unbounded curiosity about why the world is the way it is, and the skill to craft narratives that engage the general reader without being either boring or condescending. One of the factors which contributes greatly to his success is an almost uncanny ability to explain technically complicated material in an accessible manner - he makes this seem so effortless that I think people have begun to take this aspect of his work for granted. I think it's anything but effortless, that it takes hard work every time and he is one of only a handful of writers to pull it off regularly. You may find yourself disagreeing with something that Gladwell is telling you, but you generally won't have too much difficulty figuring it out. Gladwell groups the essays in this book into three broad categories:Part 1: Obsessives, pioneers, and other varieties of minor geniusPart 2: Theories, predictions, and diagnosesPart 3: Personality, character, and intelligenceIn the first part, which includes profiles of Ron Popeil (the infomercial king), Cesar Millan (the dog whisperer), Nassim Taleb (contrarian investor and author of ""Fooled by Randomness""), as well as chapters on ketchup, hair coloring, and the history of the contraceptive pill, Gladwell sticks closest to his source material, avoiding the kind of premature generalization that is his Achilles heel. He isn't always successful in doing so in the remaining parts so that, while his lucid common sense on the topics of mammography, plagiarism, homelessness, and criminal profiling is a breath of fresh air, his arguments about organizational culture (the Enron debacle, the Challenger explosion) and predictors of individual performance (why some people choke and others panic, are smart people overrated?) are not entirely persuasive.Nonetheless, this is a fine collection. Gladwell on a bad day still manages to eclipse most other non-fiction writers out there. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Jan 03, 2010","Jan 06, 2010",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6632008-what-the-dog-saw-and-other-adventures

It didn't seem possible for his subsequent book on plagiarism (""Stolen Words"") to reach the same level of excellence, but it did. It's perhaps not altogether surprising that this latest book didn't match the brilliance of the earlier two (if nothing else, the statistical phenomenon of regression toward the mean would be expected to take effect at some point). It's not that this is a bad book - it's just not particularly interesting. Mallon appears to have dragged out the writing over a period of 15 years, which conveys the definite impression that he just lost interest. It's unclear why he would think the reader's reaction would be any different. In fact, the lukewarm nature of his introduction (to  his own book ) suggests that he knows that the book fails to reach his earlier standards. The book's content is roughly one third direct quotation from various letters, flanked by Mallon's introduction and commentary. The 300 or so pages of text are divided into nine thematic groupings: Absence, Friendship, Advice, Complaint, Love, Spirit, Confession, War, and Prison. In general, the book would have benefitted had Mallon opted for more extensive quotation from fewer correspondents. Many of the people from whose letters he quotes are just not all that interesting, and his bridging text does not make it adequately clear why they have been chosen for inclusion. The inevitable result is that the reader is left wishing that the witless had been sacrificed to make room for more material from those with genuine wit and insight. I find it hard to summon up more than two stars. An infinitely better book is the collection edited by Andrew Carroll, ""Letters of a Nation"", published in 1997. It's interesting to note that this is the year that Mallon had targeted for initial publication of this book.

None of these women has a name - they are all just ""she"". And Davis writes about them with a detachment that borders on the clinical. In contrast to Jonathan Franzen, I can't imagine how a writer could make the words on the page matter less. The dreary 'stories' in this volume adhere to the dismal prevailing conventions of the late 1980s - tales of narcissistic or bipolar protagonists in which nothing much ever happens, served up in a kind of minimalist prose with that knowing ironic detachment. The kind of tripe that drives me up the wall, in other words.

As will become evident, one is infinitely more crotchety than the other, possibly to the extent of bloody-mindedness. To keep guesswork to a minimum, I will alternate between regular and italic fonts.This exploration of American English by Bill Bryson contains a wealth of entertaining anecdotal material  that is unfortunately often buried in a welter of undisciplined, self-indulgent blather, expressed in breathless, eighth-grade level prose that cries out to be edited and brought under control. In considering the development of the language in the U.S., Bryson casts a wide net, with the first nine chapters covering various stages of American history from the Mayflower to the various waves of immigration that characterized the late 19th and early 20th centuries. ""Casts a wide net"" is a good one. To say that this book is 'about' American English is a bit like saying ""A Tale of two Cities"" is 'about' knitting. Subsequent chapters are organized thematically, dealing with such subjects as shopping, travel, advertising, eating, sports, the movies, sex, politics and war, and the state of American English at the time the book was written (the mid 1990s). It seems fair to say that the author's scholarship is characterized more by the breadth of his curiosity than its depth.  Isn't that just another way of saying that sloppiness abounds in this dog's breakfast of a book? That seems a little harsh. Sure, his style is sometimes a bit discursive, and the author has a fondness for tangents... 'Discursive' is an understatement.

It's not just another lapse by the Booker selection committee, whose judgements we already know to take with a large grain of salt. But to be let down so abominably by Dame Iris, someone we know is capable of writing interestingly, though sometimes at the expense of prolixity. Regrettably, in ""The Sea, The Sea"" we see her giving free rein to her multiple vices, with little of the compensatory acuity that is there in some of her earlier books.Poor writing choices all around. Or at least none that favors the hapless reader. So we are treated to the first person narrative of a monomaniacal narcissist. One who is delusional (sea-serpents haunt him when he swims) and who seems intent on tormenting us with the weird details of every bizarre meal he fixes for himself in his crumbling 'squalid to a degree only an English person would tolerate' surroundings.

The back cover of my edition describes it as a ""superb compendium of vengeance, surprise, and dark delight"" and that's as good a characterization as any I can come up with. Continuing with my shameless plagiarization of the cover blurb, it describes the recipe for a typical Dahl tale: Take a pinch of unease. Stir in a large dollop of the macabre, add a generous helping of dark and stylish wit, and garnish with the bizarre Again, that gives you a pretty good sense of what you will find in this terrific collection of 25 stories. Though it perhaps fails to convey just how funny they are. Not to mention well-constructed and well-written. Dahl has a particular knack for knowing just which detail to include - and just as important - knowing what to leave out. Many of the best stories in tbis book stop just on the threshold of the truly dark, because the author knows that it's far more effective to leave the details unfold and reverberate in the reader's imagination.These tales may remind some readers of the stories of Patricia Highsmith. My sense is that they are not as dark as Highsmith's, nor meant to be, because where one feels that Highsmith's misanthropism ran through to the bone, Dahl's is worn lighter. You can almost feel him winking to the reader, as one nasty character after another meets a suitably macabre fate ""it's only a yarn, chum"". I suspect Dahl actually liked other people quite a bit more than Highsmith. Upon reflection, a better comparison for these tales might be the stories of Saki (H.H. Munro).Either way, it's a hugely enjoyable, often hilarious collection, which I consider the best of Dahl's work. (I may be one of the few people on the planet who doesn't ""get""  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , which I find excessively weird, both the book and - pace, Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp fans - both film versions. And some of Dahl's other work, e.g. the frankly misogynistic ""My Uncle Oswald"", doesn't do it for me either. Though you gotta love ""Matilda"", and I've never read the story on which the ""Fantastic Mr Fox"" movie is based).Almost all of these stories have been adapted for TV, by directors ranging from Hitchcock to Tarantino. Even if you've seen the series ""Tales of the Unexpected"", the stories themselves are well worth reading. My personal favorite is probably the little old lady taxidermy story, though the one about Liszt reincarnated as a kitty has to be a close runner-up. Or ""Royal Jelly"". Or ""Lamb to the Slaughter"". or ""Parson's Pleasure"".

Like all the books in the series, it is (appealingly?) short* (100 pages), but the quality of the writing more than compensates for its brevity.Perhaps shamefully, I had never heard of John Berger before stumbling across this collection of his work. A little googling points to a fairly extensive body of work, which I look forward to exploring further. The book comprises eight essays, one poem, and a concluding vignette of the philosopher Ernst Fischer, a personal friend of the author. As the title essay suggests, most of the pieces deal with the relationship between humans and animals; they range from the gently playful ""A Mouse Story"" (a man, a mousetrap, and several murine protagonists), to more elegaic pieces such as ""The White Bird"" and ""Field"", both of which use the commonplace (a wooden bird carved by a peasant of the Haute Savoie, a field near the author's home) as starting point for more general rumination on aesthetics. The poem ""They are the Last"" is a surprisingly moving appreciation of cows. Perhaps because of the quality of the writing, each of these pieces has a low-key charm which I enjoyed thoroughly.But the meat of the book (no pun intended) lies in the three longer essays: ""Why Look at Animals?"", ""Ape Theatre"", and ""The Eaters and the Eaten"", which, taken together, provide a thoughtful, unexpectedly engrossing, investigation of the relationship between humans and animals. Although Berger's purpose is undoubtedly didactic, precisely what I found appealing about these essays is the lack of any kind of preaching tone. In contrast to, say, someone like Peter Singer, whose general air of moral superiority I personally find completely offputting, and whose preachy tone diminishes the cogency of his arguments, Berger's approach is far more low-key. And because of that, more effective, at least for this reader. Whereas the extremity of some of Singer's arguments just makes me fling him aside after a while, Berger writes with a sly charm that is beguiling, with the result that I found these essays thought-provoking, and not easily dismissed. Which, I imagine, would please the author. I did not expect to like this collection of essays nearly as much as I did. Try them for yourself - you might feel the same way.*: I think the marketing folks at Penguin are quite smart - they know full well that a 300-page volume that advertised itself as containing ""great ideas"" would be a tough sell. Whereas the slim volumes that they have assembled are actually pretty appealing, even if some (Orwell's essay on ""Books v Cigarettes"" or on ""The Decline of the English Murder"", for example), though not without a certain charm, seem to stretch the definition of ""great ideas"" more than a little ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,"Nov 14, 2009","Nov 12, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6771667-why-look-at-animals

It pains me to acknowledge that, until about 6 months ago, I had this image of VW that was pretty much completely at odds with her warmth, wit, and ability to write prose that sparkles and enchants.

How Should One Read a Book?Each of the 9 essays I've read so far has blown me away, either because it contains one or more flashes of pure insight, or because of the incomparable quality of the writing, and - in most cases - some combination of the two. In six pages, the title essay contains some of the sanest observations about war in anything I've read outside of Orwell. The second two essays capture the quotidian pleasures of walking the streets of London with a wit and perspicacity that leaves me slack-jawed in admiration. Essay #4, one of my favorites (together with the final essay, which is simply perfect) is a spellbinding discourse on the slippery charm of words. Essays 6, 8, and 9 contain some of the most cogent remarks about writing that I have ever read. #7 is a hilarious takedown of those who would write or lecture about literature.But it's the final essay in this book that raises the whole collection to my top 5 books of all time list (there's going to be some ugly rearranging that will have to take place on my ""top 20"" shelf, and a difficult choice lies ahead).""How Should One Read a Book?"" is where my self-discipline breaks down. This is an essay that demands to be quoted from. In whole chunks. With difficulty, I will confine myself to three: The only advice, indeed, that one person can give another about reading is to take no advice, to follow your own instincts, to use your own reason, to come to your own conclusions. ... To admit authorities, however heavily furred and gowned, into our libraries and let them tell us how to read, what to read, what value to place upon what we read, is to destroy the spirit of freedom which is the breath of those sanctuaries. Everywhere else we may be bound by laws and conventions - there we have none. In your face, Harold Bloom! Perhaps the quickest way to understand the elements of what a novelist is doing is not to read, but to write; to make your own experiment with the dangers and difficulties of words.  I have sometimes dreamt, at least, that when the Day of Judgment dawns ... the Almighty will turn to Peter and will say, not without a certain envy, as He sees us coming with our books under our arms: ""Look, these need no reward. We have nothing to give them here. They have loved reading.""By the time the title essay of this collection was published, Virgina Woolf had already filled her pockets with stones and walked into the river Ouse. I find her suicide enormously saddening, particularly given the brilliance of these essays.

Almost half this book is given over to his impressions of the country during the second phase of Peronism, and the aftermath, during the beginning of the military dictatorship that followed. (Other essays in the book deal with post-colonialism in Trinidad and Zaire, with a brief meditation on Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"").It's not that I can find factual fault with anything that Sir V writes about Argentina. It's just that it all seems so ... mean-spirited ... In particular, his characterization of Borges (who was his host on at least more than one occasion) smacks of biting the hand that fed him.

Whatever you miThis year's volume confirms the status of this collection as my perennial favorite in the whole ""Best American"" series of anthologies. Whatever you might think of Dave Eggers, he redeems himself on an annual basis with this collection (this year, IMO, he has doubly redeemed himself, with the publication of the extraordinary ""Zeitoun"", but that's material for a whole 'nother post).This collection is hard to sum up in a single sentence - one might think of it as an edgier - and more entertaining - version of the ""Best American Essays"". But a far better collection, because Eggers (and this year's guest editor, Marjane Satrapi) are savvy enough to cast a far broader net. So, for instance, in addition to standbys like ""best craigslist ads"", ""best police blotter items"", ""best kids' letters to Obama"", ""best book titles published in 2008 (Baboon Metaphysics? Excrement in the late Middle Ages? anyone?), ""best poem titles of 2008"" (A Plea for the Cessation of Fruit Metaphors, I need more Cowbell, What your Dad's Underpants have to do with Space Travel, If my Life were a Radio, lately I would Prefer another Station, Why not Oysters?...), there are such fine contributions as Phillip Connors's ""diary of a Fire Lookout"", Anne Gisleson's ""Your exhausted Heart"" (about the Saturn Bar in new Orleans), Denis Johnson's ""Boomtown Iraq"", Jonathan Franzen's tribute to david Foster Wallace, excellent pieces by Rivka Galchen, Rebekah Bliss, Eula Biss, and Susan Breen.This partial list doesn't include the three or four charming picture essays, nor the five or six other equally good pieces by authors like Nick Flynn, David Grann and Amelia Kahaney. I can do no better than to paraphrase what I wrote about the 2008 volume - this is writing that informs me about stuff that I would otherwise not encounter, brilliantly executed by authors whose worldview extends - praise the lord - beyond their own navels. Like a bunch of exotically flavored Dove bars - unfamiliar at first, but reliably delicious. material that takes you outside of your comfort zone, in the best possible way. 4.5 stars, which I think deserve to be rounded up to 5, because the percentage of dross in this collection is very low indeed. As always, if you find yourself in the bookstore, faced with the entire gamut of the ""best American XXX 2009"" series, and you have only $14 to spend, there's no question about it - this is the one you should pick.I don't know what it is we have against Dave Eggers anyway.

But I felt that Mary Oliver's background as a poet shone through, with the result that many of the pieces had a kind of ""writerly"" quality that might appeal to other writers, but was a bit precious for a general reader like me. This was particularly true of pieces like Chris Arthur's ""(En)trance"", Patricia Hampl's ""The Dark Art of Description"", Brian Doyle's ""The Greatest nature Essay Ever"", Cynthia Ozick's ""Ghost writers"", John Updike's ""The Writer in Winter"", any of which might be of interest to someone attending a writer's workshop, but none of which seemed to me to hold much interest for a general reader. And, of course, it didn't help my evaluation that one of the longest pieces in the collection is by Richard Rodriguez, a writer whose self-indulgent posturing and whining gets on my last nerve. In a slim collection that doesn't even exceed 200 pages, the 21 pages devoted to his contribution ""the God of the Desert"" could surely have been put to better use. Not to end on too sour a note, honorable mention is surely due to; Sue Allison's ""Taking a Reading"" Jill Mc Corkle's ""Cuss Time"" David James Duncan's soaring ""Cherish this Ecstasy"" and Kathryn Miles's wonderful ""Dog is our Copilot"" But these amount to no more than 25 pages of 190, or - if you prefer - 4 essays out of 22. a disappointing batting average. original  starts below:Definitely an improvement over last year's woeful selection (courtesy of pretentious assmarmot Adam Gopnik), this year's pretty slim collection still doesn't manage to rise above 3 stars. truth be told, it's a solid 2.5 star effort, but I'm willing to round up solely on the basis of Jill McCorkle's delightful ""Cuss Time"".What to say? Well, this year's editor is a poet, so that shines through in many of the essays. A lot of writerly writing, if that floats your boat (personally I found many of the pieces more than a little precious). My other criticism, which seems to be a recurring one for this particular collection, is that you, the reader, may not find the navel-gazing of many of the contributors nearly as interesting as they evidently find it. But if *the travails of Michael Lewis living in a mansion beyond his means, *a ten-page account of Garret Lewis's ongoing fight with deer in his backyard, *10 pages about the personal health and fainting history of someone called James Marcus, (each of the above delivered in prose that is at best adequate, and with no apparent irony)is the kind of thing that fascinates you, you may well enjoy this particular selection. Personally, I am beginning to think that this particular volume in the ""Best American"" series is about ready to be put on the chopping block.Back down to two stars - the dross really outweighs the few decent contributions yet again. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Oct 27, 2009","Oct 27, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6429110-the-best-american-essays-2009

All the educational programs I see on my local public TV channel about the brain, or aging, or the aging brain (oh, boomer generation, you have a lot to answer for!), are unanimous: one of the few consolations of the whole built-in obsolescence that lies ahead is that our judgement should improve with age. Apparently not in every case. Last year, the onset of late middle age spooked the normally sensible Julian Barnes into publishing the eructation of fatuously narcissistic bloviation titled (quite inaccurately) ""Nothing to be Afraid Of"". And now, one of my favorite British authors, the eminently sane David Lodge, comes out with this unfortunate book. Though it comes nowhere close to matching the self-important narcissism of Barnes's mistake, it is nevertheless a regrettable lapse of judgement from an author who is smart enough to know better. I'm sure we can all empathize, Professor Lodge - it must have been a real bummer when you submitted the final manuscript of your Henry James book ""Author, Author"" only to learn that another author had just finished a similar book, scheduled to be published six months ahead of yours. Particularly when the competition was the ultra-talented Colm Toibin. You have every right to feel bad.  But you really didn't need to write a book about it. No matter what you write, it will be perceived as whining. Believe me, nobody else cares about this as much as you do. And the more you write, the less the reader cares. This is how one alienates one's fanbase. Next time, consider the dignified silence option.To be fair, only 100 pages of the book are given over to snivelling about being beaten to the punch by Colm Toibin and, objectively speaking, Professor Lodge doesn't actually snivel - it just seems that way. But after ploughing through those 100 pages, the reader is unlikely to be favorably disposed towards the remaining essays (on works by H.G. Wells, Graham Greene, George Eliot among others). I found the remarks on Nabokov's ""Pnin"" and on writers who influenced Graham Greene interesting - the other essays were readable, if a little dull; Professor Lodge's apparent awe for Umberto Eco renders that essay a little mushy.

Actually, make that ""including the narrator"". Which is probably what sinks the book in the end, because the whole novel is written, to a claustrophobic extent, from the point of view of its coming-of-age college freshman main protagonist, Tassie. Moore tries hard to convey Tassie's confusion and alienation, and also seems to want to make some serious commentary about life in post 9/11 America, but somehow the whole thing never gels successfully. As other ers have pointed out, many of the plot elements - in particular, Tassie's relative isolation - don't ring true. I also found the adoption subplot overwrought - ultimately the whole story just sank under the weight of its own good intentions. Given that Moore is the author, the book is well-written, but the exaggerated detachment of the narrator, and the failure of the various plot strands to add up to a coherent whole, made the novel an ambitious failure, in my opinion.So, a bit of a letdown, from an author whose previous collections of short stories I enjoyed far more....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Oct 03, 2009","Oct 22, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6076387-a-gate-at-the-stairs

The main protagonist, Claudia Hampton, an accomplished historian, lies dying in a London hospital bed and looks back upon her life. The resulting series of first-person flashbacks, interspersed with third-person accounts of the same episodes, coalesce into a tightly constructed kaleidoscopic view of Claudia's life which is impressive for the skill with which it is achieved, but ultimately left me unmoved. My fundamental problem with the book is that Claudia is such a self-satisfied narcissist that the reader ultimately tires of the recital of her various accomplishments and the smug superiority with which lesser characters in her history (her unfortunate sister-in-law, her disappointingly conventional daughter) are dismissed. Lively is no fool, and attempts to mitigate Claudia's unrelenting smugness with a brief episode of vulnerability and genuine emotion during a doomed World War II romance with a British tank commander who is subsequently killed in battle. The jacket cover inflates this episode by describing it as ""the still point of her turning world"", but the problem is that it fails to ring true. Ultimately, the version of Claudia that dominates the narrative is that of the smug, superior harpie. To whom my reaction was - why should anyone possibly care?So, while I can admire the skill with which this book was written, the emotional vacuum at its core ultimately leaves me cold. ...more",Notes are private!,0,46,1,not set,"Jan 11, 2010","Oct 22, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/130028.Moon_Tiger

And you have to hand it to the man - he does it very well. Somehow he manages to cajole the reader into looking beyond the ridiculously insane degree of gilded privilege his chosen subjects enjoy, and to make the case that lives of pure entitlement can be interesting enough to merit our attention. The very rich, it turns out, have their problems too, even if it would be stretching things to say that they are just like you and me. In the hands of a less subtle author, the protagonists of these stories would be insufferable. But Auchincloss manages to strike just the right note of unapologetic irony in his narration, and to create situations that hold the reader's interest.

Similar metaphoric compounds appear in colloquial speech, e.g. fire-water for whisky (aka ""usquebaugh', from the Gaelic 'uisce beatha', or 'water of life', another kenning)..

So I will always be eternally grateful to old Jorge Luis (you know that wizened Argentine gentleman sitting in the middle of that old labyrnthine library of his; the blind guy who should have gotten out more). Seems to me kenning is the source of more free fun with language than should legally be allowed. Let's consider some examples to figure out why, shall we?Here's a fine Icelandic example:árr þrimu minnis benstara(servant of noise of the toast of the wound-starling)Einarr Gilsson (Icelandic, 14th century): A poem about bishop Guðmundr Arason, stanza 23:5-8What could this possibly mean? Let's break it down:benstari = wound-starling (raven)minni benstara = toast of raven (blood)þrima minnis benstara = noise of blood (battle)árr þrimu minnis benstara = servant of battle (warrior) Heck, it's just a fancy way of saying ""warrior"". As yarb has commented elsewhere, ""no wonder their economy went tits-up"".But this is an example of compound kenning, where many individual kennings are nested, like so many Icelandic Matryoshka (?) dolls. Maybe it would be better to start with some of the relatively simple common single kennings:road of the gods: the skywhale-road: the seasquirrel-road: a tree branchbelly-timber: foodheaven's candle: the sunoil of the sword: bloodetc etc etcWith a few basic kennings in hand, it's a relatively simple matter to build things up. For instance:hungrdeyfir dynsæðinga dýrbliks Heita(hunger-diminisher of din-seagulls of animal-gleam of Heiti)Hallfreðr vandræðaskáld (Icelandic, late 10th century): Ólafsdrápa (1001), stanza 20:1-4:Veitkat hitt, hvárt Heitahungrdeyfi skalk leyfadynsæðinga dauðandýrbliks eða þó kvikvan(I know not whether I should praise the hunger-diminisher of din-seagulls of animal-gleam of Heiti as dead or alive.)Let's break it down, step by step:dýr Heita = animal of Heiti (ship)dýrblik Heita = gleam of ship (shield)dynr dýrbliks Heita = din of shield (battle)dynsæðingr dýrbliks Heita = seagull of battle (raven)hungrdeyfir dynsæðinga dýrbliks Heita = feeder of ravens (warrior) That was pretty fun, wasn't it? But wait, there's more fun to be had. Kenning is not just for dead Icelandic poets. Even us non-skalds can play this game. And we do, all the time. Consider:Iron horse, necktie party, skyscraper, wallflower, couch potato, rug rats, road hog, ship of the desert, stinking rose, wooden overcoat, desk jocky, tonsil hockey, trouser snake, or Jessica's bane, the chicken of the sea. Yes, gentle reader, you've been kenning all your life, and you never knew it until now. But one of the things I enjoy most about the kenning game is that there is always room for a little creativity. Here are some of my own efforts - why not add yours?tuna of the yard; chickenfish of the sofa: kittens (based on PETA's ludicrous campaign to rename fish as 'kittens of the sea', so that kids wouldn't want to eat fish)pink land clouds; pigscandy-floss of the sky: cloudsI could go on, but you get the picture. Hours of geekish fun. Gracias, señor Borges!*****************************************************************Oh, I know you're thinking 'not Borges again!'. And with such a Borgesian title, who the hell could blame you? But me, I LOVE this book, with big slobbery LOVE. But, truth in ing, that's just on the basis of the only two its seven essays that I've read so far. These are the 1933 essay on kenning and the 1935 essay on ""Translators of 1001 Nights"". Because I'm a complete sucker for any kind of comparative analysis of translations of anything - one of my all time favorite books is Douglas Hofstadter's ""Le Ton Beau de Marot"". And while some might resent Borges's ""here are the graven tablets of stone I'm handing you - pay attention and be careful not to drop them"" tone, I find it kind of endearing, if only because he has the chops - this is a man who does his research before formulating his opinions, so I think he's entitled to his sense of omniscient entitlement, if that makes sense.Also, ever since I discovered kennings about a year ago, I've had a secret weakness for them. And Borges's disquisition is masterful (again, a man who does his research - no half-assed analysis here).I don't know if these particular essays are in the anthology of non-fiction by Borges that appeared a few years back, which is what is most likely to be accessible to English-speaking readers. But they have already made this book, which I picked up for the ludicrously low sum of 10 pesos (about $2.70) here in Buenos aires, worth the price of admission....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Nov 12, 2009","Sep 11, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/544853.Historia_de_la_eternidad_History_of_eternity

There were plenty of honorable mentions in the nonfiction category for the year - Henry Alford's ""How to Live"", Alain de Boton's ""The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work"", and the Brafman brothers' excellent ""Sway"". While these three books were particularly engaging and well-executed, they are nonetheless eclipsed by the sheer unadulterated genius of Rose George's inspired exploration of - well - shit. This book is completely awesome - Rose George is an ideal guide to what Newsweek refers to as ""the history and implications of a daily act that dare not speak its name"". She's a trouper - having decided to take the project on, she's not one for half-measures. Whether she's touring the sewers of London, getting to the bottom of the success of intelligent toilets in Japan, interviewing toilet crusaders in South Africa and India, contemplating the devastation wrought by inadequate sanitation across the world, learning about China's biogas boom, or the controversy that swirls around the use of retreated sewage (""biosolids"") as fertiliser, she is a gung-ho and engaging reporter, with an instinct for asking useful questions. The material covered in the book is far-ranging, fascinating, and fun, presented with with just the right balance of wit, curiosity and seriousness. My favorite chapter was the one about public toilets. However, the discussion of Japan's progression from a nation of pit latrines to high-end robot toilets with brains high-end is pretty kickass as well. Fascinating nuggets of information abound - for instance, the fact that soybean paste (miso) is a lethal weapon in the battle for toilet market domination, as it is a vital ingredient in making realistic ""fake body waste"", essential for quality control testing. Then there's the plasticity of disgust, the term used to describe the phenomenon that mothers find the smell of their own baby's diapers less disgusting than that of unrelated baby's diapers.Fecal transfusions are becoming an increasingly common procedure in modern medicine.

Though I also have been enjoying Neruda's ""20 love poems and a song of despair"" since arriving here in Chile, their abstraction pales in comparison to the wonderfully concrete images evoked in the poems of this collection. Last Sunday I had the privilege of visiting Neruda's home in Valparaiso, (known as ""La Sebastiana"", see my current avatar), which is now preserved by the Neruda foundation as a museum. it's this indescribably wonderful four-story house overlooking the Pacific. The best part is that it's stuffed to the rafters with stuff - Neruda was obviously a complete pack-rat - the house is just filled with all manner of THINGS that he accumulated throughout his life. It provides a fascinating glimpse into his personality, and gives the ""Oda a las cosas"" a particular resonance.Before this trip, I had always mentally classified Neruda's work in a kind of ""future homework"" category. That is to say, I had always felt guilty about not having read it, but wasn't particularly looking forward to doing so. Nothing had prepared me for the joyful immediacy of these poems.I ADORE this book! Almost singlehandedly it has saved a trip whose other aspects have not always been pleasant. And I don't know whether it's the stage of life that I find myself at, or what the explanation for it is, but I find myself responding far more to Neruda's celebration of the small, concrete, pleasures of life (things! goddamit) than to the more abstract musings on love and loss in the collection from his youth (Veinte poemas de amor y una cancion desesperada). Though that, too, is well worth reading.I don't know if the poems in this volume are available in translation, but I hope that they are.

Here's a short list:* Despite its 200-page length, it's virtually devoid of information. There's a plethora of generic, meaningless, illustrations which help to take up space, but add nothing whatsoever. Examples: page 78, woodcuts of ""mujeres chilenas"" in quasi-national garb; page 73, drawing of generic pirate ships; page 66, peasants using wooden ploughs; page 67, a generic grain mill; page 117, drawing of a gentleman in the costume of the era; page 124 drawing of an impoverished peasant; page 114, a ball in the governor's palace; page 93, woodcut of the ""building of the tribunal of the consulate"", page 58, daily life under the conquistadors. Any of these freaking illustrations could be inserted into the history of any 'brief history"" of any Latin American country and nobody would be any the wiser.* Such text as there is in the book has the texture of cotton wool. Cliche follows platitude follows cliche follows platitude. After a couple pages, you have to stop, because you can actually feel your brain rotting inside your head.* that spineless quality, alluded to earlier. the fall of the government of Allende is dispatched in less than a paragraph. the atrocities that followed under Pinochet get fewer than 3 lines, including the desultory observation that ""more than 3000"" people died.

It's a simple cautionary tale - Maisie, a kitten with decidedly tomboyish qualities (she might even be a feline  hoyden ) - falls out of a tree trying to retrieve a ball. The book describes her subsequent encounter with the dreaded British National Health Service, personified by Dr McGregor, Nurse Bunty and Ina the trolley cat. Other dramatis personae include Granny, Mrs McKitty the busybody next door, assorted little kitten friends of Maisie, and various police and firekitties.Aileen Paterson makes a valiant effort to camouflage the pure evil that is socialized medicine with her jolly drawings and positively skewed presentation of Maisie's ordeal. The attentive reader will not be fooled, however, and will not fail to notice how the author, through a deliberate blurring of the timeline, finesses such questions as just how long Maisie had to wait for that X-ray. There are other, subtler, indications of trouble: the Cheshire-cat grins of every feline in every picture strongly suggest that Nurse Bunty has been raiding the pharmacy yet again. Why is there a monkey on the loose in the hospital wards? And what of Maisie's parents? We are told that her Daddy is ""exploring in Africa"". But her mother receives nary a mention.More seriously, my only quibble with this very charming cautionary tale is that it may not be cautionary enough. The entire hospital visit is presented as such a delightful experience that any kitten reading it is likely to hurl herself from the nearest tree in order to duplicate it. I understand the desire to assuage children's potential fears about having to spend time in hospital. But is it really wise to portray a hospital stay as being as much fun as a trip to Disneyworld?

An invitation to his former girl friend's wedding pushes Pete Tarslow into an existential funk. He convinces himself that the only way to avoid losing face at the wedding is to become a bestselling author. Based on his examination of the NY Times bestseller lists, he develops a set of rules for writing a blockbuster novel. A few examples illustrate their tongue-in-cheek nature: Rule 1. Abandon truth.Rule 2. Write a popular book. Don't waste energy trying to make it good. Rule 7. Prose should be lyrical.Rule 9. At dull points include descriptions of delicious meals.Rule 15. Must have obscure exotic locations. The first half of the book is given over to Pete's development process for his masterwork, and is by far the best part. Particular highlights include Hely's wickedly imagined fake New York Times bestseller list: http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages...The descriptions of his process are just as brilliantly on-target:I took out the folded best-seller list from my pocket, this time looking at non-fiction. Anything people liked. I started writing.  World War II. Football. America. The afterlife. Wise lessons learned. Food again. Sex. People accused of crimes they didn't commit. Pursuits. Las Vegas. Natural disasters - earthquakes, tornadoes etc. Gentle humor. Wise old people telling stories. Bargains. Hobos. Bounty hunters. Christmas.  From his outline to ""The Tornado Ashes Club"":  As they dodge bounty hunters, we hear the tale that brought them together, a story of lost love that begins in the hobo camps of the Depression and on mud-stained college football fields, crisscrossing through the fury of World War II France to the islands of the Mediterranean and the kitchens and vineyards of Peru, a saga whose heartbreaking but uplifting end can only come in the swirl of a tornado, sweeping across the milkweed and the bluestem of the prairie on a Christmas morning. Through a series of serendipitous coincidences, ""The Tornado Ashes Club"" actually achieves the blockbuster status Pete has dreamed of. The second half of the book describes what happens next. Although Hely has some fun with the arc of success and decline - set pieces on book fair panel discussions, the Hollywood screen treatment, the seriously high-minded writers' workshop, the high-profile TV interview meltdown, public excoriation in the blogosphere - he doesn't quite match the savage wit of the first half, so that the book coasts to a somewhat perfunctory conclusion. In a previous life, Hely was a writer for David Letterman and Fox's ""American Dad"" series. His novel displays similar strengths and weaknesses to the humor of those shows -- a series of often very clever, funny premises for which the development is somewhat perfunctory, almost as if, after setting up his various gags, the author loses interest. The book is a little bloated at over 300 pages. But the first half contains enough hysterically funny material to justify your giving it a whirl. ...more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,not set,"Jul 22, 2009","Jul 22, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6013046-how-i-became-a-famous-novelist

In the goodreads universe, where everyone else lives, this is apparently a much loved and lauded book. Heck, those good folks at the New York Review of Books tell us it's a classic. And has this to say about the main protagonist:  William Stoner emerges from it not only as an archetypal American, but as an unlikely existential hero, standing, like a figure in a painting by Edward Hopper, in stark relief against an unforgiving world I'm sorry, but that's just a crock, even allowing for er hyperbole. The very best that you could manage to say about Stoner is that he's a wraithlike nebbish who manages to glide through this dismal story without leaving an impression on anyone, least of all the reader. People seem to admire John Edward Williams's writing. The thing that baffled me is how any author can use so many words to write about a character and end up describing someone who is utterly devoid of a single distinguishing trait, or even a semblance of a personality. Stoner is a stick figure who, over the course of the book, gets to interact with other stick figures (the resentful wife, the condescending academic colleagues, the college friend with a lust for life who gets mowed down before his prime in the Great War, etc etc ad bloody nauseam) as they act out standard plot #24*. Now I know the number of plots is finite, so it might seem unjust to fault an author for serving up the same story yet again. Fair enough. But it's considered good sport to mess with the template a little bit, to inject one's own authorial ""spark"", to add *something* to make the story rise above the generic template. Maybe you take the A.J. Cronin slant and stir in a little rage against the system. Or you might just add a big ladleful of chicken soup for the soul and give the story a Mr Chips vibe. What you can't do, and hope to keep the reader's interest and sympathy, is just trot out the bare-bones generic version of the tale, with no embellishment**. But this is exactly what Williams has done here. What's the point? I wasn't looking for much. Hell, I'd have settled for the odd chunk of snappy dialog. A sense of humor. Anything at all, really. But even the most basic dialog seems to exceed Williams's capacity, and decent characterization eludes him completely.Anyway, the bottom line is that, in my universe, this book was bleak, predictable, excruciatingly dull. Like one of those dreadful Thomas Hardy books where everyone is miserable all the time, but without the local color. One star, maximum. Though it isn't quite dreadful enough to earn a slot on the ""intellectual con artist at work"" shelf.(Story #24: Intelligent {farmboy/kid from slums/juvenile delinquent/will be played by Matt Damon in the movie} transcends hardscrabble background to be first in the family to attend college. Lurches into an unfulfilling marriage that ends up making everyone miserable, teaches college, is left wondering if that's all there is. Alienation everywhere you look.)**:Several authors have written intelligently within the framework of the ""academic novel"" (Francine Prose, Jane Smiley, James Hynes, Kingsley Amis, among others), even managing to be funny. But those are authors with, you know, discernible intelligence, an affliction which John Edward Williams has apparently been spared.I just read David K's excellent  and realize that I am a hero, albeit a ""Master and Margarita""-loving hero.

Like a particularly contagious strain of bird flu, it spread like wildfire – 4During my junior year the bridge virus infected our entire high school. Like a particularly contagious strain of bird flu, it spread like wildfire – 400 students, living in close quarters with lots of free time on their hands was the perfect niche. My regular partner was a guy called Seamus, now a practicing doctor in Bailieboro, County Cavan (the home of Henry James’s ancestors). I can still remember the particular hand he played that lost us the Christmas tournament – failure to make a small slam in hearts, by one trick, doubled and vulnerable. And I can still recall the murderous rage that his mistake provoked, as if it happened only yesterday. But hey, at least I wasn’t married to the guy.Murderous rage provoked by a partner’s mistake at bridge is one of two themes explored in Gary M. Pomerantz’s latest non-fiction effort, “The Devil’s Tickets”. By the end of the 1920s contract bridge had taken the U.S. by storm. Marriage, already a beleaguered institution, now had one more potential stress factor to contend with – the insidious deterioration in mutual respect that can result when spouses turn out to be bridge partners with greatly differing levels of ability. On a September evening in 1929 in Kansas City, Missouri, the marriage of Jack and Myrtle Bennett did not survive the strain: a heated altercation that broke out when Myrtle became infuriated by a blunder Jack made during play led to him slapping her before their guests and ended with Jack at the receiving end of two fatal shots. Not surprisingly, the “bridge murder” became a national cause celebre, and roughly half of “The Devil’s Tickets” is given over to Pomerantz’s account of events leading up to the “fatal hand”, and the trial that followed. At this point, you can almost see the gears turning in the author’s head. He figures out (correctly) that the Kansas City murder alone is too slight to peg an entire book on. (One can only wish that someone had warned him that trial narratives are notoriously tricky, almost always ending up dull and uninspired, a trap that Pomerantz doesn’t manage to avoid.)So he decides to add a second storyline, also revolving around a married couple – the famous bridge partnership of Josephine and Ely Culbertson. He tracks their rise to fame as bridge’s pre-eminent couple, Ely’s obsessive quest to prove his bidding method superior to all others, and to obtain complete domination in the area of teaching methods and punditry. This story also has a famous bridge game at its center – more specifically, a 5-week challenge tournament in which Ely and Jo took on (and trounced) the best of the bridge establishment, thereby sealing dominance of the Culbertson “brand”. Sadly, attaining the summit came at the cost of their marriage – Ely’s never-ending pathological need for adulation and ever-more outrageous delusions of grandeur proved too much for Jo, who began to develop a serious drinking problem. They divorced in 1937.Pomerantz’s account of these two couple’s stories is workmanlike, but no more than that. As I already mentioned, he is not successful in making the trial scenes interesting. Spreading the trial account over three separate chapters, with other material interspersed, seems like nothing more than a desperate attempt to generate some fake suspense. Gossipy digressions about the private life of the defending attorney add nothing to the overall story and are little more than padding. At about the three-quarter mark in the book I thought I had it figured – a somewhat pedestrian, but not completely uninteresting, account, organized around a central conceit that didn’t quite gel. But then things took a distinct turn for the worse, dropping the author several notches in my esteem. The final 50 pages of the book are given over to what the author grandiosely terms “The Search”, in which he takes it upon himself to track down what he appears to consider loose ends. In the process, he sheds any semblance of objective reporting and makes it clear that he has no qualms about violating the privacy of the dead, or engaging in posthumous speculation on the motives of those who can no longer speak for themselves. Thus, for instance, it takes no more than a walk through the apartment where Bennett died to inspire the following:“Now, walking through the apartment, I see and feel and know that Byrd Rice’s story about the explosive moment is the way it must have happened” (there follows a detailed two-page account of ‘events’, presented as truth, despite being nothing more than a highly selective interpretation of the evidence). This is the “appeal to divine revelation as source of reportorial authority” gambit, which Pomerantz appears to consider sufficient to overturn the trial decision and declare his own guilty verdict on Myrtle. Given this willingness to leap to judgement, I found his rummaging through the details of her life for the remaining 61 years after she was found not guilty by the jury, including poking into the details of her will and cheap speculation as to her motives, distinctly unsavory. What should one make, for instance, of the author’s obvious relish at tracking down, years after Myrtle’s death, one of her co-workers at New York’s Carlyle Hotel, a man who had worked with her for fifteen years without knowing her past, then feeding the man file folders with every salacious headline about the 70-year old scandal. It is obvious that Michael O’ Connell, the co-worker in question, did not appreciate this revealing of information that his friend had wanted to keep confidential. Truth is an elusive commodity, and expecting to find it in a work of non-fiction is probably the height of naivete. In the unsavory final section of this book, Gary M. Pomerantz reveals himself as a writer whose every sentence should be taken with a very large grain of salt. Though intermittently entertaining, this book left a very bad taste in my mouth. Give it a miss. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Jul 18, 2009","Jul 14, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6294655-the-devil-s-tickets

Use of the product near an open flame is a distinct fire hazard and is contraindicated. My experience with this product suggests that repurposing it as a sleep aid, for subjects with mild to moderate insomnia, represents a practical option well worth considering. Viewed as a potential remedy for subjects experiencing insomnia, the risk-benefit ratio is quite favorable. If you have difficulties falling asleep, and worry about Ambien-induced ""sleep-snacking"", ""sleep-driving"" or - God forbid - ""abnormal thinking"", or the addictive potential of benzodiazepines, you might want to consider ""Names on the Land"" as an inexpensive, safe, surprisingly effective alternative.

He was a master of particularly inventive research: for instance, he devised the experimental method to investigate path lengths in social networks, establishing what is variously referred to as the ""small world"" effect, the Kevin Bacon effect, or ""six degrees of separation"". He will always be remembered, however, as the man who conducted the “obedience studies”, a controversial series of tests performed at Yale in the early 1960s. These experiments investigated the degree to which people could be persuaded to obey an authority figure who instructed them to perform cruel acts that conflicted with their personal conscience. The experiments were highly controversial, partly because of ethical questions raised by the study protocol, partly because the results were completely at variance with what psychologists had predicted. The view of human behavior that emerges from the results of Milgram’s experiments is thoroughly depressing. As Milgram puts it, With numbing regularity, good people were seen to knuckle under to the demands of authority and perform actions that were callous and severe. It seems that obedience to authority is hardwired very strongly into the human psyche, so strongly that in many cases it overrides the normal restraints that prevent us from lapsing into barbarism. This conclusion and the experiments that supported it were harshly criticized when Milgram’s results first appeared. Subsequent work, such as Philip Zimbardo’s infamous Stanford prisoner study, and events such as the My Lai massacre, or the abuse of prisoners at Abu Ghraeb, has corroborated Milgram’s conclusions many times over, and has shown that they appear to remain invariant across different countries and cultures. The (very thin) silver lining is that, even as the participants in Milgram’s studies were demonstrating their repeated willingness to submit helpless strangers to (what they believed to be) near lethal electric shocks, they were doing so out of an exaggerated respect for “authority” and not, for example, because of some inherent latent streak of depravity that made them want to hurt the experimental subject. [image]Milgram Obedience Experiments ""Victim""In the book, Milgram gives an impressively clear account of the experimental objectives and procedures. For each of the 18 experiments in the series, main summary results are presented. Milgram includes summaries of subjects’ prediction of their own behavior – the enormous discrepancy between predicted and actual behavior is one of the most interesting aspects of these studies. Roughly 700 to 800 subjects participated in total (roughly 40 per experiment) – the vast majority were male, though one of the later protocols enrolled women only (women’s and men’s results were essentially similar). Individual narratives (transcripts of a subject’s comments during the experimental session) are included for about a dozen participants. Final chapters of the book are given over to Milgram’s interpretation of the results. He also addresses some of the criticisms that were leveled against the experiments (the book was written ten years after completion of the research). My edition contains an introduction by Philip Zimbardo, author of the Stanford Prison experiment, written in 2009. This is an extremely well-written account of an important series of experiments. The results are simultaneously engrossing and horrifying. ...more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,not set,"Jul 10, 2009","Jul 10, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/821562.Obedience_to_Authority

I'm glad I did. I wasn't expecting to learn anything new, necessarily, but neither was I expecting a book as funny and engaging as this turned out to be. The Brafman brothers are whip smart, enthusiastic guides on this brilliant overview of recent research in behavioral science. As far as I can tell, throughout the book they are engaged in summarizing results of other people’s investigations (unlike Ariely or Sunstein & Cass, who are often reporting on their own, or colleagues’, work). They do it very well – clearly, succinctly, and with great examples. The book doesn’t discuss ways to trigger more honest behavior, as Ariely did in “Predictably Irrational”, neither does it contain the kind of discussion of implications for sensible public policy that was such a strength of “Nudge”. It does, however, provide a very lucid discussion of pitfalls to avoid in group decision-making.My favorite story in the book has to be that of the French “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire” audience who were apparently so disgusted by the contestant’s inability to answer the question “What revolves around the earth?” that they figured he deserved to be booted, so that 56% gave the answer “the sun”. It worked. Hapless Henri took the bait and was kicked off. (Russian audiences are apparently the worst on WWTBAM; regularly providing the wrong answer when polled. There is speculation that this stems from a broadly held Russian view that anyone trying to get ahead by amassing great personal wealth is, by definition, behaving anti-socially, and thus deserves to be cut down to size (the tall poppy syndrome at work)).An interesting and well-executed book....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Jul 07, 2009","Jul 07, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6552878-sway

It’s labeled “authors I really should read more of”, and it is – as you might imagine – gigantic. There’s a philosophy corner, where Plato, Kant, and Wittgenstein, among others, are engaged in a bull session for the ages. A.S. Byatt, and Grace Paley share a shelf with Turgenev, Chekhov, and Gogol, right next door to China Mieville, Roberto Bolano, Haruki Nurakami and Salman Rushdie. Up on one of the higher shelves there’s the Nobel niche – Nadine Gordimer, Doris Lessing, Iris Murdoch, Octavio Paz are hanging out with Saul Bellow and Isaac Bashevis Singer. Becket has a spot there, but he usually prefers the French quarter, boozing it up with Balzac, Rabelais, Dumas, Hugo, and Colette. And that’s not even the half of it.Let's be clear. This is a virtual bookcase. It exists only in my mind. Which is a good thing - because it's so completely chock-a-block that, if it existed physically, it would immediately collapse under its own weight. Even thinking about it triggers all kinds of guilt-related synapses. How can I consider myself a true reader when I haven’t read Rabelais? When my acquaintance with Dumas and Hugo is based solely on Saturday morning cartoons and heartwarming Broadway musicals? All the hip kids have read Bolano – why haven’t I?Sporadically, as some kind of vague gesture in the fight against entropy, I try to tidy things up a little by removing a few authors. This requires me to actually read at least one work by the authors in question, to determine whether they merit transfer to the “authors I want to read more of” shelf or get consigned to the “a little goes a long way” depository. Last month, against all expectations, Henry James made the transition from the “should read more” to the “want to read more” shelf, on the basis of “The Ambassadors”.At the weekend, I came across a bargain copy of “Mrs Dalloway”, so I figured it was time to give Virginia Woolf a try. I’d tried “To the Lighthouse” a few times, but never managed to get through it. I’m glad to report that “Mrs Dalloway” was a treat from start to finish – I loved this book. Which is a little unusual, because normally I tend to prefer novels where the plotting is strong, and there is no plot to speak of in “Mrs D”. It was written in 1924, just two years after the publication of “Ulysses”. Joyce may have been the first to use stream-of-consciousness, but it’s hard to argue that he did so successfully – large chunks of Ulysses are essentially unreadable, and for much of the book he seems primarily concerned with showing off his own cleverness. In “Mrs Dalloway”, Woolf gets stream-of-consciousness right. In a deliberate break from established literary tradition, the structure of the book is unorthodox. The action is minimal: the book simply tracks the progress of the main characters across a single day in post World War I London. The narrative changes point of view continuously throughout the book, presenting the different characters’ thoughts and reactions. What amazed me about the book is its richness – though it seems as if we learn very little about a given character in any particular episode in the story, by the end we realize that Woolf’s characterization is brilliant. None of the main characters in the story is particularly likeable, but they are all completely credible and vividly realized. I’m not sure how exactly Woolf pulls this off – some kind of combination of presenting just the salient detail and inviting the reader inside the characters’ heads. Maybe it’s just alchemy. But she certainly manages to make the (often mundane) details of the characters’ lives interesting. The other aspect of the book that delighted me was the writing. Although the “stream-of-consciousness” narrative entails occasionally complex sentence structure, it’s fairly easy to read, and there are many passages that are simply terrific. I’m really not explaining this very coherently. I don’t really know why I liked “Mrs Dalloway” as much as I did. I’ve never read anything else quite like it. In the end, maybe that’s reason enough for you to consider giving it a shot. ...more",Notes are private!,-1,24,1,not set,"Jul 09, 2009","Jul 05, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/46749.Mrs_Dalloway

Several characters appear in multiple stories; the title character appears in almost every one. If Lake Wobegon moved to Maine, this collection might be the result. But I can’t find it in myself to hate “Olive Kittredge”, which has the same goofy charm as Garrison Keillor’s Lake Wobegon stories, and some of the same flaws as well. Each story seems to come with an obligatory minor-key epiphany. Elizabeth Strout doesn’t completely avoid the sentimentality trap, but there is a welcome tartness to most of the stories. Olive, a seventh grade math teacher, is distinctly curmudgeonly and doesn’t suffer fools gladly, which helps keep her entertaining. Trapped in conversation at a neighbor’s funeral, “Olive has to actually look at the wall and roll her eyes because of how stupid this woman can be”. She is a woman who needs to feel her life is in control, an illusion that is harder to maintain as middle age takes its toll.

Mrs D. has no plot to speak of -- its virtues are in the characterization and the writing. The Scarlet Pimpernel is the direct opposite - its whole point is the plot. The characters are more or less your generic swashbuckling regulars, and the writing ranges from tolerable to truly atrocious.But perhaps it's a little unfair to burden ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" with exalted literary pretensions. First and foremost, it's an adventure story. And a damned good one. The Baroness can't be faulted for her handling of the plot - it's hard to see how it could be improved. Great setup, excellent pacing, satisfying ending.Now, a picky, caviling person might be tempted to find fault with certain aspects of the telling of the story - the unremitting evil of the satanic bad guy, the unbridled nobility of all those British gents, all those revolutionary froggies spouting ""Sacres aristos!"", with their British counterparts expostulating ""Zounds!"" and ""Odd's life!"" in every other line of dialog. Others might complain about this, but I don't. See, for this kind of story, I like my villains villainy. I lap up the cliched historical detail. If there hadn't been a scene with coarse Parisian proles knitting at the guillotine, I'd have felt cheated. And any swashbuckling aristocrat story worth its salt had better have some nobleman whose last name begins with ff. So I enjoyed these aspects of the book just fine.So I'd only have two gentle criticisms for the Baroness:Was it absolutely necessary to name the doddering Jewish character  Reuben Goldstein ?

If this book doesn't win this year, you are dead to me, you hear?I've said it elsewhere on this site, but it bears repeating. Colm Toibin is a genius. This is a man who has, on various occasions brought me inside the heads of:•	a gay man in Ireland suffering from AIDS and the women in his family (""The Blackwater Lightship"")•	a compromised Argentine English teacher exploring his sexuality in the time of the fall of the military junta (“The Story of the night”)•	Henry James in his middle years (“The Master”)•	an IRA gunman turned art thief (“Mothers and Sons”)•	an Irish high court judge (“The Heather Blazing”)•	and, most recently, Eilis Lacey, the stunningly ordinary, but completely unforgettable, heroine of “Brooklyn”, his latest novel.Where does Toibin’s particular genius lie? Well, there’s the writing, of course. Which is remarkable for being so completely unremarkable. If that seems like a backhanded compliment, let me assure you that it is meant as quite the reverse. I think it takes a phenomenal talent (and a certain gutsy confidence in one’s own talent, which the author most definitely has, and just as definitely has earned) to write as unobtrusively as Toibin does. Nothing in his style draws attention to himself as author. Instead, time after time, he finds the right voice, so that the writing flows in a completely natural way, without a word in the wrong place.How does he do this? The answer brings us close to the scary heart of his genius, I think. It’s because Toibin lets his characters take over in a way that few other authors manage to do. He becomes them, he channels them. To say they are “fully realized”, “deftly drawn”, that they “come to life on the page” – whatever er’s cliché comes to mind – doesn’t even begin to do him justice. Empathy is surely one of the qualities we expect from any great novelist, and Toibin does empathy like no other modern writer I know. I find his ability to inhabit his characters both fascinating and scary. It scares me because it so exceeds my own powers of imagination. No matter what, or when, I write, I can never get away from being me, a very particular individual, with my own very specific 52-year old history. It’s probably why I have never understood the fascination of online role-playing games, or the ability of others to fabricate alternate online personae – no matter the forum, with me it’s pretty much WYSIWYG all the way.But it’s one of the reasons I prefer fiction to non-fiction – if only vicariously, I find that truly good fiction has the power to take me out of myself, and to stretch my capacity for empathy, even if it’s only briefly. In his novels, Colm Toibin does this over and over again. I imagine it as being a wholly draining experience for him. But as a reader, my admiration for him is boundless. I’d like to close this  by offering my congratulations on his upcoming receipt of this year’s Booker prize*.

Packs of werewolves roaming the canyons and arroyos. It's enough to make any catlover nervous.In this awesome, exuberant, first book Toby Barlow strips away the city's thin veneer of civilization and lays bare its raw, violent, lycanthropic underbelly. It's the cross-species love story between dogcatcher Anthony and his damaged werewolf lover, which unfolds against a backdrop of drugs, murder, revenge, and the battle for pack dominance. It's noir, funny, riveting, tender, completely over the top, and by rights it shouldn't work at all. But it does - it's completely addictive and unexpectedly moving. Part of its power is a consequence of Barlow's choice to write it in free verse. The resulting rhythm give the whole story a driving momentum that keeps the reader riveted -- I read the whole book in two sittings. The plot, which seemed inextricably complicated at the halfway mark, is resolved neatly by the end, though I do feel that I need to give the book a second reading to figure out the various strands. Another er made the perceptive comment that the sheer momentum built up by Barlow's writing works against a careful reading, so I anticipate that a second reading will bring further rewards. Depending on how my second reading goes, I may yet have to give this most excellent book a fifth star. If you have time for only one lycanthropic love story this summer, then look no farther than ""Sharp Teeth"".

But that shouldn't stop you from getting your own physical copy. Nothing can rival the joy of browsing through it - you're bound to learn something fascinating along the way. As Terry Pratchett says in the Foreword, it's a storehouse of ""little parcels of serendipitous information of a kind that are perhaps of no immediate use, but which are, nevertheless very good for the brain.""First published in 1870, Brewer's has flourished for over a century. It has always been the reference book that ""reaches the parts others cannot"", the option you try if what you are looking for is not in a standard dictionary or encyclopedia. Even if you don't find what you're looking for, chances are you'll uncover something even more interesting. The fact that it has reached its 17th edition (published in 2005) suggests that it clearly meets a need, even if its exact scope can be hard to pin down precisely. Certainly, one need look no further with a question about ‘traditional’ myths and legends – from the Erymanthian boar to the Swan of Tuonela, from Aarvak and the Abbasids to zombies and Zoroastrians, they’re all covered. The latest edition updates the mythical pantheon to include such creatures as the Balrog and Nazgûl, Voldemort and Dumbledore, the Psammead and Zaphod Beeblebrox, to name only a few.This edition incorporates many new features to tempt the reader -- a listing of idioms from Spanish, French, and German, first lines in fiction, assorted sayings attributed to Sam Goldwyn, curious place names in Great Britain and Ireland, the dogs, horses, and last words of various historical and fictional figures. So, while looking for information on freemasonry, you may find yourself diverted to learn that French people don’t dress to the nines – instead they put on their thirty-one, perhaps in preparation for a bout of window pane licking (window shopping). And if that femme fatale you met last night stands you up this evening, it may be that she has other cats to whip. Or it could be that she has received a messenger from Rome (who might be called Aunt Flo by an English speaker). But as always, it’s the weird tidbits, stumbled across by sheer accident, that are the real delight. For instance, I could certainly have gotten through my entire life without knowing about the  blue men of the Minch . But knowing that they are legendary beings who haunt the Minches (the channels separating the Outer Hebrides from the rest of Scotland), occasionally bothering sailors, enriches my life. The added information that they are either kelpies or fallen angels, and are reputed to drag mariners to the bottom of the sea if they fail to answer questions in rhyming couplets (in Gaelic, naturally), fills me with unutterable glee.As do most of the entries in this terrific reference book....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,"Jul 05, 2009","Jul 05, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/21338.Brewer_s_Dictionary_of_Phrase_and_Fable

Interestingly, it is Cortazar who takes top place in the hearts of modern Argentines. They will tell you that it is he, not Borges, who writes about the regular 'man on the street', that he was the more politically engaged (the fact that Borges was born, and died, in Switzerland will be mentioned, with the implication that Borges did not concern himself with Argentina's domestic political turmoil), and that Cortazar's writing is infinitely more accessible than the cerebral musings of Borges. These are strongly held beliefs (I've had the experience of being chastised by the friendly local waiter at my local Italian restaurant in Buenos Aires for reading Borges - in his view I would have done much better with Cortazar) which have almost no basis in fact. Much of Cortazar's writing has a slanginess about it that makes it far less accessible than the relatively straightforward language of Borges. Furthermore, it is Cortazar, not Borges, who spent the great majority of his writing life living outside of Argentina (in France). And the preoccupation with parallel (often magical) universes that is the hallmark of Cortazar's short fiction surely makes the descriptor ""cerebral"" as appropriate to his writing as to that of Borges. The only explanation I have for the emotional preference Argentines profess for Cortazar is that he doesn't keep himself at quite the same distance from his protagonists as Borges does. But the whole comparison is insidious to begin with. It's not a question of 'should I read Borges or Cortazar'? The answer is - you should read both. Each is rewarding in his own way. This collection, the first of three volumes of Cortazar's complete short stories, is an excellent introduction. It contains many of his best-known stories: ""Axolotl"", ""La noche boca arriba"", ""Casa tomada"", ""Continuidad de los parques"", ""Las babas del diablo"" (Blow-up). Most of these stories tread the line between the ""normal"" world and a darker universe of Cortazar's imagination -- there is a signature twist which leaves the reader uneasy.

It creeped me out then, and it still creeps me out. As in many of Cortazar's stories, it revolves around the idea that the protagonist simultaneously inhabits two parallel realities, that beyond the ""normal events"" being described lies a far more terrible world ready to engulf the protagonist (for instance, the obsidian knife of the Aztec executioner-priest). Or there's the opening paragraph of ""axolotl"": There was a time when I thought a great deal about the axolotls. I went to see them in the aquarium at the jardin des Plantes and stayed for hours watching them, observing their immobility, their faint movements. Now I am an axolotl. Time and again in this collection of brilliantly original short stories, Cortazar pulls the rug out from under the reader.

A man sits in his study, reading a murder mystery in which he himself is the victim.

On the cover blurb Daniel Gilbert (""Stumbling on happiness"") invites us to ""find out what the best minds of the new generation are thinking before the Nobel Committee does"". Let's be clear upfront - this book is not going to help you to do that. Fair enough - this wouldn't be the first book that fails to live up to its jacket-cover hype.To understand why it doesn't, it is useful to consider Max Brockman's credentials: ""Max Brockman is a literary agent at Brockman Inc., which represents Jared Diamond, Nassem Taleb, Richard Dawkins, and Steven Pinker, among others"". So Max is well-connected, but he is not a scientist. And it shows. This is an odd collection of pieces, with an unclear selection criterion, but one which yields oddly unsatisfactory results. With fully two thirds of the eighteen articles in the collection devoted to some aspect of neuroscience (one article deals with climate change, two with cosmology, three with evolutionary biology), the generality implied by the title ""Dispatches on the Future of Science"" is seen to be a gross over-reach.If we adjust expectations accordingly and simply judge the book as a collection of essays on ground-breaking topics in recent neuroscientific research, results are mixed, at best. My ratings of the various chapters follows. (My background is that of someone with some knowledge of biology and enough curiosity on these matters to make me a regular reader of ""New Scientist"" magazine, and the NYT weekly Science Times section)Christian Keysers: Mirror Neurons: are we Ethical by Nature? A well-written coherent account, but recent developments suggest it is already outdated.Nick Bostrom : How to Enhance Human BeingsAn almost wilfully obtuse discussion of the important question ""to what extent can therapeutic interventions be expected to overcome Mother Nature"", that is, why should we expect any proposed intervention to ""do better than"" evolution? Bostrom's discussion is meandering, unfocused, and unhelpful.Sarah-Jayne Blakemore: Development of the Social Brain in AdolescenceImaging shows that the brain continues to develop through adolescence. Yawn. Surely the surprise would be only if imaging didn't show this.Jason P. Mitchell : Watching Minds InteractImaging shows that there are specific areas of the brain dedicated to social interactions. Big yawn. Does this come as a surprise to anybody?Matthew D. Lieberman : What makes big ideas sticky?A clear, thought-provoking discussion of the thesis that ""Big Ideas are influential and enduring because they fit with the structure and function of the human brain"".Joshua D. Greene : Fruit flies of the moral mind.A discussion of the organization of the human brain along moral and cognitive dimensions that is at best, adequate, and certainly breaks no new ground.Lera Boroditsky : How does our language shape the way we think?This was, for me, the best essay in the book - a fascinating and lucid account of work by the author and colleagues that addresses the extent to which language shapes thought (the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis).Sam Cooke : Memory Enhancement, Memory Erasure.This """" of the process of memory formation was incoherent, ignored important research on the placement of ""false memory"" and had a Huxleyan focus on possible pharmaceutical intervention that was downright creepy. Deena Skolnick Weisberg : The Vital Importance of Imagination.In a remarkable statement of the obvious, Dr Weisberg tells us that our ability to entertain ""what if?"" questions is central to what makes us human. Someone should alert the media!David M. Eagleman : Brain TimeOn a first reading, it seems as if David Eagleman has some fresh insights to offer on how the brain perceives time. A closer reading reveals the essay to be nothing more than a tease.Vanessa Woods & Brian Hare : Out of Our Minds. How did Homo sapiens come down from the trees and why did no one follow? The title poses an interesting question, to which the authors come nowhere near to providing an answer. Their musings about bonobos, chimps, dogs, and domesticated silver foxes nonetheless make for interesting reading. Gavin Schmidt : Why hasn't specialization led to the balkanization of science? Schmidt's discussion was interesting and to the point - this was one of the few chapters in the book where I wished for greater detail (the others being those by Matthew Lieberman and Lera Boroditsky).Given that only three of the pieces on neuroscience were of top quality, I'd have to give the benefit of the doubt to the two pieces on cosmology to justify a third star for this decidedly odd collection. As I personally found them incomprehensible from start to finish, I just can't justify that third star.If you are looking for a thought-provoking collection of essays on recent scientific progress, give this one a miss and try the infinitely superior collection by Jerome Groopman instead:http://www.goodreads.com//show/.......more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Jul 04, 2009","Jul 04, 2009",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/6586406-what-s-next

""The Tax Inspector"" falls in the middle of the pack - an enjoyable read, but not his best, in my opinion. Aspects that I thought didn't work all that well included:MINOR SPOILER ALERT (though if you haven't figured out by page 20 that this story is going to end with a bang, you're not paying attention)# Things were just a little too gothic - the rampant dysfunction within the Catchprice family, ranging from the gelignite-toting grandma to the psychopathic 16-year old, Benny, (whose initial meltdown precipitates the havoc that unfolds as the story progresses), is just a little too over the top to carry much of an emotional charge# Why does the deep dark family secret always have to be incest propagated across the generations? # Practically the first thing we're told about Granny Catchprice is that she carries a stick of gelignite in her handbag at all times. Which means, by a simple application of Chekhov's law of the loaded gun, that we know how things will turn out. So where was the suspense?# The whole Sarkis story arc seemed entirely tangential and added little to the overall development# For that matter, the tax inspector character was dull, and the integration of her story (such as it was) with that of the crazy Catchprice clan was kind of clumsyThese criticisms are actually pretty minor. Because, as in his other books, Carey's gift for telling a good yarn, his ability to pull the reader into the eccentric milieu of his characters and make us care about those characters (even the weird ones) more than compensate for minor structural weaknesses. So that this was a very enjoyable read. While I don't think it qualifies for a fourth star, it does make me want to keep reading his stuff.Have I mentioned that Peter Carey has a wicked sense of humor? ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Jun 25, 2009","Jun 24, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1000422.The_Tax_Inspector

Instead of being taught to embrace life in all its infinite variety, the feral, razor-toothed, wolf-child is subjected to a constant stream of negativity and denial from an obviously sadistic disembodied 'authority figure'. 2. Is it not remarkable that there are no other children evident anywhere in this vicious little vignette of cruelty and persecution? Why is this? Well, obviously because Jason, Ethan, Becky and the gang are all hanging out at Jason's crib, watching ""Bob the Builder"" and scarfing down marshmallow 'n ketchup pizza, because Jason's mom is like totally cool, and a future MILF to boot.3. And what is it with the kid's teeth anyway? Even feral children deserve a little time with the orthodontist. The crude, ugly caricature of a wolf-child that the author presents here is a hideous calumny with the potential to cause severe emotional damage to Davids throughout the land.4. It is a complete travesty to think that the single instance of faintly nurturing behavior demonstrated by the Eva Braun authority figure (to someone called ""Davey"") could possibly negate the damage inflicted by the litany of negativity and denial that precede it.The dedication on this woeful screed reads as follows""To Martha, my mother, who kept me in line then,and to Heidi, my wife, who keeps me in line now.""from which it is obvious that David Shannon is a completely pitiful individual, who has obviously embraced his pathetic, whipped existence.BUT, FELLOW WARRIOR-DAVIDS, THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE TO.

When employed as a writer for ""Business Journal"", he amused himself on the side by concocting fake letters to the journal under a variety of pseudonyms; several of these letters are included, most of them embarrassingly sophomoric. It's unclear what point he is trying to make by their inclusion - it seems to be just a rant that other people failed to appreciate his ""satire"". But when the satire is juvenile and heavy-handed, all he manages to do is alienate the reader.And indeed, as I read through the remaining essays in this volume, I kept thinking - what is the point? Why should I give credence to the musings of someone who has gone out of his way to establish his credentials as an unreliable narrator right at the outset? But, in fact, Maliszewski offers precious little insight in his commentary on the various fakes he considers in these essays. The best pieces were those where he simply described particular hoaxes I hadn't been familiar with - the 1835 New York Sun's account of ""moon-creatures"", the ""Francis Drake's fortune"" confidence men. His analysis of recent media scandals - Jayson Blair, Stephen Glass, James Frey and others - is muddled and self-serving. Particularly unappealing is his suggestion, made several times throughout the book, that readers get the con artists they deserve. That is, he appears to want to shift the blame from the deceivers to those who were taken in.In what seems unsurprising for someone with as shaky a moral compass as Maliszewski, the final essay seems nothing more than a desperate attempt to gain notoriety by smearing Michael Chabon.

It's not surprising, therefore, that he doesn't entirely succeed. But he does acquit himself very well in the attempt.

Foster's analyses of the economic and social changes, the beginnings of which he traces back to the 1970s, seem particularly insightful. The writing is generally pretty clear, though it can become a little dense on occasion. In general, he does presuppose a general familiarity with Irish history and politics, so this is not a book for someone looking for a basic primer.

The best parts of this book are where he confinesSteven Johnson, author of the excellent ""The Ghost Map"", here takes on the life of Joseph Priestley. The best parts of this book are where he confines himself to the task at hand, and gives us details of that life. Priestley was a fascinating character, a brilliant chemist and one of the most influential scientists of his age. He was also a practicing clergyman, whose nonconformist views ultimately provoked such a storm in England that he had to flee to America with his family. He was friends with Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams; as a consequence of these friendships, he was to have substantial influence on the development of political thought in the fledgling democracy. Priestley wasn't brilliant all the time, of course - there was his notorious attachment to the phlogiston theory, as well as an unhealthy obsession with the Book of Revelation in the final years of his life. So the details of Priestley's life certainly provide more than adequate material for an interesting account.Indeed, the book is at its most interesting when Johnson confines himself to filling in the biographical record. In particular, his account of the early work (discovery of what would later be termed Coulomb’s Law, publication of the ‘History of Electricity’, invention of soda water) and the two experiments which established Priestley's reputation (the work showing that plants synthesize oxygen, his later ‘discovery’ of oxygen) is excellent. Unfortunately, Johnson then seems to lose his moorings a bit. Understandably, he wants to put Priestley’s scientific contributions in historical perspective. But this leads him to include what can only be called bloviation – ponderous, pseudo-profound musings about paradigm shifts, regrettable metaphors about the nature of scientific progress down the ages, and sentences like these: In the next decade, the three paths would combine to form a mighty highway, one that would ultimately drive Priestley all the way to the New World.Seeing human history as a series of intensifying energy flows is one way around the classic opposition between the Great Men and Collectivist visions of history.What is the internal chemistry of a mob? Tellingly, mob behavior inevitably gravitates toward displays of intense energy transfer: the collective strength of a hundred enraged men pulling a building apart and unleashing the destructive, oxidizing force of combustion. Where are the editors when you need them? Seriously, dude, ease off on the goddamned chemistry metaphors, wouldja? They make you seem like a moron, which you’re not.For a prolonged stretch in its middle third, the book ceases to be mainly about Priestley, degenerating instead into a kind of “look at me, I’m Steven Johnson, see how clever I am” morass. This is unfortunate, because even the most pedestrian of Priestley’s biographical details would be more interesting than Johnson’s views on the nature of scientific progress, which seemed to me to be short on content, long on pomposity. (This actually surprised me, because I’ve heard him interviewed on the radio and he seemed quite sensible and unpretentious).Fortunately, things get back on track (more or less) for the remaining third of the book, describing the rising tide of violence that forced the Priestleys to flee to America and the scientist’s final years in Pennsylvania.Despite the misgivings expressed above, I really enjoyed this book, and have no hesitation in recommending it. But I do hope that Steven Johnson gets himself a better editor on his next project. (I've put this on my ""terrific"" shelf for now, despite reservations about Johnson's style, because Priestley's life was genuinely fascinating) ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Jun 27, 2009","Jun 17, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3688884-the-invention-of-air

For years mine used to be the loathsome paper-clip assistant – it seemed like a perfect symbol of Microsoft’s sneeringly obvious contempt for their users. Eventually, the continuing forced exposure to PowerPoint at my job became an irritant as well. There’d be days when I’d have to suffer through half a dozen PowerPoint presentations by my colleagues.

It wasn’t so much that PowerPoint triggered explosive rage – it was more of an ongoing slow burn.So Professor Tufte’s wicked evisceration of the program in this (very) slim pamphlet definitely struck a chord. Tufte argues that presentations developed using Powerpoint are more likely to suffer the following deficiencies:• Inadequate resolution – not enough detail provided• Important assumptions unstated or ambiguous• Dumbed down content• Complexity of arguments not adequately captured• Data presented in a way that is unhelpful (and often misleading)He supports his argument with three main case studies –• the slide presentation made to NASA officials who had to make important decisions during the final flight of the space shuttle Columbia (infamously, legitimate safety concerns expressed by the engineering group did not survive the PowerPoint treatment, which sanitized them out of existence, with deadly consequences)• what PowerPoint would make of the Gettysburg address • the horror that can result from applying PowerPoint templates for statistical graphics to a straightforward table of relative cancer survival ratesHis obvious relish at pointing out some of the worst excesses of Powerpoint in no way undermines the validity of his objections. Furthermore, as this pamphlet only runs to 28 pages, don’t expect detailed advice on how to do things better.Nonetheless, it is fun to watch him take down PowerPoint.

Six strangers, from“The Ambassadors”, by Henry JamesThis is Daisy Fuentes Miller, reporting to you live from the set of MTV’s “Real World Gay Paree”. Six strangers, from totally different backgrounds, thrown together, forced to live under the merciless glare of the Hankcam, which documents their every move for posterity. Let’s see what happens when the gloves come off, and things get real. Strether: Hi. I’m Strether. I’m engaged to Chad’s mom. She’s pissed at him, and sent me over to bring him back to Connecticut to run the family business. Paree sure seems like an awesome party town.Chad: This is the Chadster. I don’t wanna go back to Connecticut. I’m dating this totally hot older lady. Who’s a countess. She’s been giving me some private life coaching lessons. If you know what I mean.Countess: ‘allo. Zis is Marie. you can call me Countess Cougar. Sacre bleu, but you American boys are fine!Strether: Damn, that countess is one hot MILF. Chad – no rush about going home. We should just hang out here in Paris and par-tay!6 weeks later:Sarah: This is Sarah, Chad’s older sister. What the f*** is going on here? Strether, you’ve been over six weeks already. Mother sent me over. She wants you both to haul ass back to Connecticut, pronto. (You can ignore my fat philistine slob of a husband, Jim. He’s only here to provide a cheap diversion as a lazy stereotype and adds nothing to the plot)Chad: Chill, sis. This is my girlfriend Marie. Ain’t she smokin? Did I mention she’s a countess?Sarah: Filthy French slut! Chad, Mother expects you to do your duty.Strether: Dude, don’t go! It’s a trap. Sarah: You be quiet! And you can forget about marrying Mother. Which means you’ll die lonely and poor. Strether: Bite me. Your mother always was one uptight bitch, anyway. I’ll just stay on here. Maybe catch a little menage-a-trois action with Chad and the Countess. Chad : Not gonna happen, dude! Sis, tell Mom to take the job and shove it. I’m having too much fun tapping aristocratic ass here in Paree. Screw Connecticut.2 weeks later, Strether, alone in the confessional room: So Sarah and Jim are on the way back home, with no hanging Chad. My life is totally screwed up. But at least I can be happy about getting Chad to do the right thing, to avoid the money trap, and to choose life!2 weeks later, Chad, alone in the confessional room, very drunk:You know, I’ve always thought that advertising was where the future is at..... And, there's no two ways about it, Marie's boobs have definitely been showing some major saggage .... Operator! Get me the number for the Cunard line, please.Fade, to the sound of Strether whimpering pathetically, off-camera. (Marie, of course, goes on to star in the breakout Bravo series, “Real Housewives of the 4th arrondissment”).********************************************OK, I'll come clean and admit that I’ve had a definite prejudice against Henry James for as long as I can remember. But reading Colm Toibin’s “The Master” last month made me think I should give him another try. “The Ambassadors” certainly confirmed my belief in the brilliance of Toibin’s accomplishment. It also changed my opinion of James – though I doubt I’ll ever achieve fanboy status, it was a far more interesting read than I had anticipated. In “The Master”, Toibin gives us a portrait of James in mid-career, focusing on the period between 1895 and 1900. It’s eerily well done – it’s almost as if he were channeling the spirit of James. Although Toibin is an avowed fan, his depiction of the author seems scrupulously honest and right on the mark. The picture of Henry that emerges is not entirely flattering – that of someone who is fascinated by the workings of the very privileged segment of society into which he was born, with a keen, almost obsessive, eye for the subtleties and complexities of the relationships among the various players, and the talent, determination (and free time) to document it in his writing. Even if that came at a certain emotional cost. In James’s case, that cost appears to have been an inability (or unwillingness) to form truly deep emotional attachments. There seems to have been a pattern of his withdrawing emotionally whenever another person threatened to come too close. This was a man who lived far too much of his life in his own head.It shows in the writing, of course. Every detail of every character’s action, no matter how minor, is picked apart and analyzed. Characters are presented as being engaged in endless analysis and speculation about how to interpret the actions and motives of others. And if it takes a page and a half to pin down the precise nuance of A’s reaction to a casual snub by B, then so be it – James always assumes that the reader has both the time and interest to stay with him. The odd thing is that, although this can be a little offputting at the beginning, ultimately it becomes kind of hypnotic. He is so clearly fascinated by the inner world of his characters that he ultimately draws you in. The plot of “The Ambassadors” is wafer-thin. But the author’s focus on the psychology of his characters is so intense (and so believable) that one is motivated to keep on reading. This was not a dull book.Much is made of Henry James’s style, and I just don’t get it. This is a man who never met a subordinate clause he didn’t like, with a definite preference for the baroque. Hemingway he’s not. But his penchant for convoluted sentences means that he’s not particularly easy to read. On any given page, there is likely to be at least one sentence that you will have to read three times over, and still not be sure you understand what he was trying to say. (He has a way of nesting negative particles in his various subordinate clauses that is particularly evil – I’d find myself counting them on my fingers, trying to figure things out). Stylistically, the writer he reminds me most of is Thomas Mann, who also had a penchant for long, complicated sentences. At least James wasn’t writing in German, so there is a limit to how convoluted things get. Personally, I don’t consider opacity to be a virtue. YMMV. A book that was far more interesting than I had anticipated, and which definitely changed my mind about Henry James. ...more",Notes are private!,0,51,1,not set,"Jun 29, 2009","Jun 10, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/775366.The_Ambassadors

In the book's preface, Hayes treats us to a display of faux-humility (""Aw shucks, I'm not qualified"") which is striking only for its transparent insincerity. On balance, I'd have to agree with his assessment - it's not clear exactly what his qualifications are. But the word that comes to mind to describe the majority of these essays is 'woolly-headed' - there is a rambling, unfocused quality to them that leaves the reader questioning the time invested in reading them. An exception to this criticism is the essay on the genetic code. Hayes's riff on the problem of mattress-flipping and its link to the Klein 4-group is imaginative and entertaining. Essays on the astronomical clock at Strasbourg and on the kinds of gear problems faced by watchmakers might appeal to some, but my pathological aversion to all things mechanical caused my eyes to glaze over pretty early on. I found Hayes's ruminations on randomness, economics, and ""the statistics of warfare"" particularly weak - neither focused nor rigorous. Essays on the use of base 3, the meaning of identity and issues of nomenclature were coherent but uninspiring. Two superior essays out of twelve seems a little disappointing, which is why I give this collection only two stars.

Initially this book was fairly amusing, but somewhere around the half-way mark its charms began to fade, and by the end it was just plain exhausting. This was certainly not the fault of the author, who was an engaged and enthusiastic tour guide throughout. But ultimately the cumulative craziness of the various language inventors takes its toll. Okrent's tour of the ""land of invented languages"" covers a lot of ground, making five major stops, each of which considers a particular example in depth:John Wilkins's ""philosophical language"" (1668)Ludwik Zamenhof's Esperanto (1887)Charles Bliss's symbolic language, ""Semantography"" (1949)James Cooke Brown's language of logic, ""Loglan"" (1960)Marc Okrand's Klingon (1985)A major strength of the book is Okrent's ability to place each of these particular invented languages within its historical context. She also manages to convey the essential flavor of each language in a style which is not overburdened with linguistic technicalities, and with a refreshing sense of humor throughout. Her tolerance for the sheer weirdness that permeates the various personalities she encounters along the way ultimately exceeds mine. I had a certain grudging admiration for John Wilkins's noble attempt to categorize everything in the universe, as well as for the idealism displayed by proponents of Esperanto. But the monomania of Bliss and Brown, their protracted legal wranglings in defence of their weirdly idosyncratic creations made for depressing reading. And, though I share a certain geekiness where language is concerned, it doesn't really extend far enough to make me find the development of Klingon and the antics of those who ""speak"" it anything other than tedious. So, I think this book would have 5-star appeal only to someone far geekier than I. Nonetheless, it is an impressive and entertaining accomplishment.

You surely got some mad writing skilz. From a technical point of view, the ten stories in this collection are ridiculously impressive (OK, except for that 60-page boxing story which it’s a safe bet that nobody actually finished). That unreliable narrator in “Suicide Watch”, the creepy atmospherics of “The Museum of Dr. Moses” – brilliant execution, I gotta admit.But you know what, Ms Oates? I wouldn’t recommend this collection to my worst enemy. These stories were uniformly ugly, brutal and twisted. They disturbed me, but only because I don’t understand what kind of author would feel the need to write so many of them (well, actually, I do – the same kind of author that is fascinated by the ritualized brutality of boxing). I mean, yeah, the first story where you put yourself so convincingly in the mind of the serial killer – sure, that’s impressive.

Even if he has mortgaged his immortal soul to get results, we the readers are the beneficiaries. At first blush, “You or Someone Like You” didn’t strike me as all that promising. The main protagonist (and first person narrator) is Anne Rosenbaum, an English literature scholar transplanted to southern California, where she shares a life of privilege with husband Howard, a major Hollywood power broker, and their teenage son, Sam. Fiercely intelligent, highly opinionated, emotionally fragile and hyper-articulate, Anne seems almost guaranteed to be annoying. But (I don't know how Chandler does this) she’s not annoying at all, quite the opposite - she’s awesome, and her story is riveting. As the novel progresses, events unfold that threaten her marriage and the well-being of the family. She responds with a steely determination and an unwavering clarity of moral vision that totally kick ass. But the best part is that this is a woman who looks for, and finds, the solution to her crisis through literature. Which she shares with usIn only 300 pages, Chandler Burr explores several fascinating themes – how politics that are too obsessively based on cultural identity can end up perpetuating codified inhumanity, the deep breakdown of an apparently healthy marriage resulting from unresolved issues of personal identity (Sam’s exploration of his Jewish heritage comes to an abrupt end when he is ejected from an ultra-orthodox yeshiva while visiting Israel* – an event which precipitates a complete identity crisis in his father Howard), and the ability to find solace in literature. This may sound kind of hokey, but Burr is an intelligent and subtle writer, and he somehow manages to make it work. The result is an affecting and extremely impressive debut novel.4.5 stars.

But this book - a set of highly idiosyncratic meditations on opera - just bristles with cringe-inducing stereotypes. In particular, his apparent willingness to embrace the 'gay man as ostracized outsider' role is distinctly unappealing. I enjoyed two of the book's seven chapters - Koestenbaum's reflections on ""The Callas Cult"" and the final chapter, in which he singles out moments in opera which he finds particularly affecting, and attempts to explain why. (Though he's not always able to provide a particularly coherent explanation, his passion does shine through, and it's always interesting to hear about other people's favorite opera moments.)I found the remaining five chapters to be a curious melange of the weirdly fetishistic and the worst kind of deconstructive excess. The following excerpt exemplifies these two problems: ""I've always been fascinated by the spindle hole. Everything on the record's face conspires to highlight it: the price circles it; the label and the round window in the protective paper envelope echo its shape....The hole makes no single anatomical allusion. It makes many. It isn't reductively equal, even in the listener's unconscious, to any part of the human body. But it has always spoken to me of the emptiness at the center of a recorded voice and the emptiness at the center of a listener's life and the ambiguities in any sexual body, including a homosexual body, concerning the proper and improper function of orifices.""He goes on, I regret to report, to devote even more space to the contemplation of a record's label, its grooves, the turntable, and a myriad of other objects remotely associated with opera. I'd like to say that his passion for opera shines through, but for the most part I found his ruminations oddly detached. The musings of a collector, and not of a lover of opera. Had he focused more on the music itself, and not the trappings that surround opera, this would have been a better book.

This book just confirms my desire to have Alain de Botton as a friend. What a smart, erudite, witty, unassuming mensch this guy is. With a quirky curiosity that helps him take an interesting perspective on almost any subject he tackles. His previous books shows his willingness to take on quite a variety of topics. but, of all his books that I've read thus far, the subject of work seems particularly well-suited to his particular (and prodigious) talent. The book consists of ten chapters, in each of which the author explores a specific job in depth. The text is augmented throughout with photographs by Richard Baker, about 15 per chapter. These serve as an excellent complement to de Botton's remarks and reinforce one of the book’s major strengths, which is Alain de Botton’s skill for anchoring his exploration of profound questions pertaining to work (what to do with one’s life? how to combine earning money with attaining fulfilment? how to balance career and family obligations?) in intelligently chosen, concrete examples.A listing of the ten chapters gives an idea of the wide-ranging and eclectic nature of his investigation:1.	Cargo Ship Spotting2.	Logistics (including a photo essay which follows the path of a tuna from its capture in a Maldives fishing boat to the supermarket shelf)3.	Biscuit Manufacture4.	Career Counselling5.	Rocket Science6.	Painting7.	Transmission Engineering8.	Accountancy9.	Entrepeneurship10.	AviationThe list fails to convey the charm and subtlety of de Botton’s writing – to appreciate those, you’ll have to read the book yourself. In each chapter there is something to delight – the author’s curiosity will make you think about commonplace things in a new way, and his thoughtfulness and erudition make him a charming tour guide. The chapter on “rocket science”, centred around a trip to French Guiana to report on the launch of a French-made communications satellite commissioned by a Japanese TV station, is a tour de force of nonfiction writing. But de Botton’s particular talent shines through most obviously in those chapters which appear superficially least promising. You think to yourself – how can anyone write about biscuit manufacturing, or accountancy, and be interesting? Then you read the chapters in question, and re-read them, and think – how the hell did he do that?This book is riveting. No  can do it full justice. You really do need to read it yourself.

The specific slang terms that he includes, from sources such as * inhabitants of the Buffieverse (Professor Adams is an acknowledged expert on Slayer slang)* restaurant jargon* stamp-collecting* snowboarding* soccer moms* raver culture* ""hip"" and ""raunch"" cultures* different online social networks are hugely entertaining and are by far the best part of this book. For those who just get a kick out of language, but who have neither a background in linguistics nor any professional involvement, the main attraction of this book will probably lie in these concrete examples (and the author's obvious delight in presenting them). Professor Adams does have his academic career to consider, so the book also contains a certain amount of - how to put this delicately -  less accessible prose  (you know, the kind of headache-inducing bumf that members of the academy seem to feel obliged to cobble together to confuse/intimidate/bore their colleagues and rivals into submission). I've never really been clear about why academic prose is so uniformly impenetrable. Since I am disposed to like Professor Adams, who establishes himself as a genial guide with a good sense of humor in the first two chapters, I will spare everyone the cheap shot of picking out a particularly bad sentence to mock as part of this . Professor Adams has mercifully confined most of the worst academic jargon to the final chapter (roughly the last 40 pages out of 200), and for all I know, if you are steeped in Chomsky's linguistic theories and have a particular interest in cognitive linguistics (heck, if you even know what that is), it might be smooth sailing for you. But it's a safe bet that most people will have tuned out well before they reach that final tormented (and more or less incomprehensible) ""slang as linguistic spandrel"" metaphor.In a way, I felt kind of sorry for Professor Adams, that he felt the need to get all theoretical on us towards the end. At the outset, he appears to set himself a baffling, and completely unnecessary challenge, namely to come up with a definition of ""slang"". Not too surprisingly, he fails to do this in any convincing way, but I think perhaps he was just using the definition challenge as a device around which to structure his thoughts about slang. Other than the Chomsky-fest in the final chapter, the author's general remarks about slang (it represents a deliberate break with established conventions, often with the intent of defining a particular 'in'-group; commonly serves as a vehicle for people to show off their linguistic prowess/indulge their pleasure in language games) don't go beyond anything you hadn't already figured out for yourself. There were two specific points where I just couldn't share the author's enthusiasm (which just seemed endearingly goofy, but weird).Homeric infixing (the reference is to the Simpsons, not the Odyssey), exemplified by ""edumacation"", ""saxamaphone"", or the hideous Flanders variation where the infix is 'diddly', is neither as clever or as fascinating as Professor Adams appears to think. The amount of space devoted to this single linguistic tic was vast, baffling, and lethally boring.The phrase ""how's it going, protozoan?"" might have seemed clever, once, when some member of the author's family coined it at the breakfast table. It is not a phrase that deserves to appear in print more than once. That it appears repeatedly throughout the book, often in conjunction with even more regrettable phrases, such as ""Please don't pout, my sauerkraut"" and ""Don't rock the boat, you billy goat!"" is unfortunate, to say the least. It was as if Teddy Ruxpin had suddenly joined the debate. I was perfectly happy to excuse these lapses, given that the author provided several more entries to add to my list of euphemisms for the specific activity variously known as: bash the bishop, grip the gorilla, paddle the pickle, punish the pope, rub your radish, wave your wand, jerk the gherkin, tickle the pickle, yank the plank, jerk your jewels, gallop the antelope, etc etc etc... Other pleasures included the hundred or more slang terms for ecstasy included in the first chapter, the primer on dating and sex terms used by young soccer moms ('perma-laid', 'flirt buddies', 'coin-slot shot', 'spliff'), slayer slang, and snowboarding jargon. Not to mention learning such necessary urban survival terms as 'bagpiping', 'maple bar', 'lobbin' and 'cherryoke'. That last one is what you lose at your first karaoke performance - the others you'll have to research for yourself. Read this book for the fun examples and Michael Adams's infectious enthusiasm for language. The final 40 pages should be attempted only if you are feeling particularly masochistic....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Apr 27, 2009","Apr 27, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6401641-slang

I will give a longer  in a couple of days, but need to mull it over a bit first.OK: here's the  - ""The Glittering Prizes"" was first published in the mid 1970's and almost immediately made into a highly acclaimed BBC television series. Indeed, there's Tom Conti (the 70's version of Hugh Grant) gazing at me from the front cover, with all of his patented winsome charm, in the lead role of Raphael's semi-autobiographical protagonist, Adam Morris. Reminding me that this book is, first and foremost, a screenplay rather than a novel. And therein, I think, lies its strength and its weakness. When I first read TGP in the late seventies, having seen the BBC series, I had no difficulty with the characters; each seemed fully realized, because - you know - I could visualize each of them quite distinctly, remembering them from the (excellent) TV adaptation. Returning to the book thirty years later, some of its flaws become more problematic. The fact is, not all of the characters are developed in depth - without the crutch of the TV version, some are quite hard to distinguish from one another, and Raphael's habit of giving almost everyone in the book the same brittle, brilliant style of speaking (these are Cambridge graduates, see - so they're all so terribly clever, all of the time, even when taking out the rubbish) makes for entertaining television, but weakens the novel. The story, which has a distinct autobiographical flavor, traces the fortunes of a group of characters who attended Cambridge in the 50's, through the early to mid 70's. A later novel, ""Fame and Fortune"" follows them into the Thatcher years. One of the book's problems is its scope - basically, Raphael introduces us to too many characters in the first couple of chapters, with the result that some receive only perfunctory attention as the screenplay develops. That said, the story arc which focuses on his main character, Adam, is beautifully and affectingly done - despite the glittering dialog, there is genuine depth and substance to the way the character is developed (though one could have wished for a little more time given to his wife, Barbara, who is equally interesting, but receives much less attention from Raphael).There are six sections in the book, each of which basically focuses on a specific year in the characters' lives, each obviously meant to function as a single episode of the TV script. Adam and Barbara get the best of the deal, appearing in three of the six episodes; others fare less well, and make only a cameo appearance following their introduction in the second. But I don't want to niggle too much - a few of the other couples get their due as well, and the storyline involving Dan, the handsome leading man in the Cambridge episode, who deliberately chooses a quiet life and marries Joyce, who has been knocked up by one of the other flashier characters, is brilliantly done. Raphael also carries off some terrific set pieces with enormous verve - the intercutting of the various characters at their final Cambridge ball, the academic dinner party, breathing life into what would be stale clichés in the hands of a less author. All the glittering brilliance might rot one's teeth, and it certainly doesn't hold up quite as well as I remembered it. But Raphael provides enough complexity to his development of the two main couples, Adam & Barbara, and Dan & Joyce, to keep the reader interested and, it must be admitted, his dialog is compulsively readable. I will definitely be interested to read the sequel, though it was much less favorably ed. So, provided you bear in mind that this is primarily a screenplay, rather than a traditional novel, ""The Glittering Prizes"" is well worth your time. (Wikipedia tells us that Raphael was the screenwriter for, among other films, ""Far from the Madding Crowd"" and ""Eyes Wide Shut"")....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Apr 11, 2009","Apr 09, 2009",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1013681.The_Glittering_Prizes

I actually read this in parallel, in the original Spanish, and in the Penguin Classics English translation by J.M. Cohen. Anyone who is interested can follow my tortured progress through Book I at the link below:http://www.goodreads.com//show/...In this , I will attempt a coherent summary of my reaction to Book I, and in the process try to justify my two-star rating.Let me start by saying that I really gave it my best shot. I can't think of another book that I've read as closely. Read it in Spanish AND in English. Even - to keep myself honest - tried summarizing as I went, in deathless doggerel ( QUIK QUIXOTE ). I've spent a month of my life with this book - it's been a mild obsession. Why? Oh, I don't know. Can we ever satisfactorily explain why we choose to give ourselves over to any specific whim? I'm here, in Madrid. I'm studying Spanish at a school that's called ""Don Quijote"". The time just seemed right. And I had a strong feeling that it was going to be now or never. But a coherent summary of my reaction eludes me, frankly. This book alternately amused me and bored me to tears. There are a couple of places where I laughed out loud. But mostly I just wanted it to be over. I wasn't about to quit. But it felt awfully like a penance, much of the time. Some random observations, for which I am forced to resort to the dreaded list of bullet items:1. The Spanish was often more fun to read than the English. Cervantes and Shakespeare were contemporaries (down to the urban legend (?) of having died on the same day). But Spanish has changed considerably less in the intervening 400 years than English. There were enough archaic words that I did feel reading the translation was a necessary check, but it was surprisingly straightforward in Spanish, and - traduttori, tradittori - one felt closer to the original story. So I definitely enjoyed that aspect of reading the book - it felt like a real confirmation that all the Spanish classes have paid off.2. I have a good general understanding of the book's place in literary history, and so was willing to cut it some slack - that is to say, not to judge it as one would a modern novel. That said, I still can't avoid saying that I found it enormously clunky. The first couple of hundred pages were annoyingly episodic and formulaic - addled Don meets (a)windmills (b)yokels (c)sheep (d)funeral mourners - take your pick - is confused, through a  hilarious misunderstanding  (but see point 5 below) attacks them, gets the worst of the dustup, and ends in the ditch. 3. Things improved a little in the second half (of Book I), when some of the protagonists other than Don and Sancho start to appear on a recurring basis. But don't look for in-depth characterization, or much character development to speak of. Cervantes is no Shakespeare. OK. Let me repeat that for the benefit of each and every one of my Spanish teachers, though I love them dearly. People - you are completely fucking delusional! CERVANTES IS NO SHAKESPEARE. When you make this comparison, you just make me want to resort to actual physical violence. I've read Shakespeare and, dudes, CERVANTES IS NO FUCKING SHAKESPEARE. There's more subtlety, insight, and depth of understanding of human nature in almost any single Shakespeare play (OK, ""Titus Andronicus"" is a little weird, but there are still over thirty to choose from) than in this entire first volume. Not to mention a superabundance of the most gorgeous language, though - to be fair - I can't quite fairly judge Cervantes on this score.4. When the plot isn't being all episodic, it's not really any great shakes either. Mick is altogether too heavy-handed with the AMAZING COINCIDENCE method of plot resolution. Man, you wouldn't believe who all happens to mosey on by the same remote Manchegan inn, just in time to tie up a dangling plot thread. I dunno. It all seems more than a little -- lazy. Though I guess (and I feel like I'm really bending over backwards to give Mick the benefit of the doubt here - why is that - in retroactive justification of the time I invested reading this damned book?) maybe I'm applying modern criteria and expectations here. It's not as if all of Shakespeare's plots were entirely plausible either.5. Humor. Ah, yes. One of literature's great comic masterpieces. Well, excuse me, if I fail to climb on this particular bandwagon. I'm sorry, but I just don't get it. Let's be quite clear - the humor, such as it is, is almost exclusively slapstick of the broadest kind. If you like watching circus clowns do pratfalls, or if your dream television weekend is a Three Stooges marathon, then maybe you´ll laugh like a drain. But if you don't really find slapstick all that hilarious, or take vicarious pleasure in taunting and jeering at a deranged person, you will, as I was, wonder what all the fuss is about. (Yes: I acknowledge that there is some wit in the book's initial premise - a person addled by too much book-reading. But lemme tellya, it gets old awful quick. It really does).One goodreads er tells us, with no apparent irony, that this is the funniest book he has ever read in his life. A statement that can only be literally true if he is a shut-in with no access to a library.6. And on the subject of those ratings by other goodreads ers. De gustibus non disputandum est (i.e. diff'rent strokes..) etc. But really, folks, I'm having a hard time swallowing it. An average rating of 4.69? 102 5-star ratings? Might it not be possible, just faintly possible, that we have a slight case of what one might call ""classic intimidation"" going on? The (perhaps unconscious) fear that people may think less of one for not appreciating one of the world's designated literary classics? Did all these apparently rabid Quixote enthusiasts - and how can I put this delicately - ACTUALLY READ THE WHOLE BOOK? All of it, without cheating? All those pastoral poems by the love-besotted shepherds? The entire soporific ""Tale of Foolish Curiosity"". The limited empirical data available suggests that maybe close attention was not paid - a mere 9.9% of respondents chose the correct answer to the goodreads quiz question about the ""fulling hammers"".Just sayin'. I has my doubts.7. Because, here's the thing. Large swaths of this book are intrinsically unreadable. No, I mean it. You read a page. Your eyes glaze over. You try it again. Same phenomenon. Cycle and repeat. I humbly submit that the stuff in which Cervantes is engaged in direct spoofing of the knight-errant genre - all the stuff about Amadis of Gaul, the Don's argument with the Canon, the priest's adjudication of the various volumes in the Don's library, not to mention the interminable pastoral interludes with lovelorn shepherds and damsels dressed as shepherdesses could be considered interesting only by the most desperate of graduate students in need of a dissertation topic. For anyone not engaged in abstruse academic investigation it's a freaking snoozefest. Did I enjoy ""Don Quixote, Book I""? Only very sporadically. Do I consider it one of the world's great books? Absolutely not. Will I read Book II? Oddly enough, probably yes. But not this trip. And probably not this year. Let the Don lie slumbering back home in La Mancha. Myself, I hope to travel to Chile in July, and Argentina in August. I think that other, more appealing, opportunities will arise to extend my knowledge of literature in Spanish.So there you have it.

How toJust the cover alone of my edition is worth the price of admission, as it features Eve Arnold's photo of Marilyn reading ""Ulysses"": Marilyn So. How to  an anthology of this scope, without simply parroting a list of its contents? I suppose by considering how well it meets its objective. When the book was published, in 1992, Dermot Bolger's aim as editor was ""to reflect the cutting (changing) edge of contemporary Irish literature, focusing purely on fiction published in the previous quarter century"". Elsewhere in his introduction, he explains that he wanted to break down existing stereotypes (Irish writers as ""masters of the short story"", still writing in ""post-colonial"" mode, in constant rebellion against the censorship that was prevalent through the mid 60's, just an ""Anglo-Irish"" tributary to the mainstream of British writing, focused primarily on the gaping wound in the Irish body politic that the ""troubles"" in the North represented, and so on). Does he succeed? Without a doubt. The writing by the 50 writers selected for inclusion in this anthology is so broad in its scope that it completely demolishes the absurd notion of a single ""type"" of Irish writer. As Carlo Gebler of the Daily Telegraph blurbs on the back cover (slightly paraphrased):""The message of this marvellous collection is that ... on the island of Ireland there live both men and women, heterosexuals and homosexuals, Catholics and Protestants, Nationalists and Unionists, Communists and Fascists, people who think of themselves as Irish and those who think of themselves as British..""A bit long-winded, and not particularly elegantly articulated, but the basic message is, there are plenty of Irish writers whose work deserves to be taken seriously. And yes, they have met, and overcome, the challenge of working in the shadow of their literary antecedents - Joyce, Yeats, Patrick Kavanagh, Flann O' Brien, and Beckett.There are two flaws which prevent me from giving this book five stars, which I will mention briefly, before going on to discuss some of its considerable virtues. The first is that, well, 50 writers is a lot. Even in my most chauvinistic moments, I wouldn't argue that the crop of genuine literary talent working in Ireland today is that big. Bolger's claim that ""they selected themselves"" is a little disingenuous, and it's hard to avoid the (admittedly cynical) impression that there wasn't just a hint of mutual literary backscratching going on when he made his selection. A slightly skinnier volume, with the number of authors cut down by half, might have been a more interesting undertaking. This is, in the scheme of things, a minor criticism. The other point I dislike about the book (and my reason for placing it on my ""structurally flawed"" bookshelf) is that Bolger does something which I personally dislike in anthologies of this kind, namely he includes sections taken from full-length novels. Fully seventeen of the fifty pieces included represent selections from longer works by the authors in question. While I understand his reasons for doing this, it's just something that doesn't work for me personally. Your mileage may vary. With that out of the way, how can I possibly complain about a book which introduces the reader to the work of:Sean O' FaolainJennifer JohnstonMary LavinPatrick McCabeWilliam TrevorMolly KeaneNeil JordanBernard MacLavertyEdna O' BrienRoddy DoyleDermot Bolger Colm ToibinBenedict KielySebastian BarryBrian MooreJoseph O' ConnorDermot Healyall writers whose work I was previously familiar with, and had admired enormously.Damn! I really wanted to resist resorting to the list of authors - let's just say those are the ones I consider in the top third. Oops! I forgot, there's that opening 4-page piece by Beckett, but it really didn't do a whole lot for me, and I reckon you all have heard of him already. One of the pleasures I got from the book was adding another seven or eight writers to that list. I could include them here, but why don't you read the book for yourself and make your own selection. One note of warning, though. Incomprehensibly, in what can be termed his only obvious lapse from sanity, Mr Bolger has chosen to include a ""story"" by one Clare Boylan. Possibly one of the least interesting writers alive today, Ms Boylan apparently once experienced some kind of abortive romantic interlude while holidaying abroad on a package trip to Benidorm. Or possibly Torremolinos. She has been writing about it ever since. Don't say you weren't warned.But, other than that single Costa Del Sol lapse into Cosmopolitan-worthy chick-lit, this is a completely awesome anthology.

""My life as a Fake"" explored some interesting ideas, but wasn't altogether successful, in my opinion. In ""Theft"", Carey revisits some of the themes which clearly continue to interest him - Australian art and literature, and how they are perceived both within and outside Australia. ""My Life as a Fake"" dealt with literature and made obvious reference to the infamous ""Ern Malley"" literary hoax of the 1940's. In ""Theft"", Carey considers the issue of fakery in the art world, in a story that shifts between Australia, Tokyo, and the art world of Manhattan in the 1980's. ""My Life as a Fake"" didn't soar as one might have wished - in part because Carey sometimes bogged down in the complexities of an overly laden plot, and in part because it was hard for the reader (at least this reader) to share his fascination with the repercussions of the Ern Malley episode on Australian literature. In ""Theft"", he is far more sure-footed, and though the plot is also quite convoluted, he develops the story in a compulsively readable fashion. The reader is swept along by the story, the brilliantly drawn, idiosyncratic characters, and by Carey's wonderful language right up to the jarring (and absolutely brilliant) conclusion. The book reminded me of the recent film bombon (I mean that as a compliment), the wonderful ""Duplicity"", with Julia Roberts and Clive Owen, which also kept the viewer guessing throughout, but which the director and actors pulled off with tremendous style and humor. It was hugely entertaining, without ever condescending to the viewer. ""Theft"" has that same lighthearted verve, and Carey's terrific writing and obvious love of language made it a joy to read.

How did such a promising young literary stud like yourself turn out to be such an emasculated whore? When did things start to go so horribly, horribly wrong?Let me be clear. When I picked you up at the airport in San Francisco, it was with entirely clear-eyed, realistic expectations. Let's face it. I wasn't looking for the literary love of my life. Just a two-plane romance - enough to while away the time it takes to get from SFO to Madrid. Maybe a little bathroom nookie during my stopover in Dulles. And believe me - I'm no snob about this shit. I think there's everything to be said for the fleeting joy of airplane lit. Done right, it can be one of life's great pleasures. And the possibility can never be ruled out that it may lead to a deeper and more passionate commitment. I mean, look at Nate and Brenda in ""Six Feet Under"", and how well it worked out for them. Even the briefest of airport bathroom encounters is pregnant with possibility.So I'll admit to a certain nervous excitement as I boarded the plane at SFO, your manly bulk in my pocket, pressing against my crotch in mute promise of pleasures yet to come. And for the first 20 pages or so, you didn't disappoint. There was wit, a sense of direction, a certain ability to nail characters with brisk efficiency within a couple of snappy paragraphs.But I should have heeded the warning signs that were obvious right there in the book store. Even if the appalling cutesy biographical sketch could be excused as a horrendous contrivance foisted upon you by your publicist, there was that truly worrisome 'author portrait', which presumably you had to have approved at the very least. You know the one I'm talking about. The one where your desperate need to be liked permeates every line of the simpering come-hither rictus of a wistful little-lost-geisha-boy pout that you project to your potential johns. It might as well have been subtitled ""me make you happy long time"". Did they teach you that at geisha school, Tommy? To try to be all things to all men? Because, here's the thing, eunuchboy. Let me let you in on a little secret. Nowadays even the sweatiest of Japanese salarymen no longer finds the response ""Who would you like me to be?"" even faintly arousing in answer to the question ""Who are you?"".So that, when your thin excuse for a bold courageous novel touching on polemic issues degenerated into an incoherent mess of not wanting to offend anybody under any circumstances, frankly my frustration increased in direct proportion to the flaccidity of your prose. What was particularly weird was that you were hardly fooling anyone with your lethally boring 150 pages of padding trying to cover up the moral vaccum at the heart of your cardboard ex-stoner Jesus freak.

The Paul Auster boom which was prevalent in Madrid when I was here two years ago seems to have been replaced with Allenmania - in VIPS, the ubiquitous kind-of-upscale-7-11 chain, there is a seemingly eternal promotion of all his books and movies - you can take home a DVD of any of his movies for only 6.95€ (and I mean, ANY of then - they are all prominently featured, from Vicky Cristina Barcelona all the way back to Sleeper).

The best among those books was Daniel Gilbert’s “Stumbling on Happiness” and, while this book is not without a certain charm of its own, it poses no serious threat to Gilbert’s supremacy. It might seem as if this ground has already been covered more than adequately, but Weiner is smart enough to have come up with a reasonably appealing, and effective, gimmick. Instead of just giving yet another presentation of the experimental work and its conclusions, he packages his whole investigation as a travel memoir. As a correspondent for NPR, Weiner spent ample time reporting from the world’s trouble spots. He bases his exploration of happiness on the following hypothetical question:“What if I spent a year traveling the globe seeking out ... the world’s ... unheralded happy places? Places that possess one or more of the ingredients that we consider essential to the hearty stew of happiness: money, pleasure, spirituality, family, and chocolate, among others.”So he began by traveling to Rotterdam to meet with Ruut Verhoeven, “Professor of Happiness Studies”, who grants him access to the “World Database of Happiness”, the largest and most comprehensive repository of quantitative data about the relative happiness of people in different countries around the world. Weiner describes the research findings as “alternatively obvious and counterintuitive, expected and surprising”. He proceeds with a thumbnail sketch of the effects of key factors on happiness:“Extroverts are happier than introverts; optimists are happier than pessimists; married people are happier than singles... ; Republicans are happier than Democrats; ... people with college degrees are happier than those without, though people with advanced degrees are less happy than those with just a BA; people with an active sex life are happier...; women and men are equally happy, though women have a wider emotional range; having an affair will make you happy but will not compensate for the massive loss of happiness you will incur when your spouse finds out and leaves you; wealthy people are happier than poor ones, but only slightly.”It seems that Weiner was really suffering from severe wanderlust, because he provides only a perfunctory discussion of the results summarized above, focusing instead on trying to get a geographical handle on happiness, that is, to identify countries at the high and low extremes of the distribution of happiness scores. This leads him to the choice of countries he reports on in the book: Switzerland, Bhutan, Qatar, Iceland, Moldova, Thailand, Great Britain, India, and the U.S. These particular destinations seem to have been chosen partly for their utility in helping to illustrate key results gleaned from happiness research, partly for their desirability as places to visit. (It’s obvious that Weiner had a longstanding yen to visit Bhutan; one can hardly grudge him this small pleasure, if only to compensate him for the miserable weeks in Moldova). Most of the book then is structured as a chronological account of the places he visited, and what he learned in each. It’s a standard travel narrative, with little didactic chunks pasted in at various points (usually towards the end of the chapter devoted to a particular destination). During his stay at each location, he generally tries to interview a variety of people to ask about their thoughts on happiness; typically these subjects include one or more “experts”, random “wo(man) on the street” interviews, and any available U.S. expats. This gives him the chance to revisit the academic findings, and to discuss various aspects at greater length as the book progresses. As gimmicks go, it’s not a bad one, and the result is quite readable, without being exceptional.It suffers from the kinds of minor defects you might expect. Not everyone he meets while engaged in his happiness tourism is interesting, or has anything useful to add, and at times you wish that he’d been a little more selective in his reporting. A more distracting flaw is that Weiner shares a weakness exhibited by many memoirists – he has a compulsive, almost pathological, need to be liked. Not just by the locals in the places he visits, but also by his readers. This leads him, on far too many occasions, to lapse into what I can only describe as a very regrettable cutesiness in his writing, which goes from just slightly annoying to fingernails-on-the-blackboard irritating as the book progresses. Discipline is not a hallmark of his style; for instance, we get sentences like this: The prize wasn’t much ... but the event marked a major shift, what I might call a paradigm shift if I were the kind of person who used terms like “paradigm shift”. Don’t they have editors to save writers from themselves (and readers from sentences like the one above)? Evidently not. But there are compensating moments of charm: Its name, like all Icelandic words, is impossible for foreigners to pronounce lest they risk total and irreversible facial paralysis, so for safety reasons I will not divulge it here. Overall, Eric Weiner is a genial, if occasionally over-eager, guide. The particular conceit that he adopts in the book, discussing the findings of happiness researchers by placing them in the context of the people and places he visits, works surprisingly well. I thought his chapter on Iceland worked particularly well. Others, such as those on Great Britain and on India, were less successful – somewhat unfocused, and lacking a coherent argument. The book would have benefited from some tighter editing. But these are minor flaws in a pretty decent book.3.5 stars.

With bewitching Buenos Aires as its capital. Sixty years after the end of WWII, it can safely be assumed that all those fugitive Nazis have expired. And, following the economic collapse of 2001, the exchange rate is distinctly favorable vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar. So, perhaps you're thinking of paying a visit. If so, you will certainly want to have read Professor Ambrosetti's definitive guide to Argentine superstitions and legends before your departure. First published to great acclaim in 1917, it remains the definitive book on this vitally important subject. No traveller to Argentina will want to be without this Baedeker of bogeymen and bizarre beliefs of the natives. Your sojourn in the land of the gaucho will be immeasurably the richer by knowing:  * that the owl Buo magellanicus has the ability to magnetize cats and other domestic animals * that the black crow is an augur of rain and should never be shot, because the rifle will stay damp for ever after * that rubbing your thumbs with a magnet brings good luck at cards (presumably if you don't have a magnet to hand you might try rubbing your thumbs with a cat or other domestic animal that has been magnetized by an owl) * that the seventh of seven consecutive sons is doomed to be a lobisón, or werewolf. On the distaff side, the seventh consecutive daughter would, of course, be a witch.Now, you might think that the life of a werewolf is fun, involving the kind of bad-boy glamour that the ladies find irresistible, and regular binges on raw human flesh. You would be in error. Not in Argentina. To paraphrase the good Professor Ambrosetti:El lobisón metamorphoses into a cross between a pig and a wild dog, (as there are no wolves in Argentina); the transformation occurs every Friday at midnight, independently of the phase of the moon. Favorite diet is ""excrementos"" of every type, spiced up occasionally with the flesh of an unbaptized infant. As noted previously, being a lobisón is the fate of any seventh consecutive male child*. Physically, the untransformed lobisón is thin, subject to digestive ailments, with a propensity for staying in bed on Saturdays. Not terribly surprising, given his nocturnal activities on Fridays.During his nocturnal rambles, the lobisón is harassed by packs of local dogs, who cannot, however, harm him, due to being terrorized by the eerie noise produced by the flapping of the creature's abnormally large, deformed ears. Should the lobisón be injured by a stranger who crosses his path and doesn't recognize him for what he is, the spell is lifted. Unfortunately for the stranger, the creature expresses his gratitude by making every effort to kill his benefactor; for this reason, it is advised that the optimal course of action when meeting such a suspicious creature late on a Friday night is to kill first, ask questions afterwards. Appropriate behavior when confronting a lobisón is just one of the invaluable pieces of advice the traveller will glean from this book. Other highlights include:* how to make yourself invisible at will* how to ensure that the object of your infatuation returns your affections* survival tips when dealing with the Aho-Aho, the Yasi-Yatere, and other cryptozoological denizens of the region. I'd include these secrets in this , but then (obviously) I would have to track you down and kill you. Buy your own damned copy!(You won't be sorry)*For extra credit: Juan and Begoña are a Patagonian couple with five strapping sons (and no daughters).

It's well-organized and easy to use. But coverage seems idiosyncratic - sometimes seeming oddly all-embracing (you get the impression that some words are in there just because they may, at one time, have shared a dictionary with an animal), but with definite gaps, and already appearing distinctly dated (it was published in 1995). Specific examples are given below, but first my scoring in various categories.Coverage: 3 out of 5Scholarship: 4.5 out of 5.User-friendliness: 4.5 out of 5Charm: 2 out of 5Total: 14 out of 20, or 3.5 stars.To give credit where it is due, the dictionary is extremely well-organized. The primary alphabetical listing of entries is augmented by a second index, wherein all entries are re-listed by animal (alphabetically by animal). This second index, which runs to 40 pages, also includes sections for ""bird (general)"", ""fish (general)"", and ""insect (general"", and is one of the most attractive features of the book. For instance, it allows one to get an immediate answer to the question: ""what animal is the basis for the most metaphors?"" (horse, with dog as a close second). Cross-referencing is extensive and helpful. Scholarship appears excellent - the list of primary references is comprehensive, but not excessive, and Professor Palmatier is an authoritative guide, albeit a somewhat matter-of-fact one. Reaction to the style in which the explanations are couched is, of course, subjective, but I found the dryness of his style - I can't avoid the word - just plain dull. I have no doubt that Professor Palmatier is a language enthusiast (I mean, let's face it, only someone who's a little crazy about language would even contemplate an undertaking like this dictionary), but somehow his enthusiasm doesn't really shine through in most of the entries.This lack of charisma is the main reason for my low rating on the 'charm' scale. Also, despite apparently broad inclusion criteria ('erode' and 'erase' are included, linked to the rat only on the basis of a shared etymological root, 'rodere', the verb ""to dig""; CAT scan and catsup are included, despite having nothing to do with cats, or any other animal), there are some glaring omissions. Some of these reflect evolution of the language since 1995, but not all can be explained in this way. Below is a partial list of terms you won't find in the dictionary; I'm sure there are others. Some may reasonably be believed to have entered the language after publication of this dictionary:  jump the shark, prairie-dogging, skunkworks, mouse potato, yak-shaving, seagull manager, salmon day, donkey sentence, feathered fish, stress puppy, idea hamster, ant farm, goat-roping exercise, mole-groomer, sleep camel , and may be judged not yet to have passed the test of time.Other omissions seem less defensible:doe-eyed, deer-in-the-headlights look, like herding cats, four horsemen of the apocalypse, pale horse, singerie, frogmarch, elephant’s graveyard, culture vulture, zebra crossing, Schrodinger’s cat, brass monkey weather, dead cat bounce, dogsbody, monkeys’ (or foxes’) wedding, poodle-faker .I give Professor Palmatier the benefit of the doubt on sweater puppies. Pussies and beavers are given their due in the dictionary, though don’t look for the more vulgar, feline, version of henpecked. Credit to Prof P. for overcoming his midwestern reticence to include the term “beaver shot”, an instance where his somewhat desiccated style serves him well:shoot a beaver: to sneak a look at, or photograph, the adult female pudenda, or vulva. The American beaver has long been prized for its thick brown fur, which is used to make capes, coats, and hats, although the semiaquatic animal is usually trapped rather than shot. A beaver shot is a filmed or taped picture of the female genitals.(That little aside, ""is usually trapped rather than shot"", is hilarious).I didn’t intend for this  to end on a vulgar note; it just seems to have worked out that way.3.5 stars.

Having dIn this, his final book, Postman's main thesis is that we must look to history to find wisdom to help us tackle the challenges of the future. Having dismissed the 20th century as a disaster, in which people were deluded by the deadly trio of fascism, nazism, and communism, and technological progress was subverted to facilitate more efficient methods of mass killing, he proposes examining the 18th century, the era of the Enlightenment, as the best place to start.I enjoyed this book far more than I had anticipated. ""Amusing Ourselves to Death"" was kind of frustrating, a mixture of accurate insights and shrill complaint, largely negative in tone, with no obvious useful conclusion. The tone of this book is far more constructive and, while I don't by any means agree with everything Postman has to say, I found most of the material thought-provoking, with two exceptions.One part that gave me difficulty was the chapter on childhood (a topic that he has explored in one of his earlier books, apparently), which seemed completely off the mark. Specifically, his argument that childhood is primarily a social construct, invented in the 17th century and perfected in the 18th, at risk of vanishing entirely under the onslaught of information available in our time seems fundamentally misguided. It ignores the reality of the fundamental division that puberty represents in human development. No matter what society or epoch one considers, sexual maturation represents a natural milestone that carries within it an implicit definition of childhood. The natural order, and the imperative to propagate the species, lead virtually all societies to treat those who have not yet realized their reproductive capacity (i.e. ""children"") differently from those who have attained puberty. But then, one gets the strong impression that science was never Postman's strong suit. This also contributes to the second aspect of the book that I found problematic - his profound distrust of technology in all its aspects. I should be clear here - I actually agree with Postman that a healthy scepticism about alleged technological ""advances"" is in order. We should have learned by now not to take the tech prophets' over-hyped claims at face value. And the experience of the last century demonstrates conclusively that delegating responsibility for dealing with the ethical, moral, political and sociological questions raised by scientific progress to the scientists and engineers is a recipe for disaster. The level of Postman's distrust seems exaggerated, however, and gives the impression that it is primarily a result of ignorance, and thus not entirely rational.(While reading the book, I couldn't stop thinking about how much fun it would be to have Neil Postman and Ray Kurzweil participate in a panel discussion about what the future holds).The other parts of the book, in particular the chapters on ""language"", ""information"", and ""narratives"" were persuasively argued and thought-provoking. The final chapter, on ""education"", inherited some of the difficulties arising from Postman's flawed conception of childhood. But overall, I found this book interesting, well-argued, and well-written. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Feb 13, 2009","Feb 05, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/79680.Building_a_Bridge_to_the_18th_Century

BUT SEE BELOW.Comments: My relatively low scores for coverage and charm need some explication. Paradoxically, the low score for ""coverage"" is actually a reflection, in this case, of the enormously broad scope of the dictionary. Candidate entries for the website, and for this book, were obtained by automated google-searching across the internet; the subsequent editing and filtering to decide what should be included in the dictionary presumably reflect Mr Barrett's judgement and personal preferences. I can hardly fault him for exercising editorial judgement, except that the result is, somehow, frustratingly unsatisfying. The net he casts is so wide, and the resulting selection so idiosyncratic, that the final result conveys a certain eccentricity, but not that much charm (despite Barrett's obvious enthusiasm and scholarship). I was left befuddled as to what the particular selection of entries in this dictionary is supposed to represent. Are they words that Barrett believes*are not yet in standard dictionaries, but ought to be?*are not yet in standard dictionaries, but are likely to be in future?*deserve broader attention (if so, why)?*merit inclusion, just because he found them neat?It's just not clear. Many of the entries don't strike me as meeting the first two criteria at all, and a word's 'charm' is, of course, in the eye of the beholder. But consider these entries;""marbit"", a marshmallow bit found in processed breakfast cereal;""godunk"", a person who solicits free airplane trips (the only two citations date from 1939 and 1946); ""gap out"", a variant of ""space out"";""FLOHPA"", an acronym used to denote the swing states of Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania during the 2004 election (all five citations date from 2004);""dub-dub"", a restaurant server (possibly specific to the TGI Friday's restaurant chain)""ding-ding"", Hong Kong term for a streetcar""Califunny"", a jocular or derisive name for California""land of fruit and nuts"", jocular or derogatory name for California""lolicom"", a Lolita complex, the attraction of older men to young girls""rinse"", new Zealand prison slang for GHB""Rummy's dummies"", derisive term for the U.S. military,""unass"", to dismount or disembark""wet"", prison slang for a recreational drug made from marijuana, PCP, and formaldehyde""in the weeds"", restaurant slang for the condition of a waiter who is completely swamped""yumptious"", delicious - a portmanteau of 'yummy' and 'scrumptious'""vuzvuz"", derogatory term applied by Sephardic jews to Ashkenazic jews.Do I need to explain why I find none of them even remotely interesting or clever? How about:weirdly uninteresting specificity, only of interest to a subset of waiters and felons;built-in obsolescence, sell-by date already in the past (FLOHPA, Rummy's dummies);terminal stupidity (Califunnia? CALIFUNNIA?);needed to be executed at birth (yumptious, unass);any combination of the above reasons.I hate to say it, but there is no obvious reason for this particular book to exist.

There are perfect monsters who wrote like angels, and virtue in one's private life is a worthless predictor of literary talent. However, it's hard to watch the parade of pathologically depraved characters presented in these stories and not be reminded that they were written by someone whose mother once told her she'd tried to abort her by drinking turpentine. The stories in this collection were written over the course of several decades, but one feature is a constant throughout – Ms. Highsmith’s unwavering misanthropy. Her interest in the aberrant and antisocial side of human behavior was an early development -- at the age of eight, she discovered Karl Menninger's The Human Mind and was particularly fascinated by the case studies of schizophrenics, pyromaniacs, and those with other mental disorders. (Wikipedia)Exploration of transgressive behavior is the defining characteristic of Highsmith’s work. From the early “Strangers on a train”, through the various Ripley novels, and in each of the roughly sixty stories in this collection, her (human) characters are variously depicted as amoral, manipulative, shallow, or weak, prisoners of their most venal impulses. In contrast, the portrayal of the animal characters that populate the first dozen stories (taken from “The Animal-Lover’s Book of Beastly Murder”) is infinitely more sympathetic. Most of these stories are told from the animal’s point of view, and it’s quite clear who Highsmith favors in the ongoing battle of man versus beast. Circus elephants, ferrets, horses, rats and truffle-hunting pigs all exact vengeance in these stories. Highsmith wastes little sympathy on their human victims. Perhaps the most disturbing aspect is her skill in manipulating the reader’s sympathies. In stories like “Hamsters versus Websters” and “The Bravest Rat in Venice”, you may find yourself rooting for those homicidal hamsters, or caring more about the survival of the rat than the fate of the baby. Stories from the second collection, “Little Tales of Misogyny”, are less successful. At an average length of under 3 pages, character development is not an option, so that everything rests on the cleverness of a given story's central conceit. But with titles like “The Fully Licensed Whore, or, the Wife”, “The Mobile Bed Object”, and “The Breeder”, subtlety and genuine wit are in short supply.Highsmith ups the ante in later stories, and the best stories in the book are all taken from the last three collections. There is a fair amount of death and dismemberment, usually with a macabre twist. The best stories are those where she explores her characters' demons without actually having them erupt in homicidal fury, as she does in “The Terrors of Basketweaving”, for my money the best story in the book. Not all of the stories work. Highsmith’s focus on transgressive behavior, her predilection for writing about those on the fringe – often antisocial, amoral, and outlawed – doesn’t necessarily lend itself to the short story form. Sometimes the characters are simply too repulsive to be interesting, a problem which might be fixed in a full-length novel, but not within a short story. In general, though this work is impressive, I don't think it's as strong as the Ripley novels. But, even taking the weaker stories into account, it is still well worth reading, and many of the later stories in particular are outstanding. Be warned, though. These are tales of the macabre; reading too many of them in one sitting might jaundice your view of the human species permanently. ...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,not set,"Feb 12, 2009","Jan 30, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/80886.The_Selected_Stories_of_Patricia_Highsmith

Unfortunately, the features that gave ""The Crow Road"" its richness - convincing, complex, fully-developed characters in two generations of three families, with a complicated shared history, are largely absent from ""The Steep Approach to Garbadale"". The Wopulds (a perversely infelicitous choice of name that stopped me in my tracks every time I stumbled across it) are just not that interesting, largely because the only character developed in any depth is Alban. The plot is pretty threadbare; Banks gives us no reason to care about the outcome of the final ""climactic"" family gathering. Will the obscenely rich Wopulds relinquish control of the family business and sell it to the crass Americans? Forgive me for not giving a damn. And while Banks does invest Alban with a certain charm, it's not enough to make his handwringing and soulsearching more than mildly interesting. Sure, the guy's not a total jerk, so the reader wants things to turn out OK for him. But you know that once Banks has Alban eat his spiritual spinach, dessert is not going to be withheld.So the dark secrets are revealed, triggering the requisite Alban-epiphanies, great advances in his personal and spiritual growth (almost overnight), and happy endings all round.

Supposing for the moment that this is not an inherent recipe for disaster, what is baffling is the number of ers who claim to see something in this work ""for adults"". Other ers seem to agree on the book's ""lack of condescension"", so I guess I'll have to chalk my own perception of Gombrich's condescending tone up to an inability to put myself in the shoes of a 10-year old. So I'll give him the benefit of the doubt on that point.(ON EDIT: hell, no I won't; I found him condescending as all get out) What I can't forgive him is the utterly Eurocentric, theistic worldview that permeates every page of this book. Oh sure, Buddha and Confucius get a token few pages, Islam gets its chapter. A typical excerpt: ""I am especially grateful to the Arabs.... for the wonderful tales they used to tell... which you can read in 1,001 Nights."" To be fair, he does give the Arabs credit for development of our modern number system, though he somewhat spoils the effect by continuing ""Perhaps it's just as well that Charles Martel defeated the Arabs in 732"".And so it goes. Want to know what happened to the native peoples of the Americas? ""There (in Mexico) and in other parts of America, the Spaniards proceeded to exterminate the ancient, cultivated Indian peoples in the most horrendous way. This chapter in the history of mankind is so appalling and so shameful to us Europeans that I would rather not say anything more about it"". So, not a mention of the human toll associated with Manifest Destiny (sorry, Plains Indians!); for the colonial depredations in Africa, just one sentence: ""as you can imagine, the native inhabitants were often very badly treated if any of them tried shooting at the invading troops with their bows and arrows"". Is this dude for real? I think there's a whole lot of Congolese (to mention just one example) who had their hands chopped off for ""infractions"" considerably less severe than shooting at their colonial invaders with bows and arrows. I suppose European behavior in Africa was just so shameful, best just not to mention it. Wouldn't want to upset the kids. For all I know, kids may lap this kind of thing up. But I doubt it. If this enormously biased, sanitized, middle Eurocentric view of history were all they were to be exposed to, the world would be in a sorry state indeed. ...more",Notes are private!,1,154,1,not set,"Jan 31, 2009","Jan 27, 2009",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3711671-a-little-history-of-the-world

Superficially, his predilection for working the same, relatively narrow, ground (David Lodge is not a flashy writer, but he is an extremely good one. Superficially, his predilection for working the same, relatively narrow, ground (he is a master of the academic novel) might seem constricting. But each of his novels delivers fresh insights, with his signature blend of intelligence, wit, and genuine affection for his characters. ""Deaf Sentence"" is no exception. Although it's not as hilariously funny as some of his earlier books, it is - like all of his work - compulsively readable, and ultimately very moving, in an understated kind of way. Lodge's description of the various indignities that deafness brings is hilariously funny and so utterly convincing that you know it has to be based on first-hand experience. There is far more wisdom about aging in this unassuming story by Lodge than, for example, in Julian Barnes's recent, migraine-inducing, bloviation about his own mortality. When I think of the trio of Julian Barnes, Martin Amis, and David Lodge (I try to think of Christoper Hitchens as little as possible), restaurant analogies come to mind. Amis is the risk-taking molecular gastronomist, brashly confident of his own genius, and hey - if the diners don't always appreciate the flashiness, that’s not his problem. To his credit, when he’s on target, he can be sublime. But the brilliance is hit-or-miss. Barnes is closer to Amis than he might care to admit, thought perhaps not writ quite so large. In general, the quality of his work doesn’t fluctuate quite as much, but he is still capable of succumbing to navel-gazing, and cleverness (or perhaps his consciousness of his own cleverness) is definitely his Achilles heel. You’ll be served some extraordinary meals chez Barnes, but there will be an occasional inedible mess. At the risk of beating this analogy to death, David Lodge, perhaps at the cost of never reaching the Olympian heights attained sporadically by the others, never disappoints, reliably serving hearty nourishing comfort food that leaves the reader satisfied and looking forward to the next visit. That might sound like damning with faint praise, but is actually meant as the highest compliment. I can think of very few novelists working today who are consistently such a delight to read. He joins a very short list of authors (Margaret Drabble in early and mid-career, Anne Tyler) whose work is reliably intelligent, thought-provoking and interesting without being flashy. Such craftsmanship is rare and not something one should take for granted. I look forward to each new novel by Lodge, and thus far have never been disappointed....more",Notes are private!,0,41,1,not set,"Jan 27, 2009","Jan 24, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3139433-deaf-sentence

In this massive eructation of self-indulgent, rambling, repetitive prose, Julian Barnes contemplates his mortality. At considerable, punishing, length. Where does it get him? To paraphrase another writer: And the end of all his exploring is to arrive where he began. Despite the purgatorial length of this hideous hairball of a book, he never really arrives at any conclusion. The reader isn't even offered the courtesy of a chapter break. The book just meanders on with no evident direction until (mercifully) it finally just peters out.""But surely"", I hear you ask, ""this is Julian Barnes, a man of such wit and erudition, he cannot fail to be delightful company along the way"".That’s what I thought, gentle reader, but I was mistaken. I believe the relevant phrase is epic fail. The biographical stuff is faintly interesting at best, and Barnes – obviously a very private man – is careful to avoid anything genuinely revealing about his personal life. Anecdotes about various friends and acquaintances, and their thoughts about death, are tediously pointless. They are rendered all the more irritating by Barnes’s referring to the people involved as ‘P’, ‘S’, ‘A’ etc., a device that should have been outlawed after the death of Kafka, and that lends the text all the crackling excitement of a proof from Euclid. Barnes's rehashing of what other writers have written about death is equally soporific. This is a baffling and irritating book. There is no apparent reason for it to exist at all - if Mr Barnes has nothing to say to us, why not leave us in peace? Whatever made him feel impelled to torment us with these vacuous scribblings? Reading this book feels exactly like watching your favorite cat cough up a particularly dense, matted hairball. It takes forever, and you feel vicariously exhausted when it’s all over. I know that, in mediaeval times, magical healing properties were attributed to such animal hairballs, or bezoars. But the best that can be said for this one is that you won’t have to clean up the carpet afterwards.

At an emotional level, we don't want the author whose work we really admire and enjoy to be a total a**hole (what would that say about us)? As far as memoirs go, suppose I stumble across one of those rare books where I feel a visceral connection, as if the author had been writing just for me. If serious questions then arise about the author's honesty, that he or she has misrepresented his own experience to ""heighten the reality"" (or some comparable weasel phrase), then I am likely to feel manipulated and disappointed. In fact, the more I was moved by the account that I believed to be ""truthful"", the greater my disappointment is likely to be.One of the most disturbing books I've read in connection with the Holocaust is Jerzy Kosinski's ""The Painted Bird"". First published in 1965, it tells the story of a young boy (possibly Jewish, possibly Gypsy) who is separated from his parents and wanders about small towns scattered around Eastern Europe (presumably Poland) during World War II. With few exceptions, the country people he has to deal with are portrayed as extraordinarily cruel, engaging in almost any kind of sexual or social deviance you care to name. The cruelty, viciousness and amorality of the villagers manifest themselves in episodes of incest, bestiality and rape. When the book was published, to great critical acclaim, the presumption was that Kosinksi's account was based on his own experiences during the war, which belief he did nothing to dispel.When ""The Painted Bird"" was finally published in Poland (it was banned there for over a decade), the Polish couple who rescued Kosiński (then Josef Lewinkopf) during the war, even though in German occupied Poland any kind of help to a person of Jewish faith or origin was punishable by death often for the whole family, became highly indignant about how they were depicted. They recognized the names of Jewish children sheltered by them (who also survived the war), presented in the novel as victims of abuse by characters based on them. They informed the press about the fact that Kosiński ""had lived through the years of Nazi occupation not only in safety, but in comfort"" under their protection. Jerzy was baptized and received Holy Communion; he served as an altar boy. Summing up the ensuing reception of the book in Poland, Phillip Routh wrote: ""The Poles branded Jerzy Kosiński a Holocaust profiteer because the novel, which drew comparison with The Diary of Anne Frank, was immediately granted the status of a chronicle of the Holocaust,"" while – at the same time – exciting a form of lust reminiscent of the extreme part of modern day Holocaust pornography.""I agree with this last assessment. Whatever you might think about the trustworthiness of memoirs in general, the deliberate faking of a ""holocaust memoir"" seems particularly shameful. When there are still people who would deny that the systematic killing of European Jews was carried out during WWII, it is all the more important to get the record straight. This means bearing witness not only to the atrocities that were committed, but also acknowledging the many acts of courage and refusals to bow to tyranny. That Kosinski not only failed to acknowledge the decency of the family that saved him, instead presenting a slanderous and inaccurate portrayal that reflected nothing of his actual experience, is despicable.It could be argued that what happened in Europe during the Holocaust was essentially too horrific to be amenable to treatment in a ""standard"" memoir or ""novel"". I think there is some validity to this argument (though I think it in no way exonerates Kosinski, who cynically exploited the sympathy engendered by ""The painted Bird"" as far as he could). This brings me ... finally ... to Paul Celan, and the two books which are the direct subject of this . Celan, born to a Jewish family in 1920, survived the war to become one of the post-war era's major German-language poets. Although Celan survived, his family were killed in Eastern European death camps; after the war he experienced considerable survivor guilt, and eventually committed suicide in 1970.Celan's poetry is powerful and difficult. He has a penchant for neologisms that would give even a fluent German speaker pause. Fortunately, there are two translations that make his work accessible to English speakers: Michael Hamburger's ""Poems of Paul Celan"", and the more recent ""Selected Poems and Prose of Paul Celan"", translated by John Felstiner. Both are well worth your time. Neither translation is uniformly better, though if I had to pick a winner, I'd give the nod to Felstiner. Inspection of both translations of Celan's best-known poem, ""Todesfuge"" (Death Fugue) should make it clear why.Schwarze Milch der Frühe wir trinken sie abendswir trinken sie mittags und morgens wir trinken sie nachtswir trinken und trinkenwir schaufeln ein Grab in den Lüften da liegt man nicht engEin Mann wohnt im Haus der spielt mit den Schlangen der schreibtder schreibt wenn es dunkelt nach Deutschlanddein goldenes Haar Margareteer schreibt es und tritt vor das Haus und es blitzen die Sterneer pfeift seine Rüden herbei er pfeift seine Juden hervorläßt schaufeln ein Grab in der Erdeer befiehlt uns spielt auf nun zum Tanz.Felstiner: Black milk of daybreak we drink it at eveningwe drink it at midday and morning we drink it at nightwe drink and we drinkwe shovel a grave in the air where you won't lie too crampedA man lives in the house he plays with his vipers he writeshe writes when it grows dark to Deutschlandyour golden hair Margaretahe writes it and steps out of doors and the stars are all sparklinghe whistles his hounds to stay close he whistles his Jews into rowshas them shovel a grave in the groundhe commands us play up for the dance.Hamburger:Black milk of daybreak we drink it at sundownwe drink it at noon in the morning we drink it at nightwe drink and we drink itwe dig a grave in the breezes there one lies unconfinedA man lives in the house he plays with the serpents he writeshe writes when dusk falls to Germany your golden hair Margaretehe writes it and steps out of doors and the stars are flashing he whistles his pack outhe whistles his Jews out in earth has them dig for a gravehe commands us strike up for the dance.Schwarze Milch der Frühe wir trinken dich nachtswir trinken dich mittags der Tod ist ein Meister aus Deutschlandwir trinken dich abends und morgens wir trinken und trinkender Tod ist ein Meister aus Deutschland sein Auge ist blauer trifft dich mit bleierner Kugel er trifft dich genauein Mann wohnt im Haus dein goldenes Haar Margareteer hetzt seine Rüden auf uns er schenkt uns ein Grab in der Lufter spielt mit den Schlangen und träumet der Tod ist ein Meister aus Deutschlanddein goldenes Haar Margaretedein aschenes Haar SulamithFelstiner:Black milk of daybreak we drink you at nightwe drink you at midday Death is a master aus Deutschlandwe drink you at evening and morning we drink and we drinkthis Death is ein Meister aus Deutschland his eye it is bluehe shoots you with shot made of lead shoots you level and truea man lives in the house your goldenes Haar Margaretehe looses his hounds on us grants us a grave in the airhe plays with his vipers and daydreamsder Tod ist ein Meister aus Deutschlanddein goldenes Haar Margaretedein aschenes Haar Sulamith.Hamburger:Black milk of daybreak we drink you at nightwe drink you at noon Death is a master from Germanywe drink you at sundown and in the morning we drink and we drink youDeath is a master from Germany his eyes are bluehe strikes you with leaden bullets his aim is truea man lives in the house your golden hair Margaretehe sets his pack on to us he grants us a grave in the airhe plays with the serpents and daydreams death is a master from Germanyyour golden hair Margareteyour ashen hair Shulamith.Felstiner's choices seem both closer to the original text (compare the two lines: ""he shoots you with shot made of lead shoots you level and true"", 'he strikes you with leaden bullets his aim is true'; only the first matches the driving rhythm which is such an essential part of the power of the original) and more daring, as for instance his decision to add more German words with each repetition of the line ""der Tod ist ein Meister aus Deutschland"", until the German has taken over completely in the end. This seems like an inspired choice to me - the result is a much more powerful rendering of the sense of the poem.But this is just one poem, and Hamburger acquits himself well elsewhere.

He decides the best way to find out is to ask a bunch of elderly people, then try to distil key life lessons from the resulting conversations. Framing this process as a “search for wisdom” doesn't help particularly, and occasionally causes him to get sidetracked into some fairly unproductive academic discussions. It’s not surprising that encouraging people to talk about their own lives works far better than asking them about “wisdom” in the abstract, an approach which, predictably, yields mostly just bland generalities. As a general rule, his success is inversely proportional to the fame of the interviewee. Conversations with Harold Bloom* and Edward Albee lead to unhelpful pseudo-profundities like “wisdom is a perfection that can either absorb or destroy us”, and pointless exchanges about the dictionary definition of “wisdom”. A series of meetings with actress Sylvia Miles reveal little more than her apparently bottomless self-infatuation. The most interesting thing that is gleaned from self-styled guru Ram Dass’s pontification on “wisdom” and “spirituality” is his admission that he doesn’t plan to attend his own brother’s funeral. This, quite rightly, bothers Alford, though he later suggests that Dass is redeemed by the calm acceptance he displays in the aftermath of a disabling stroke. It’s unclear whether this reflects Alford’s innate generosity of spirit, or an unwillingness to admit to himself how worthless his pilgrimage to meet with Dass has been. Sandra Tsing Loh has already written more about her eccentric father than anyone might possibly want to know, so Alford’s decision to include further anecdotes about Mr Loh’s dumpster-diving and public urination is baffling.* I should add that the most memorable response Alford elicits, in an otherwise fairly ho-hum interview with Bloom, is in answer to the simple question “What have you gained with age?” Bloom: “A healthier respect and affection for my wife than I used to have...” (smiles) “Next May will be our fiftieth anniversary”. Somehow that moment of sweetness makes one forgive Professor Bloom many of his more pompous utterances over the years.Fortunately for Alford, and for the reader, his conversations with less well-known senior citizens are more rewarding. The best chapters of this book are those in which Alford describes meetings with ‘ordinary’ senior citizens: Charlotte Prozan, a San Francisco psychotherapist he met on a cruise organized by The Nation; Althea Washington, a 75-year old retired schoolteacher who lost her husband and her house in Hurricane Katrina; Setsuko Nishi, 86-year old professor emerita of sociology at Brooklyn College and CUNY; Doris Haddock (aka Granny D), who staged a 3000-mile walk across America in support of campaign finance reform back in 1999, when she was still a spry octogenarian. Most affecting of all are the author’s conversations with his own mother and stepfather. In what comes as an obvious shock, shortly after he interviews each of them, his mother (aged 79 at the time) asks for a divorce. Alford’s account of the events that follow, and the reverberations throughout the family, is remarkable for his ability to navigate obviously treacherous emotional territory without ever becoming exploitative or judgemental. In all of his writing, one senses that Alford is fundamentally a true mensch, a really decent guy. It’s part of what makes his work so enjoyable, and it really serves him well here. His writing about his family is funny and moving (never exploitative: David Sedaris, please take note), and is one of the best parts of this book.Interspersed among the conversations are the results of Alford’s auxiliary research – what various philosophers have to say about wisdom, what other cultures have to offer on the subject. There is also a (desultory) consideration of deathbed confessions and famous last words as possible sources of insight. These are, at best, intermittently amusing. This book is a departure from Alford’s previous work, the two collections “Big Kiss” and “Municipal Bondage”, humorous essays reminiscent of, and often much funnier than, the work of David Rakoff and David Sedaris. Though his choice of subject here doesn’t afford him the chance to be as hilariously funny as he was in the earlier books, he is witty and engaging throughout. The interviews with Bloom, Dass, and Albee would have benefited from a little less deference: one gets the sense that Alford was holding his natural snark in check. “How to Live” doesn’t quite have the mischievous exuberance that made “Municipal Bondage” such a joy to read, but it does have compensating virtues of it own, particularly the interviews with ‘ordinary seniors’ and Alford’s extremely moving writing about his own family. I had expected Henry Alford to be charming.

Let's get the whole rating thing out of the way right now. Objectively speaking, this is a three-star book. But I enjoyed it very much - and read all 600 pages in about a day and a half. Which I think deserves some acknowledgement. There are many, many books that are far superior to ""The Northern Clemency"", but are way less fun to read. So I'm giving it 4 stars. Here is an example of Philip Hensher in action as a critic. Writing about James Thackara's ""The Book of Kings"" it's terrible. Startlingly badly written, with no apparent understanding of what drives people or how people relate or talk to each other, it is a book of gigantic, hopeless awfulness. You read it to a constant, internal muttering of 'Oh - God - Thackara - please, don't - no - oh, God, just listen to this rubbish'. It's so awful, it's not even funny. There is not one decent sentence in the book, nothing but falsity and a useless sincerity. It may be the very worst novel I have ever read. Which has no bearing at all on my ; I just thought you might enjoy reading it.Aspects of The Northern Clemency that I liked:It's a  sprawling  portrait of two families, spanning the period from 1974 to about 1994. Yes, that's right: the Thatcher years.Hensher is really terrific at capturing the dynamics of relationships within a family. He can be very funny for long stretches.He can also write very movingly about intra-family tensions and loyalties.With one glaring exception, the characters are believable, and he keeps us interested, even though the events of their lives, objectively viewed, are pretty mundane. So if you like a nice, generation-spanning family drama that's a 'good read',  The Northern Clemency  definitely has something to offer. But I'd be doing you a disservice if I didn't warn you that:The book is way too long. At 600 pages, it's a bit of a doorstopper, and it cries out for editing on every page. If one of the characters gets a drink, expect to be told the height, weight, hair color and demeanor of the bartender, as well as what he's wearing. Somewhere around page 500, we spend four pages in the company of a woman called Rosalie, we learn about her relationships with her heroin-addicted son, with the different security guards in the building where she cleans offices at night, with the late-shift supervisor, Brendan, her nosy neighbors etc. Rosalie has grit and is a survivor. But the only function she serves in moving the action along is to pass along something she reads in one of the main character's recycling bins. Which told us nothing we didn't already know anyway. Don't even get Hensher started on anything food-related. The description of a fish pie can run to two pages. Canapes and appetizers receive similar attention, bordering on the fetishistic. Hensher's disdain for the use of easy cultural references, such as pop songs, to evoke a particular point in time is on record. Apparently it doesn't bother him to use vol-au-vents, shag carpeting, and specific TV programs to do the same thing. Although the book is set in Sheffield, against the backdrop of the miners' strike and Thatcher's response, there is no political commentary of any depth. To be fair, Hensher may wish to make the (valid) point that even during periods of (relative) political turmoil, the interest and engagement of the upper middle class was virtually nil. But his development of Tim, the troubled youngest kid in one of the families as a caricature Trotskyite who is laden with every tired cliche in the book is unforgivable. And boring.Baffling title.Occasionally, the plot just meanders into a completely implausible digression. This didn't bother me particularly, as Hensher generally manages to keep things entertaining, and is often very funny. What can I say? I enjoyed  The Northern Clemency  a lot, warts and all. ...more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,not set,"Jan 09, 2009","Jan 07, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3976230-the-northern-clemency

All those 5-star s gotta count for something, right? Well, let's take a look. ""We will have the requisite hardware to emulate human intelligence with supercomputers by the end of this decade."" Really, Ray. How's that coming along? You've still got a year, two if we're charitable. But, even despite the spectacular vagueness of the claim, things are hardly looking good.  ""For information technologies, there is a second level of exponential growth: that is, exponential growth in the rate of exponential growth"". A breathtakingly audacious claim. Without a scintilla of evidence provided to justify it. Graphs where the future has been conveniently 'filled in' according to the author's highly selective worldview do not count as evidence, and are nothing more than an embarrassment. But then, most of the graphs in this book do not bear up under close scrutiny - their function is more cartoon-like. Even Kurzweil's more apparently reasonable claim - that of exponential growth at a constant rate - rests on a pretty selective framing of the question and interpretation of existing data.  ""Two machines - or one million machines - can join together to become one and then become separate again. Multiple machines can do both at the same time: become one and separate simultaneously. Humans call this falling in love, but our biological ability to do this is fleeting and unreliable."" Say what now?From a technical standpoint, as far as biotechnology is concerned (which is the area I am most competent to judge), there's hardly a statement that Kurzweil makes that is not either laughably naive or grossly inaccurate. Assuming that, indeed, drug delivery via nanobots and the engineering of replacement tissue/organs will at some point become reality, Kurzweil's estimate of the relevant timeframe is ludicrously optimistic. A relevant example is the 20 years it took to derive clinical benefit from monoclonal antibodies -- the rate-limiting steps had little to do with computational complexity. So the notion that, in the future, completely real biological, physiological, and ethical constraints will simply melt under the blaze of increased computing power is fundamentally misguided. From a statistical point of view, things are no great shakes either. His account of biological modeling is such a ridiculous oversimplification it defies credulity. I'd elaborate, but frankly, the whole sorry mess is just starting to irritate me. Given the density of meaningless, unsubstantiated, and demonstrably false statements in the first few chapters, it's hard to see the point in continuing. If one actually reads carefully what he's saying, and assumes that he is assigning standard, agreed-upon, meaning to the words he uses, then several possible reactions seem warranted:* that sinking feeling that one inhabits a universe that is completely orthogonal to those who gave this a 5-star rating* heightened skepticism and aversion to Kool-Aid* bemusement at the gap between Kurzweil's perception of reality and one's own - in particular, the evident moral vacuum in which he ""operates"", as well as apparent ignorance or indifference to the lot of the vast majority of the planet's inhabitants* wonder at the sheer monomaniacal gall of the manGrandiose predictions of the future, the more outlandish the better, appear to have an undiminished appeal for Homo sapiens.

Actually, it's condescending to 7th grade teachers to imply that they should be satisfied with this book. It's an amorphous mess. I suppose the jacket blurb should have warned me - by now I should have know the code. When ers focus almost exclusively on the ""sharp, graceful prose"" and ""lush, poetic imagery"", it's a sure sign that other essentials, such as plot and character development, are probably not up to par. You know, the kind of writing that appeals to the writers' workshop crowd and nobody else. This is that kind of book. Bynum sidesteps that irritating plot requirement by structuring the book as eight linked ""chronicles"", each centered around the eponymous Ms. Hempel, whom we're obviously supposed to find charming as all get out. Well, call me a curmudgeon, but self-absorbed, aimless, needy characters navigating their twenties and thirties no longer do it for me. The meandering structure didn't help - in the first two chronicles, Beatrice is in her twenties; then we get two chronicles which are primarily flashbacks to her childhood, then back to the 'adult' Beatrice, but there's no particular payoff. It's not a horrible book. No puppies are killed or maimed. There are no obvious linguistic atrocities. You sense that the author has talent. And maybe that's why I found the book so irritating, because - talent notwithstanding - the whole exercise just seemed completely pointless, and more than a little self-indulgent on the author's part.I finished it only because of my pathological Catholic guilt....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,"Jan 08, 2009","Jan 02, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3432943-ms-hempel-chronicles

In laterSciascia, born in Sicily, was trained as a teacher, became a deputy in the national assembly and, later, a member of the European Parliament. In later life he turned to writing, his chosen form being the detective story with a definite noir flavor. This is the second of Sciascia's books that I've read. The other was ""To Each His Own""; comments in this  apply to both. I was led to them by a recommendation from the gnooks site (I'd never heard of him previously):http://www.gnooks.com/trip.phpWhat I like about gnooks is that it leads me off the beaten track, reliably generating offbeat, interesting suggestions. With that, one has to accept a certain risk. Unfortunately, I'd have to classify Sciascia as being part of the downside -- though I'm not sorry I read the books, I didn't really enjoy them all that much. The recurring theme in all of Sciascia's work is the corrosive influence of the Mafia in Sicilian life, leading to a corruption that infects all of Italian politics, and making a mockery of justice. There are at least six murders between ""The Day of the Owl"" and ""To Each His Own"" and they all go unpunished (well, technically I suppose one might have to classify retaliatory murder as a kind of punishment, so that's not strictly true). The dark view of the world* that pervades the books didn't bother me all that much - I suspect it may be a justified reaction to the situation in Sicily at the time (late 1950's, early 1960's). But Sciascia's focus is a little one-note; he lacks the complexity of, say, Patricia Highsmith, whose books inhabit a similarly morally compromised universe, but are considerably more interesting. I found the style of ""The Day of the Owl"" problematic as well due to a combination of # clumsy translation ('arid-feeling eyeballs'!)# Sciascia's habit of abbreviating placenames by initials (people are constantly driving from A. to C., with occasional detours to visit S.),# untranslated Sicilian vocabulary words scattered throughout the text ( lupara, cosca, parrinieddu, ingiuria, zicchinetta, briscola, bargello, chiarchiaro, barrugieddu: each of these can be translated into English, so why weren't they?) # the author's predilection for overly long paragraphsEven though the book is only 125 pages long, it took me forever to finish. Sadly, part of the book's opacity may result from Sciascia's fear of reprisal; in a coda to the book, explaining why he had pruned initial drafts severely, he writes:  ""pruning was ... self-defence against possible reaction by any who might consider themselves more or less directly attacked... One thing is certain, however: I was unable to write it with that complete freedom to which every writer is entitled."" Interesting books, but I wouldn't give them a strong recommendation. *: I'd use the word 'Weltanschauung' here, but studies show that doing so would cause 8 out of 10 readers to roll their eyes and mutter 'what a pompous assmarmot'; hence this footnote, as a way of sneaking it in anyway, in a kind of smarmily ingratiating fashion, to manipulate you, the reader, away from such a hostile reaction.****: This second footnote serves no purpose at all, but is included in the spirit of meta-homage to DFW. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Jan 13, 2009","Dec 31, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/130219.The_Day_of_the_Owl

He goes on to explain that  Classics for Pleasure  deliberately ignores most of the authors discussed by Fadiman; as these are likely to be familiar to most readers already, ""it seemed more useful - and fun - to point readers to new authors and less obvious classics"".In approximately 90 essays, Dirda covers a considerable amount of ground.

If, like me, you chose this book because you really enjoyed its predecessor, ""The Polysyllabic Spree"", prepare to be disappointed. If I didn't like Hornby so much, this would be a candidate for the ""intellectual con artist at work"" shelf. Though the real culprits might be the McSweeneys/Believer posse. Who apparently see no problem in subtitling this volume ""two years of reading begat by more reading, presented in easily digestible, utterly hysterical monthly installments"". Naively, one might expect somewhere around two dozen such installments. What they fail to mention is that there are actually only 15, two of which have nothing to do with books. It appears that Hornby's relationship with his employers at ""The Believer"" was in more or less consistent decline over the period in question, so much so that he was suspended on several occasions, resulting in one 5-month hiatus, and several briefer one-month suspensions (these resulted in combined March/April type installments, the standard 7 pages long). The material that is included is interesting enough, though there is a much higher proportion of general 'the dog ate my homework' kind of waffling, with correspondingly less space devoted to Hornby's thoughts and insights about books he actually read. Personally, I didn't find the seven-page justification of why he read no books at all during the month of the World Cup particularly interesting; just as his views on The Simpsons Movie left me cold. It would have been interesting to hear the gory details of his rift with ""The Believer"", but these are not forthcoming, though he does mutter obliquely about ongoing censorship and repeated exhortations to be nicer about the books he discusses. There are occasional titillating references to the byzantine hierarchy of relationships within the McSweeneys fortress, and of being forbidden to write about certain books based on who was currently boffing whom, but the juicy details are disappointingly absent.The time gaps and his obviously waning interest in the project take their toll. There is very little continuity, and most of the books featured in the ""books bought"" columns are never discussed at all. With fewer than 100 pages of material actually devoted to books, the $14 price tag and misleading representation of the book's content seem like an impudence on McSweeneys' part.

A short list might include: *genetic testing for diseases for which no effective therapy may exist *embryonic selection based on genetic profiling *confidentiality of patient records and insurability issues*individualization of therapy according to a patient's genetic profile*ethical issues arising from advances in infertility and embryonic stem cell research *the potential to prolong human life beyond 'natural' limits *greater ability to perform successful organ transplantation*genetic engineering and the creation of hybrid species, up to and including the possibility of human cloning.“Masterminds” is journalist David Ewing Duncan’s flawed effort to illuminate the frontiers of modern biology – specifically, current efforts in genetics, molecular biology, and the latest advances in biomedical research which result. He does this by profiling seven of the most prominent scientists in the field: James Watson, Craig Venter, Francis Collins, Sydney Brenner, Cynthia Kenyon, Douglas Melton, and Paul Berg. Given that Duncan appears to have had unlimited access to, and full cooperation from, his subjects, this approach is not without promise. The extent to which that promise is fulfilled depends, of course, on how well Duncan used the opportunity that his access to these brilliant scientists afforded him. Sadly, the answer appears to be – not particularly well. He does have a reporter’s natural curiosity and a decent ability to explain relevant scientific concepts in layman’s terms, traits which serve him well in his efforts. He does not, however, have a particularly subtle mind, which prevents him from following through beyond the initial, fairly obvious questions, and reaching a more nuanced characterization of the limits of current understanding and of future challenges. Nor does he do a particularly good job of navigating his interviews with the strong, often outsized, personalities profiled in the book. Ultimately, most of these profiles are an unilluminating rehash of the media cliches through which scientists like Watson, Venter, Collins, and Brenner are usually portrayed.This failure is directly attributable to a disastrous choice that Duncan makes at the outset. Unwilling to let his subjects speak for themselves, he insists on superimposing a stale, reductive gimmick – that of assigning to each scientist the persona of a mythological or literary archetype. Thus, the following correspondences are forced on his unfortunate subjects: James Watson is ZeusCynthia Kenyon is Eve Craig Venter is FaustSydney Brenner is PuckDouglas Melton is PrometheusFrancis Collins is Saint PaulPaul Berg is MosesThis works about as well as you might imagine. It is lazy, reductive, and virtually guarantees that nothing that any of his subjects might say is allowed to interfere with the box into which Duncan, a modern Procrustes, has forced each of them. One can understand the reporter being seduced by his own gimmick. But what was his editor thinking? A superficial, gimmicky disappointment of a book....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Dec 16, 2008","Dec 15, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/305460.Masterminds

Anyway, no matter.""It was the day my grandmother exploded."" Any author with the balls to have that as an opening sentence deserves to be given a chance, at least. Banks keeps up the brilliance for another 500 pages, drawing you in to the story of three Scottish families with a complicated, interlocked history. Young Prentice McHoan is a pretty irresistible first person narrator, so that it's a pleasure to accompany him as he navigates his last year at college, trying to come to terms with his various preoccupations: death, drink, sex, God, illegal substances, and whatever happened to Uncle Rory (who disappeared a decade earlier). It takes four funerals, a wedding, and immeasurable amounts of whisky, but in between hangovers Prentice is pretty smart, and pieces it all together for an ending that is maybe a little too neat, but is definitely satisfying.Two minor aspects of Banks's style could be a little offputting to some readers, but it's well worth the effort to keep reading. There's a fair amount of Scottish dialect, mainly dialog, though it's reasonably easy to figure out. Also, Banks alternates between Prentice's first-person narrative and an 'omniscient third-person' narrator, with frequent switches of timeframe across the generations. This is confusing for about the first 100 pages, until you get all the main characters straight in your head, after which it ceases to be an issue.

And by his second wife. But I think we could have guessed that* padding out Bennie's tale of woe by including big chunks of the book he is translating (from Polish), giving a second narrative that unfolds in parallel, sounds like a real neat idea in theory * but all it did was muddle a story that already had way too many flashbacks even moreThe ""trapped in O' Hare"" aspect of the book is appropriate, however. Because the sensation I had the entire time reading it was the overwhelmingly claustrophobic feeling of being trapped next to a drunken, boorish loudmouth, intent on boring me with every last insignificant detail of everything that had ever happened to him in his insanely uninteresting, fucked-up cliche of a life.

Muriel Barbery walks the high-wire throughout - there were any number of places where things could have degenerated into mere sentimentality. Not to mention the assorted philosophical digressions. But the alternating narrators - Renee the dumpy concierge and Paloma the precocious 12-year old - are so charming that I just went with the flow. I granted Mme Barbery my willing suspension of disbelief, trusting that I was in good hands. And Muriel, God bless her, delivered the goods. An enormously satisfying ending to a highly unusual book. Now that the book has been translated into English, it seems highly likely that Oprah will pick it. It would be a shame to hold that against it.Update 12/12/2008: Well, the five stars didn't even last 24 hours. Although I was swept up enough by the book to read it in one sitting - which should be acknowledged as a major point in the book's favor, by the way - some of its weaknesses become evident upon reflection. Unlike some of the other ers, the fairly hefty dollop of implausibility attached to the two protagonists didn't bother me all that much - the author is constructing a kind of fable, after all. But it has to be said that the way Barbery plonks in whole pages of ponderous ruminations on art, philosophy, Japan-worship, just like that is (a) a completely intrusive artifice and (b) a huge structural weakness. Aren't authors suppose to show and not tell? Then, too, my inner cynic has to cavil just a little bit at the unlikely perfection of the emotional harmonic convergence towards the book's ending. Mr Ozu seems more than a little too good to be true. And, for that matter, once you get away from the hypnotically, charmingly persuasive voices of the two narrators, the thought might cross your mind that maybe the other residents of the building aren't quite the shallow monsters they are made out to be throughout the book. Maybe the much maligned older sister, Colombe, deserves a break as well.The moral of this story is that I should impose a 24-hour waiting period before assigning ratings.

Sadly, what he had to say wasn't really sufficiently interesting to merit a third.It would be remiss of me not to mention the highly entertaining, albeit decidedly weird, cover that Bowling Green State University Press (or somebody) have chosen to adorn Scott's nugget of erudition.

Books like this one, in which Druckerman examines differences in cultural attitudes towards infidelity around the world, or Eric Weiner's recent investigation of happiness by country (""The Geography of Bliss"": http://www.goodreads.com//show/...) show us that cultural heterogeneity is still alive and thriving. Druckerman's research for this book began in the U.S. and took her to England, France, Japan, China, Russia, Africa and Indonesia. Anyone writing about sexual mores faces an immediate challenge: statistics are scarce and, given people's tendency to lie about such intimate matters, notoriously unreliable. I thought Druckerman did an excellent job of navigating the terrain - she is upfront about the limitations of the available data, and strikes an excellent balance between summarization of the research that has been done and weaving in enough anecdotal material to keep things readable. There is nothing particularly deep about her analysis, but that's not to say it's without insight, and it was definitely a fun and interesting read. The French are demonstrated to be far more chaste than popularly believed; similarly, despite the voracious local appetite of the press for scandal involving public figures, infidelity levels in the U.S. and Britain are on the low side. Her account of the dismal state of marital relations that appears to be the norm in Japan, the attitudes that make Russians view infidelity as something not to get overly worked up about, and the magical thinking used to rationalize infidelity that is rampant in certain countries in Africa (a major factor in driving up rates of transmission of HIV) is simultaneously fascinating and depressing. Druckerman also reminds us that attitudes towards infidelity within the U.S. are by no means uniform, though the existence of a uniquely virulent U.S. strain of puritanism cannot be denied. This nominal conservatism, when combined with people's normal tendency to transgress occasionally, can have bizarre consequences. One of the most memorable episodes in the book is her account of the horrifying aftermath of a single episode of infidelity in one southern couple's marriage. The relationship has become completely toxic, by any objective standard; fifteen years later, the ""wronged"" spouse resurrects the transgression on a daily basis, his partner is too guilt-ridden to recognize that the marriage should have been ended years ago, they remain locked in a miserable, toxic stalemate. Druckerman makes the point that this consequence of the accepted standard ""script"" for dealing with infidelity is all too common.

The similarities are staggering - the milieu and plot of both books are virtually identical -- a Chicago/Manhattan advertising/graphic design office, staffed by assorted twenty- and thirty-something professionals, dealing with successive rounds of layoffs and the resulting paranoia. Not only that, use of a 3rd person plural narrative voice and deadpan gossipy tone throughout much of Park's book make parts of it almost indistinguishable from Ferris's.The differences, unfortunately, almost all work in Ferris's favor. Park's book suffers from a glaring lack of character development - none of the characters who make up the collective narrative voice are developed to a sufficient degree of individuality to allow the reader to distinguish among them, let alone care about their fate. Ferris managed to rise above this trap and ultimately wrote a book that packed a surprising emotional wallop. It's impossible to feel much for Park's thinly limned characters - and the final stream-of-consciousness soliloquy by Jonah, trapped in the belly of the elevator, addressed as an apology to Prue, just left this reader wondering: ""which one was Prue again?"".Park does have a keen ear for the linguistic atrocities of the workplace, and the book has its share of hilariously on-target skewering of management guru platitudes. But ultimately, it all adds up to nothing of interest, since the author fails to provide characters with genuine emotional depth. The failure of this book makes one realize once again the impressive nature of Joshua Ferris's accomplishment.http://www.goodreads.com//show/... ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,"Dec 11, 2008","Dec 10, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2026701.Personal_Days

I mean, here I am, with around 170 books on my ""owned but not yet read"" shelf, almost any of which deserves a higher priority than this. A collection of pieces by Gore Vidal published in 1968, for chrissakes. How is that gonna help my glittering, Christmas party book chit-chat cred?Meanwhile, those Savage Detectives have slid back down to the middle of the pile, joined by the mind-improving history of the Spanish civil war, a certain man of La Mancha and sundry residents of the village of Combray. Not to mention those apparently infinite jests, Infinite Jest and The Recognitions. But Vidal is irresistible. It’s refreshing to read material by someone with a subtle mind and an extensive vocabulary, who deploys both without apology or condescension. His style is engaging – he has an ability to make his point clearly, without beating the reader over the head. You may not agree with what he has to say, but you won’t have any difficulty figuring out what he means. This collection contains s of works by Susan Sontag, John O’ Hara, John Hersey, J.K. Galbraith, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Edith Nesbit, and Henry Miller. In addition, there are roughly half a dozen general essays discussing such topics as the state of the novel, censorship laws, pornography, public television, the Kennedys, and the 1968 Republican convention. Vidal doesn’t pull punches in these s, but they seem remarkably even-handed to me. Although his criticism can be blunt, it never comes across as personal, and he seems to go out of his way to point out each author’s strengths, as far as possible. In the preface, Vidal acknowledges that his s are reputed to be “harsh”, but counters that he is “blunt about issues, not people”. He admits to having been “too unkind” in the piece on John Hersey, (who had apparently wanted to sue him) – I thought the  was actually right on the mark. “To give Mr Hersey his due .... he is good-hearted, right-minded, and ... tireless. Unfortunately, he is almost always dull, and this dullness is not easily accounted for, since he deals with interesting subjects. The Hersey technique is, simply, to collect an immense amount of data, then use most of it. ...To what end does Mr Hersey in his level, fact-choked style insist that we attend these various disasters human and natural? Admittedly the simple declarative sentences are excellent at conveying action, ... but they are hopeless at expressing a moral point of view, even by indirection. ... he does little but feed us facts in the worst tradition of those often useful but invariably overwritten profiles of the obscure with which the New Yorker has for years burdened our era’s social archives ...”Vidal is absolutely right. Hersey’s writing is overladen with irrelevant detail, and disappointingly boring, given the potential for his subject matter to be riveting. Vidal writes with equal perspicacity about the other authors ed in this collection. His iconoclastic remarks about the Kennedy dynasty may not have earned him much gratitude in 1968, but that doesn’t mean he was wrong.What Gore Vidal had to say forty years ago about Susan Sontag, John Hersey, E. Nesbit, J.K. Galbraith, and Henry Miller is probably not of interest to very many readers in 2008, but a reasonable case could be made that it should be.

Hyland, an author I hadn't previously heard of, by the algorithm at gnooks.com. I found this book quite disturbing when I read it, so much so that I felt I needed some distance before I could articulate my thoughts about it in a .A couple of months later, I think I have a better understanding of why I found the book so disturbing. Some basic information about the book: it's a first-person account, in the voice of 12-year old John Egan, a precocious only child, of a difficult year in the life of his family. Without giving away too much of the plot, his unemployed father alienates John’s (maternal) grandmother, in whose County Wexford house the family is living, they are forced to move to Dublin, where they spend some time staying with John’s aunt and uncle, before being placed in welfare housing in Ballymun, a notorious high-rise slum on the outskirts of Dublin. Building tensions within the family reach a disturbing climax, which causes John’s grandmother to re-evaluate and rescind the family’s initial banishment. The story ends with the family’s return to the Wexford house; whether this represents a lasting resolution of their problems is anything but clear. All these experiences are filtered through the perspective of John’s 12-year old’s take on events. By choosing to tell the story in the voice of this consummate unreliable narrator, Hyland sets herself a challenge that ultimately becomes a trap from which she doesn’t really manage to escape. Some quirks of John’s character are believable (his conviction that he has ‘superhuman’ lie-detecting abilities, and his obsession with having these documented in the Guinness Book of Records), but his Asperger-like tics and increasingly obvious inability to read the limited information available to him correctly make it increasingly difficult for the reader to figure out exactly what is happening. Hyland’s way of getting around this trap of her own devising is –- it took me a while to realise this, and I suspect she may not have realised it –- to have the various adults in the story interact with John in a way that is actually completely implausible for a child of his age. There are scenes between John and each of his parents which leave you shaking your head in disbelief. This further undermines the credibility of the story. Another major problem is that Hyland’s depiction of attitudes and behavior in Irish society at the time (the 1970s) seems off by at least 20 years; that is, she imputes behavior of her own generation to that of her parents.All of this makes the climactic events in the book just not credible. The violent eruption in Ballymun is overwrought, and the resolution too pat. So that this ambitious, deeply flawed, novel fails to rise above the level of ‘sound and fury, signifying nothing’. Reading various newspaper s of “Carry Me Down” suggests that mine is a minority view. So, as always, your mileage may vary. ...more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,not set,"Dec 06, 2008","Dec 05, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/251050.Carry_Me_Down

The writing is crisp and engaging throughout, with very few exceptions. What really sets it apart though are the topics discussed. The best pieces in the book -- Jane Meyer's ""The Black Sites"" (on CIA interrogations post 9/11); Joshua Kors on the denial of medical and disability benefits to Iraq veterans; George Packer's scathing account of the shameful betrayal by the U.S. government of the Iraqi interpreters who had provided invaluable help at great personal risk; Steve Oney's profile of one young marine who served and died in Iraq -- derive their power from the writers' outrage at the events being described. There is none of the ""look at me, what a terrible life I've had"" solipsism that contaminated so many of the essays in Gopnik's collection. Instead, the reader is led to understand, through detailed consideration of some very specific cases, just how devastating the consequences can be when a government and its military pursue an ill-considered strategic objective, with little or no attention to practical issues of implementation, and scant regard for the welfare of the very people trying to execute it. The four pieces dealing with Iraq alone would make the book worthwhile. But they are joined by five equally fine pieces:# Mike Kessler on the failure of the federal government to honor its promise to compensate cancer-stricken workers who assembled nuclear bombs at the Rocky Flats plant near Denver.# Jeanne Marie Laskas writing about the lives of coalminers in south-eastern Ohio.# Paige Williams's account of a teenage refugee from Burundi who has to rebuild her life from nothing in Atlanta.# Peter Hessler writing about China's economic transformation (""China's Instant Cities"").# William Langewiesche reporting on how a gang of criminals reduced Sao Paolo to a state of chaos for a 7-day period in May 2006, in a coordinated attack so fierce it took the police a week to mount a credible response.All nine of these pieces benefit not only from excellent writing; it is obvious that each was based on exhaustive, on-the-ground, research and reporting. The book has more to offer: interspersed with the longer pieces of ""serious"" reporting there are some very funny essays:""I am Joe's Prostate"" (Thomas E. Kennedy)""The Autumn of the Multitaskers"" (Walter Kirn)""So Many Men's Rooms, So Little Time"" (Christopher Hitchens)as well as short pieces on the Obama and Clinton presidential campaigns, the financial meltdown, and Ken Burn's WWII documentary, by Matt Taibbi, Hendrik Hertzberg, Kurt Andersen and Tom Carson, respectively.There were only three of the twenty pieces in the collection that I found weak -- Vanessa Grigoriadis on the media-gossip blog Gawker.com, Caitlin Flanagan's somewhat aimless remarks about the risk posed by online predators, and Matthew Scully's risible mudslinging at his former speechwriting colleague in the Bush White House about who deserved credit for exactly which piece of turgid, forgettable pablum inflicted on the nation by President Bush over the last eight years. Scully's delusion that this is something worth bickering over, or something that more than a dozen people might care about, is so surreal it's almost endearing. If he weren't so ridiculously petty.The final piece in the book is Evan Wright's long (70-page) profile, ""Pat Dollard's War on Hollywood"", which I haven't yet had the chance to read. Nonetheless, the overall quality of the other pieces is so high that I don't hesitate to give this book a four-star rating....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Nov 27, 2008","Nov 27, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3358626-the-best-american-magazine-writing-2008

Points in this book's favor - It's short, and very readable. In the second of two introductions, Wood promises to be ""mindful of the common reader"" and to try to ""reduce .. the scholastic stink to bearable levels"". He does a commendable job of keeping his promise.Wood's enthusiasm for reading is evident throughout, and is infectious. The strongest aspect of the book are the many specific examples that Wood provides of what works and doesn't work in fiction. Refreshingly, the ratio of positive to negative examples is high, so that we are treated to eloquence inspired by enthusiasm, rather than critical disregard, for the most part. His insights on Chekhov, Joyce, Nabokov (to name just a few) prompt me to go back and (re)read the work in question. On the other hand - Although I didn't find his style overtly pompous, there is an inescapable aura that one is reading dispatches from what Walter Kirn, in his wicked New York Times takedown*, refers to as ""someone who has attained the detached, big-picture perspective of an orbiting critical satellite"". A slightly offputting air of omniscience.An enthusiasm for Flaubert (and, to a lesser extent, Henry James) that borders on burbling adulation. There's nothing wrong with this, of course, but when coupled with what appears to be a blanket dislike for almost everything even remotely postmodern, one begins to feel that Wood might be a helpful guide only for a certain subclass of fiction. David Foster Wallace, for example, gets dissed several times throughout the book, with little recognition of his considerable talent and influence. Of the 90 or so works referred to in the book, only 20 date from 1965 or later.On balance, though, I very much enjoyed the book.

But this may simply be a reflection of the fact that Adam Gopnik gets on my last nerve. His meandering, pretentious introduction is a painful reminder of just how much David Foster Wallace's brilliance, wit, and low tolerance for bullshit will be missed (DFW was last year's editor).Really slim pickings this year. I'd break it down roughly as follows.Brilliant: Anthony Lane on the Leica camera; Hugh Raffles on cricket fighting in ShanghaiEngaging: Atul Gawande on geriatric medicine; Emily Grosholz on necklacesMoving personal reminiscence: separate essays by Patricia Brieschke and Bernard Cooper, though be warned that each documents the horrific suffering of a terminally ill child and life-partner respectively.Personal reminiscence that was only mildly amusing: Ariel Levy (""The lesbian bride's handbook""); David Sedaris mining his adolescence for yuks according to his standard formula (if you've read any of his previous books, you probably could have written the essay yourself)Personal reminiscence that, although I know that I was supposed to be moved, just came across as whiny, self-pitying and ultimately annoying:Lauren Slater (mommy issues and homesickness at summer camp: when she started ""shuddering with grief"", I lost interest) and  - hey - I'm sorry that Lee Zacharias's father shot himself and that she seems to be obsessing about vultures, but I think her interspersed flashbacks about her family and assorted vulture/buzzard facts were just creepily embarrassing, and certainly no fun to read.""Quirky"" essays that flopped (the reader understands that the author is enthusiastic about the topic, but the author fails to engage or persuade the reader): Albert Goldbarth on science-fiction comics of the 1950's; Sam Shaw on trying to attain transcendence through extreme long-distance running; John Updike (?!) on dinosaurs (it's only my admiration for Updike as a critic that is keeping this out of the ""embarrassing"" category)Reasonable idea, execution marred by excessive cleverness, smugness, or implied condescension (the 'elite writing for the elite' tone):Jonathan Lethem on plagiarism (some interesting points, buried in 30 pages of undisciplined prose); Louis Menand (""Notable Quotables""); Ander Monson (""Solipsism"" - a thin idea, pushed way too far)Cringeworthy, embarrassing, annoying, and/or just plain stupid: Rick Moody ""On Celestial Music"" Rich Cohen on how his neighbors reacted when he grew a Hitler moustache (Not well? Gee! You don't say. THIS makes it into the top 21 essays of the year. Hmmm. Let me think about that) Joe Wenderoth on -- well, it's hard to know WTF it was about, actually. Something to do with a strip club - he can't have been sober when he wrote it, that's for sure.The remaining two essays, by Jamal Mahjoub and Charles Simic were inoffensive, but also completely unmemorable.You see why I am so annoyed at Adam Gopnik? He forces me to be mean in public.Give this one a miss. 2 out of 21 home runs is pathetic. You may think I'm being unduly harsh. But there was very little joy in reading this book. Life is short. We have a right to expect more joy than is provided by this sorry collection.Now, here's the good news. Probably right next to this volume, on the same shelf in the bookstore, you are likely to find a book called ""The Best American Magazine Writing 2008"". It's roughly twice the length of the Gopnik disappointment, and is introduced by Jacob Weisberg. It might cost you a few bucks more. No matter. Buy it!

This account of the experience has one chapter for each letter of the alphabet; each chapter is roughly equally split between a selection of words and definitions and Shea's musing on some aspect of dictionaries, lexicography, or the logistics of his current project, many of which have to do with finding good places to do his reading.I enjoyed the book, but not nearly as much as I had expected to. Shea is a genial guide, and one admires his stamina and enthusiasm. But ultimately the gimmick is a little flimsy to support an entire book. Ammon's random musings are fascinating, quirkily charming, or dull in roughly equal measure. His writing isn't bad, though it is a little clunky at times, and there are surprising lapses into imprecision: ""One of the things that has been painfully apparent as I read through the enormity of the English language is just how little of it I know."" Use of the skunked term 'enormity' distracts the reader unnecessarily here; and even if one allows the meaning of 'great size' or 'hugeness', the construction remains clumsy. In another passage, he refers to the tribe of library denizens (people who spend their days in the New York Public Library reading room) as 'elusive', having told us a paragraph earlier that one of their defining characteristics is their tendency to occupy the same seats, day in, day out. However, it seems unfair to come down on him too harshly for this. Each of us has surely had the experience of staring at a word on the page for too long, until it starts to look really bizarre, just a weird concatenation of random-looking syllables. Or just repeat any word out loud ten times -- by the time you're done it will seem like gibberish. Reading the OED could be enough to unhinge one altogether. Ammon Shea deserves our admiration for having made it through intact. In this account of the journey he has not been completely successful in overcoming a fundamental difficulty, which is that the pleasures of the dictionary are generally private, idiosyncratic, and personal. So that it's hard to banish the thought that, rather than read his book, it might be more fun to use the time to browse the dictionary itself....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,"Jan 13, 2009","Nov 26, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2300922.Reading_the_OED

But thereThis wasn't quite as brilliant as the first chapter, included as teaser in the New Work Times book  a few weeks ago, led me to expect. But there is plenty of good stuff to cheer and amuse the reader. The book is formatted like a dictionary, in which each entry is an idiosyncratic riff by Blount on some aspect of the alphabet, words, the English language, language generally, or English usage. (Blount is a member of the American Heritage Dictionary usage panel.) What do I mean by 'idiosyncratic riff'? Here is a representative sample:Why do so many reduplicative expressions (e.g. heebie-jeebies) in English begin with 'h' than with any other letter? (with an impressive list of 54 examples)Origins of the word 'mansuetude'.Menu-ese: language atrocities culled from menus.Goldwynisms;The (non)-admissibility of 'hopefully': Blount comes down squarely against it. (A position I disagree with - it seems to me to fill the same need as its German equivalent - ""hoffentlich"" - and Blount's charges of ambiguity seem unconvincing to me).Synesthesia.Great one-word, two-word, and three-word sentences; e.g. 'Fuhgeddaboudit', 'Nooses give', 'Omit needless words'.Ruminations on each of the individual letters of the alphabet.To me, Blount's thoughts about the individual letters of the alphabet were hit-or-miss, with more misses than hits. Another recurring theme of his which was reasonably amusing the first couple of times he brought it up, much less so the fifteenth, was the property he refers to by the cutesy-irritating coinage 'sonicky'. Blount uses it to mean a broader kind of onomatopoeia - a 'sonicky' word is one which is acoustically appropriate to its meaning. As examples he cites 'chunky', 'squeeze', 'foist'. The concept didn't bother me particularly, but Blount's obsessive returning to it every few pages got old really fast, and the term 'sonicky' should have been put down at birth. My final complaint about ""Alphabet Juice"" is the unforgivable lack of an index - a lazy, annoying omission.But this is mere caviling. These are minor flaws in a book which has more than its share of highly amusing entries. Blount's enthusiasm for language, and his appreciation for its oddities, are infectious.

He makes some valid points throughout the book, but they ultimately get lost, due to a lack of organization, signposting, and an overarching tendency simply to pick holes in the arguments of others without really stating his own position very clearly. The book also lacks any kind of structural coherence - the chapters are more like scattered essays with no real unifying concept. The opening and closing chapters are generally concerned with establishing that much of the received wisdom about food (recommended daily allowances, epidemiological claims that a given food is harmful, the demonization of McDonald's and fast food generally, overblown claims linking obesity to mortality) is highly questionable. But two chapters in the middle of the book - ""Restaurant Heaven"" and ""The Food Adventurers"" - seem completely out of place, being little more than a catalog of memorable meals the author has been privileged to enjoy in various fancy restaurants. One doesn't begrudge Glassner his dream dinners prepared by Daniel Boulud or Thomas Keller, but the rapturous descriptions included here are a pointless self-indulgence. And I think most of us don't need to have it pointed out that restaurant critics are likely to get better meals and service than your average nondescript diner. In the end, this book was annoying, in that the valid points that Glassner has to make get lost in a welter of irrelevant detail and poor organization. I waver between 2 and 3 stars, but ultimately give it 3; despite the distraction of the ""Restaurant Heaven"" chapter, the points made in the opening and closing chapters are worthwhile....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Nov 18, 2008","Nov 18, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55184.The_Gospel_of_Food

Charles Mackay's extraordinary survey of the various manifestations of mass hysteria throughout history cannot help but offer perspective. He reminds us that, no matter how batshit crazy a particular fad might seem, it's already been done by our ancestors. There is truly nothing new under the sun; the catalog of human daftness, though entertainingly long and varied, is nonetheless finite.It's all here in Mackay's book, laid out with a kind of detached amusement that leaves no doubt as to where the author stands. Market craziness got you down? It may cheer you up to read about the Mississippi scheme that wrought such havoc on the French treasury in the 18th century, while the South Sea Bubble engulfed the English, or to refresh your memory on Holland's infamous Tulipomanic excesses. Three of the longer sections of the book are devoted to alchemy, the crusades, and witch-hunting. By the accumulation of examples and anecdotes across the geographical and historical spectrum (i.e. from different times and places), Mackay demonstrates that human folly remains a constant down the ages. He doesn't beat us over the head with this message - he simply assembles the data, with no overt analysis, and leaves us to draw the inevitable conclusion. Most of your favorite targets are discussed in the book: eschatological prophets, fortune tellers, spiritualists, mediums, and the good Dr Mesmer and his imitators. The anecdotes are often hilarious, even more so because of Mackay's tone of dry amusement. But he knows when to administer the coup de grace, as for example, when he shows how easy it is to attribute post hoc meaning to the notoriously vague quatrains of Nostradamus. One can only wish that the folks at The History Channel would read these sections and take them to heart.Shorter chapters are interspersed on topics as diverse as the wave of spouse-poisoning that swept through the courts of Europe in the 17th century, the influence of politics and religion on men's hair and beard styles, haunted houses, popular admiration of great thieves, duels, relics, and the sudden rise and fall of certain catchphrases or songs in big cities. (Yadda yadda yadda, anyone?)This book is ideal for browsing. It's all pretty interesting stuff, presented clearly and wittily.

Homes - cancer patients can be loathsome people too, so what?), and with such evident gusto. Sadly, it's downhill all the way for the remaining 19. Some are merely dull, without being actively offensive. Padgett Powell's 'Scarliotti and the Sinkhole', Ann Cummins's 'Where I Work', Brian Evenson's 'Two Brothers', 'Histories of the Undead' by Kate Braverman, 'You Drive' by Christine Schutt, 'Brief Interviews with Hideous Men"" by David Foster Wallace -- each of these succumbs to some combination of navel-gazing protagonists, incoherent or overly flashy style, or terminal lack of action and generalized anomie (why does nothing happen any more in the modern short story?). That still leaves ten to a dozen contributions. These are not just bad - they are aggressively, offensively, in-your-face dreadful - the kind of incoherent, smirkingly self-indulgent, look-at-me-see-how-clever-I-am, pointless dreck that makes you want to smack the author (and the editor of this sorry collection) about the head. HARD. The usual grab-bag of archly self-referential, pomo stylistic tics is paraded before the reader, with the results you'd expect. Your computer's IP address packs a greater emotional punch than any of the remaining stories in the book. Calling out individual offenders by name seems pointless; in any case, the real culprit is the editor, Ben Marcus. I have to admit that the warning signs were right there in Marcus's introductory essay, which is studded with overwrought, barely intelligible, sentences like the following:* Plot would be another name for our bodies, carved hollow to receive something amazing.* The story, then, is what the story is hiding, and the hide is indeed a piece of skin, whose effect is to conceal the body..... the current practice of the short story has ample methods of matterfulness ....... these stories ... are toolkits for the future. * They could be projected by megaphone onto an empty field and people would grow there.Marcus acknowledges that he deliberately ""tried to include a single vigorous practitioner of each thriving literary style I could identify"". What he fails to grasp is that the insistent, obtrusive obsession with stylistic novelty comes at a serious price - even the most technically accomplished of the resulting stories fails to kindle any emotional spark whatsoever. As a result, almost half the stories in this book are emotionally bankrupt, and a complete waste of time.Viewed as a snapshot of the state of the American short story in 2004, this book is probably a fairly accurate representation.

It puts the competing anthology ""Best American Science Writing 2008"", edited (perfunctorily) by Sylvia Nasar, to shame. Where Nasar didn't bother to look beyond ""The New York Times"" and ""The New Yorker"" for her material, Groopman's anthology benefits from his having cast a much broader net, as well as from the depth of his intellectual curiosity. In his introduction, he outlines his criteria for inclusion:""the articles ... have novel and surprising arguments, protagonists who articulate their themes in clear, cogent voices, and vivid cinema. They are not verbose or tangential. They are filled with simple declarative sentences. ... I suspect none of the articles was easy to write. Each shows a depth of thought and reporting that takes time and considerable effort.""These target criteria show that we are in good hands - the only remaining question is whether they are actually achieved for the pieces included in the anthology. The answer is a resounding yes - with very few exceptions (only Freeman Dyson's piece on biotechnology and Michael Specter's article on retroviruses seemed fuzzy to me) the writing is crisp and clear, and the subject material is interesting and thought-provoking. That is, in my estimation, Dr Groopman's batting average is 22 excellent pieces of 24 (and your view on the Dyson and Specter pieces may differ). Which far exceeds the norm for this kind of anthology.Here is a partial list of the articles included:Jon Cohen: ""Zonkeys are pretty much my favorite animal""John Colapinto: ""The Interpreter"" (the linguistic anomaly represented by the Piraha language)Robin Marantz Henig: ""Our silver-coated future"" (safety assessment of nanotechnology)Michael Finkel: ""Malaria: Stopping a Global Killer""Olivia Judson: ""The Selfless Gene""Todd Pitock: ""Science and Islam in Conflict""Ron Rosenbaum: ""How to Trick an Online Scammer into Carving a Computer out of Wood""Ian Parker: ""Swingers"" (mating habits of bonobos)Jeffrey Toobin: ""The CSI effect"" (forensics: TV versus reality)Other articles cover topics as diverse as dark matter, ""spooky action at a distance"", khipu knots of the Incas, the coming robot army, the poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko by polonium-210, the Hendra virus, difficulties in the interpretation of epidemiological studies, wind energy, and the requisite Oliver Sacks case study (musicophilia)....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Nov 13, 2008","Nov 09, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3328967-the-best-american-science-and-nature-writing-2008

Everyone loves pirates!In my defense, I didn't hate the pirates. But it turns out apparently that a little whimsy goes a long way. This book has the virtue of being - GASP! - two books in one. But - and I must be brutally frank here, my goodreads public expects nothing less than searing honesty at all times - had Gideon Defoe stopped at just one book, that would have been A-OK with me.Which is to say that, having come up with an awesome gimmick (pirates! everyone loves pirates!), Gideon's execution is mediocre at best. The humor is sporadic and very British, with much recycling of material that isn't all that hilarious to begin with.Of the two stories, I liked the Ahab one better. Gideon really never did figure out what to do with the Darwin story: both stories meander, but the Scientist story was particularly aimless. I guess I'll just go and read my copy of the Curmudgeon Chronicle now. (The third star basically reflects peer pressure - my initial impulse was to give it only two stars)....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Nov 08, 2008","Nov 07, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/194679.The_Pirates_In_an_Adventure_with_Scientists_The_Pirates_In_an_Adventure_with_Ahab

Nobody in the St CharleAnother Anglo-Irish family whose members are dedicated to mutual assured destruction, even as they slide into genteel poverty. Nobody in the St Charles household would dream of treating the dogs or horses badly; servants and local tradesmen don't fare so well. But the brunt of their vituperation is saved for one another, with each family member nursing a store of petty grievances, both real and imaginary. Our guide for this particular version of hell is the unlovely, delusional daughter of the house, Aroon. Neglected by her philandering father, despised by her icy mother, used by her charming brother, she pines for love and approval. Her transformation to bitter, vengeful, old maid is inevitable and heartbreaking to watch.The stifling closed world of the decaying Anglo-Irish ascendancy is Molly Keane's chosen niche, and nobody captures it better (except, perhaps, William Trevor). While parts of ""Good Behaviour"" are very funny indeed, it is considerably darker and more complex than the rest of her books, all of which cover similar ground.

Honestly I did. But Damian Thompson was just such an unappealing advocate for the forces of reason. Although not as overtlI wanted to like this book. Honestly I did. But Damian Thompson was just such an unappealing advocate for the forces of reason. Although not as overtly obnoxious as - say - Christopher Hitchens (or Richard Dawkins, in his more recent writings), he doesn't manage to avoid the trap of self-righteous superiority. After a couple of chapters, it's like being trapped at a dinner party with a know-it-all guest - you don't care how right he is - you just wish he'd shut up already.Not that his targets aren't worthy. They fall into three main categories: pseudoscience, pseudohistory, and what might be thought of as examples of ""popular delusions and the madness of crowds"". Thompson gives particular scrutiny to:# Creation ""science"" , ""intelligent design"" and the assorted shenanigans of evolution-bashers.# The prevalence of untested, unproven ""alternative therapies"" (which he refers to as ""Quack remedies""), from homeopathy to reflexology to aromatherapy.# Assorted conspiracy theories (primarily related to 9/11)# Examples of ""pseudohistory"" - Jesus's lovechild survives, but the Catholic Church maintains a conspiracy of silence. The Phoenicians/Israelites/Celts/Greeks/Vikings/Chinese discovered America in (choose your pre-Columbus date). Aliens (or technologically super-savvy ancient civilizations) roamed the earth, building the pyramids and Mayan temples until perishing in the lost city of Atlantis!# Marketing phenomena such as ""The Secret"", dubious dietary supplements, QLink bracelets with crystal-based 'healing powers'.All of this makes Thompson righteously indignant. And I'm certainly not going to defend any of them here - indeed, all this bogus 'knowledge', shoddy scholarship, and fuzzy thinking does deserve our censure. But from a purely pragmatic point of view of persuading the reader, Thompson would be more effective if he didn't wax quite so white-hot indignant about each and every example he cites. After all, not every example of 'counterknowledge' has equally serious consequences - some are considerably more damaging than others. Bogus science which denies the link between HIV and AIDS, or which makes unwarranted claims about a putative link between MMR vaccination and autism is clearly actively dangerous, as it can cause people to avoid therapies proven to be beneficial. Those who promulgate this kind of misinformation, in the service of their own political or profit-driven agenda, deserve to be challenged and possibly earn our moral censure. But no matter how much the success of Rhonda Byrne's ""The Secret"" or Gavin Menzies's ""1421: The Year China Discovered America"" might irritate Thompson (and it clearly frosts his eyeballs enormously), it is hard to see these books as being quite as dangerous or reprehensible as,say, holocaust denial used to foment anti-Semitism or the South African government's distortion of information related to the cause of AIDS. Thompson's uncalibrated indignation has the unfortunate side-effect of suggesting that every instance of 'counterknowledge' deserves equal condemnation, which ultimately hurts his argument, though not fatally. A far more serious flaw throughout the book is what I can only term as a persistent anti-Islamic strain, which is hard to ignore, and seems particularly unfortunate given the author's position as editor-in-chief of  The Catholic Herald . For instance, Thompson claims that ""Islamic Creationism is turning into a serious problem for british sixth-form colleges and universities"", but fails to substantiate this claim with anything but the flimsiest of anecdotal evidence. He goes on to assert that the damage of Creation Science is limited within the United States because it is still ""essentially located within the American cultic milieu"", while ""Islamic creationism"" by contrast is a unified and increasingly influential component of a wider Islamic worldview"". Which would be OK if he didn't then go on to establish that almost all of the anti-Darwinist propaganda promulgated in the name of Islam is the product of a single individual. In these sections Thompson appears clearly guilty of applying differential standards of evidence to support his claims.In the end, the most useful part of this book was the ""Further Reading"" section that concludes it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Nov 07, 2008","Nov 07, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2623572-counterknowledge

The books included in this comparative evaluation are:Bulfinch's Mythology (Modern Library Paperback Edition, 2004)Mythology by Edith Hamilton (originally published in 1942; Back Bay Books edition of 1998)The Greek Myths by Robert Graves (Penguin Books combined edition, 1992)Gods and Heroes of Ancient Greece by Gustav Schwab (Pantheon Books, copyright 1946)Don't Know Much About Mythology by Kenneth C. Davis (Harper Collins, 2005)Myths of the Ancient Greeks by Richard P. Martin (New American Library, 2003)Goodreads is not really set up to handle comparative s smoothly, so the discussion is split across the six book s. Thus, I've tried to evaluate each book on its own particular merits, and also give some idea of how it stacks up relative to the others. I based the comparative evaluation on three main general criteria - readability, accuracy, and scope (breadth and depth of coverage); I also looked at how each book handled two particular examples -- the life of Hercules and the story of Philomela and Procne. More details about the comparison can be found in the introduction to the first : Bulfinch evaluation  One of the problems in this whole undertaking is that some of the books on the list are acknowledged to be ""classics"", which makes it harder to  them objectively. You end up second-guessing yourself - maybe the classic status is causing you to be unduly deferential. Or maybe you're overcompensating by being too mean.One thing became clear to me as I read these books. Although the myths remain unchanged, the way that we think about them has evolved considerably over the last 150 years. This is one reason why the bowdlerized myths presented to us by Bulfinch, in which each story is rendered moribund by being stripped of all reference to sex, violence, or any hint of unpleasantness, are so unsatisfactory to a 21st century reader. Fortunately, Edith Hamilton is no prude. Her enthusiasm for the stories in ""Mythology"" is evident throughout the book. At times, she comes across as a woman on a mission - her conviction about the importance of these myths in Western culture is so passionate that she is determined to spread the message to a broader audience. She is scrupulous about identifying her source materials (on this point Bulfinch is, sadly, more dilettante than scholar). She knows how to structure a narrative. Her prose is clear and reasonably accessible - slightly dated, but largely unburdened by archaic language or academic jargon. ""Mythology"" even comes with a bunch of nifty illustrations, done by someone with the improbable name of Steele Savage (with a great fondness for winged horses, apparently). Though her first book wasn't published until she was in her sixties, her work achieved great popular success. Book-of-the-Month Club selection in 1957, honorary citizenship of Athens, a highly laudatory obit in the New York Times when she finally died at age 95 - what's not to love?To sum up the points in its favor: Hamilton does well on the three basic criteria (accessibility, credibility, extent of coverage) the writing is clear, she is commendably rigorous about sourcing, and there are no glaring gaps in the extent of coverage. Both of my ""test myths"" were covered well; the story of Procne and Philomela particularly so. The family trees for the major Gods and important families of mortals are a really useful feature.I wish that I liked ""Mythology"" better. But I have no great love for this book. That 3rd star was given only because I felt obliged to acknowledge her superiority to Bulfinch. But, for me, the book has an inescapable ""Reader's Digest"" feel to it. Yeah, the writing is clear. It's adequate, but never more than that - it never takes off, even in those obvious places where you think it must. I know this is an unfair comparison, but earlier in the month I had been reading Oscar Wilde's stories for children, as well as some of Kipling's poetry, and I kept waiting for Hamilton to dazzle me, even just a little bit. But she never did. And those nifty illustrations? Cheesy beyond belief. It's not just the over-representation of winged steeds, there's also way too much use of the threatening dark thundercloud effect, and the human figures are invariably depicted as shrieking heavenward as they shake their evidently double-jointed limbs in panic. Finally, it should be noted that Hamilton's retelling of the Greek myths is based solely on her study of the classical literature - she had never been to Greece, and had no archaeological experience. Examination of myth from an anthropological or psychological perspective is also absent. There is about a page of rambling prose in the introduction in which the words ""myth"", ""religion"" and ""Nature"" appear together prominently, but no coherent thesis is advanced. Sometimes Hamilton is opinionated to a fault: ""Intelligence did not figure largely in anything he did and was often conspicuously absent."" (about Hercules)""The terrifying irrational has no place in classical mythology. Magic ... is almost nonexistent. Ghosts never appear on earth in any Greek story.""I don't really mind if she disses Hercules, but her gratuitous dissing of my boy Ovid really didn't win her any points. All in all, reading ""Mythology"" was not as much fun as I had expected. I'm not sure that it deserves to be considered a true classic....more",Notes are private!,2,141,1,not set,"Sep 28, 2010","Oct 31, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/23522.Mythology

Do those mythology questions on Jeopardy leave you stumped? Could mythology be your Achilles heel?If your knowledge of Greek mythology is derived primarily from Saturday morning cartoons, then maybe it's time for a refresher course. Yes, I know - life is busy, and you have philosophical objections to the dominance accorded the Greeks where mythology is concerned. Too bad. That argument may be theoretically sound, but it's completely irrelevant in practice. Greek mythology is so embedded in every aspect of our culture that ignorance dooms one an impoverished intellectual life. Fortunately, the converse is also true - greater familiarity with the myths and legends of the ancient Greeks will enrich your intellectual life generally and your reading experience in particular. So learning more is an investment with a big payoff. But where to begin?Over the past few weeks I've been reading several different books about Greek mythology, partly to get a sense of the degree of consistency across the various versions, also to see if any stood out as clearly superior. This is one of several linked s, which I hope may be useful to anyone looking for a decent, accessible book about Greek mythology. I've tried to evaluate each book separately on its own merits, as well as give my opinion of how well it stacked up against the others. The comparative ranking is obviously highly subjective. It's based on an evaluation of three main characteristics: (i) readability/accessibility, (ii) accuracy/credibility, and (iii) scope/breadth of coverage. I should note upfront that ""accuracy"" is an elusive concept in this context - there are multiple variations of many legends, with no obvious criterion for designating a single, canonical ""correct"" version. However, some authors were noticeably better about referencing appropriate source materials and acknowledging alternative variants, so I factored this into my assessment of overall credibility.I thought it would be useful to consider some specific examples, to base the comparison on a concrete foundation, rather than waffle in abstract generalities. So I looked in detail at the way each of the books on the list presented the following stories:* the life and exploits of Hercules (Herakles to the Greeks)* the sad fate of the sisters Procne and PhilomelaI chose the first of these to see whether or not a given book would do justice to the entire life of Hercules, by providing the backstory for the 12 Labors, as well as the various other exploits, from his singularly complicated birth to his equally complicated death. The story of Philomela and Procne is one I've always liked since stumbling across the word philomelian (like, or pertaining to, the nightingale) and tracking down its etymology. It derives from Philomela, a princess of Athens who was raped by her brother-in-law Tereus. He cut out her tongue to silence her; the gods transformed her into a nightingale, so that she could sing beautifully for ever*.Here is the list of books included in my overall evaluation:Bulfinch's Mythology (Modern Library Paperback Edition, 2004)Mythology by Edith Hamilton (originally published in 1942; Back Bay Books edition of 1998)The Greek Myths by Robert Graves (Penguin Books combined edition, 1992)Gods and Heroes of Ancient Greece by Gustav Schwab (Pantheon Books, copyright 1946)Don't Know Much About Mythology by Kenneth C. Davis (Harper Collins, 2005)Myths of the Ancient Greeks by Richard P. Martin (New American Library, 2003)Thomas Bulfinch (1796-1867) was a Boston bank clerk, best known for the three constituent volumes that make up Bulfinch's Mythology  1. The Age of Fable, or Stories of Gods and Heroes (1855) 2. The Age of Chivalry, or Legends of King Arthur (1858) 3. Legends of Charlemagne, or Romance of the Middle Ages (1863)This  considers only the first of the three volumes. Although it was popular in its day, it was by far the worst of the six books on my list, so my  here is relatively short. Bulfinch's primary sources for the classical myths were Ovid and Virgil; he stated his goal as follows: Our work is not for the learned, nor for the theologian, nor for the philosopher, but for the reader of English literature, of either sex, who wishes to comprehend the allusions so frequently made by public speakers, lecturers, essayists, and poets, and those which occur in polite conversation. That reference to ""polite conversation"" turns out to be important - by today's standards, Bulfinch's work suffers from a crippling defect - all of the stories have been savagely bowdlerized to avoid any possible offence to the 19th century sensibilities of genteel Americans. In some cases, the legend is presented in cleaned-up form (no sex, no violence); many of the fundamental myths just don't make it in at all (for instance, all that violent stuff of the Greek creation myths). This explains the absence of any reference to my second test case - the Philomela-Procne-Tereus legend, whose references to rape, imprisonment, and the cutting out of tongues were obviously too disturbing for Bulfinch's target audience. (Not to mention the part where the vengeful Procne boils her son and serves him to Tereus in a casserole). Bulfinch's version of Hercules's story does little to redeem him. His treatment, which is dispatched in a mere 5 pages, is risibly perfunctory, to the point of failing to list all 12 Labors. If Bulfinch were your only guide, you'd never find out about the Cerynean hind, the Erymanthian boar, the Stymphalian birds, the Cretan bull, or the mares of Diomedes. Bulfinch's desire to make Greek mythology palatable to the genteel Americans of mid-19th century Boston results in a book that may have interesting to his target readership, but is now little more than a historical curiosity. * In Ovid's Metamorphoses Philomela's defiant speech is rendered as: ""Now that I have no shame, I will proclaim it.  Given the chance, I will go where the people are,  Tell everybody; if you shut me here,  I will move the very woods and rocks to pity.  The air of Heaven will hear, and any God,  If there is any God in Heaven, will hear me."" The myth of Philomela is also referenced in Eliot's The Waste Land: ""Above the antique mantel was displayed	 As though a window gave upon the sylvan scene	 The change of Philomel, by the barbarous king	 So rudely forced; yet there the nightingale	 Filled all the desert with inviolable voice	 And still she cried, and still the world pursues,	 'Jug Jug' to dirty ears.""from Section II, ""A Game of Chess"", and later, in Section III, ""The Fire Sermon"": ""Twit twit twit	 Jug jug jug jug jug jug	 So rudely forc'd.	 Tereu ""An alternative version of the story has Philomela transformed to a swallow (lacking a song), with her sister Procne undergoing the change to a nightingale. Husband/rapist Tereus is changed into a hoopoe (or a hawk). ...more",Notes are private!,0,57,1,not set,"Sep 25, 2010","Oct 31, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/588147.Bulfinch_s_Mythology

Brohaugh obviously believes himself to be enormously witty; in fact, he's a crashing bore.Nothing to see here folks. Trust me. Unless you'd care to witness the usual suspects* poked and prodded by someone who is neither particularly bright nor articulate, and whose writing style is strongly suggestive of ADD, do yourself a favor and give this dismal effort a miss. There is nothing in this book that hasn't already been discussed, with far greater wit and insight, by Bill Bryson and Richard Lederer, among others.The only thing even remotely noteworthy about this book is Mr Brohaugh's stunning lack of any semblance of wit.* You know: those fake etymologies for 'posh', 'golf', and 'f**k'; the usual defense of split infinitives, singular data and criteria; several amazingly banal observations along the lines that a peanut is not a nut, there is no toe in mistletoe, no cow in coward, and so on at tedious length. All delivered in smirkingly dreadful prose. Updated  on November 2nd  I generally enjoy books on English word origins and usage - this book was a notable exception. The author covers generally familiar terrain - the kind of material that one might reasonably expect in a book of this kind. This means, of course, that it has also been covered by several other authors already. Roughly speaking, the material in Brohaugh's poorly organized book falls into two categories - discussion of word origins and advise on usage. Virtually all the etymological material has been discussed, more clearly and with far greater insight, in David Wilton's excellent ""Word Myths : Debunking Linguistic Legends"", and by Richard Lederer, as well as on a variety of word-related websites. As far as usage is concerned, one would do infinitely better to consult the excellent Garner's Modern American Usage, or Martha Brockenbraugh's hilarious ""Things that make us Sic"". As a guide to usage, Brohaugh's book is completely unhelpful. For one thing, as a kind of extended, stream-of-consciousness rant, it lacks any kind of organization, structure, or discipline. Then, sentences like the following are regrettably common:1. 'And a nother thing' is not necessarily bad grammar.2. 'Giving someone a kudo' is not bad English.3. 'I am here to defend the downtrodden, the outcast, the hopefullys and the ain'ts and the possessive it'ses and the banished double negative'. To which I can only point out that 1. Yes it is. 2. Yes it is. 3. here the author is just being unhelpfully provocative, since he never offers any kind of coherent defense for it's as a legitimate possessive form.Ironically, the results of Brohaugh's professed disregard for the rules of English usage are evident on every page of this rambling, poorly written, idiosyncratic rant. Whole sections are completely incomprehensible - for instance, the page and a half of text following the bizarre statement that Z is not the final letter of the alphabet, or the five rambling pages (188-193) about vowels. Brohaugh's undisciplined prose is not improved by his insistence on scattering a variety of words of his own invention, along the lines of ""bullshitternet"", ""babblisciousness"", ""catapostrophe"", and ""persnickitor"", throughout the text. A kind of juvenile belligerence, aimed preemptively at anyone who might disagree with him* is the straw that broke the camel's back for me, and convinced me that this is not a book that deserves to be taken seriously. *: He refers to them as ""persnickitors"" and offers the following defence against their ""whining"". ""Stop your crying or I'll give you something to cry about. If you're going to play by those rules, let's follow them to their logical conclusion. In other words, we are here going to fully exercise to the fun game of Xtreme Etymological Stasis (sic).""The preceding sentence could mean almost anything, of course, but in practice it appears to amount to nothing more than the tired old trick of ascribing (incorrectly) an exaggeratedly extreme position to anyone who dares to disagree with the author, then using that extreme position as a straw man to attack. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Oct 16, 2008","Oct 16, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2254277.Everything_You_Know_About_English_Is_Wrong

In this capacity he writes regular s (""Scent Notes""), which initially strike one as unbelievably precious, but are ultimately kind of engaging.

This book, an account of the development and launch of two new perfumes, ""Lovely"" by Coty for Sarah Jessica Parker, and ""Jardin sur le Nil"" by Hermes, doesn't quite match the brilliance of ""The Emperor of Scent"", but it is engagingly written and was a very enjoyable read. To some extent, the science writing, which I think is Burr's particular strength, takes a back seat as he describes all of the other facets of product development. Which he does with the same intelligence and wit that characterized his earlier book: his take on the relationships among the various players at Hermes, as well as on SJP's unusual degree of personal involvement in the development of ""Lovely"" is nuanced and perceptive. A smart, highly readable, account of a subject to which you may not have given much thought. My only caveat would be that,given Chandler's exceptional talent for science writing, I'd love to see him take on something a little more weighty next time around. (For example, biotechnology, genetic testing, or pharmaceutical drug development: anyone who can write so vividly about the world of fragrance chemistry could undoubtedly contribute significantly in making these topics more accessible to a general audience). ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Oct 17, 2008","Oct 16, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1742032.The_Perfect_Scent

Previous short story collections of his (""Ireland"", for example: http://www.goodreads.com//show/...) are so amazing that it's not realistic to expect the same level of brilliance every time. That said, this is the first of his books that I've read that was a disappointment. Although two or three of the stories in this collection were terrific (""Bravado"" and ""Folie a Deux""), most were well below his usual standard. The title story, in particular, seemed sentimental and unfocused. As usual, with Trevor, nobody in these stories is having much fun: we are presented with characters who are mourning the death of a loved one, or who mark time waiting for their own death, or - a favorite theme of Trevor - we watch people as they settle for less, as they learn to accommodate and accept the narrow, circumscribed nature of their lives. (Why are characters in modern short stories not allowed to have fun - do we have Raymond Carver to thank for this?)Usually the brilliance of Trevor's writing mitigates the bleakness of his characters and their situations. In these stories, not so much. There is an aimlessness about most of them which is quite uncharacteristic for Trevor who, one senses, usually has things firmly under control. Not here.I didn't dislike these stories.

ItsThis catalog of historical disasters, both natural and man-made, has a certain snarky, superficial appeal, which doesn't survive a closer reading. Its putative appeal rests in the implicit invitation to the reader to join in ridiculing various follies perpetrated by the powerful and the pompous throughout the ages. The problem is that all but the most jaded of readers must eventually recognize the ultimate emptiness of this kind of schadenfreude. Furthermore, the great majority of catastrophes documented throughout the book are not manmade at all - earthquakes, tidal waves, floods, plagues and epidemics far outweigh the tally of human foolishness. So that one comes away with a healthy respect for the power of Nature to complicate the course of human history, but beyond that, it's hard to buy into the authors' snarky superior tone.

At 300 pages, it's a little verbose at times, but the author is pretty engaging, so that it is fun to read.Nothing particularly profound, but it provides a pretty good overview of the workings of the restaurant business. Dublanica writes well -- is often very funny, and manages to keep a reasonably healthy perspective, even in the face of some truly dysfunctional behavior from customers and co-workers. One expects this kind of book to include a large helping of entertaining horror stories, and Dublanica doesn't disappoint. A worthy addition to books in the tradition of Debra Ginsberg's ""Waiting"", Louise Rafkin's ""Other People's Dirt"", or Anthony Bourdain's ""Kitchen Confidential"". It was interesting that Dublanica and Ginsberg each devote a section to Mother's Day and Valentine's Day as being particular contributors to waiters' hell. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Oct 06, 2008","Oct 06, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2187270.Waiter_Rant

Or talk about the sly subversive undermining of prevailing bourgeois values that had Victorian and Edwardian editors struggling to ""sanitize"" these stories to make them suitable for children. But it would be like giving you the chemical formula for a particularly sublime soufflé, or trying to capture the beauty of a Monarch butterfly by dissecting it and pinning the component parts to a board. Something would get lost in the process. Instead, let me reproduce an entry from my blog. But first, let me beg you to buy these stories. Read them to yourself, to your children, to your grandchildren. To the brat in the corner with the headphones and the playstation. It's your civic responsibility!Blog Entry - Sunday August 23rd: El Príncipe Feliz   I should have known better. Yesterday evening my options were:1. Join the assorted 19- and 20-year olds for a so-called ""Buenos Aires pub crawl"", which promised - for less than twenty bucks - free drinks and appetizers at each of no fewer than four bars, followed by V.I.P. entry to a ""hot club"" in the city center.2. A relaxing dinner alone, with an opportunity to catch up on some Spanish reading.OK, I'm a wuss. My 51-year old liver and I chose option 2.The root of the problem was my choice of reading material. Rather than eat to the accompaniment of the bloodless prose of Borges's  ""Ficciones""  (which, I hasten to add, are just fine if you are in the right kind of mood), I opted instead to bring along a Spanish translation of collected stories of Oscar Wilde: ""El Fantasma de Canterville y Otros Cuentos"". I had bought the book earlier in the day, for its nice simple prose - a fine choice for non-native speakers like myself. So my dinner courses were punctuated by intermittent sections of ""El Príncipe Feliz"" (The Happy Prince).Problem was, I'd forgotten the effect this particular story has on me. As a kid, I could never make it to the end without bawling my eyes out. And sure enough, the Spanish translation had lost none of the tale's emotional wallop. By the time my espresso was served, when the swallow dies and the prince's heart breaks in two, well - let's just say I had to go to the men's room to compose myself.*The Happy Prince: reading it in public is a bit like watching ""Brokeback Mountain"" with the lights on - a recipe for embarrassment.Damn you, Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde! And I mean that in the best possible way.* I'm all better now, I swear.**************************************************************************Tráeme las dos cosas más preciosas de la ciudad -- le dijo Dios a uno de sus ángeles.Y el ángel le trajo el corazón de plomo y el ave muerte.Has escogido bien -- dijo Dios -- porque en el jardín del Paraíso este pajarillo cantará eternamente y en mi ciudad de oro del Príncipe Feliz me glorificará.Bring me the two most precious things in the city -- God said to one of his angels.And the angel brought him the heart of lead and the dead swallow.You have chosen well -- said God -- because this little bird will sing for eternity in the gardens of Paradise, and the Happy Prince will bring me glory in my City of Gold. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Sep 10, 2008","Aug 24, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3294713-el-fantasma-de-canterville-y-otros-cuentos

This slim paperback volume, which I came across while looking for a city guide here in Buenos Aires earlier in the week, is a case in point. A ""mataburros"" (literally, 'donkeykiller' or 'duncekiller'), or dictionary, of Lunfardo, the local Buenos Aires patois, it promises to bring me hours of geekish pleasure.Lunfardo has its origins in prisoners' argot, and the language of the tango, as well as incorporating some elements similar to those of pig-Latin, or the French Verlan. Thus, for instance, ""tordo"" means ""doctor"", by an inversion of the syllables of the latter, and elision of the c, a process known as ""vesre"", by inversion of the syllables of ""revés"".Some of my favorite words thus far include:raviol: a small packet of cocaine (I'll never think of eating ravioli in quite the same way again)fangushes: shoesmanyapapeles: a lawyer (obviously derived as 'someone who eats documents')Of course, as in any dictionary, there are hazards. For example, the sheer multiplicity of the listed meanings. For instance, this entry:papa: cancer, a hole in one's sock, something beautiful, a young beautiful woman, drugsA word for foreigners to avoid, I'd have to say. Or how aboutpamela: a flat woman's hat, a prostitute. morcilla: a d*ck, an actor's adlib when he has forgotten his lines.OK, those are probably guessable from the context.Another major plus is the amusement provided by the dictionary's occasional earnestly hilarious mistranslations.plata: money, fortune, shine, green, duckets, dead presidents, skrilla. (You gotta love that perfectly placed ""duckets"").But my favorite so far has to be this expression, and its priceless translation:darle(s) margaritas a los chanchos: You or I might reasonably think that this means ""to cast pearls (margaritas) before swine"". But no. The dictionary earnestly informs us that the meaning is ""to waste something on someone"" - literally - ""to feed margaritas to the pigs"".If that indelible image of inebriated, tequila-swilling porkers doesn't make you crack a smile, I'm not sure what will. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Sep 22, 2008","Aug 16, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4213561-mataburros-lunfardo-english-dictionary

But ""Antic Hay"" is a clunky, sorry mess, whose primary virtue is its brevity. Heavyhanded and confused, it never gels to anything even remotely memorable.Not too hard to figure out why. There is no discernible plot - instead, various stock characters are dragged in and out of the action, essentially caroming off one another in a fairly random fashion. You've got your artist, your poet, your critic, your (pseudo)-scientist, your futurist, your lowlife, your romantic, a vamp, and a flapper or two, and the (anti)hero Gumbril, who is spectacularly devoid of personality. None of these characters is fleshed out in any credible way - they just engage in brittly clever dialog (which is to say, lethally boring dialog), mouthpieces for whatever point of view they are supposed to be representing. While the reader is left baffled as to what the hell Huxley might be trying to convey.I think the answer is that Huxley doesn't really have anything much coherent to say, in this dull and annoying book. Since there's no plot to speak of, eventually it just sort of peters out. So another writer who disappoints for reasons related to one of my pet peeves - a complete abrogation of the author's responsibility to tell the reader a story.

But there were relati""The Transit of Venus"" eventually won me over, despite occasional frustration with Shirely Hazzard's mannered and oblique style. But there were relatively few rewards for plodding through this disappointing effort. Hazzard's account of the romance between war veteran Aldred Leith and 17-year old Helen Driscoll spans a large canvas, both geographically and historically - the action unfolds from Hiroshima and Hong Kong to London and Wellington, in the immediate aftermath of World War II, still a time of great political and personal instability.This choice of backdrop for the central love story suggests a certain ambition on Hazzard's part - this is not meant to be just your average star-crossed love story. No, this is about  love in tumultuous times, and the romance of Aldred and Helen is presented as more portentous somehow because it unfolds in a world which has been ripped apart and is still stumbling towards a new order.I wish I could say that Hazzard has been successful. Certainly, the book garnered more than its share of critical acclaim (""hypnotic"", ""brilliant"", ""stunning"", ""dazzling"" say Ann Patchett, Joan Didion, while Anita Shreve is moved to such excesses as ""transcendent"", ""sublime"", and ""touching infinity""). These are not the adjectives I would have chosen to describe what is, charitably viewed, nothing more than a slightly better written version of ""The Bridges of Madison County"". By which I mean that Hazzard is skilled enough to avoid the kind of hilarious linguistic atrocities that were littered throughout Waller's book.But does she have anything more interesting to say than Waller? Not really. Aldred and Helen are possibly two of the dullest protagonists you'll ever come across. Implausibly noble and sensitive, they are cast straight from the same phoney mold as Francesca and Robert over there in Madison County. Which makes ""The Great Fire"" a love story that is impossible to take seriously, despite Hazzard's bombastic efforts to convince us that Aldred and Helen are cut from some kind of super-special cloth.They are endlessly fascinating to each other, of course, and the reader is obviously meant to find them charming as all get out. To this end, Hazzard makes a point of reminding us on every other page that(a) they read books and discuss art and big profound ideas(b) Aldred is brave and noble(c) Helen is wise beyond her years,while further stacking the deck by surrounding them with an assortment of cartoonishly yobbish, nasty, colonial caricatures of vulgar insensitivity.Oh, and yes -- Helen comes equipped with a delicate, saintly, terminally ill, sagelike, older brother, who dies obligingly on cue, while Aldred has a neurotic, ineffectual wartime friend Peter, to underscore his own manly, heroic nobility and general sensitive warrior qualities.Aldred and Helen. Two of the noblest, most sensitive, caring, protagonists you could ever hope to meet. And two of the most boring.Personally, I've never been a fan of hagiography. There's nothing like the odd weakness or character flaw to add depth and keep the reader interested. Give me the sodden moral ambiguity of one of Graham Green's whisky priests, or the cool amorality of Tom Ripley, over the nobility and sensitivity of Aldred Leith any day.Readers looking to Hazzard for insights into the postwar milieu of South East Asia during the collapse of colonialism will also be disappointed. Other than some generalized hand-wringing about the horrors of war, she has little of interest to add. An omission that is particularly disappointing when one recalls Paul Scott's extraordinarily nuanced and sensitive account (The Raj Quartet) of events in India on the eve of its independence. By contrast, Hazzard's commentary on postwar developments in Asia seems superficial and uninformed.Despite its rapturous critical reception, ""The Great Fire"" seemed entirely pedestrian to me, peopled with characters that remained oddly two-dimensional and consequently unaffecting....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,not set,Jun 2008,"Jun 25, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/142975.The_Great_Fire

In general, I try to acknowledge the validity of other opinions in my s and comments, something I notably failed to do in this discussion. I should have been more civil, initially and subsequently.Update: WELL, CONGRATULATIONS, PAUL AUSTER!!I wouldn't actually have thought it possible, but with the breathtakingly sophomoric intellectual pretension of the final 30 pages of ""City of Glass"", you have actually managed to deepen my contempt and loathing for you, and the overweening, solipsistic, drivel that apparently passes for writing in your particular omphaloskeptic corner of the pseudo-intellectual forest in which you live, churning out your mentally masturbatory little turdlets.Gaaaah. Upon finishing the piece of smirkingly self-referential garbage that was ""City of Glass"", I wanted to jump in a showever and scrub away the stinking detritus of your self-congratulatory, hypercerebral, pomo, what a clever-boy-am-I, pseudo-intellectual rubbish from my mind. But not all the perfumes of Araby would be sufficient - they don't make brain bleach strong enough to cleanse the mind of your particular kind of preening, navel-gazing idiocy. All I can do is issue a clarion call to others who might be sucked into your idiotic, time-wasting, superficially clever fictinal voyages to nowhere. There is emphatically no there there. The intellectual vacuum at the core of Auster's fictions is finally nothing more than that - empty of content, devoid of meaning, surrounded with enough of the pomo trappings to keep the unwary reader distracted. But, if you're looking for meaning in your fiction, for God's sake look elsewhere.And, please - spare me your pseudoprofound epiphanies of the sort that the emptiness at the core of Auster's tales is emblematic of the kind of emptiness that's at the core of modern life. Because that brand of idiocy butters no parsnips with me - I got over that kind of nonsense as a freshman in college. At this point in my life I expect a little more from anyone who aspires to be considered a writer worth taking seriously.Which Paul Auster, though I have no doubt that he takes himself very, very seriously indeed, is not. This little emperor of Brooklyn is stark naked, intellectually speaking.The only consolation is that I spent less than $5 for this latest instalment of Austercrap. Gaaaah. PASS THE BRAINBLEACH.Earlier comment begins below:My loathing for the only other of Paul Auster's books that I had read (the Music of Chance) was so deep that it's taken me over ten years before I can bring myself to give him another chance. But finally, today, after almost three weeks of reading only short pieces in Spanish, my craving for fiction in English was irresistible, so I picked up a second-hand copy of The New York Trilogy in the English-language bookstore here in Guanajuato.So far so good. I'm about three-quarters through the first story of the trilogy and I'm enjoying it, without actually liking it, if that makes sense. Auster seems to owe a clear debt of influence to Mamet - there's the same predilection for games, puzzles, and the influence of chance. Thankfully, the influence doesn't extend to dialog, which Mamet has always seemed to me to wield clumsily, like a blunt instrument. Auster is more subtle, but he still holds his characters at such a remote distance, it gives his writing a cerebral quality that is offputting at times. Thus, one can enjoy the situations he sets up and the intricacies of the story, without quite liking his fiction.

With the exception of Hamlet, I have always found these plays powerful and disturbing, without necessarily understanding why. I still don't get ""Hamlet"" - probably never will. But this relatively short book by Fintan O'Toole did actually offer fresh insights into where the power of these plays lies. In five clearly-written essays that are mercifully free of academic jargon, he analyzes the tragedies from a new point of view, which I found interesting and thought-provoking, without being completely persuasive.The book consists of five essays:Shakespeare is hard, but so is life.Hamlet: Dying as an art.Othello: Inside out.King Lear: Zero hour.Macbeth: Back to the future.In the first, central, essay O'Toole lays out his objections to the 'standard' mode of interpreting the tragedies, and proposes an alternative viewpoint. This is then illustrated by application to each of the four tragedies in turn.O'Toole opens with the assertion that we have all been sold a bill of goods were Shakespeare is concerned. The standard approach to interpreting the tragedies originated in Victorian England and is far more reflective of prevailing attitudes at that time than of the political and private realities that guided and influenced Shakespeare. To view the plays through this particular lens is to invite distortion. In particular, O'Toole calls out the following as being misguided:1. The idea of the  Tragic Flaw , which invites us to reduce the hero to a one-note character, and results in some 'witheringly useless' analyses (Macbeth is ambitious, Hamlet is indecisive, Lear is vain, Othello is jealous)2. The idea of the  Tragic Hero , which leads to an analysis in which the main character is viewed in isolation, rather than in terms of the interplay between characters.3. The Victorian idea that the soliloquy is the 'heart of the tragedy', the place where the hero bares his true soul, and is thus the key to understanding the play.Combining 1 and 2 leads to a view of the tragedy as a play in which the potentially noble hero, through some flaw in his character, helps to bring his own downfall, and by suffering, acquires self-knowledge, and so purges his own faults. As O'Toole points out, the problem with this notion, which is taken directly from Aristotle with no regard to the enormous differences between Greek tragic heroes and Shakespearean ones, is that Shakespeare's plays make no consistent sense when viewed in this way. It is reductionist in a way that ultimately makes the protagonists seem one-dimensional, not very bright, and not very interesting. Idea #3 is a Victorian distortion of how soliloquies actually worked in the Shakespearean theater. How does O'Toole suggest we approach the plays, if not through the Victorian reformulation of Aristotle's lens? To get the full story, you'll have to read the essays yourself, but the following observations are relevant to his suggested approach:  Successful tragedy .... gets written only at certain times, when there is on overwhelming tension between two sets of values, two world views, two ways of thinking about how individuals related to their societies. The tragic figures are those who get caught in the middle between these two world views, and who can therefore literally can do nothing right. O'Toole goes on to make a case for viewing the tragedies as examples of what he terms 'secular rituals', but it is the observation above that I found most useful. That is, he invites us to reinterpret the plays, not in terms of a specific character flaw of a single indivual, but as expressions of the tension between two competing views of the world in which a given play is set. Obviously, understanding the particular tensions which prevailed in Shakespeare's world when the plays were written, and how these may have shaped the playwright's thinking and influenced his writing, is likely to be important in trying to understand the tragedies. This is an obvious invitation to read, or re-read, Stephen Greenblatt's excellent Will in the World : How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare, which is less a standard 'biography' than it is an exploration of the factors at play in Shakespeare's world and how they may have combined to form the poet's worldview. Each of the four tragedies is analyzed within the framework proposed in the first essay. The analyses, though not always fully convincing, are clearly and persuasively argued. I couldn't be further removed from the world of Shakespeare scholarship, so I have no idea how O'Toole's ideas are viewed by academics within that community. All I can say is that he explains them clearly and articulately, and that I found them helpful and thought-provoking. I still don't get ""Hamlet"", though.I highly recommend this book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"May 08, 2008","May 08, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/483671.Shakespeare_is_Hard_But_So_is_Life

In his novels, these characters have the opportunity to grow on, and charm, the reader - this is less the case within the confines of the short story, so that often what comes through is just the deliberate oddness, with less of the charm. I found the title story, in which the main protagonist never transcends his deliberate eccentricity, to be the least successful among the seven included in this book. ""Old Swimmers"", with its alienated teenager and geriatric survivors of a torpedoed ferry, was also little more than the quirkiness of its characters. ""Milk Train"", in which an engineer considers his life while waiting for rescue in the aftermath of a train crash, seemed pointless, as it lacked any kind of resolution. I did enjoy the remaining four stories: ""Jenny Aloo"", in which an Eskimo woman believes the spirit of her son has been trapped in a jukebox, ""Laughing and Crying"" (a young teenaged boy's confusion following his parents' divorce), ""Whatever Lola Wants"" (a man's special 50th birthday gift to his wife), and - the best in the book, IMO - ""Catching Heat"", in which a racing announcer describes his sadness at the loss of his girlfriend to a jockey.

An interesting feature of the book is that each rhyme is illustrated by one of a panel of 30 artists commissioned for the purpose. As you might expect, the quality of the illustrations is decidedly mixed, ranging from the charming (Celia Biscoe's drawings to accompany 'Jack Be Nimble' and 'Georgy Porgy') to the truly abysmal ('Here we go round the mulberry bush', 'Three Men in a Tub'; both drawings appear to have been done by a manic depressive).

A recent loss is still taking its toll on him, and a trauma in his past is similarly proving hard to deal with. He decides that he will return to a town on the coast at which he spent a memorable holiday when a boy. His memory of that time devolves on the charismatic Grace family, particularly the seductive twins Myles and Chloe. In a very short time, Max found himself drawn into a strange relationship with them, and pursuant events left their mark on him for the rest of his life. But will he be able to exorcise those memories of the past?The fashion in which John Banville draws the reader into this hypnotic and disturbing world is non pareil, and the very complex relationships between his brilliantly delineated cast of characters are orchestrated with a master’s skill. As in such books as Shroud and The Book of Evidence, the author eschews the obvious at all times, and the narrative is delivered with subtlety and understatement.

Ruth's and Eva's stories unfold in alternating chapters until they finally converge in a climax that will keep you riveted. One slight problem is that Eva's story is way more interesting, so that the chapters devoted to Ruth are padded: there are some fairly obvious red herrings and a subplot that ends up going nowhere. But these are very minor flaws.Terrific story, great characters, good writing - ""Restless"" delivers on all three levels. AS other ers have pointed out, this book is a bit of a departure for Boyd - it's more of a straight spy thriller than a 'literary novel'. Personally I have no problem with this - give me a good spy thriller over most critically acclaimed 'literary' novels any day. Boyd has already demonstrated his talent in half a dozen excellent novels - this talent is also evident throughout this smart, well-paced thriller....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Apr 22, 2008","Apr 18, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/400332.Restless

So I expected to like this book more than I actually did. The book follows the standard McPhee schema - in-depth reporting on a very specific topic, in this case doctors who choose to work as general practitioners. McPhee provides vignettes of a dozen or so such doctors, almost all of them working in Maine. McPhee is usually very effective in working from the specific to reach more general insights, and it is clear that he would like to do the same here. That is, by focusing on doctors who have opted out of the mainstream, he would like to illuminate some general truths about the practice of mainstream medicine. However, I think his success in doing so is limited, rarely rising above statement of the obvious. By focusing his microscope only on family practitioners working in Maine, the generalizability of any lessons they might offer is questionable. The needs of communities in Maine cannot be considered particularly representative of the U.S. in general. So the book never really becomes anything more than a series of isolated vignettes of some individual 'maverick' doctors.Which is interesting as far as it goes, but I wish McPhee had been able to do more with the material.

But there were relati""The Transit of Venus"" eventually won me over, despite occasional frustration with Shirely Hazzard's mannered and oblique style. But there were relatively few rewards for plodding through this disappointing effort. Hazzard's account of the romance between war veteran Aldred Leith and 17-year old Helen Driscoll spans a large canvas, both geographically and historically - the action unfolds from Hiroshima and Hong Kong to London and Wellington, in the immediate aftermath of World War II, still a time of great political and personal instability.This choice of backdrop for the central love story suggests a certain ambition on Hazzard's part - this is not meant to be just your average star-crossed love story. No, this is about love in tumultuous times, and the romance of Aldred and Helen is presented as more portentous somehow because it unfolds in a world which has been ripped apart and is still stumbling towards a new order.I wish I could say that Hazzard had been successful. Certainly, the book garnered more than its share of critical acclaim (""hypnotic"", ""brilliant"", ""stunning"", ""dazzling"" say Ann Patchett, Joan Didion, while Anita Shreve is moved to such excesses as ""transcendent"", ""sublime"", and ""touching infinity""). These are not the adjectives I would have chosen to describe what is, charitably viewed, nothing more than a slightly better written version of ""The Bridges of Madison County"". By which I mean that Hazzard is skilled enough to avoid the kind of hilarious linguistic atrocities that were littered throughout Waller's book. Does she have anything more interesting to say than Waller? Not really. Aldred and Helen are possibly two of the dullest protagonists you’ll ever come across. Implausibly noble and sensitive, they are cast straight from the same phoney mold as Francesca and Robert over there in Madison County. Which makes ""The Great Fire"" a love story that is impossible to take seriously, despite Hazzard's bombastic efforts to convince us that Aldred and Helen are cut from some kind of super-special cloth. They are endlessly fascinating to each other, of course, and the reader is obviously meant to find them charming as all get out. To this end, Hazzard makes a point of reminding us on every other page that (a) they read books and discuss art and big profound ideas (b) Aldred is brave and noble (c) Helen is wise beyond her years, while further stacking the deck by surrounding them with an assortment of cartoonishly yobbish, nasty, colonial caricatures of vulgar insensitivity. Oh, and yes -- Helen comes equipped with a delicate, saintly, terminally ill, sagelike, older brother, who dies obligingly on cue, while Aldred has a neurotic, ineffectual wartime friend Peter, to underscore his own manly, heroic nobility and general sensitive warrior qualities. Aldred and Helen. Two of the noblest, most sensitive, caring, protagonists you could ever hope to meet. And two of the most boring.Personally, I've never been a fan of hagiography. There's nothing like the odd weakness or character flaw to add depth and keep the reader interested. Give me the sodden moral ambiguity of one of Graham Green's whisky priests, or the cool amorality of Tom Ripley, over the nobility and sensitivity of Aldred Leith any day. Readers looking to Hazzard for insights into the postwar milieu of South East Asia during the collapse of colonialism will also be disappointed. Other than some generalized hand-wringing about the horrors of war, she has little of interest to add. An omission that is particularly disappointing when one recalls Paul Scott's extraordinarily nuanced and sensitive account (The Raj Quartet) of events in India on the eve of its independence. By contrast, Hazzard's commentary on postwar developments in Asia seems superficial and uninformed.Despite its rapturous critical reception, ""The Great Fire"" seemed entirely pedestrian to me, peopled with characters that remained oddly two-dimensional and consequently unaffecting. I had more fun reading ""Skye O' Malley"", the bodice-ripper featuring Ireland's legendary voluptuous Elizabethan pirate.But the world is wide, and somewhere Aldred and Helen are living nobly, sensitively, happily, ever after, reading BOOKS and discussing big, profound ideas while the dignified family retainer serves them sherry in the library, cosily insulated from the common plebeian hordes of people like you and me that roam the earth in our vulgar, clodhopping fashion. Probably right down the road from Francesca and Robert, and Howard Roark. You all are imagining them in a villa in Tuscany somewhere. I'm betting that they end up in a gated community for snooty protagonists with attitude, in one of those creepy, radioactively glowing, houses created by that spiritual soulmate of Waller and (on the basis of this overwrought effort) Hazzard, Thomas Kinkade, the infamous ""Painter of Light"".Shirley Hazzard: a writer who becomes less interesting, the more of her work you read....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Jun 24, 2008","Apr 12, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11737.The_Great_Fire

This story of the two orphan Bell sisters, CaroliFinal  (May 7th, 2008)Well, by the end, Hazzard won me over, as I got accustomed to her style. This story of the two orphan Bell sisters, Caroline and Grace (and their self-martyring older half-sister, Dora), spanning three decades and as many continents, starts out slowly but ultimately rewards the reader's patience. Once you persevere beyond the first 50 pages or so, the story is never less than absorbing, and builds to a stunning climax. Hazzard is not your typical narrator, and makes some unusual choices in the way she tells this story. Despite having an omniscient narrator, certain key information is withheld until very near the end (the reader finds out only when Caroline does); conversely, the ultimate fate of one of the other main characters is signalled in a throwaway sentence on page 12. In general, Hazzard assumes that the reader is paying attention; the presentation of key plot information is often subtle, with the reader expected to join the dots. Personally, I far prefer an author who is willing to attribute some smarts to the reader than the type who beats you over the head, but some readers might be put off by the obliqueness of Hazzard's style.One minor criticism: I thought Caroline, the book's main protagonist, was the least convincingly drawn among the characters - she never quite escaped the whiff of being an abstract embodiment of the qualities the author wanted her to represent. This shows up in the writing - where Caroline is concerned, the author resorts far too often to telling us what she is feeling, as opposed to showing us through what she says and does. This slight clumsiness in the way Caroline's character is presented is in marked contrast to the author's deft portrayal of such characters as Dora, or the different members of the Thrale family. Her descriptions of Christian Thrale's dalliance with his secretary, or of Dora's emotional blackmail techniques, for example, are wickedly, astonishingly, brilliant.Four stars to Shirley Hazzard for telling a good story, and for writing that assumes the reader actually has a brain and is willing to use it.#####################################################Original comments (May 5th, 2008)I was puzzled by recurrent comments about Hazzard's writing style in people's s of this book - they seemed all over the map. Only fifteen pages into the book, I now understand. The fourth sentence in the book is a perfect example:""Whatever there was of fresh white paint sprang out from downs or dunes, or lacerated a roadside with a streak of fencing.""Or stuff like this:""Even his wet hair gave off an auburn smell""""Her other discovery of consequence was also not original: that the truth had a life of its own. It was perhaps in such directions that her energies had flowed, leaving her looks to follow as they might.""Normally, I'd consider sentences like these a very bad sign indeed. But there is so much mitigating brilliance that I have to view them as the kind of lapse that's inevitable when a hugely talented writer isn't afraid to take risks.

In tracing the team's progress - or rather its stunning lack of progress - over the 4 years between 2001 and 2005, Rosenberg is partially successful in illuminating the various pitfalls that can waylay this kind of effort.Though the book suffers from the problem identified by other ers - a lack of clarity about the target audience, with accompanying difficulties in hitting the right technical level, Rosenberg does manage to convey the perpetual lack of focus which bedevilled the project from the beginning. (Even now, in 2008, no widely useful product has resulted, and work continues towards whatever redefined objective the team has most recently embraced.)Although the book is likely to kindle a spark of empathy in any reader who has suffered through the doldrums of a poorly defined software development project, ultimately it falls into the same kind of traps that hurt the Chandler team.

I'd seen an interview with the author on ""The Daily Show"" and wasn't that impressed, but bought the book anyway This book was a major disappointment. I'd seen an interview with the author on ""The Daily Show"" and wasn't that impressed, but bought the book anyway because of the promise inherent in its subject matter. Sadly, that promise remains largely unfulfilled in this pedestrian, and often irritating effort by LeVay. The book is arranged in twelve chapters, each considering a specific instance of what LeVay deems to be 'scientific failure'. These specific aspects of the book bothered me:1. Several vignettes (e.g. the 1928 St Francis dam break, a 1961 nuclear reactor explosion at the Idaho National Laboratory) clearly deal with  engineering, rather than scientific, failures. But throughout the book, LeVay makes little distinction among science, engineering and technology, which makes the title misleading. 2. ""I had hoped to find out more about this from Tudor herself but ... she had died a few weeks earlier""""Dyer ... seems to have disappeared from public view""""Williams ... didn't respond to my requests for an interview""The book is studded with this kind of admission. Failure to represent all points of view adequately may be inevitable in an exercise like this, and LeVay does acknowledge this difficulty. Nonetheless, the reader is left with some niggling doubts about his credibility. In a story about an experiment conducted almost 70 years ago, to miss obtaining testimony of the main protagonist by three weeks seems unfortunate, to say the least. And in almost every chapter, it seems, LeVay is forced to admit that testimony of at least one key person was unavailable.3. One chapter, about the 'failure' of the BBC Met Office to predict a severe storm in 1988 has no discernibly useful comment to make about science, except maybe that computer weather prediction models are often inadequate. But it does give the unsettling impression that LeVay constructed a 'story' where none existed, then collected a bunch of selective quotes to buttress his preformed prejudices. Several times I found myself wondering about LeVay's status as a neutral observer, not the feeling one wants to come away with after reading a book like this. Similarly, the reason for including a vignette about a patient with late-stage Parkinson's disease, who flies to China for fetal-implant surgery forbidden in the U.S., with predictably disastrous consequences, is murky. What point is LeVay trying to make - that submitting to experimental surgery under poor supervision in an inadequately equipped facility is a bad idea? Well, duh! This type of pandering to lurid curiosity seemed better suited to World Weekly News than to a serious book.4. Maddeningly, in several vignettes, on feels that an opportunity is being missed to write a far more interesting story. A story about confusion of units leading to the loss of the Mars Climate Orbiter and its aftermath suggests at least two more interesting possibilities: an analysis of the culture at NASA which made such errors possible, even likely, or a discussion of the high prevalence (with often deadly consequences) of serious dosing errors in U.S. hospitals. Similarly, LeVay's account of the death of Jesse Gelsinger in the now-infamous gene therapy trial at U. Penn was an even-handed presentation of the facts of the case, but left me wishing for a more illuminating discussion of its implications. The reader is left with the impression that the case dealt a death blow to the future of gene therapy (which seems unlikely). Several interesting questions raised by the case are left largely unexamined, e.g.:* how scientific ambition can corrupt the scientific process* the potentially destructive hegemony of the status quo in the biomedical and scientific establishment* direct funding of clinical research by pharmaceutical companies and associated issues* the appropriate balance of risk and caution in the regulation of biomedical researchPointing out cases where things have gone wrong is necessary and useful. But ultimately, unless it fuels a discussion of how things can be improved in the future, it starts to feel like a slightly smug exercise in playing Gotcha! LeVay's idiosyncratic selection of case studies, his conflation of science, technology, and engineering, as well as a repeated failure to explore the more interesting questions raised by his examples combine to make this book a real disappointment....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,"Apr 11, 2008","Apr 09, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3152599-when-science-goes-wrong

Farquhar shines a light on thirty characters who would otherwise remain shrouded in the mists of obscurity, with mixed results. One obvious problem is that some people  deserve  to languish in obscurity. Despite Farquhar's enthusiasm, not everyone profiled in this book lived an interesting, let alone a fascinating, life. A useful test question would have been ""Is this someone I would enjoy sitting next to on a plane?"" Had the author applied it, several characters would not have made the cut, and this would have been an infinitely better book. Farquhar, or his editors, should have realized that:* The sadly pedestrian criminal behavior of John Billington does not become interesting just because he was a passenger on the Mayflower. * It's a shame that Mary Dyer was hanged for her Quaker beliefs, but a mildly remarkable death doesn't mean her life was interesting. * That evangelist Zilpha Elaw was a black woman might be unusual, but doesn't make reading about her call to Jesus, and subsequent proselytizing, any less tedious. (You wouldn't invite Mary or Zilpha into your home for a riveting discussion of their religious enthusiasms; reading about them is no less unappealing.) * The lives of Richard Johnson and Clement Vallandigham do nothing to dispel the conclusion that most unsuccessful politicians earn their obscurity.* A single accomplishment (e.g. inventing Mother's Day, or the Fosbury flop) may deserve nothing more than a footnote in history.Excluding the duds would have allowed a more expanded account of the genuinely interesting lives. I for one, would have liked to learn more about these fascinating characters:Anne Bonney, pirate of the CaribbeanLouise Boyd, socialite and Arctic explorerMary Jemison, ""white woman of the Genesee""Sarah Winnemucca, ""Paiute princess""William J. Burns, ""America's Sherlock Holmes""Gaston B. Means, ""American scoundrel""Beulah Louise Henry, ""the female Edison""Elizabeth Bentley, ""Red Spy Queen""James Callender, muckraker for the First AmendmentIsaac Parker, ""The Hanging Judge""Edwin Forrest, ""First American Idol""Guy Gabaldon, ""Pied Piper of Saipan""Each of these chapters left me wanting more. In particular, devoting fewer than three pages to Beulah Louise Henry seemed almost criminal. Vignettes of more even length, dedicated to the 20 most interesting characters, would have made for a much better book.But let's not quibble. 20 out of 30 is a pretty decent batting average. Farquhar writes reasonably well, with an enthusiasm that is engaging. The format of the book makes it ideal for occasional sampling. Although your choice and mine may differ, I'll wager that there will be at least half a dozen vignettes that will charm the pants off you. Furthermore, if the chapter on Guy Gabaldon, the 18-year-old marine who singlehandedly took hundreds of Japanese prisoners at the end of World War II, isn't in that top half dozen, I'll eat my hat.**: or any other similarly-sized garment, of your choosing. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,"Apr 11, 2008","Apr 07, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1620374.A_Treasury_of_Foolishly_Forgotten_Americans

By writing a story in which - heaven forfend - something  actually happens, she reclaims the form from those  crafty vampires  who try to hold it hostage. You know the type - those pallid, anemic 'writers', who hide behind the claim that the short story is all about the 'craft' of writing, even as they exsanguinate the form, bleeding it dry as they distract us with their pretty adjectives and limp, solipsistic navel-gazing. I don't want to exaggerate. This collection of stories is far from perfect. But the vigor and imagination that Tremain brings to her writing are a welcome development, and deserve to be acknowledged. This short collection hardly represents the final conquest of the forces of mediocrity that plague modern writing. But, in writing these vibrant stories, Tremain reminds us readers that we have a right to expect more from a short story than the anemic navel-gazing of a Deborah Eisenberg or Rick Moody character. In doing so, she puts a stake through the collective heart of the  crafty vampires, and puts a major dent in their efforts to leech the life out of the short story form.A minor victory, perhaps, but a significant one, for which Rose Tremain deserves our acknowledgement and our thanks...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Apr 27, 2008","Apr 03, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1182871.The_Colonel_s_Daughter

Fortunately, Marina Lewycka has something more interesting in store than low comedy and lazy stereotypes and the story that unfolds is more nuanced than its initial premise would suggest, while still managing to be funny. Although Valentina, the blonde with the boobjob, is indeed a gold-digger, Lewycka is smart enough not to demonize her altogether. Furthermore, Vera and Nadia, Nikolai’s adult daughters are no saints either - they have issues of their own and as the story unfolds it is a tossup as to whose behavior is more reprehensible. The marriage of Nikolai and Valentina sours once money runs low, and Vera and Nadia must put their own differences aside to look out for their father’s welfare as relations between him and Valentina careen from bad to worse. Against this background Lewycka also weaves in the story of Nikolai’s early life in the Ukraine. The result is a surprisingly moving account of a family’s dealing with a parent who refuses to grow old gracefully.

When I bought it, it had already generated quite a buzz - nominated (unsuccessfully) for the Booker prize, winning the Whitbread. I wasn't sure what to expect.AS I was reading it, I thought I would end up giving it 4 stars, but in the end I really couldn't justify a fourth star. Which already tells you something about Ali Smith - she is (in this book, at any rate) the kind of writer who can be locally dazzling, but is less impressive when you step back to do an overall assessment. Most of ""The Accidental"" was fun to read, at times ridiculously so -- there are parts that are pure brilliance in action. Unfortunately, despite Smith's intelligence and impressive writing ability, the book's appealing qualities and scattered brilliant stretches don't fuse successfully to make a coherent whole.The strongest aspect of The Accidental is the writing, specifically Smith's ability to cycle through the internal voices of the five main characters and pretty much nail each one. The sections written from inside the head of 12-year old Astrid are particularly impressive. Plotting, on the other hand, is considerably weaker. AT its core, the plot is just a variation of standard trope #17: ""arrival of a mysterious stranger spurs the other protagonists to self-examination and growth"". In Smith's execution, the mysterious stranger is thirty-something Amber, who shows up one summer evening and insinuates herself into the bosom of the uptight, middle class Smart family: philandering English professor Michael, his wife Eve, a (blocked) writer, 12-year old Astrid and 17-year old Magnus. Before Amber's arrival, each of the family members is fixated on his/her own problems and their self-absorption precludes any genuine communication. To say that Amber stirs things up would be an understatement - she intuits each character's weak point and uses it to ingratiate herself with, and eventually gain power over, them. Plausibility is not a high priority for Smith, so that ""The Accidental"" demands more than its fair share of willing suspension of disbelief. Readers who expect neat resolution are likely to find the end of  The Accidental  unsatisfying - I know I did.But dwelling on perceived plot deficiencies misses the point. The beauty of ""The Accidental"" lies in the brilliance, exuberance, and genuine wit with which Ali Smith presents the unfolding events. The story is divided into a ""beginning"", ""middle"", and ""end"" - in each section, we hear from each of the five characters in turn. Brilliantly, Smith gives each character a characteristic style: Eve is interviewed Q&A-style, like her books; Astrid is stream-of-consciousness; while Michael holds forth as if he's lecturing to a hall of adoring freshmen (until his infatuation causes him to break, hilariously, into verse). Smith's ability to get the register exactly right for both teenagers is, quite simply, awesome, as is the mixture of compassion and humour with which she presents the inner monolog of Marcus, the most genuinely troubled member of the Smart family. Amber's interior monologs, in contrast, are less successful - Amber's character remains faintly murky throughout. Obviously, to Smith she's just the figure that kick-starts the action. As a reader I was a little disappointed by the failure to develop Amber's character in greater depth.Taking into account the brilliance of Smith's writing, and the exuberance and enthusiasm that permeate the book, I think I've argued myself back up to a 4-star rating. There's a lot of virtuosity on display in ""The Accidental"". But it's tempered with compassion - I never felt it was just virtuosity for its own sake. Though it's not perfect by any means, ""The Accidental"" has brilliance to spare and - most importantly - it's a book with heart....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,not set,"Nov 02, 2010","Apr 01, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/127630.The_Accidental

So many column inches for just one book - somewhere the debut novelists whose efforts didn't get ed to make room for the Price love-fest are weeping.Does it merit all the hype? Depends on what you're looking for, I suppose. Price does get the specifics of his Lower East Side milieu exactly right. His characters are believable and fully three-dimensional. His knack for dialog is as phenomenal as all the ers say. My only real criticism of “Lush Life” pertains to its plot, which was serviceable, but no more than that. The book runs to about 450 pages, and somewhere around page 275 it starts to meander. A couple of subplots (a flirtation by the lead detective, the problems of his sons who live in upstate New York) have no real bearing on the main story and do nothing to advance the plot. The final resolution is somewhat random – it’s the result of a chance encounter and could just as easily have been introduced a hundred pages earlier. But, although not the most tightly constructed police procedural I've read, it was very good, and extremely readable.

I suppose if I had done French, rather than German, in high school I would have discovered Madame Bovary before now. Better late than never.Obviously, I knew what Madame Bovary was about before reading it. But I had no idea how brilliantly Flaubert would suck me in to the story. He pulls no punches, just lets the story unfold to its horrifying, inexorable conclusion. What I hadn't expected were his unerring eye for the details of the life of the bourgeoisie, which he lays out for us in unsparing detail. Or how he manages to make us care about Emma, and to sympathise with her, even as she makes one misguided choice after the next. The flair with which he executes the set pieces. And the power of some of the images - Emma cramming her mouth with arsenic, the final stream of black liquid (like vomit) that flows from her mouth, just after the innkeeper's remark how peaceful she looks.

If you find this kind of thing riveting, then you'll enjoy this book. Ashmead has to be one of the laziest writers on the planet. Incredibly, he stoops to the same device again on page 9 of the book, which consists entirely of names given to babies ""born in Upstate New York"". Most of the names listed are unremarkable in a multicultural society, leaving one with the distinct impression, not dispelled anywhere else in the book, that Ashmead is inviting us to join him in finding such names as 'Nayraha Dmarye, Tajae Nylei, Nyeerah Oqay-lyn, Kobe, Anief, and Kody Ryan' - well, what exactly? Insufficiently WASP-y? Too foreign? Hard to be sure, since he just lists them without comment and moves on.NEWSFLASH: The phone directory is a veritable treasure trove of names, and it's free.But then this is an author so self-absorbed that he devotes nearly two pages of the book's introduction to the fact that his employee badge misspelled his name on his first job. Fear not - his next employers managed to get it right. Hilariously, the moron provides pictures of both ID badges, presumably to eliminate any further worries you might have on the matter.Ashmead's shamelessness doesn't stop at reproducing lists of names gleaned from birth announcements. Fully six pages of the chapter devoted to pets' names are a verbatim reproduction of a (not particularly interesting) newspaper article about Queen Victoria and her dogs. Then there are the interminably meandering, pointless anecdotes from, or about, various acquaintances of his. Introductions like this one are typical: ""Mary Tobin Adams Hedges was a dear friend in the late 1960s and '70s when I owned a beach house in Sagaponack, a small town in the Hamptons.""I have my own name for lazy, shameless authors who produce books as appallingly dreadful as ""Bertha Venation"": Larry Ashmead is a complete and utter ASSMARMOT ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Mar 22, 2008","Mar 20, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2094055.Bertha_Venation

She's right -- I have no words to describe how much joy that little sequence ""yanadick, tanadick, tetheradick, metheradick, bumfit"" brings me, except to say that when I first read it, I literally  squealed with delight .

Little claims no formal qualification for writing on linguistic topics, other than a lifelong enthusiasm for language. In writing such a wonderful book, she has demonstrated that no other qualification is needed. If you are a language geek (like me), this book gets 5 stars hands down. The only reason I give it only 4 stars in my  is in acknowledgement of the (baffling) reality that not everyone out there shares my passion.

IAll classic economic theories are based on the assumption that consumers behave rationally, despite a considerable body of evidence to the contrary. It is only in the last 25 years that economists have begun to investigate the irrational side of consumer behavior. This field of investigation, which started with the pioneering work of Tversky and Kahneman, is usually referred to as  behavioral economics. Dan Ariely's book, ""Predictably Irrational"", offers a clear and comprehensive overview of this fascinating subject. If you are the kind of person (like me) who can't imagine using the words 'fascinating' and 'economics' in the same sentence, don't worry, the primary focus of the book is human behavior and its peculiarities, rather than economic theory. In particular, the author is concerned with elucidating how and why people continue to engage in behavior patterns that are detrimental in the long term.In thirteen well-written chapters, Ariely considers such topics as:•	The effect of our need for a reference point before we can judge the value of something, and how clever marketers can exploit this•	How we can become trapped by our own behavior - the importance of first decisions•	How the prospect of getting something free can override reason and logic (is it really smart to wait for free-entrance night at the museum?)•	The effect of social norms (why you are more likely to agree to help your local charity by working for nothing, than for a quarter of your normal professional rate) •	The influence of arousal (we behave irrationally in the throes of passion - what you can do about it)•	The problems of procrastination and self-control•	Our tendency to place too much value on what we already own•	The destructive consequences of people's tendency to want to keep as many options open for as long as possible•	How our expectations of something can actually influence our ability to enjoy it•	The power of price (response to a $2.50 placebo is better than that to a 10c placebo)•	In what situations are people particularly likely to behave dishonestly? How can the triggers for dishonest behavior be disarmed?The book is based primarily on work that Ariely has done with colleagues at M.I.T. and elsewhere. Two features make the book exceptional, in my opinion:The ability of Ariely and colleagues to devise really neat experiments to test their hypotheses. All of the conclusions in the book are convincingly supported by often remarkably clever experiments.Ariely does an extraordinary job of making his material interesting and accessible to a general audience. The book was a joy to read.I highly recommend ""Predictably Irrational"". ...more",Notes are private!,0,51,1,not set,"Mar 21, 2008","Mar 19, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1713426.Predictably_Irrational

I wish I had enjMartha Cooley obviously went to a lot of trouble setting up the various patterns and parallels in this very tightly constructed book. I wish I had enjoyed it more. But really, she might have done better if she hadn’t been trying quite so hard.Let me explain. There are three main characters in the book – Matthias, the archivist of the title (who is custodian of a cache of T.S. Eliot’s letters, sealed for the next 60 years, and a potential treasure trove for scholars), his wife Judith, and Roberta an English scholar, whose curiosity about the Eliot letters serves as the book’s McGuffin. The emotional palette that Cooley draws on ranges from sombre to bleak. There’s a lot of torment in this book. Matthias agonizes because Judith is tormented by guilt about the fate of European Jews during World War II. So much so that she goes nuts, has to be put in a mental institution, where she eventually commits suicide. The middle - and strongest - section of the book is an account of her descent into madness, reminiscent of ‘The Bell Jar’. But it’s not the parallel with Plath that is on Cooley's mind, rather it's the parallel between Matthias and T.S. Eliot, who also had a tormented wife who ended up in a mental institution, where she ultimately died. This is already a bit heavyhanded, but for some reason Cooley finds it necessary to layer on yet another set of parallels. This time an unconvincing crisis of identity suffered by Roberta, upon learning that her parents, far from being the devout life-long Lutherans she was always led to believe, were actually Jews who barely escaped the Holocaust by being sheltered by devout Dutch Protestants. Roberta's crisis is supposed to parallel Judith's breakdown, which was also triggered by learning the real past of her Jewish parents. The problem is, Roberta's crisis in no way rings true; in fact, her role in the book seems little more than a device used by the author to precipitate Matthias's revisiting of his own particular Calvary. In the end, it's all just a bit too overwrought. The emotional reactions of the characters seem completely off the deep end, and are unconvincing in the final analysis. The novel's intricate structure, and laboriously crafted parallels, seem like much ado about very little. So that, despite the book's welter of swirling emotions, at the end the reader is left surprisingly unmoved....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,not set,"Mar 17, 2008","Mar 10, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/482964.The_Archivist

There are certain things you can rely on in a book by Howard Norman: distinctly quirky protagonists, odd names, a relatively remote Canadian location, and a dynamite opening sentence -""The painting I stole for Imogen Linny,  Jewess on a Street in Amsterdam , arrived to the Glace Museum, here in Halifax, on September 5, 1938.""That's the voice of DeFoe Russet, the main protagonist of ""The Museum Guard"". He is one of two guards at the museum, his uncle Edward being the other. DeFoe's narrative tone borders on lugubrious throughout the book, but never fails to be engaging. To be fair, he does have some reason to be mournful - both parents died in a fiery Zeppelin crash when he was eight, his plodding romance with Imogen isn't exactly going swimmingly, in no small measure due to recent unwelcome competition from his philandering uncle. To put it mildly, DeFoe is a person who craves a regular life - when stressed, he likes to iron shirts to calm himself. So increasingly odd behavior by Imogen, his uncle, and everyone around him is starting to get him seriously rattled.A lot of shirts get ironed, and DeFoe does achieve a measure of calm by the end of this book. The hook that Howard Norman places so expertly right there in that first sentence is irresistible - you just have to keep reading to find out how DeFoe, the most buttoned-down character imaginable, is driven to such an act of desperate bravado. The characters in this book are so odd, and behave so eccentrically that, by rights, it shouldn't work at all. Yet somehow it does. I don't understand how Norman manages to pull it off, but he does it brilliantly. This is a terrific novel.Read it and see for yourself.

His essay on the short story, in which he provides a useful taxonomy of the form: the event-plot story (everything before Chekhov), the Chekhovian, the ""modernist"", the cryptic/ludic, the mini-novel, the biographical, and the poetic/mythic.2. The essay ""War in Fiction"" in which he pinpoints the central flaw in almost all fictionalized treatment of war with remarkable astuteness: Any one man's experience of war or battle .... has to be an exclusively subjective, quirky and highly personal affair...... And yet one's reading of any account suggests that the experience is instead fundamentally a common one; a moderately varied but essentially repetitive parade of stock attitudes and conclusions. Furthermore, the basic judgement of nearly all war novels runs along these sort of lines: ""war is hell/shocking/depraved/inhuman  but  it provides intense and compensatory moments of comradeship/joy/vivacity/emotion or excitement."" What appears most damaging is not so much the fatuity of the idea but that this formula represents an orthodoxy in the fictional treatment of war that - with few exceptions - is only paralleled in the pulpier forms of modern romance writing. 3. His thoughts on being translated. An excerpt: My Norwegian translator, for example, actually concluded one of his letters to me thus: ""Hey listen, man, if you're ever in Oslo and short of bread you can crash in my pad anytime"". aFter I stopped laughing I started frowning. ... I conjured up images of a superannuated hippie sitting cross-legged on a mattress in an Oslo squat blithely grabbing at the wrong end of every textual stick in my novel.  Or his bemusement that this three novels ""A Good Man in Africa"", ""An Ice-Cream War"", and ""Stars and Bars"" had titles translated respectively as ""Gewoon een Beste Kerel"", ""Gewoon een Oorlogie"", and ""Sterren, Strepen en een Gewoon Englesman"". (Apart from way that Dutch always manages to look ugly, what's with the ""Gewoon""?)Boyd is incredibly erudite, but never condescending, is a shrewd but generous critic, and has led a varied and interesting life. All of which combine to make this a terrific collection.This just arrived from Amazon, and has managed to displace everything else in the reading queue, for this evening at any rate. It feels like Christmas! 500 pages of essays and s by William Boyd, an author I've always liked, ever since I read ""An Ice-Cream War"", way back in the day.Can't possibly list the entire contents here. Let's just say that the book contains pieces in the following categories (counts are approximate):LIFE (10)LITERATURE (30)ART (15)AFRICA (7)FILM AND TELEVISION (16)PEOPLE AND PLACES (17)Boyd is, I think, a more charitable critic than, say, Anthony Lane or Martin Amis, so there are fewer verbal pyrotechnics. But this book has all the marks of a juicy treasury. I assume that his reasons for including 5 different pieces on Evelyn Waugh will become clear in due course....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Mar 10, 2008","Mar 07, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/376726.Bamboo

Does it deserve its exalted reputation? You'll get no argument from me.Brenan writes intelligently and fluidly, and his account is always interesting, whether he is writing about his own personal experiences, or about his neighbors and the local customs of the Alpujarra. As he was friends with members of the Bloomsbury circle, the book also contains an account of (separate) visits by Lytton Strachey and Virginia Woolf.The following comments on Woolf nicely illustrate Brenan's perspicacity and generosity, two of the qualities that make this memoir so enjoyable to read: I want to emphasize Virginia's real friendliness on this occasion and the trouble she took to advise and encourage me, because her recklessness in conversation -- when she was over-excited she talked too much from the surface of her mind -- made some people think that she lacked ordinary sympathies. I was young for my age, and rather earnest. ... She on the other hand was a writer of great distinction, approaching the height of her powers. Yet she and her husband not only concealed the impatience they must often have felt, but treated me as though I was their intellectual equal. Based on this book, I'm really looking forward to reading Brenan's writing on the Spanish Civil War.Photos from the Alpujarra:http://www.flickr.com/photos/gaelstat......more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Mar 19, 2008","Mar 06, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2299336.South_from_Granada

Gogol has a fine time skewering petty bureaucrats of every stripe, but after a couple of pages it gets old, frankly. Perhaps if I had a better understanding of the relative ranks of a collegiate assessor, a procurement officer, a major, a senate chief clerk, a field officer, a state councillor, a police inspector, and a district judge in czarist Russia, it might have been easier to appreciate Gogol's satire in ""The Nose"". Absent appreciation of these finer distinctions, the satire remains very broad indeed. Similarly, starting ""The Overcoat"" as follows just strikes me as irritating:In the department of ...... but it is better not to name the department. ....So, in a certain department serves a certain official ...Based on the four stories in this book, next time I'm looking for a story which pokes fun at bureaucrats and the bourgeoisie I'll take de Maupassant over Gogol any day.Onward and upward: Chekhov, Tolstoy, Turgenev and Dostoyevsky await!...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Mar 07, 2008","Mar 06, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/19104.The_Overcoat_and_Other_Short_Stories

For years after leaving prison he was forbidden to log on to a computer, a prohibition he appealed successfully. He now runs a computer security business, lectures to large corporations, and has co-authored two books on computer network security. This book focuses on the human element of computer security. Reminding us that even the most sophisticated high-tech security systems can be rendered worthless if the people running them are not sufficiently vigilant, Mitnick goes on to point out the myriad ways in which human carelessness can contribute to security breaches. An experienced con artist who is well-versed in social engineering techniques can often do far more damage by manipulating people to provide information they shouldn't than by relying on technologically sophisticated hacking methods.The book is interesting for the most part, though it would have benefited from a 25% reduction in length, and there are some annoying stylistic tics. Throughout the first 14 chapters, each of which s a particular type of ‘con’ used by hackers/social engineers to breach computer security, the chapter setup follows the same schema:(i) an anecdote or vignette, involving fictitious characters but based on actual events, which lays out the deception as it unfolds, following it through to the successful breach (ii) analysis of the ‘con’, focusing specifically on the mistakes or behaviors (at the individual and at the organizational level) which allowed it to succeed (iii) discussion of the changes that would be needed to stop the con from succeeding (e.g. behavior of individual employees, corporate policies and procedures, computer software and hardware). This is actually a pretty decent way to make the points Mitnick wants to get across – starting out with a concrete example of how things go wrong gets attention and motivates the reader to read on to figure out the solution. One feature of the book which was meant to be helpful started to drive me crazy by about the third chapter. Interspersed throughout each chapter, the authors insert highlighted textboxes of two types: ‘lingo’ – repeating the definition of a concept already adequately defined in the text, or ‘mitnick messages’ – which manage to be irritating beyond the cutesy name, as they do nothing but encapsulate the obvious in language which condescends to the reader. In general, this is not a book you will read for the delights of its prose style (after successfully gaining access to a cache of hidden documents, one hacker is described as spending his evening gleefully “pouring over” the documents); however, the prose is serviceable, managing to avoid lapses into the dreaded corpspeak, for the most part. For some readers, the most useful part of the book may be its final two chapters. Here the authors lay out, in considerable detail, outlines for recommended corporate information security policies, and an associated training program on information security awareness. Though I am no expert in these areas, the outlines strike me as being commendably thorough – complete enough that they could be fleshed out without too much difficulty to generate a comprehensive set of policies and procedures.Despite some redundancy, and occasional infelicities of style, this book seemed to me to be interesting, and likely to be practically useful....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,"Mar 17, 2008","Mar 06, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18160.The_Art_of_Deception

When I finally finished it on Sunday eveninFor the day and a half or so that I spent reading this book last weekend, very little got done in my home. When I finally finished it on Sunday evening, all the subtle indicators of a misspent weekend were evident - dirty dishes in the sink, heaps of dirty laundry, piles of assorted tax-related documents still needing to be corraled into some semblance of order, and two less than gruntled kitties, whose reproaches were getting progressively more vocal. Having written that, I realise that saying a book is more interesting than household chores might be considered damning it with faint praise, so let me clarify - that's not what I mean - this book is engrossing, and you may find it an irresistible time-sink.It's been widely, and generally favorably, ed. I think the praise is well-deserved. Susan Choi writes beautifully, and was remarkably effective in making me care about Professor Lee, the central character, despite his many flaws and almost total lack of empathy. The basic plot outline - Lee comes under suspicion in the investigation of the death of a colleague who died following a Unabomber-style attack - is sketched in most s of the book, so I won't dwell on it here. The plot is not really the book's strong point - it is a little haphazard, with some aspects that don't seem completely plausible. But that hardly matters, it really just serves to provide the framework for Choi's in-depth, fascinating, and completely convincing character study of her flawed protagonist. In the novel, Lee is a math professor; I spent four years of graduate school studying mathematical statistics. At certain points in the book I would find myself thinking - ""she's exaggerating - nobody could be that lacking in empathy"". But then, I'd do a mental rundown of my own class roster, and come up with at least two or three characters who were even weirder. Graduate study in the mathematical sciences does not, after all, tend to attract the raving extroverts of this world. So I think that Choi does get her character essentially right; her father being a math professor was presumably of some help in this regard.A final note: the book is highly reminiscent of Heinrich Böll's 1974 novel, ""The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum"", adapted for film in 1975 by Volker Schlöndorff and Margarethe von Trotta (and later as a 1984 made for TV movie in the U.S., starring Marlo Thomas and Kris Kristofferson). Both books focus on a central character whose natural reserve and desire for privacy result in demonization and suspicion by the press and the authorities. I had a summer job in Berlin in 1975, and there was much lively debate about Böll's book and the film adaptation. One can only dream of a similarly engaged debate in the U.S.; Choi's book should at least provoke readers to think about the questions involved.I highly recommend ""A Person of Interest"". ...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,"Mar 11, 2008","Mar 06, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1193230.A_Person_of_Interest

Based on the relatively lame collection of ""erotica"" in this book, the meaning seems to be that some people find politics a turn-on.

But the majority suffer from the particularly excruciating dullness that arises when the author is swept up in his or her own imagined brilliance. Newsflash: poking fun at Republicans for their hypocrisy on the topic of sex is not guaranteed to make the reader guffaw - it's only amusing if done with some semblance of wit. Sadly, wit is in very short supply in these pieces. To add insult to injury, none of these stories is even remotely erotic. Which raises an obvious question: there is already an apparently infinite supply of embarrassingly dreadful sex scenes out there - how could anybody think that adding a fresh batch would be worthwhile? Or even justifiable? Did nobody alert the contributors to this volume to the fact that poorly-written, pedestrian, sex scenes do not acquire some kind of magical luster just because the participants are campaign workers?Three moderately witty pieces out of 24 seems like a lousy batting average to me.

I’m sure the author is technically competent in his field, whatever it is, but his reasons for writing this particular book are a complete mystery. I suspect he believes he has written something that is accessible to the general reader. To the contrary, this book is an incomprehensible, indigestible mess, in which all he does is manage to display his singular pedagogical ineptness. Mark Eberhart is the insufferable nerd relatives scatter to get away from at family gatherings. The kind of guy you just pray you're never stuck next to on a transatlantic flight. The kind of guy you hope you, or your kids, never have as a professor. This may seem harsh. If so, put it down to my frustration at having slogged through 250 pages of meandering text without ever having come across a coherent summation of what the book is really about. Unless you consider this kind of thing coherent. In a chapter where he is explaining to the reader that he likes to play games with anyone unfortunate enough to ask him what he does for a living:When I want to have fun, however, I say, ‘My research is concerned with the study of why things break.’ Usually a look of satisfaction appears in the questioner’s eyes as he says, ‘Oh, so you are a mechanical engineer (metallurgist, ceramist, or materials scientist).’Now the fun begins as I say, ‘No, I study  why  things break, not when.’The questioner is now doubtful. I sometimes break down at this point and explain my research in detail, but I have been known to milk the when/why distinction until my questioner is just fed up and moves on. ...It is a common misunderstanding, confusing when with why. What people really understand is  when  things break. Fracture, as with almost every other phenomenon, is composed of two parts, cause and effect. The question of when deals with the cause, while that of why deals with the effect. Yeah. And I am Marie of Roumania.You may not have a problem with this kind of stuff, but I do. There’s his juvenile satisfaction in somehow outsmarting the misfortunate soul who just asked him a polite question, the smug superiority about his sacred when/why distinction. Followed by a completely batshit crazy ‘elucidation’ of said distinction. One which divorces ‘why’ from cause. Humpty Dumpty has nothing on this guy.And it doesn’t get any better. In fact, it gets infinitely worse. You might get an inkling of how much worse if I tell you that, despite the technical nature of the subject matter, the book contains not a single formula, equation, graph, or diagram. Think about that. One can admire the bravery of trying to write a book which eschews the use of equations. But only a fool would choose not to include charts, diagrams or pictures. There were at least a dozen places in the book where a simple diagram might actually have made the point clearly and spared the reader several paragraphs of tortuous, confusing prose.Chapter 5 –- Shocking, Simply Shocking – exemplifies what a sorry mess this book is. Opening with some pointless bitching about how fracture mechanics didn’t make anyone’s list of top accomplishments of the millennium, he segues into a pedantic discussion about how people misuse the term ‘quantum leap’. There follows a two-page account of the hearings following sinking of the Titanic, ten-pages about the Challenger (including a ridiculous mile-by-mile account of where exactly the author was on his commute during the countdown), four pages on a lawsuit against GM for safety issues with the Chevy Malibu fuel tank placement, and six pages about an industrial accident where the author was called as an expert witness. It all seems to lead nowhere in particular. But I’m stubborn, so I read the chapter twice more. Eventually I figured out that he was trying to make a point, namely that public attitudes about how to react to such highly publicized cases of failure have evolved from “failure is inevitable, avoid circumstances likely to produce it” to “improve design to the point where the risk of failure is essentially negligible”. An evolution he characterizes as a ‘quantum change’. At which point you just want to strangle the bastard. By his own admission, this is a characterization that is confusing to most people, but rather than seek out simpler, less ambiguous language, instead he adds a page and a half of bitching about how everyone else in the world misuses the term (which does nothing to eliminate the potential for confusion) and goes ahead and uses it anyway. What a sanctimonious dickhead!I think Eberhart is constitutionally incapable of correctly gauging the actual level of his audience's understanding. So, about three lines into any of his explanations, he and the reader part company - he continues obliviously (after all, it's all obvious to him), leaving the reader to seethe in a muddle of incomprehension. Some readers might be tempted to blame deficiencies in their own technical background, effectively giving Eberhart a pass on the wretchedness of this effort. Don’t. The only person who deserves excoriation for this appalling dog’s breakfast of a book is Mark E. Eberhart. And possibly his editor, though it’s hard for me to believe he really had one. ...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,not set,"Apr 15, 2008","Mar 03, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1909819.Why_Things_Break

From the book's back cover:""Cards of Identity is a scathing satire of psychology, identity theory, and class prejudice. The plot centers on an annual meeting of the Identity Club, a group of psychologists who come together to present ""case histories"" promoting their chosen theory of identity. These case studies (three of which are presented in the novel) are not scientific treatises, but fictional representations of characters in line with the author's biases. Surrounding this meeting is the equally bizarre story of the local townspeople, who are brainwashed and transformed into servants for the convention, and who end the book with a show-stopping Shakespearean play.""Nobody is who he seems to be in this book. Identity is fluid, and can be reshaped overnight, should you have the bad luck to fall into the clutches of the wrong kind of unscrupulous psychologist. By far the most interesting part of the book is that described in the final sentence of the summary above - the remolding of several local villagers, through skillful manipulation by the psychologists, who create fictitious histories and identities for seven of the townspeople, whom they then persuade to inhabit these new roles. It's fascinating to follow the way Dennis sets this up - basically, it is accomplished by exploitation of class prejudice, the respect accorded authority figures, and the subjects' individual weaknesses, and is made to seem quite plausible. The central portion of the book, which contains the three 'case studies' mentioned in the summary, is not nearly as interesting. The book jacket states that Dennis translated works of the Austrian psychologist Alfred Adler, and that this provided him material for Cards of Identity. It's probable that each case study skewers some particular theory of identity, but this kind of academic in-joking is likely to be lost on most general readers. Unfortunately, the same judgement ultimately applies to the entire book. There is a lot of brilliance on display, mindgames within mindgames throughout, with much satirical skewering of psychologists and academics. Problem is, unless you have an a priori interest in psychological theories of identity, and some familiarity with Dennis's specific targets, you are likely to end up feeling sidelined by all the cleverness on display.On the other hand, if you're feeling adventurous, I guarantee you that this will be like no other book you read all year....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Mar 02, 2008","Feb 29, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1547246.Cards_of_Identity

Letters to Fred Allen, Russell Baker, Alistair Cooke, and others. But the oddly moving center to the whole collection is an exchange of letters between Groucho and T.S. Eliot, initiated when Eliot, who was an avid fan, wrote in 1961, requesting an autographed photo. Anyone troubled by the anti-Jewish sentiments in some of Eliot's writing should read these letters, which go a long way to softening the image of Eliot as a rabid anti-Semite. The two men obviously grew friendly, and held each other in high regard, as this excerpt from a letter from Groucho to Russell Baker shows: (January 21, 1965)I was saddened by the death of T.S.

Let's open it up again. Updated (i.e. ""final"") : March 30th, 2008 So. I had read three quarters of this and decided to chuck it, but last night my compulsive side won over, and I went ahead and finished it. I still can't wrap my mind around the notion that I should somehow regard it as a ""great book of the 20th century"", and none of the 19 comments in this thread to date really addresses why I should. So, I am asking for enlightenment.To sum up my three main difficulties with the book:(a) dialog that is clunky to the point of unreadability. It's so dreadful that I'm quite willing to believe it's deliberately implausible. But - assuming it's not just laziness and a tin ear - why would an author make such a choice? What's the point? Giving DeLillo the benefit of the doubt, and assuming he could have written believable dialog, what is the point of not using his gifts to the best of his ability, instead irritating the reader with substandard rubbishy 'conversations' that draw attention to their own lack of believability?(b) ""satire"" whose effect is similar to assaulting the reader with a blunt instrument. Whether it's the repeated use of such tired and obvious devices as the random scattering of consumer product names throughout the text, or having his protagonist lead the department of ""Hitler Studies"", there's nothing remotely smart about it. This kind of heavy-handed bludgeoning is the hallmark of a very inferior writer. It insults the intelligence. Authors are generally praised for demonstrating subtlety and wit - why should DeLillo be given a pass? (c) The lousy dialog is symptomatic of a related problem - the characters are thinly developed, cartoonishly described, to the point of caricature. Not to mention aspects of the plot that don't even bother to approximate reality (did you know that just rolling up your car window will create a hermetic seal, preventing any and all gas exchange with the outside world?). Again, hardly qualities we associate with good writing. So I'm left with the question -  why is DeLillo given a pass?  At best, (if one believes he is capable of writing well) in this book he's being incredibly lazy and just phoning it in. Another possibility is that he's genuinely incompetent and actually mistakes his cartoonish efforts here for genuine wit. Either way, why should he be held to a lower critical standard? Because that's what seems to happen with this book. People acknowledge that it is poorly written, with characters that border on caricature, that it's hard to read, then go ahead and give it 4 or 5 stars anyway. Why?*************************************************my original comments start hereOK. I'm 50 pages into this award-winning effort and there's something I just don't get. Why is this book stuffed with such gratingly implausible* dialog throughout? It's so unspeakably bad, I have to think it's deliberate. But why? What would be the point? DeLillo has already made the questionable choice to filter the entire story through the voice of a first-person narrator who was already irritating by page 2 and isn't getting any more likeable. If none of the characters has a believable voice, why should I read on?*: entered as supporting evidence -  I've bought these peanuts before.  They're round, cubical, pockmarked, seamed.  Broken peanuts. A lot of dust at the bottom of the jar. But they taste good. Most of all I like the packages themselves. You were right, Jack. This is the last avant-garde. Bold new forms. The power to shock.  ""Your wife's hair is a living wonder.""""Yes, it is."" ""She has important hair."" ""I think I know what you mean"".  ""Whatever's best for you.""""I want you to choose. It's sexier that way.""""One person chooses, the other reads. Don't we want a balance, a sort of give-and-take? Isn't that what makes it sexy?"" ""A tautness, a suspense. First-rate. I will choose.""  There's not a human being on the planet who would say the boldfaced stuff. Ever. Further examples - even more egregious - can be found (famously) in B.R. Myers's ""A Reader's Manifesto"". So why does this not bother all you readers who gave 5 stars to this book?

Sam Harris knows full well that the likelihood the people he purportedly addresses in his 'letter' (conservative Christians) will actually read it is close to zero. OK: he does state in the preface that its primary purpose is to ""arm secularists"", which I guess means he really had a different audience in mind from the start. Fair enough. But why use the particular framing device that he does - a belligerent, hectoring letter to fundamentalist Christians? They're not going to read the book anyway, and there's nothing helpful about the 'angry attacking letter' framework. In fact, it's particularly unhelpful.I consider myself a rational person; definitely  a priori  likely to be receptive to the line of argument I had expected to find in this book. But my immediate reaction to it was one of annoyance and dislike. Annoyance at its overall tone, and dislike because I think the author indulges in such a selective interpretation of the Bible, history, and the world's current political situation that it simply undermines the case that he wishes to make. The best that I could say is that reading the book made me re-examine some of my own beliefs. But to no greater extent than reading the newspaper can sometimes have the same effect.Towards the end of the book Harris acknowledges that ""this letter is the product of failure"".

Not only that, but people buy them in large numbers. So who's to fault Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill for choosing to roll the dice on this one?Oh, what the hell, I'll step forward and chastise them. If there was ever a book that really had no need to be published, it's this one. Sure, Dan Kennedy's previous effort, ""Loser Goes First"", had a certain goofy charm. But said charm didn't really even last through his first book - by the end, one had the feeling of being trapped in a Denny's booth in the middle of the night with your former stoner buddy from high school, who is there because he's got the munchies. You're stone cold sober, and he is rattling on a mile a minute, and it was fun for the first 30 minutes, but now you just want to get away, but oh God he's ordered a frackin' Western Skillet, whatever the frack that is ...So, Algonquin Books, here are two fundamental questions where you failed to apply the 'minimum standards to be a book' test:Plot: does anything happen? In a 200-page book, the reader is entitle to see a little action. I would respectfully submit that ""guy gets job, spends 18 nondescript months blending into the office scenery as best he can, is canned when the company is taken over"", all facts which could be gleaned from the back cover, is just not enough to repay the investment of reading 220 pages.Narrative voice: should preferably come from someone with an actual personality. One can imagine that there are interesting stories to be told about the Gotterdammerung at Time-Warner, but not by someone whose defining personality trait is blandness, and whose acknowledged survival strategy was to lie low and be as inoffensive as possible. OK, I guess it might be possible to have the main protagonist be a total nebbish and have the secondary characters be really colorful and skillfully drawn. But nobody else in the book rises above the generic stereotype. Dialog is painful. Nothing happens. It's an embarrassment.Dan Kennedy still seems like a mensch, albeit a pretty boring one.

Rosen's main point - that judicial temperament determines success on the court, in the sense that justices who work well with others have more influence - hardly qualifies as an earth-shattering insight. But it causes him to adopt an awkward structure for the book, sorting through history to pick pairs of judges, who are then analyzed in a series of artificial head-to-head comparison. The result seems forced, and not particularly illuminating.I'll bet that Rosen thought it was quite a coup when he scored the in-depth interview with the new Chief Justice Roberts that rounds out the book. But it's basically a string of banalities, wherein Rosen seems like nothing more than a mouthpiece for Roberts's insubstantial, Pollyanna-ish platitudes. The effect is to undermine any credibility Rosen might have built up in the preceding chapters. But how much respect does this kind of writing really deserve, anyway?  If the pairings of judicial temperaments in this book suggest anything, it is that courting attention and partisan approval in the short term is no guarantee of judicial respect in the long term. In each of the pairings, there have been consistent tropes. The brilliant academic is less appealing over time than the collegial pragmatist. The self-centered loner is less effective than the convivial team player. The resentful braggarts wear less well than the secure justices who know who they are. The narcissist wields judicial power less sure-handedly than the judge who shows personal as well as judicial humility. The loose cannons shoot themselves in the foot, while those who know when to hold their tongues appear more judicious. (On the court, a justice often achieves more by saying less.) The ideological purists are marginalized, while those who understand when not to take each principle to its logical extreme are vindicated by history. Those who view cases in purely philosophical terms are less sure-footed than those who are aware of the cases' practical effects. Those with the common touch win broader support than those who live entirely in abstractions. That Rosen sees fit to indulge in eight consecutive repetitions of the same point strongly suggests (a) that he is a moron, and (b) that he considers his readers to be morons.

Epstein is far too heavy on vitriol, with little compensating wit, and his style has a pompous, 'I'm smarter than you', aspect to it that is downright unattractive.

So I am taking the lazy way out by cutting and pasting:I started with those essays flagged as ""attacks"" (on Mortimer Adler, Harold Bloom, and Edmund Wilson, respectively), because - let's be honest - a skillful intellectual skewering of a suitably pompous target is usually pretty entertaining. But Epstein wields a bludgeon, not a rapier, and his animosity against his targets feels way too personal. For one thing, Adler is a former boss of his, and he doesn't seem to realise that trying to settle scores with a former employer through public attack just makes him (Epstein) look petty. Particularly when part of the attack is to ridicule Adler for his physical clumsiness, and for his failure to pass Columbia's mandatory swim test.Epstein is also way too fond of the throwaway remark that plunges the stiletto into the ribcage. For instance:""I do not know of any genuine contribution that Mortimer Adler made to serious philosophy..""""I don't believe Susan Sontag's celebrity finally had much to do with the power or cogency of her ideas.""""Wisdom, in a critic, is never excess baggage. Edmund Wilson, it begins to be clear, traveled light"", having previously characterized Wilson as ""a bald, pudgy little man with a drinking problem, a nearly perpetual erection, and a mean streak"".There are far too many of these - often completely gratuitous - asides, whose characteristic feature, aside from the nastiness, appears to be that they are invariably directed at people who have been more successful than Epstein.And for all that he purports to take down others for the 'pompous' nature of their writing, his own tone in the essays ""The Perpetual Adolescent"" and ""The Culture of Celebrity"" pretty much defines old fogeydom. So that it wasn't particularly surprising to read, in the final essay, documenting his tenure as editor of ""The American Scholar"", that:""In my twenty-three years as editor, the title 'Ms' never appeared in its pages""""I moved slowly ... on changing from 'Negro' to 'black'""""I was not big on 'gay' either.."" Unfortunately, by the time I got through these pieces, I had developed an antipathy to Epstein that made it almost impossible to be enthusiastic about the other essays I tried. (I didn't read the 'personal' pieces). Though I did quite like the pieces on Auden and Keats.In hindsight, it might have been better to read the ""personal"" pieces before the attack pieces, as it would have given a greater chance of developing some sympathy with Epstein. I will not be seeking out other work by this author....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Mar 02, 2008","Feb 26, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1216974.In_a_Cardboard_Belt_

It tells the story of Eddie Socket, a 28-year old from New Jersey living in Manhattan, his roommate Polly, his boss Saul, and lover Merrit, following their struggle to carve out meaning in life in a city besieged by AIDS.Although Eddie does contract the virus, ultimately dying of the disease, this book sets itself apart from others written during this period by bucking the trend of focusing solely on death and loss. Despite the undeniably grim backdrop, the characters in Weir's book are focused on living. Weir's accomplishment is that he manages to forge a sensitive, upbeat novel even in the face of Eddie's irreversible physical decline, without resorting to sentimentality. The story is firmly rooted in 1980's New York, which probably limits its general appeal. There is a certain solipsism about all of the characters which is a little offputting at first. Not surprisingly, Eddie's decline is a catalyst for growth in almost all of the characters, but Weir's account manages to avoid being predictable or overly sentimental. However, for those interested in reading about gay life in Manhattan in the 1980's, I would much sooner recommend David Feinberg's two books, ""Eighty-Sixed"" and ""Spontaneous Combustion"". There is a passivity in Eddie's approach to life which makes him far less interesting than Feinberg's magnificently angry (and much funnier) B.J. Rosenthal. Twenty years later Feinberg's writing still electrifies the reader, a feat that Weir never quite manages to pull off....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Mar 02, 2008","Feb 26, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2902682-the-irreversible-decline-of-eddie-socket

But there was nothing particularly illuminating either - the style was (predictably) stolid, with sentences like the following being far too frequent: There is considerable overlap between plagiarism and copyright infringement, but not all plagiarism is copyright infringement and not all copyright infringement is plagiarism. Thanks for the clarification, professor. The great majority of the material in this book was a dull restatement of the obvious. Even the examples were dull - quite an accomplishment, given that the history of plagiarism is not exactly wanting for colorful characters. The only thing I learned from this book was Judge Posner's view that the difficulty of detection of an offence should play a greater role than the seriousness of damage done in determining the severity of punishment, That, and the fact that he is not a fan of Doris Kearns Goodwin.

Since Hugh Laurie has achieved grumpy heartthrob status Stephen Fry is probably best known in the U.S. as one half of the comedy duo, Laurie and Fry. Since Hugh Laurie has achieved grumpy heartthrob status in his role as ""House"", Fry would be the lesser-known of the duo. Before reading ""Making History"" I had read one of his earlier books, which I remember vaguely as being pretty funny (but not much else). So I was expecting that ""Making History"" would also be a short, funny read.In fact, it turned out to be quite a bit more interesting and thought-provoking than I had anticipated. Blending elements of science fiction (specifically time travel) and revisionist history (what if Hitler had never been born), it explores questions of evil, morality, and guilt within the framework of a tightly constructed time travel story. Though I found it a little bit slow to begin with, by page 50 I was hooked and sucked in to the story, which moves at a brisk pace, and has some distinctly thought-provoking aspects. Provided one is willing to grant Fry enough suspension of disbelief to buy the time-travel aspect, he manages to wrap things up quite neatly, bringing the story to an oddly satisfying conclusion. Not particularly funny, but a very satisfying read....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Feb 23, 2008","Feb 19, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/66859.Making_History

SPOILER ALERT!! SPOILER ALERT!! (tee-hee) Chapter 1: Most 'spoonerisms' are probably apocryphal.Chapter 2: There is less to Freudian slips than meets the eye.Chapters 3-5: Mistakes and hesitation are an intrinsic part of verbal communication. Everybody makes mistakes, and while the particular pattern of doing so is specific to an individual, ascribing some deeper significance to verbal 'disfluisms' is generally misguided. In other words, the answer to the question implicit in the last part of the book's title is ""precious little"". The origin of verbal mistakes lies in the fact that speaking is essentially complicated. People who are tired, or distracted, are prone to more frequent errors; similarly, variation in frequency of errors with age follows a predictable, unsurprising pattern.Chapter 6: The Toastmasters hold speakers to a higher, error-free, standard than is actually consistent with normal human speech.Chapters 7 and 9: People are often amused by other folks' hilarious bloopers, particularly when committed by celebrities and captured on camera.Chapter 8: (probably the only chapter with the germ of an interesting idea) the frequency of occurrence of particular mistakes does shed some useful light on how the brain acquires language.Chapter 10: President Bush makes a boatload of verbal blunders.Amazingly, the author manages to stretch this thin gruel over a total of 270 pages.If most of the revelations above strike you as either blindingly obvious or completely banal, then you will understand why I give this book only a single star. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Feb 18, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1387405.Um_

And the only conceiGerard Manley Hopkins was a lugubrious Victorian Jesuit who wrote some of the most amazing poetry you will ever read in your life. And the only conceivable way I can persuade you that statement is true is to include some of that poetry here:  That Nature Is A Heraclitean Fire And Of The Comfort Of The Resurrection Cloud-puffball, torn tufts, tossed pillows flaunt forth, then chevy on an air-built thoroughfare: heaven-roysterers, in gay-gangs they throng; they glitter in marches.Down roughcast, down dazzling whitewash, wherever an elm arches,Shivelights and shadowtackle in long lashes lace, lance, and pair.Delightfully the bright wind boisterous ropes, wrestles, beats earth bareOf yestertempest's creases; in pool and rut peel parchesSquandering ooze to squeezed dough, crust, dust; stanches, starchesSquadroned masks and manmarks treadmire toil thereFootfretted in it. Million-fuelèd, nature's bonfire burns on.But quench her bonniest, dearest to her, her clearest-selvèd sparkMan, how fast his firedint, his mark on mind, is gone!Both are in an unfathomable, all is in an enormous darkDrowned. O pity and indignation! Manshape, that shoneSheer off, disseveral, a star, death blots black out; nor markIs any of him at all so starkBut vastness blurs and time beats level. Enough! the Resurrection,A heart's-clarion! Away grief's gasping, joyless days, dejection.Across my foundering deck shoneA beacon, an eternal beam. Flesh fade, and mortal trashFall to the residuary worm; world's wildfire, leave but ash:In a flash, at a trumpet crash,I am all at once what Christ is, since he was what I am, andThis Jack, joke, poor potsherd, patch, matchwood, immortal diamond,Is immortal diamond. So, here's the thing. As a distinctly lapsed Catholic, I can't say that I share Father Hopkins's faith in the comfort of the resurrection. Not on doctrinal grounds anyway. But that poem is so insanely beautiful that I start to think that anyone who can write like that might be on to something ...And he keeps doing it: ""Inversnaid"", ""Pied Beauty"", ""God's Grandeur"", and - probably his most well-known poem - ""The Windhover"". Extraordinary poems - about half a century ahead of their time. Poetry so beautiful it will send chills up your spine. If it doesn't, maybe you're dead inside....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,not set,"Feb 18, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/673880.Poetry_and_Prose

Of course, you can't forget who did it, even after a 40 year hiatus between readings. But reading it again was hugely enjoyable, if only for the fun of watching Dame Agatha sprinkle both legitimate clues and red herrings as she leads her readers up the garden path. It's got Poirot, but without Hastings. I didn't find old Hercule as annoying as usual, which makes me think that maybe it's the whole Poirot-Hastings-Japp triangle that actually bothers me. I still think she overdoes it with the ""Poirot's fractured English"" shtick: I do in verity believe that this husband of yours is innocent, but the affair marches badly...  Not to mention the hackneyed ""little grey cells"". But apparently that's the price you pay if it's Poirot. Though, to be fair, I've recently come to the conclusion that every literary detective, no matter how charming, has a shelf-life for the reader. The maximum number of full-length mysteries should optimally be about six or seven. (This is based on my recent observation that, in the seventh Maisie Dobbs mystery, what previously seemed like charming idiosyncracies start to look like annoying tics). After that, they start to get on your nerves.But that's neither here nor there. The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, often called Agatha Christie's masterpiece, is entirely worthy of that designation. Forty years after I first read it, revisiting it was still greatly enjoyable....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Aug 28, 2010","Feb 15, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16328.The_Murder_of_Roger_Ackroyd

This book was a lively and entertaining read - Ha Jin's ""Waiting"" seemed to me to be a fairly dull book, about relatively pedestrian characters, which owed much of its success to the perceived 'exoticism' (and trendiness, at the time of its publication) of its setting.

The proven track record of Ellmann. What's not to love?Answer - nothing. Ellmann doesn't make a single misstep in this astonishing biography. Imagine the challenges facing a Wilde biographer: the contradictions of an outrageous, larger-than-life subject whose brittle public persona masked his inner torments; Wilde's enormous drive, which led to success and acclaim, but also set in motion his ultimate fall from grace. Worse: so much already written, including Wilde's own glittering one-liners - what could anyone presume to add to already crowded record?But Ellmann, who worked for almost twenty years on this book, doesn't fail to deliver. In what will clearly be the definitive biography, he lays out details of Wilde's life, illuminates the work, and cuts through the brilliant and brittle public persona to show us Wilde's soul. All of this is accomplished with wit, intelligence and compassion -- this book confirmed Ellmann's status as the English professor I always wished I'd had. His final assessment of Wilde: ""He belongs to our world more than to Victoria's. Now, beyond the reach of scandal, his best writings validated by time, he comes before us still, a towering figure, laughing and weeping, with parables and paradoxes, so generous, so amusing, and so right.""If I may be forgiven a paraphrase of Ellmann's own words, this biography is also ""so generous, so amusing, and so right."" Sadly, overuse by undiscriminating ers has made the assessment, 'a  tour de force' off-limits in a serious . But I feel compelled to dust it off anyway, together with a few other adjectives from the forbidden list. Here goes:""Ellmann's magisterial work, destined to be the definitive biography of Wilde, is a brilliant, breathtaking tour de force."" ...more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,not set,not set,"Feb 15, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/110179.Oscar_Wilde

This book, by brothers Chip and Dan Heath, focuses on traits which make ideas, and ways of communicating ideas, ""sticky"" or memorable. Although a good chunk of the book deals with communication within organizations and will be of interest primarily to managers, the book also provides food for thought for teachers, journalists, and anyone with an interest in communicating more effectively with their target audience. According to the authors, a mnemonic for the main qualities of effective communication is SUCCES. Messages stand a better chance of being ""sticky"" if they are:SimpleUnexpectedConcreteCredibleEmotional and tell a StoryIt seems fair to evaluate the authors on the stickiness of their own message, and in general they acquit themselves well. Abstract ideas in each chapter are well-illustrated using a range of examples, from the persistent appeal of certain urban legends, through specific case studies of both successful and unsuccessful communication strategies.

The selection is distinctly skewed in favor of various neurological topics, with relatively fewer environmental and ecological pieces, but the high quality of the results vindicates the chosen emphasis, in my view. Among the topics covered:•	neurological research pertaining to:-	lie detection -	face recognition -	stereoscopic vision -	Alzheimer's disease -	depression -	financial decision-making•	new surgical methods for the treatment of brain aneurysms•	medical ethics (3 articles by Jerome Groopman, Atul Gawande, and Lawrence Altman)•	climate change (2 articles by Elizabeth Kolbert and William Broad)•	the fallout from the falsification of data •	the Dover, Pa 'intelligent design' trial •	string theory•	genetic computing algorithms•	molecular gastronomy•	Hollywood's 'science guru'•	the unseemly squabbling for credit that lay behind the recent resolution of one of mathematics' deepest questions, the Poincare conjecture.My top three choices: Robin Marantz Henig’s excellent piece “Looking for the Lie”, Matthew Chapman’s “God or Gorilla”, and the fascinating piece by Sylvia Nasar and David Gruber on the solution of the Poincare conjecture (“Manifold Destiny”).One might wish that the editor of this year’s collection, Gina Kolata, had cast a wider net in soliciting articles – the great majority of contributions are from The New Yorker or The New York Times.

Béthouart has worked magic here, taking Versace’s genetics — its petulant Italian machismo — and adding technical virtuosity (the stuff diffuses perfectly on the skin) to create the scent you’d get if it were possible to combine sugar, steel and graphite. The Dreamer startles you. It’s strangely mouthwatering, like a French pastry crossed with a Thai spice (caramel lemongrass?). Then there’s the hint of ice cream, gunpowder, star fruit, hot cocoa and blood-orange peel crushed on wet rock. in the hands of Slatkin’s talented young perfumer Christophe Laudamiel, Absinthe is a blunt instrument: you smell the 1800’s Parisian bar, the fermented wormwood, the rich scarlet velvet curtains, and then you get the slam in the back of the throat as the poison goes down. Slatkin is smart enough not to genderize its scents, but men will wear Absinthe for its heightened reality."" What do the three text snippets above represent? The winning entries from some mad logophiles' parlor game? Random text from one of those post-modern essay generators? Coded messages from the Paterson, New Jersey terror cell? Why, no. The gray lady herself, the nation's newspaper of record, The New York Times, now has its own resident perfume critic. The maiden 'nose' (so to speak) is an individual named ""Chandler Burr"". The text at the beginning of this post are examples of Chandler's writing style. As a grateful subscriber, all I can say is that this is the most poop-in-your pants exciting news in years.

The usual precipitating event - everyone else on the planet holds an opinion or belief that seems so outrageous and outlandish to me, we cannot be having the same experience. I've had this feeling all day today.My current sense of profound alienation was triggered by looking down the list of other people's ratings for this book, the Robert Bly ""translation"" of selected poems by Rilke. Four-star and five-star ratings abound. OK. Maybe people are responding to the beauty of Rilke's poetry, filtered through the laughable effort at ""translation"" by Robert Bly. But no - several people single out the translation for particular praise!Did these people read the same book I did? This is the most abysmal ""translation"" of Rilke's work, indeed of anyone's work, I have ever had the misfortune to come across. It reads as if it were written by an imbecile, tone-deaf to the natural cadences of both German and English, whose grasp of German matches what one might expect of someone who had seen ""The Sound of Music"" as a youth. And possibly ""Heidi"".To give two concrete examples, compare Bly's butchering of two of Rilke's most famous poems with some other translations:http://gaelstat.com/translation.aspx(click on links to ""Autumn Day"" and ""The Panther"", respectively; a direct link to ""Autumn Day"" is below, but for some reason goodreads doesn't accept my efforts to provide a direct link to ""The Panther"") Autumn Day I've given specific examples in the first document of where I think Bly makes inexcusable choices - changing the poem's title, duplicating text in a way that ruins the metre, making avoidable changes in the meaning. I think just reading the various translations of ""The Panther"" should make it clear just how clunky Bly's effort is. A specific example is his translation of the line - ""Der weiche Gang geschmeidig starker Schritte"" as""The lithe swinging of that rhythmical easy stride""- it's awkward, and the metre of the original is completely mucked up. The book is filled with other examples of hopelessly clumsy language, brutalization of the metre, and - this seems most unforgivable - the imposition of unnecessary changes. For instance, in the section ""The Voices"", ""Das Lied des Bettlers"" is rendered as ""The Song the Beggar Sings"", and that superfluous ""sings"" makes its appearance in each title in this section. But Bly apparently feels no compunction about adding his own superfluous ""improvements"" to Rilke's original text. That this sometimes changes the meaning considerably doesn't seem to bother him. Combine this with what appears to be a tin ear for the normal rhythms of English, and you end up with the ghastly results in this sorry apology for a translation.Seriously. There are many fine translations of Rilke out there. Give this one a miss. ...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,not set,"Feb 10, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/104712.Selected_Poems_of_Rainer_Maria_Rilke

You could say the same about Faulkner, or Flannery O' Connor, Eudora Welty, or James Joyce. But their writing, though set in a very specific milieu, manages to be universal in a way that Mansfield's is not, IMO. That is, Faulkner et al demonstrate an understanding of ---- must avoid cliche, don't know how, SORRY! ---- the human condition that goes beyond the specific local setting. Mansfield's writing didn't have that same authority for me.If she were an artist, I think the pretentious term that I'd use is 'miniaturist'.

While there is nothing particularly profound about it, it is a very readable, well-paced addition to the 'academics abroad' genre. The story is reminiscent of David Lodge’s excellent “Changing Places”. However, where Lodge’s two academics are English and American transplants, respectively, Lurie follows the progress of two American academics, each on a 6-month leave in London. One of the pleasures of this particular genre is the author’s freedom to allow characters to develop in unexpected ways. Lurie takes full advantage, particularly for the older (and more interesting) of her two main protagonists, Vinnie Miner, a professor of English in her mid-fifties. Indeed, the author has said that the main theme she wanted to explore in the book was the way in which people living abroad, freed of pre-existing expectations, can change their lives, sometimes quite drastically. (As an immigrant to the U.S., who still has family in Ireland, the question of how one’s identity can morph with a simple change of longitude is one to which I can definitely relate.) Lurie tells a good story, in a voice that is smart and appealing. Although she juggles her various plotlines and romantic liaisons expertly, the conclusion is not entirely convincing. However, this is a minor flaw in an otherwise excellent story, charmingly told....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Feb 09, 2008","Feb 09, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/202897.Foreign_Affairs

Or that the narrator wouldn't be a detached hipster who spends way too much time inside his own head. For that matter, the warping of the alienated protagonist's reality (dancing dwarves, little green monsters, diminutive TV gnomes, mysterious phone callers, vanishing elephants) is not a uniformly successful device either. Sometimes it's just tedious, reinforcing the idea that Murakami is just writing the same story over and over again. The stories where he doesn't get trapped by his standard formulaic gimmicks are actually pretty damned good. This results in a spectacularly uneven collection - about half the stories in this collection are terrific; the remainder feel like a tired reworking of the same (not particularly interesting) ground, over and over, to the point of extreme tedium.The best three stories in the book: ""Sleep"", ""Family Affair"", ""The Silence"".The weakest: ""The Kangaroo Communique"", ""On Seeing the 100% perfect Girl ..."", each of which has a creepy stalkerish feel. And there's a story called ""The Fall of the Roman Empire, the 1881 Indian Uprising, Hitler's Invasion of Poland, and the Realm of Raging Winds"" which is every bit as abysmal as its lamentable title suggests....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,Jun 2008,"Feb 06, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9555.The_Elephant_Vanishes

About one quarter way into this book, I was tempted to throw it aside for good. But given its generally favorable s, I felt I should give it another chance. And a peculiar thing happened. Although Crisp does nothing to present himself in a more favorable light – if anything, he goes out of his way to make the point that the reader’s approval matters nothing to him – by the two-third mark, one cannot help but develop a grudging admiration for the man.It’s hard to know why this happens – perhaps just a case of sympathy for the underdog. Crisp was born in a time when homosexuality really was the love that dare not speak its name, and made his mark by never obliging those who would have him live life in a shadow, instead choosing to flaunt his difference. This book is an account of the price exacted. While the reader may be moved toward a grudging admiration for Crisp’s refusal to be ground down by the prejudice and cruelty surrounding him, it’s impossible to feel any real sympathy for the man. Because, ultimately, this is the autobiography of a narcissist. Reviews of this book invariably mention its wit and brilliant self-mockery, qualities I found singularly absent. Given a 200-page book in which no other character appears as remotely human, as anything other than a sketch or cipher, and in which the author admits to never having loved, or been loved, the final effect of this strangely empty memoir is bleak indeed. I feel a certain admiration for Quentin Crisp.

But I quite enjoyed ""Case Histories"", without considering it anything special.The good news is that ""One Good Turn"" is far more similar to ""Case Histories"" than to the earlier book. In fact, two characters from ""Case Histories"" appear again in ""One Good Turn"" - it also shares the convoluted intersecting plotlines that seem to be a characteristic of Atkinson's work.The pace in ""one Good Turn"" is a little tauter - the story unfolds* over a four-day period during the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. However, the number of overlapping plotlines seems a little excessive, requiring a fair amount of suspension of disbelief to consider the resolution satisfactory. And Jackson Brodie, the private investigator of ""Case Histories"", who plays a central role again in ""one Good Turn"", and is apparently slated to appear in Atkinson's next book as well, remains flat and lacking in affect. Despite the author's obvious efforts to make us care about him, he remains little more than a middle-aged depressed guy with too much time on his hands.Despite these flaws, the book works reasonably well as a better-than-average mystery, and is extremely readable. * with barely a flashback, I'm happy to report (in sharp contrast to the out-of-control ""Behind the Scenes at the Museum"")...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Feb 06, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/501124.One_Good_Turn

Reader, beI hope the system allows me to enter a  without entering a rating, because there is no way that this dreck is getting a star from me. Reader, be warned! Take care to avoid the interminable scribblings of Neal Pollack*, who appears deadset on exercising his constitutional right to bespatter the internet with his noxious drivel, much as a particularly pestilent skein of Canada geese might choose to befoul a suburban office park. Ingesting that goose guano won't do you any good; similarly, even threshold exposure to the inanities perpetrated on an innocent world by Neal Pollack is likely to kill brain cells. In significant numbers. The reasons for Neal's inclusion in the Pantheon of authors who are not just bad, but detestable and obnoxious to boot, are straightforward:Neal Pollack is not funny.Neal Pollack is not clever.Neal Pollack is delusional; specifically, he apparently believes himself to be both clever and funny.Neal Pollack writes. Far more than he should. In an unfortunate quirk of fate, at some point, something moved the folks at McSweeney's (perhaps a desire to burnish their image as ""fresh"" ""risk-takers"") to publish a collection of Neal Pollack's scribblings in book form. This single appalling lapse in taste and judgement appears to have spawned the monster that currently goes by the name of Neal Pollack; since the publication of that McSweeney's book, a veritable tsunami of drivel has been unleashed, attributed to Neal Pollack.None of this material is good. What is hard to convey here is just how bad it is. Perhaps the best analogy is Drew Carey - a ""comedian"" who not only is incapable of ever being funny, but is guaranteed to suck all possible humour out of any room he infests. Add to the complete absence of wit, the complete absence of even the remotest clue and Neal's apparently boundless self-infatuation and you've got a self-aggrandizing, fatuous buffoon. Flee, gentle reader, flee! Make for the higher ground.* The possibility must be acknowledged that ""Neal Pollack"" is not a real person, but instead represents some kind of overly clever experiment being perpetrated by those brainiacs at McSweeney's. It hardly matters. Drivel is drivel, and if it is some kind of fancy McSweeney's experiment, it would hardly be the first superficially clever notion of theirs to backfire into tedium....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Feb 05, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/72828.The_Neal_Pollack_Anthology_of_American_Literature

Essinger writes with an enthusiasm which is engaging, though I confess that my interest did start to flag somewhere around the 3/4 mark. English spelling is notoriously frustrating. My personal belief is that there is actually a 'spelling gene', which is distinct from overall intelligence and linguistic ability to a surprising degree (some of my smartest employees couldn't spell to save their lives). People who are homozygotes for possessing the ability* are the editors and proofreaders of the world (if not in fact, at least in spirit). Most people are heterozygotic - decent spellers, who get all but the most difficult words right. Then there are the misfortunate homozygotes who inherit both bad alleles, for instance my former employee who couldn't understand why his/her rendering of ""vial to vial variability"" as ""vile to vile variability"" left me helplessly convulsed. Essinger's defence of current spelling practices, that they provide an informative window on the historical development of the language, is likely to be of little comfort to this third group. Worse, his arguments that 'regularization' will be slow in coming are hard to refute.I enjoyed this book quite a bit, but I admit to being a total language geek. Other people may not find it quite as fascinating.*: I am definitely in this group - typos leap off the page to assault my eyes, even on documents which are upside down and halfway across the room. On the other hand, as you may have notice, the correct deployment of commas is something which defeats me completely....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Feb 06, 2008","Feb 04, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/716201.Spellbound

Yes, yes, I know all about his weaknesses - the digressions, the rampant footnote abuse, the flaunting of his amazing erudition, the mess that is 'Infinite Jest'. I know all this, and I don't care. Because when he is in top form, there's nobody else I would rather read. The man is hilarious; I think he's a mensch, and I don't believe he parades his erudition just to prove how smart he is. I think he can't help himself - it's a consequence of his wide-ranging curiosity. At heart he's a geek, but a charming, hyper-articulate geek. Who is almost frighteningly smart.The pieces in “Consider the Lobster” have appeared previously in Rolling Stone, The Atlantic Monthly, the New York Observer, the Philadelphia Enquirer, Harper’s, Gourmet, and Premiere magazines. Among them are short meditations on Updike’s ‘Toward the end of Time’, on Dostoyevsky, on Kafka’s humor, and on the ‘breathtakingly insipid autobiography’ of tennis player Tracy Austin. An intermediate length piece describes Foster Wallace’s (eminently sane) reaction to the attacks of September 11th. Each of these shorter essays is interesting, but the meat and potatoes of the book is in the remaining five, considerably longer, pieces. They are:  Big Red Son: a report on the 1998 Adult Video News awards (the Oscars of porn) in Las Vegas.Consider the Lobster: a report on a visit to the annual Maine Lobster Festival (for Gourmet magazine).Host: a report on conservative talk radio, based on extensive interviews conducted with John Ziegler, host of “Live and Local” on Southern California’s KFI.Up Simba: an account of seven days on the campaign trail with John McCain in his 2000 presidential bid (for Rolling Stone).Authority and American Usage: a  of Bryan Garner’s  “A Dictionary of Modern American Usage” , which serves as a springboard for a terrific exegesis of usage questions and controversies.Here’s what I like about David Foster Wallace’s writing: I know of nobody else who writes as thoughtfully and intelligently. That he manages to write so informatively, with humor and genuine wit, on almost any subject under the sun is mind-blowing – it’s also why I am willing to forgive his occasional stylistic excesses. (Can you spell ‘footnote’?) You may not have a strong interest in lobsters or pornography, but the essays in question are terrific. The reporting on Ziegler and McCain is amazingly good, heartbreakingly so, because it makes the relative shallowness of most reporting painfully evident. Finally, the article on usage is a tour de force – when it first appeared in Harper’s, upon finishing it, I was immediately moved to go online and order a copy of Garner’s book (which is just as good as DFW promised). How can you not enjoy an essay that begins as follows? Did you know that probing the seamy underbelly of US lexicography reveals ideological strife and controversy and intrigue and nastiness and fervor on a near Lewinskian scale? ....... (several other rhetorical questions) ...... Did you know that US lexicography even  had  a seamy underbelly?  And which later contains sentences such as:  Teachers who do this are dumb. ,  This argument is not quite the barrel of drugged trout that Methodological Descriptivism was, but it’s still vulnerable to objections.  and – my personal favorite – This is so stupid it practically drools.

In this new collection, Fadiman demonstrates an ability to write engagingly on a wide variety of topics. Coffee, ice-cream, moving, the life of Coleridge, the essays of Charles Lamb - Fadiman expounds charmingly on these topics, and several others, making it seem easy. Like Malcolm Gladwell, she can make any topic she writes about fascinating.Of course, writing essays so polished they sparkle like gems is anything but easy.

Were I to rate it on content alone, I would give it an unabashed 5-star rating - broad selection of words, with associated definitions and discussion being generally clear and informative.However, one cannot judge a reference book like this solely in terms of its content. Organization matters - specifically, the ease with which one can expect to retrieve the information being sought. And this book sucks in that regard. The author has a bizarre, and infuriating, predilection for separating words from their definitions, sending the reader on a cross-referencing frenzy around the book. Obviously, some cross-referencing is inevitable in any dictionary, but Schur seems to like to give his readers the run-around for no apparent reason.For instance:Why should someone looking up the word  'haiku'  be redirected to the entry under 'cinquain'? If we proceed to that entry, we find definitions, not only for  cinquain , but also for 'tanka', 'hokku', and - finally - 'haiku'. Why lump these four definitions together here, instead of locating each definition directly unter a discrete entry for the associated word? These are not synonyms.Similarly, why is the definition for 'pawky' located as an aside included in the definition for 'pantagamy'? The two words have nothing to do with one another.Look up 'lupine', 'caprine', 'leonine', 'asinine' -- in each case, you will be directed to the word 'accipitrine' before you get your definition. This is because all of the animal adjectives are included together in a single list, and  'accipitrine'  happens to be the first element on the alphabetized list.But enough griping. Let me finish on a positive note, by including 3 of my current favorite words -  strangury:  A medical term, whose meaning can be inferred from the following citation - ""He that hath that dysease .... that hyghte  stranguria,pysseth ofte ande lytyll."" pilliwinks:  an instrument of torture designed to crush the fingers. (The discussion notes that thumbscrews were often referred to as ""thumbikins"", or ""thumbkins"", which seems akin to trying to convince someone that waterboarding is just the latest extreme sports craze.) thank-you-ma'am:  a hollow or rut across a road that causes the people in a vehicle passing over it to nod involuntarily, the way one might do in acknowledging a favor and expressing thanks.Content: 5 stars.

Wilson, and an introduction by David Foster Wallace, there is no shortage of big-name contributors. Unfortunately, name recognition doesn't always guarantee quality and, for me, the gems in this collection came from authors I was unfamiliar with until now. In addition to a terrific introduction by DFW, there were four essays among the 22 in this collection that I found exceptional:""Werner"" by Jo Ann Beard""Shakers"" by Daniel Orozco""Dragon Slayers"" by Jerald Walker""Fathead's Hard Times"" by W.S. DiPieroSeveral essays covered political topics: Mark Danner on Iraq, George Gessert on torture, Garret Keizer on gun control, Phillip Robertson on Iraq, Elaine Scarry on America's compliance with the Geneva Convention, Roger Scruton's ""A Carnivore's Credo"", Ian Buruma on multiculturalism, Edward O. Wilson on responsible environmental stewardship, Peter Singer's ""What should a millionaire give - and what should you?"" It might be just a testament to my shallowness, but the only two of these essays that didn't feel like homework were those by Elaine Scarry and Peter Singer. Gladwell's profile of Cesar Millan (The Dog Whisperer) is interesting, but only moderately so. Personal reminiscences are provided by John Lahr, Molly Peacock, Cynthia Ozick, and Marione Ingram. Of these, only that by Lahr rises above the average; Ingram's account of her family's experience during WWII during air raids on Hamburg, which should be moving, is told in a way which manages to be oddly flat and unaffecting.Essays by Mark Greif (""Afternoon of the Sex Children"") and Richard Rodriguez (""Disappointment"") were just irritating. Greif ruminates for 20 pages on the unappealing topic of pedophilia, without managing to express a single coherent thought, while Rodriguez argues that California's heyday is over in an essay that is nothing more than an extended, solipsistic whine. Finally, it pains me to report that the musings of Marilynne Robinson, a writer I greatly admire, on personal holiness, did not coalesce to form a particularly successful essay.Reading back over this , I realise that the book comes perilously close to a 2-star rating.

This may have something to do with his learning English as a second language as a child (he was born in Liege, Belgium in 1954 and his family moved to the U.S. in the early 1960s) -- one thinks of Nabokov, another writer for whom English was not the first language, but who achieved a mastery of the language superior to that of most native speakers. At any rate, Sante writes so fluidly, with such grace (but without showing off), that the reader is happy to buy whatever story he's spinning. The essays in this collection include pieces on art, photography, poetry and music, and some more idiosyncratic meditations -- on cigarettes, on factory work, on 'hipness', on the harm done to New York City by Rudy Giuliani, on the particular madness that characterizes New Year celebrations. Sante's Belgian origins are reflected in essays about Magritte and Tintin, respectively. Other pieces deal with Victor Hugo, the photography of Walker Evans and of Robert Mapplethorpe. There is a moving tribute to Allen Ginsberg, who lived in the same NY apartment building as Sante for over ten years. Though I had no great prior interest in the musical evolution of Bob Dylan or the origin of the blues, Sante's writing is so seductive that I read both pieces, and was riveted throughout.

It’s hard to synthesize them into a coherent She’s Come Undone (Wally Lamb)A week after finishing this book, I still have conflicting opinions. It’s hard to synthesize them into a coherent , so I’m just going to summarize what I liked and disliked.On the plus side:Easy to read: The story is told as a first-person narrative by the main protagonist, Dolores. Though her actions can be exasperating to the point where you want to shake some sense into her, she is always engaging, keeping a sense of (sometimes gallows) humor as she recreates her story. And it’s impossible not to admire Lamb’s skill in writing from the perspective of an overweight, overwhelmed woman as he tracks her history over the 25-year span of the book.Growth and development: It’s incremental, it’s painful, there is backsliding – but there is growth. The ending offers a measure of comfort, but to a degree that seems deliberately subdued – there is no fairy-tale ending here. Lamb is showing us that adversity can be overcome, but doing so is hard work. And don’t get too comfortable – any ground that you gain in life could be lost overnight. There is something completely admirable in the way that Dolores doesn’t simply buckle, but – against considerable odds – manages to reach a level of self-awareness that affords her a measure of contentment in her own skinAs against that:Hard to read: For the same reasons that the book of Job is not your favorite book of the bible (If the book of Job is your favorite, either you need psychological counseling, or have evolved to a remarkably advanced spiritual state. Either way, you probably won’t get much from this ). The tribulations just keep coming. Guilt about parents divorcing? Daddy abandonment issues? That’s just the baseline. Let’s pile on a little molestation, rape, 150 or so excess pounds, several years in a psychiatric facility, peer rejection and gratuitous cruelty, marriage to a philandering narcissist, abortion, and the death of almost everyone dear to you. You can almost hear Satan betting with that dear old-Testament God. Dolores’s failure to conceive is almost a relief – at least we’re spared the prospect of a child-immolation scene.Growth and development: Wait now. Didn’t I list this under the ‘things to like’? Well, yes I did. So sue me for also disliking it. Because there is that unavoidable Oprah sticker right on the cover of this book. And it’s completely obvious why – the kind of uplift that is doled out makes this book a shoo-in for Oprah-approval. But it’s hard not to feel that one is being emotionally manipulated throughout, on a grand scale. To which my – possibly irrational – response is “Dude, if you’re going to play the reader like a cheap violin, then at least have the decency to provide more of a feel-good ending than you do”. Dead whale metaphors: Give me a break, Wally! Was this really necessary? Best you could come up with? Why not just club me over the head and have done with it?And, if I were a lesbian, I think I’d be within my rights to be offended by this book.You can tell, I’m all over the map where this book is concerned.

I think it's nauseatingly cutesy dreck that condescends to children. But that's neither here nor there, because the target in ""Postmodern Pooh"" is not Pooh. In this sequel to his earlier book, ""The Pooh Perplex"", Crews instead takes aim at various current fads in academic literary criticism, using Pooh as a vehicle. This is a bit like shooting fish in a barrel, but the results are hilarious. The book purports to be the proceedings of a forum on Winnie-the-Pooh at the Modern Language Association's annual convention. Crews takes devastating aim at the whole bunch, including, but not limited to:DeconstructionismPoststructuralist MarxismRadical Feminism (gynocritical theory)New HistoricismPostcolonialismSociobiological AnalysisQueerCultStudLitCritthe Woolf wrote Milne school""As for 'the reader', spare me! The term elides difference, attempts to inscribe on a bubbling bouillabaisse of potentialities one model of a stolid, passive, tabula rasa receptor. Grant yourself a 'reader' and you automatically become a  writer  -- worse, a  communicator with a plain  message  that 'the reader' will supposedly open like some ersatz telegram announcing that he has been declared a finalist in the Publishers Clearing House Sweepstakes.""""As you've seen, the Colonized Unconscious has already had its way with both Pooh and Milne, turning their backbones to Yorkshire pudding.""The book will probably be funniest (or most tragic) to academics who actually have to navigate the sordid back alleys of lit crit to ensure their professional survival.

Compiled by the self-anointed, self-important guardians of the shrine of high literature. People whose primary goal seems to have been to make us all feel bad about ourselves.""Pure Pleasure"", John Carey's ""guide to the 20th century's most enjoyable books"", is a welcome antidote to the kind of supercilious high-mindedness exuded by most critics. In his refreshingly down to earth introduction, he asks rhetorically of lists like the infamous 1,001 books to read before you die: 'Who are these daunting league-tables meant for? Not, surely, other human beings."" As a counterpoint, he has compiled his own list of fifty books written in the 20th century, with the only criterion being the amount of pleasure that reading them brought him. ""Pure Pleasure"", which first appeared as a series of weekly essays in the London Times, is nothing more than that list, with an essay on each book in which he tries to isolate what it was about that particular selection that made it enjoyable to read. As he explains in the introduction, he has not included ""books he never managed to finish"" (so no Proust), or given a place to books solely based on their critical acclaim (so Joyce is represented by the ""Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man"", rather than ""Ulysses"".Both the list, and the accompanying essays, are terrific. Carey casts new light on old favorites (""The Hound of the Baskervilles"", ""The Man Who Was Thursday"", ""The Great Gatsby""), has an excellent representation of poetry (T.S. Eliot, Edward Thomas, W.B. Yeats, A.E. Houseman, W.H. Auden, Seamus Heaney, Stevie Smith, Ted Hughes, Philip Larkin), and has a way of loading each essay with unforgettable gems:""Those who think of Evelyn Waugh as a venomous old snob should try the early novels, written when he was still vulnerable and adrift""""Brighton Rock is a novel that got out of hand.""""Why one of our supreme poetic masters should have needed the help of beliefs that would disgrace a fairground fortuneteller is a question that takes us to the heart of the modern poet's predicament."" (on Yeats)""His words seem to light up avenues in the brain that have never been opened before, but that we immediately recognize as the dwelling-place of our own feelings."" (on T.S. Eliot)In addition to its predictable pleasures, John Carey's list includes a few authors who you may not have come across before: Sylvia Townsend Warner, William Empson, Keith Douglas, Edward Thomas. Carey is so persuasive about the authors you already know, that you will be moved to add these unfamiliar authors to your reading list.This is an extraordinary book, which I strongly recommend....more",Notes are private!,0,29,1,not set,not set,"Jan 21, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1259289.Pure_Pleasure

Fortunately, closer reading of his introduction to this short, amusing, book reveals a refreshing tongue-in-cheek attitude. I can imagine that the author's smart aleckness could lose its appeal over the long haul, but it works quite well in a book of this size (500 words defined; 178 pages). Mr Bowler is a self-professed logophile:"".. if words are weapons, they are also toys. They are fun to play with... ""who doesn't take himself too seriously:""Pronunciations are not given ... The reader who genuinely wishes to equip himself with the vocabulary of a Superior Person should be prepared to submit to the intellectual discipline of finding out the pronunciations for himself.""Two sample entries should be enough to convey the flavor of the book: abecedarian insult  ""Sir, you are an apogenous, bovaristic, coprolalial, dasypygal, excerebrose, facinorous, gnathonic, hircine, ithyphallic, jumentous, kyphotic, labrose, mephitic, napiform, oligophrenial, papuliferous, quisquilian, rebarbative, saponaceous, thersitical, unguinous, ventripotent, wlatsome, xylocephalous, yirning, zoophyte"". Translation: ""Sir, you are an impotent, conceited, obscene, hairy-buttocked, brainless, wicked, toadying, goatish, indecent, stable-smelling, hunchbacked, thick-lipped, stinking, turnip-shaped, feeble-minded, pimply, trashy, repellent, smarmy, foul-mouthed, greasy, gluttonous, loathsome, wooden-headed, whining, extremely low form of animal life."" gralloch  (verb): To disembowel a deer.

Ultimately, an excess of cleverness marred 'In Persuasion Nation' for me, and the same is true of this collection. There are some terrific pieces - the title essay, in particular, is a tour de force. I loved his analysis of the Barthelme story and the essay on Twain. The piece on Dubai and 'Thought Experiment' were great, but I think both have been anthologized previously, as I'd read each already. Although 'Buddha Boy' was well-written, the subject matter didn't interest me all that much. 'A Survey of the Literature', 'Ask the Optimist' and 'Manifesto' were considerably less successful, each bogging down in its own cleverness long before reaching a merciful end. So, this collection stacks up pretty much like every David Foster Wallace collection I've ever bought (and I've bought them all) - two or three essays so brilliant they leave me breathless, three or four more that are good, but not great, and some that are just headache-inducing. Except that generally Wallace's brilliance can land him a fourth star.

It wWhen I had my recent physical, HIV testing was offered as an optional addition to the regular hematology panel, so I went ahead and got the test. It was reassuringly negative, but what struck me was the difference between getting tested in 2010 and the first time I was tested back in 1985. Back then, the probability of testing positive was distinctly higher (I was a gay man in my twenties, living across the river from downtown Manhattan, and several of my friends had tested positive). Back then, a positive test was also a death sentence. For the three days before the test result came back I was climbing the walls.It's hard to remember now just how terrible a time that was. Even though I was negative, several of my friends were not as lucky. Throughout the New York area, young men in their twenties and thirties were dying way before their time, struck down by opportunistic infections nobody had ever heard of; many were isolated and stigmatized, while Reagan could barely bring himself to say the name of the disease that was killing them.In response to the epidemic, gay writing sprouted a new branch overnight. Reading back over much of what was written at the height of the epidemic is, for the most part, a fairly grim exercise. Most of it is heartbreaking, but not very good. People were understandably angry, frightened and confused, but not always able to channel their feelings into a coherent shape. There was, however, one magnificent exception. Out of all the chaos and pain, as first his friends, and then he himself, were getting sick and dying, David Feinberg wrote two 'plague diaries' that capture the times perfectly with unflinching honesty. Eighty-Sixed is the first of the pair (the other is Spontaneous Combustion). It's raw, visceral, confused, angry, satirical, and one of the funniest books you will ever read in your life. The second book is just as affecting, and just as funny. Feinberg was not about to go gently into that good night - throughout both books he rails constantly against the disease that was ravaging his world, as well as at the institutionalized stupidity, hypocrisy and inefficiency that was characteristic of the early response to the disease. Don't get me wrong. These books are hilarious, but they will break your heart. Feinberg did not live to experience the discovery of the treatments that stopped an AIDS diagnosis from being a death sentence. He did, however, leave behind these two extraordinary books, which are truly the canonical accounts of a particularly dark time. Much of the material written about the epidemic doesn't hold up over time - Feinberg's account is the honorable, unforgettable, exception - one which still holds extraordinary power. ...more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,not set,Jan 1989,"Jan 20, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/340929.Eighty_Sixed

Based on this book (there's a followup volume, ""Toujours Tingo"", which I haven't read), and the author's own website:http://themeaningoftingo.blogspot.com/one is forced to the inexorable conclusion that Monsieur J de B is* extraordinarily gullible* incredibly lazy* a cynic who is onto a good thing and not above milking it for all it's worth* some disturbingly human combination of the above three.Personally, I opt for the fourth choice.""The Meaning of Tingo"" purports to be a collection of words in various languages which are essentially untranslatable. As such, they offer a unique view into the way different peoples and cultures look at the world, new insights into ""the human condition"" and blahdeblahdeblah ...People love this kind of shit. They lap it up. I'll be the first to admit - I'm a bit of a sucker for it myself. One of the appeals of learning a foreign language is that it does force you to look at the world a bit differently. And, on the surface, it would appear that ""The meaning of Tingo"" delivers up a rich feast. I mean, who could resist:razbliuto: 'the sentimental feeling you have about someone you once loved but no longer do' (Russian)Scheissenbedauern: ‘the disappointment one feels when something turns out not nearly as badly as one had expected’ (German)seigneur-terrasse: Someone who spends time, but not money, at a café. (French; literally, 'lord of the terrace')agobilles: a burglar's tools. (German)The problem is, none of the words above actually exists. Something Monsieur J de B could have presumably found out if he had cracked a dictionary, or consulted even one native French, Russian, or German speaker. That German speaker, or indeed any student of German, could have told him that a 'word' such as 'Scheissenbedauern' could not exist, as it violates the basic rules for constructing compound words in the language. But, no, it appears that whatever minimal research he did was conducted exclusively online. Now there's a recipe for accuracy and attention to detail.How about:sucrer les fraises: to die (literally, ""to sugar the strawberries""aardappel: Dutch for ""potato"" (literally, 'hard apple')koshatnik: a dealer in stolen cats.Nope. Nope. And nope again.""Sucrer les fraises"" does exist in French, but it is used to describe a Parkinson-like tremor, not the act of dying. 'Aardappel' means 'earth-apple'. 'Koshatnik', if it means anything at all, might be used to describe a 'cat-lover' or 'cat person', but 'dealer in stolen cats' suggests that someone's leg is being pulled.And that's the fundamental problem with this superficially appealing book. One Amazon er, a native Russian speaker, identifies 80% of the Russian 'words' as being unrecognizable, garbled, or non-existent. There are similar objections from native Chinese, French, German, and Turkish speakers.Which leads to my scoring:Breadth of coverage: 2Research: 0Usability: 2Charm: 0 (because it's not charming to lead your readership down the garden path with ignorance masquerading as fact, no matter how idiosyncratically entertaining)This book is moderately entertaining rubbish.Two stars....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,not set,"Jan 19, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/855189.The_Meaning_of_Tingo_and_Other_Extraordinary_Words_from_around_the_World

For me, it's a toss-up between two contenders for the title.Many would give the crown to Scotland's famous ""disaster poet"", William Topaz McGonagall. While he is possibly best known for his chronicling of 'The Tay Bridge Disaster', and other catastrophes, I think that focusing solely on his disaster verse does him an injustice. There are his heartfelt odes to the towns and cities of his native Scotland (every town merits at least one, and trust me, not a statue or landmark goes unmentioned). Here is a fair sample:  ""Bonnie Montrose""Beautiful town of Montrose, I will now commence my lay,And I will write in praise of thee without dismay,And in spite of all your foes,I will venture to call thee Bonnie Montrose.Your beautiful Chain Bridge is magnificent to be seen,Spanning the river Esk, a beautiful tidal stream,Which abounds with trout and salmon,And can be had for the catching without any gammon.Then as for the Mid Links, it is most beautiful to be seen, And I'm sure is a very nice bowling green,Where young men can enjoy themselves and inhale the pure air,Emanating from the sea and the beautiful flowers there.And as for the High Street, it's most beautiful to see,There's no street can surpass it in the town of Dundee,Because it is so long and wide,That the people can pass on either sideWithout jostling one anotherOr going to any bother.Beautiful town of Montrose, near by the seaside,With your fine shops and streets so wide,'Tis health for the people that in you reside,Because they do inhale the pure fragrant air,Emanating from the sea waves and shrubberies growing there;And the inhabitants of Montrose ought to feel gay,Because you are one of the bonniest towns in Scotland at the present day. Who could possibly compete with that inspired drivel?Well, it's a tough challenge, but I think a claim can be made that James McIntyre, Ontario's Chaucer of Cheese, can go eye-to-eye against the great McGonagall and not blink. Sure, he's not as prolific. But he is much, much worse.  Dairy OdeOur muse it doth refuse to singOf cheese made early in the spring,When cows give milk from spring fodderYou cannot make a good cheddar.The quality is often vileOf cheese that is made in April,Therefore we think for that reasonYou should make later in the season.Cheese making you should delayUntil about the first of May.Then cows do feed on grassy fieldAnd rich milk they abundant yield.Ontario cannot competeWith the Northwest in raising wheat,For cheaper there they it can growSo price in future may be low.Though this a hardship it may seem,Rejoice that you have got the cream,In this land of milk and honey,Where dairy farmers do make money.Utensils must be clean and sweet,So cheese with first class can compete,And daily polish up milk pans,Take pains with vats and with milk cans.And it is important matterTo allow no stagnant water,But water from pure well or streamThe cow must drink to give pure cream.Canadian breeds 'tis best to pairWith breeds from the shire of Ayr,They thrive on our Canadian feedAnd are for milking splendid breed.Though 'gainst spring cheese some do mutter,Yet spring milk also makes bad butter,Then there doth arise the queryHow to utilize it in the dairy.The milk it floats in great spring floodThough it is not so rich and good,Let us be thankful for this streamOf milk and also curds and cream.All dairymen their highest aimsShould be to make the vale of Thames,Where milk doth so abundant flow,Dairyland of Ontario. But, who knows? Maybe you will come across your own special favorite in this delightful compendium of horrors. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,not set,"Jan 17, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2195095.In_Search_Of_The_World_s_Worst_Writers

During his neurology residency at Johns Hopkins, he had done the family genetic study which established that the 'photic sneeze reflex' (sneezing in response to bright sunlight) is an autosomal dominant trait. It pretty much made his day when I told him that I already knew who he was because I had read about him in 'The Straight Dope'. Much more so than if I'd said I read the research paper he had written.

Each essay in 'Character Studies' focuses on just one person, so the selection of subjects is a major determinant of the quality of the pieces. And what an odd selection it is:Ricky JayDonald TrumpJoe MitchellPablo Bush Romero, so-called member of the 'intelligentsia' of El Paso, with a bee in his bonnet about the skull of Pancho VillaTom Chino, grower of organic vegetables in Del Mar CARichard Seiverling, organizer of a Tom Mix festivalSera somebody, a prototypical soccer mom Michael Zinman, a book dealerMartin ScorseseWell, of course the piece about Ricky Jay is great - fortunately it's the longest in the book. And Scorsese doesn't disappoint either, though one might have wished for Singer to cut down on the hagiography and ask a couple of tough questions. That's about it, really. I wasn't feeling a burning need to learn more about Joe Mitchell, given that I already have a copy of 'Up in the Old Hotel', New Yorker characters aren't quite as fascinating as they themselves might believe. And your Uncle Jasper is more interesting than the rest of the characters combined. Some of the essays are almost painfully boring - you cringe for the misfortunate children of the soccer mom from hell, and a Tom Mix festival has all the fascination potential of a Star Trek convention. I know, I know - everyone has a fascinating story, just waiting for the right reporter to come along and set it free, by asking just the right combination of questions.

The author just seems like a crashing bore with way too much time on his hands, all the better to peer out at the damp English countryside and wax pompous.I'll grant you - this may have something to do with my INTJ personality type, which involves a fair amount of obliviousness to my surroundings.

The music crescendos in ominous cacophony; the camera zooms in as the horrifying realization dawns across the protagonist’s face ....As I read this collection of stories, the third book by Padgett Powell, I experienced that exact same sinking feeling. Here’s an author whose first novel, “Edisto”, was one of the most enchanting books I had read in 1984, the year it was published. So when I came across this collection in the second-hand book store, buying it seemed like a no-brainer. Caveat lector! As it says in those indigestible mutual fund prospectuses that clog my mailbox daily, “past success is no guarantee of future performance”.In this case, the warning signals were loud and clear. Had I just taken the time to do a little skimming in the store, I would have surely seen the warning signs. “Stories” with titles like “Mr. Irony Renounces Irony”, “Dr. Ordinary”, “General Rancidity”, “Mr. Nefarious”, “Miss Resignation”. These sound like homework assignments from a graduate writing workshop in hell, and that’s pretty much the way they read as well. Mr. Powell apparently thinks this kind of thing may be passed off as writing:“Dr. Ordinary found solace in nothing. He found his shoes untied during surgery. He found his mother once, when she was in her sixties, naked in the bathtub calling for a fresh martini. He found bluebirds too far south. He found pies too sweet to eat. He found God with no difficulty, but locating his belief another matter. “And so on, for a total of three wretched pages, and sixty repetitions of the phrase “He found..”. If this kind of thing strikes you as insufferable, you are unlikely to find “General Rancidity”, which is just more of the same with the verb ‘run’ instead of the verb ‘find’, any better.It gets worse. Four of the ‘stories’ are named for states: Kansas, Texas, South Carolina and Florida. Here is the first 30% or so of ‘Texas’:“I fell off the lightning rod. I entered the sweepstakes. I lost control. I became beautiful. I charmed a queen. I defied gravity. I moved mountains. I bowled. I wept, mourned, moped, and sped about town in a convertible, progressively irascing the gendarme until I was charged with exhibitionist speed.”My feelings about this toxic insult to the intelligence may be summed up as follows:Dr. Giltinan found this book to be worthless dreck. Or, if you prefer:I wanted to vomit. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,Jan 2008,"Jan 07, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/104117.Typical

But it's been 12 years since his wife, Irene, left him - and since he didn't pursue divorce proceedings immediately when she did, and she has remained alone, getting a divorce now is not a simple matter. And, when he meets her again, he still finds her bewitching. More to the point (in Soames's mind), she is still his property, and she has done him a grave wrong. (Never mind that he raped her in Volume 1 - he doesn't see it that way).Things aren't going smoothly for his sister Winifred either. Husband Montie has hocked her pearls and fled to Argentina with a dancer. So Winifred too must look to the divorce courts for protection.Meanwhile, despised cousin Jolyon is living in the house at Robin Hill that Soames commissioned and that led to Irene's flight. Worse yet, in a fit of apparent senility, before his death, Jolyon's father, Old Jolyon, added Irene as a beneficiary to his will.

Jon has sold the farm in North Carolina, to return to England with his lovely bride, Anne, and his mother. (However, Irene never appears throughout the book; Galsworthy uses the excuse of the strike to sequester her offstage in Paris throughout.)Predictably, this does not bring out the best in Fleur, whose spoiled only-child status and doting father have managed to confer on her many of the less appealing attributes of Paris Hilton and Britney. By page 50, she's in full stalker mode. This continues, bringing much worriment to all three men in her life (husband Michael, her stalking target Jon, and her dear Papa Soames). When Jon's wife becomes pregnant, he cuts off all further contact, forcing her to recognize the futility of her stalkerish behavior. So she falls back on the only other behavior pattern she knows, and goes into a major sulk.Poor Soames! She's such a brat, but she is his only daughter. But really, the way she behaves - it'll be the death of him. And, in fact, it is. Allowing Galsworthy to round out the series with the death of Soames, in an unexpectedly moving, but emotionally satisfying, conclusion. Because, although Fleur is such a bitch that the reader really doesn't give a toss about the outcome of her efforts at adultery, by the end of this sixth book Galsworthy manages to make us care deeply about Soames.

The White Monkey  is inferior to the three volumes that precede it on several counts. At the most fundamental level, the plot is wafer-thin: very little of consequence happens in this book, to any of the characters. Also, the Forsytes no longer occupy the central role that they played in the initial trilogy - of his generation, only Soames and Winifred maintain much of a presence, Jon and Irene are an ocean and a continent away, so that this book shifts its focus to concentrate more or less exclusively on Soames's daughter, Fleur. Problem is that the new characters - Fleur's husband, Michael Mont, and his family, his war buddy, the poet Wilfrid Desert, the artists and writers who populate Fleur's salon never rise above the level of cardboard cutout figures, dragged on stage in an obvious effort by Galsworthy to cover all his bases. There is a ridiculously clunky subplot involving a worker, Bicket, who is let go from Michael Mont's firm, and his wife, which might as well be sequestered off in its own optional section, with the label ""travails of the working class"".So, a lot of quivering and soul-searching by Fleur as she reluctantly comes to the conclusion that she's not going to be able to manage to juggle husband and passionate admirer (Desert) successfully; further soul-searching about whether or not to have a child, all carried out in the presence of some kind of hideous lapdog, Ting-a-Ling. It's never a good sign when the Chinese lapdog is one of the more memorable characters in a book. With an odd 15-page coda (""A Silent Wooing"") to fill us in on Jon's progress. He's living in North Carolina now! He meets an American girl! They get married! Neither seems to have a discernible personality! If there's not a payoff in Book 6 for wading through all this boring stuff, I'll be really pissed off.The book's title?

I don’t care about the Superbowl; the Oscars are a snoozefest, so there’s plenty of time to hit the books. Every year I try to revisit one of the longer “classics” during February. This year’s choice is Galsworthy’s “The Forsyte Saga”. Galsworthy wrote a total of nine novels about the Forsyte family, collectively referred to as “The Forsyte Chronicles”. The entire series is normally grouped into three trilogies: “The Forsyte Saga”, “A Modern Comedy”, and “End of the Chapter”. I’ll be happy to make it through the first trilogy: “The Man of Property”, “In Chancery”, and “To Let”, though my boxed set does contain novels 4-6 as well, in case I should get ambitious. I don’t know if anyone ever makes it through the entire set of nine novels – it doesn’t help that the action in books 4 and 5 drags considerably.Like most readers of my generation, I first discovered the Forsytes courtesy of the BBC’s 26-part serialization of the first six novels, first broadcast in the late 1960’s as “The Forsyte Saga” (there is a slight discrepancy between the BBC’s nomenclature and that of Galsworthy). Here is a link:http://www.ceejbot.com/EricPorter/For...A newer production of the saga aired on several PBS stations two or three seasons ago, but in my heart nobody will replace the originals. There can be no Irene other than Nyree Dawn Porter (the recent production’s Irene wasn’t even a blonde, for crying out loud); Margaret Tyzack *is* Winifred; Fleur can only be played by Susan Hampshire, and only Eric Porter is capable of embodying the ‘now you love him, now you hate him’, tortured “man of property”, Soames Forsyte.About 100 pages into the first book, it’s amazing how vividly it all comes back to me. The piano piece that Irene plays when Soames first meets her? Chopin’s waltz in C# minor. Seeing the Forsyte Saga was what gave me the perseverance to learn to play this particular waltz properly myself, much to the amazement of my piano teacher. So I surrender myself to the pleasure of re-acquainting myself with all of these characters, rediscovering their quirks and foibles, as Book 1 moves towards its shocking climax – that unforgettable rape scene where Soames, the man of property, exercises his conjugal rights over an unwilling Irene, thereby setting the stage for the story which unfolds down the generations....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Feb 25, 2008","Jan 07, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/748318.The_Man_of_Property

Beginning with the chance meeting of Soames's daughter, Fleur, and Jon, son of Irene and young Jolyon, their romance unfolds over the summer, only to founder inevitably on the rocky remnants of their parent's troubled entanglement. With the role of both Montagues and Capulets being taken by the estranged branches of the Forsyte family, Galsworthy sketches the doomed romance of Jon and Fleur sensitively and with great sympathy, even as his updates on the other members of the family provide wry commentary on developments in society at large.By story's end young Jolyon is dead, the family secret is out, and Jon understands the choice he has to make. So Fleur must content herself with marriage to Michael Mont, Jon and Irene head for British Columbia, and the great house at Robin Hill is put up to let. Fittingly enough, the story closes with Soames in the family mausoleum, having just buried Uncle Timothy, the last Forsyte of the previous generation. Despite his occasionally barbaric behavior as the anti-hero of what has gone before, we are left to feel sympathy for the tormented Soames, because, despite his status as a man of property: ... only one thing troubled him, sitting there - the melancholy craving in his heart ..... He might wish and wish and never get it - the beauty and the loving in the world!

If it  is  the most wonderful book you've ever read, might I suggest broadening your horizons?On the plus side:•	The voice of the first-person narrator (and murderess), Flannery Culp, is irresistible - smart, irreverent, quirky (OK, maybe a little insane as well), and highly entertaining.•	Handler is a good writer, and knows how to structure the story to keep your interest - you definitely want to keep reading to see how things turn out. His account of the horrific, climactic final party was hilariously brilliant.•	This book establishes Handler’s ability to write outside his “Lemony Snicket” persona. Here he ventures into the ""Secret History""/""Calamity Physics"" milieu, and generally acquits himself fairly well. (something I wouldn’t say about his later book “Adverbs”)On the negative side:•	His satirization of popular culture is heavy-handed at times, or too self-consciously clever. References to “The Winnie Moprah"" show, or to ""Benjamin Granaugh's new movie, Henry IV"" are just kind of silly.•	Some s have criticized the book on the grounds that its final plot twist isn’t quite coherent, and introduces certain inconsistencies which are never satisfactorily explained. I think this is a valid criticism, but it didn’t bother me near as much as some other difficulties with the plotWARNING: SPOILER POTENTIALMy real difficulty with the book is that the entire story is completely implausible at the most fundamental level. Specifically:Where were Flannery’s parents? Their daughter is sliding into total meltdown over a six-week period, and they don’t even make so much as an appearance. Now, theoretically, one can postulate parents so distant, so uninvolved in their daughter’s life, as to be completely unaware of her slide into homicidal madness. But I’m not buying it. Because – here’s the thing – all this is alleged to be happening  during September and October of her high school senior year. All that any of these kids would be focusing on during this time would be their college applications. And, given the upper middle class San Francisco milieu, there is no way that their parents would not also be focusing obsessively on the same issue. So that, when Flannery fails her calculus test in early September, it’s just not credible that matters continue to degenerate without some parental intervention. But Handler never mentions the parents, not even to explain their continued absence.So, in the end, it’s a nice little fantasy story. But one which bears no relationship whatsoever to the real world. A fun read, but one which I will have forgotten in a month....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Jan 10, 2008","Jan 06, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10997.The_Basic_Eight

But the result is - despite being a bestseller - a dreadful book. If I had checked it out in a bookstore, rather than buying it on Amazon, I might have figured it out from the back cover. Here are the four 'quotes from inside' that the publishers use as a teaser:""I believe in the goodness of a free society. And I believe that the society can remain good only as long as we are willing to fight for it."" Jackie Robinson.""I believe in empathy."" Azar Nafisi.""I believe in the pursuit of happiness. Not its attainment, nor its final definition, but its pursuit."" Andrew Sullivan. ""Be cool to the pizza delivery dude; it's good luck"". Sarah Adams.Forgive me - and I may burn in hell for this, but I submit that the only possible reaction to this kind of anodyne banality is a major YAWN. If you crack open the book and can wade through some of the most mind-numbingly pompous prose imaginable, there are further nuggets to be gleaned:Benjamin Carson believes that ""there is no job more important than parenting"". William F. Buckley believes in God, but, being WFB, finds it necessary to express himself thusly: ""This I believe: that it is intellectually easier to credit a divine intelligence than to submit dumbly to felicitous congeries about nature"".Jackie Lantry believes in the power of love to transform and heal. I believe that the kind of cliched banality that the contributors to this effort ended up producing is available free in any Hallmark store. More charitably, in considering why this book ended up being such a disastrous collection of woolly-minded writing, almost never rising above hackneyed cliches and Reader's Digest level banality, I believe that the problem lies in the formulation of the question. It seems that asking people to come on the radio for three minutes to sum up the core beliefs of their lives is a poor mechanism to generate anything of interest. It's a trap, causing most respondents to founder in banal generalities. The (very) few interesting contributors were smart enough to avoid the lure of the pompously abstract profundity, and rooted their answers in the specific. Here are the opening sentences of the three most interesting (OK, let's be honest, the only three truly interesting) essays:'I consider myself a feminist, and I feel like a moron admitting it, but it's true: I believe in Barbie.' (Jane Hamill)'I believe in always going to the funeral. My father taught me that.' (Deirdre Sullivan)'There is no such thing as too much barbecue'. (Jason Sheehan)Let me be clear - this  is in no way a critique of the expressed beliefs and opinions of the contributors. It is concerned only with the interest level and readability of their efforts.

People participate by being interviewed at the Storycorps booth in New York City or at one of the mobile recording booths traveling the country - they can choose to be interviewed by a relative or friend, or by a Storycorps facilitator. Selected stories are read on NPR every Friday morning and all are stored in the Library of Congress (subject to the participant's signing a release; thus far about 95% of participants have done so).This book represents a selection of the submissions so far, and the majority of the stories are truly moving. It's divided into five broad sections:Home and FamilyWork and DedicationJourneysHistory and StruggleFire and Water (stories related to the attacks of September 11th and to Hurricane Katrina)With the exception of those in the first section, the stories are universally powerful and moving, with over 10,000 to choose from, the editor has done a fine job in selecting the best. For me, the 'home and family' stories fell oddly flat, though this just may be an inability to match the power of some of the later contributions. One could think of this as an oral version of the other NPR Story Project, stories from which are collected in the (awesome) book ""I Thought My Father was God"", which I have ed separately. The stories in ""Listening is an Act of Love"" match those in that book in their capacity to move the reader. The only think that prevents me from giving it a fifth star is the relative weakness of the first section of the book.The success of this venture just underscores the lameness of the 'This I Believe' collection, which I also ed recently - it's interesting to me that two undertakings, which are fairly similar on the surface, should give such disparate results.

Hard to imagine that there's a worse insult to the intelligence out there than the 'Who Moved my Cheesesweet lord Mother of God, what was I thinking? Hard to imagine that there's a worse insult to the intelligence out there than the 'Who Moved my Cheese?' scam, but this book may just qualify. I may actually burn this book, in some kind of ritual immolation sacrifice.Updated Feb 15th. I posted the following, more detailed  on Amazon.com. Only to receive a creepy e-mail from Seth Godin, the editor, offering me a refund of the purchase price. I declined. I don't know what came over me in the bookstore. Mysteriously, when I got home, this book was at the bottom of the bag. It's an embarrassment.I would have thought it impossible to come up with something more stupid, more openly contemptuous of the very managers purportedly being 'helped', than the horrendous ""Who Moved My Cheese?"" of a few years back. You remember, the one which portrayed employees as mildly retarded rodents. But one shouldn't underestimate the intellectual arrogance of the consultant class, nor the gullibility of corporate management.This book is infinitely worse. It turns out that there is no apparent limit to the degree of atrocity of the rubbish that can be generated (and printed) in an ""unprecedented collaboration of the world's smartest business thinkers"". Despite the separation of material in this book into separate chapters, there is no individual attribution of responsibility for the individual chapters. This is not a good sign.Seth Godin, the nominal 'editor', obviously sees no problem in publishing a book which, for any concrete piece of strategic advice that is included, hedges its bets by also advising the diametrically opposing strategy. Thus, to succeed companies should:1a. Stick with what they know and do it well. (Focusing on your specialty is key).1b. Not get stuck in the rut of what they know, they should branch out. (Focusing on your specialty is fatal)2a. (page 23) ""ignore your customers"" (the customer is ignorant and wrong).2b. (page 64) the customer is always right.3a. (page 31) ""Every organization that gets into trouble falters because it waited too long to change..."". (urgency is crucial)3b. (page 136) ""Remarkable doesn't always mean right now"" (urgency is detrimental).And so on. Because chapter authors are not individually identified, should your coin toss happen to choose the wrong option between 1a and 1b, 2a and 2b, 3a and 3b, there can be no assignable blame.However, at least the examples above have the virtue of giving concrete, specific advice. If that makes you nervous, there is also plenty of this kind of gibberish:Plant rocks.Embrace the power of storytelling.Ignore the regulations. (I'm trying to imagine how this would play out in, say, the pharmaceutical or biotech industries).Imagine there's a tiger loose in your office. Breathe the fear. Fear is good.You are not a cog. You are not ordinary. In fact, you are remarkable.But if you're dumb enough to buy this book, you're a complete moron. Even by the extraordinarily lax standards for business advice books, it sets a new low.Zero stars. ...more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,not set,not set,"Jan 03, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/96600.The_Big_Moo

I had read two of Mallon's books - ""Stolen Words"" (on plagiarism) and ""A Book of One's Own"" (people and their diaries) - quitThis book was a delight. I had read two of Mallon's books - ""Stolen Words"" (on plagiarism) and ""A Book of One's Own"" (people and their diaries) - quite some time ago, and found them both charming and fascinating. So maybe the charm of these essays shouldn't have been a surprise. But I was bowled over, both by the breadth and depth of Mallon's coverage. Not to engage in hagiography, but he comes close to my notion of a perfect er. In many instances his evaluations are a more eloquent expression of my own thoughts about a particular book or author. And in those cases where our evaluations were different, his views are expressed with a persuasive clarity that stimulates me to go back to the work in question and see what I might have missed. He's smart, erudite, witty, someone who has obviously read widely, with catholic tastes and a broad-ranging curiosity. But, refreshingly, his criticism comes squarely from the point of view of someone who obviously wants to give the writer the benefit of the doubt. Which is not to say that he pulls his punches, but there is none of the besetting sin that afflicts most critics - the cruel putdown whose primary aim is to remind you of the critic's own smartness. Nor does he ever give the sense of targeting someone solely because of their success. A good illustration of what I mean is his essay ""Snow Falling on Readers"", which examines the work of David Guterson. It is characteristic of Mallon's approach that, to understand the success of Guterson's biggest hit, he takes it on himself to read and discuss the author's entire work. Having done so, he ultimately finds it wanting. Characteristically, his summation is gentle, but damning nonetheless:""I must confess that the real mystery to me is not what happened to Carl Heine aboard his fishing boat but just what on earth the PEN/Faulkner jurors were thinking - and beyond that, what all the local book-group readers who have made this No.1 can be seeing. A majority of these group readers - a discerning constituency who do much to keep literary fiction alive in America - are women, and it's the female characters in Guterson's books who are flimsy to the point of mere functionality, projections of male desire and indecision.""Compared with the mean-spirited hatchet job on Guterson that appears in ""A Reader's Manifesto"", which cannot escape giving the impression of being motivated by resentment at another's success, Mallon's evaluation reads like genuine literary criticism.Which is not to say that all is high-minded and serious. Elsewhere in the same essay he makes the following throwaway, but devastatingly on-point, remark:""I have been against homeschooling ever since that family-taught girl won the national spelling bee a few years back. This child who became such a point of pride to homeschooling parents couldn't stop shouting and jumping around and crowing about her moment of onstage accomplishment. I didn't care if she could spell 'arrhythmia' backwards; this unsocialized kid needed Miss Crabtree to put her in the corner.""Essays I particularly enjoyed were those on the David Leavitt-Stephen Spender lawsuit, on Howard Norman (whose 'The Bird Artist' I have always considered the antidote to the appalling 'Shipping News'), on Will Self, on Tom Wolfe's ""A Man in Full"". The essays on letters from his readers, on obituaries, on the ups and downs of the 'author book tour', and on the challenges of writing historical fiction are equally fascinating. But what clinched things, and what earned this book its fifth star is the essay ""Enough about Me"", which expresses his civilized but eloquent antipathy to the ""emergence of memoir as a hot new publishing commodity"". Someone who mirrors my own thoughts on the matter, and can express them far more eloquently than I could.

I estimate that at least 40% of the entries are Gaelic, not English, words. Most are included with the Irish spelling unchanged. A typical 'usage example' is just a simple declarative sentence, with no attribution or sourcing, in which the relevant English word has been replaced by its Gaelic equivalent. For example, under the entry for the word 'easog' (which is the Gaelic word for 'weasel'):""I think I say an easog down by the river"".This is pernicious rubbish. Terence Patrick Dolan would apparently have us believe that Irish people are given to the random substitution of the Gaelic equivalents of English words throughout their conversation. This may be true for a handful of common words, but I doubt very much that the number of such cases exceeds a few dozen. That the dictionary should be bulked up by the importation of hundreds of Gaelic words is simply idiotic, and negates any value it might otherwise have as a work of scholarship.Scanning the acknowledgements suggests the source of the problem. A list of some hundred or so 'non-literary sources' is given at the end of the book. It would seem that Mr Dolan solicited input from scattered correspondents around Ireland. It would also seem that he was willing to include anything submitted by these correspondents, with little regard for plausibility, accuracy, or the existence of corroborative evidence. As a result, the dictionary is a wortheless hodgepodge, a gallimaufry of entries of dubious credibility....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Jan 03, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2495536.A_Dictionary_of_Hiberno_English

Apparently, as practiced by David Leavitt, it involves picking over the lives of his chosen victims - for some reason he has a predilection for gay English intellectuals - and tarting up the factual record with embellishments that appear to be more a projection of Leavitt's own unresolved issues than any kind of added insight into the character being assassinated. Maybe Professor Leavitt would be better served by seeking out his own rough-trade liaisons in the academic groves of Gainesville than slandering the dead by inventing non-existent affairs in which his victims are portrayed as behaving atrociously. G.H. Hardy deserves better than David Leavitt's dehumanizing portrayal in this invented version of his life.The reader should bear in mind that the last time Leavitt tried a similar stunt, he was sued for his efforts by Stephen Spender, and lost. The New York Times  of 'The Indian Clerk' comments that: ""Luckily, or circumspectly, Leavitt has chosen this time to portray people who are no longer around to file lawsuits.""Which is certainly one way of looking at it. An equally valid conclusion would be that this is an author with no shame whatsoever.Ramanujan too deserves better than his portrayal by Leavitt, who is completely incapable of conveying the essence of his particular genius, despite the various equations spattered through the book. Nowhere does he manage to convey the fascination of the Indian's peculiar and prodigious talent, or why Hardy would be sufficiently excited to bring him to Cambridge. His treatment of Ramanujan as a person is equally murky. (An excellent account of Ramanujan's life is available in Robert Kanigel's ""The Man Who Knew Infinity"").But then this hodgepodge of a book is stuffed with so much detritus that it becomes clear that Leavitt would rather pad things out with semi-salacious gossip about various other Cambridge luminaries, the amorous dalliances (both real and invented) of various secondary and tertiary characters, and the obligatory meanderings about the love that dare not speak its name than attempt to cast any real light on the relationship between Hardy and Ramanujan. Fortunately, the genius of Hardy, Littlewood and Ramanujan is such that their names will live on long after Leavitt's work has been consigned to the dustbin of history....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,not set,Jan 2008,"Jan 03, 2008",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/210113.The_Indian_Clerk

I really liked it, though the clipped, starker-than-Hemingway, style does leave me craving lusher prose. More complete  to follow.Edited to add this :It's late 1999 – a couple of months until the new millennium. A 67-year old man moves from Oslo to a remote cabin in the Norwegian woods. He intends to live out his days in self-sufficient isolation, in an effort to forget, and to move beyond, events in his recent past -- the death of his wife in a car crash 3 years earlier. But an encounter with his neighbor shows that there is no escaping the past, and forces him to reexamine the pivotal events of a long-ago summer.The book alternates between the present of 1999 and flashbacks to the summer of 1948 (when the narrator was 15), gradually revealing the episodes of loss and betrayal that have had such a profound effect on the narrator’s subsequent life. The prose is understated, spare, and has a cumulative effect that is both sad and elegaic. By the end, with no fanfare, in the most understated fashion imaginable, the author has constructed a work which is oddly, sadly moving. You may find yourself craving a fix of lusher prose by the time you finish.3.5 stars. Round up to 4 or down to 3, depending on how important it is to you that a work be upbeat.

In fact, it's an odd collection all round - the puzzling question is why it exists at all. Don't get me wrong. The quality of most of the contributions to this anthology is very high. But most of the pieces are not new. Glass describes his selection criterion: ""most of the stories in this book come from a stack of favorite writing that I've kept behind my desk for years"". What does this yield? Michael Lewis on Jonathan Lebed (the 15-year old who was sued for white-collar crime by the SEC).Malcolm Gladwell: Six Degrees of Lois Weisberg.Chuck Klosterman interviewing Val Kilmer.David Foster Wallace on right-wing talk radio.Michael Pollan on buying a cow.Susan Orlean: The American Man, Age Ten.James McManus on playing in the World Series of Poker.Mark Bowden on Saddam Hussein.and stories by Jack Hitt, Dan Savage, Lawrence Weschler, Lee Sandler and Bill Buford.The problem is that most of the pieces in the book have appeared in print before, not once, but twice. For instance, Gladwell's piece - which is indeed a delight to read - first appeared in The New Yorker, then again in his book ""The Tipping Point"". Similarly, the pieces by Orlean and Weschler first appeared in The New Yorker and were subsequently republished in books by their authors. David Foster Wallace's story was first published in The Atlantic, and subsequently appeared again in the collection ""Consider the Lobster"". Pollan's work first appeared in The New York Times, and then again in his book ""The Omnivore's Dilemma"". And so on. I haven't checked, but given the general proliferation of anthologies these days (each year there are the 'best essays', 'best business writing', 'best nonrequired reading', 'best science and nature writing', and The new Yorker has taken to publishing its own anthologies as well), it wouldn't surprise me if some of these pieces have been further anthologized. Thus, operationally, Ira's selection criterion seems to amount to choosing pieces that have been published at least twice before. Which makes one wonder why Glass felt the need to pull this book together - was he stuck for funds?my favorite pieces: the article on Jonathan Lebed, Gladwell's piece, and Klosterman's interview of Val Kilmer. At the other end of the spectrum, the article about poker was a tedious, self-indulgent bore and Foster Wallace's abuse of footnotes is unusually rampant. Finally, and this says more about me than about the quality of the essays, but I couldn't manage to make myself finish Lee Sandlin's article about World War II, nor could I bring myself to care about Bill Buford's exploits with British soccer hooligans.Don't buy this book.

The author's main thesis There's a lot of indignant sputtering to be found in this book, an extended cry of ""J'accuse!"" leveled at U.S. universities. The author's main thesis is that the intense focus on research acts as a corrupting influence throughout the system. Overvaluation of research in the triad of teaching, research and administrative duties that comprises a faculty member's job responsibilities has diverse and far-reaching consequences, most of which the author views as negative.•	It creates an unhealthy system of incentives, whose main casualty is the quality of undergraduate education. •	As the number of highly talented researchers in any given field is necessarily finite, competition among universities for the same few 'stars' results in major distortion of salaries. •	This competition has also completely warped more traditional views of the appropriate role of the university within the broader society, so that now even land grant colleges have lost sight of their formerly clear mission of education, and strive to compete as research institutions with universities twenty times as well-endowed, in a senseless game they cannot hope to win. •	The ‘publish or perish’ criterion forces junior faculty to prioritize research above all else, but the inflexibility of the tenure clock almost ensures that the research will be excruciatingly narrow in its scope, incremental, and of interest to only a handful of academics. It is the rare junior academic who will take the risk of branching out in a completely new direction, which might prove to be a dead end, knowing that the primary metric used by tenure committees is the number of publications (quality is supposed to play a role, but can be difficult to assess, so all too often a simple count is the major determinant). •	As for tenure, Sykes finds it to be just one more mechanism which allows faculty to avoid accountability, instead of being the much-vaunted ‘protector of academic freedom’ the professoriat would have us believe. Within certain disciplines, in fact, true freedom of expression often seems threatened by a particularly virulent type of political correctness.With chapter titles like “The Crucifixion of Teaching”, “The Weird World of Academic Journals”, “The Pseudo-Scientists: the Social Sciences”, Sykes leaves little doubt where he stands in this excoriation of the ‘professoriat’. He makes the point repeatedly, and convincingly, that the real casualty in today’s university is the quality of undergraduate teaching, and that today’s undergraduates (and their parents) are being asked to shell out more and more for less and less. In the book’s final chapter, he outlines the key components necessary to improve matters: puncturing the research myth, abolishing tenure, requiring professors to teach, restoring the curriculum and the canon, and enforcing ‘truth in advertising’, i.e. forcing colleges to provide accurate statistics on such questions as the actual number of hours spent by tenured faculty in teaching undergraduates. I first read this book fifteen years ago, and found it to be a depressingly accurate account of third-level education in the U.S. Upon re-reading it this past weekend, I was cheered again by the brisk common sense of Sykes’s arguments – his broadsides retain their pungent relevance. The depressing thing, of course, is how little things appear to have changed in the interim, making this book as relevant today as when it was first published twenty years ago....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,Jan 2008,"Jan 01, 2008",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/270332.Profscam

Chances are you'll be needing a verb. In your native language, you won't really have to think about it - the correct tense and fGot something to say? Chances are you'll be needing a verb. In your native language, you won't really have to think about it - the correct tense and form should bubble up to the tip of your tongue, unprompted. If you're trying to navigate a foreign language, then you'll have to build a little reference table in your head, and do a quick table look-up to retrieve the correct form. The sneaky part: in many languages the most commonly used verbs are irregular, requiring extra memorization of the specific associated forms. The perverse truth is that, generally speaking, the more common the verb, the greater the degree of irregularity.Which is part of what gives books like this one their appeal. Wander over to the foreign language section in any bookstore, and you're almost guaranteed to find books which promise:101 verbs201 verbs501 verbs""fully conjugated in all the tenses"".Psychologically, buying one of these books is a little bit like buying an insurance policy - it feels like a hedge against future problems, and depending on how ambitious you're feeling, you can invest in a greater or lesser degree of protection (I've even seen numbers as high as 1001, presumably designed for the true super-achiever).Of course, continued investment in this kind of book (and I have them for every foreign language that I've ver studied) also represents the triumph of hope over experience. As the cashier rings it up, you have a clear vision of yourself, spending large amounts of well-organized time with your new purchase. Just like in high school, when we cycled through the 250 or so irregular German verbs, on a 5-a-day schedule, which started afresh when we reached ""zwingen"". Problem is, without some external pressure to enforce the necessary discipline, it's pretty much a given that your resolve will start to slip, usually somewhere around week 3. I have to think that this is the explanation for the odd phenomenon that my command of irregular verb forms in several languages decreases as one goes down through the alphabet. Furthermore, I'd be willing to bet that this is a fairly general phenomenon.Strictly speaking, one should not hold the authors of books like this one responsible for readers' failure to engage with their product in a fully efficient manner. So let me hedge my rating as follows:if you are that rare person with the discipline to use the book regularly: 4 starsif you are like the rest of us: 3 stars.If you are foolish enough to be learning Russian, you will (of course) want to augment this book with a more specialized book dealing with those pesky verbs of motion.

In an effort to bring some order to my unruly ""words and language shelf"", I attempt here to give a succinct evaluation of the 33 books on it which are essentially devoted to words. Those dealing with usage, etymology, language development, and general linguistic issues will, I hope, be evaluated in future s. As a quick test of whether this  is likely to be of interest to you, consider the following:The area on your (or any mammal's) back which you cannot reach to scratch is known as the acnestis.Lurgulary is the term used to denote the act of poisoning a water source.The adjective meaning ""pertaining to walnuts"" is juglandaceous.The verb to maffick means ""to engage in wild, boisterous, protracted revelry in the streets"", and is a backformation from the city name Mafeking. The association derives from the celebrations that followed the relief of Mafeking on May 17, 1900 after a protracted siege by the Boers; when word of the rescue reached London, ""the city erupted in wild celebration which went on for days"". If these words fill you with irresistible glee, despite the very low probability you will ever need to use any of them in casual conversation, then at least some of the books considered in this  are likely to appeal to your latent logolepsy. Read on. If, on the other hand, you react to new, weird, or obsolete words with indifference, you may safely skip the rest of this .With 33 books to evaluate, obviously I need some kind of system. So I will evaluate each book on the following 4 criteria:* breadth of coverage -- does it really deliver the goods, that is, deliver a reasonable quota of truly satisfying obscure words? * scholarship -- is it to be trusted? Are there any egregious errors? Is there evidence of adequate background research? Cross-checking with other sources? * usability -- how user friendly is it? Level of cross-referencing appropriate? Adequate examples of word usage? Thematic organization? Helpful citations and indexing? Is the pronunciation key helpful to the casual reader, or does it require mastery of the IPA (international phonetic alphabet).* charm -- an entirely nebulous quality, but probably the most important. Were the authors having fun when they wrote it? And is that sense of fun transmitted to the reader? Because, frankly, there's nothing more lethally boring than a big book full of fancy words assembled by someone who isn't almost orgasmically enthusiastic about sharing those words. A couple of the books below make ludicrous attempts to engage readers with promises that expanding their vocabulary will lead to improved ""success"" in life. Such promises are worded in a way that makes it obvious that ""success"" is being measured in the basest, most soul-destroying, moneygrubbing terms: having just the right two-dollar word at the tip of your reptilian tongue will open all the right doors, affording you countless opportunities to further your spiritual degradation by playing round after round of lickspittle golf with your vile nouveau riche social climbing ""boss"". This notion is, of course, frankly ridiculous, being based on implicit, and utterly false, premise that mere possession of the dictionary in question will result in the desired augmentation of vocabulary. Well, as Charles Earle Funk might put it, ""horsefeathers!"" The only way you are going to augment your vocabulary, gentle reader, is by reading, widely, voraciously, and indiscriminately. And if you haven't figured that out by now in life, then none of the books below is gonna help you, sucker! So, with the understanding that books like these interest us because of their potential to surprise and delight, and not as stepping stones to greater ""status"" or ""wealth"" or ""success"", let's get on with it. I will assign each book a score of 0 to 5 on each of the four dimensions discussed previously. So that a superstar like Mrs Byrne might hope to end up with a total score close to 20; duds may expect to languish in the single digits.

But the introduction by Paul Collins was reassuring - I had read and enjoyed two of his books. And who could resist trying an author described in the introduction as ""the best worst writer ever""?I think the standard euphemism for the kind of stuff Keeler gets up to in ""The Riddle of the Traveling Skull"" is ""pushing against the boundaries of the genre"".

The result is an extended shaggy dog story with a ridiculously convoluted plot that is barely patched together by a remarkable series of truly amazing coincidences. You roll your eyes in disbelief at least once a chapter.

I am a fan of CHE. The man's got style. He's got a sense of humor. His enthusiasm is infectious. And he understands perfectly the kinds of words readers get a kick out of. This reader, anyway.Coverage: 5 out of 5Scholarship: 4 out of 5User-friendliness: 4 out of 5Charm: 5 out of 5This is not a dictionary. Elster eschews the standard alphabetical listing, choosing instead to group entries by theme. He considers twelve main categories:1. Health and Disease.2. Food and Drink.3. Love, Sex and Perversion.4. Argument and Insults.5. Words to describe People.6. Phobias.7. Religion, Belief and Divination.8. Politics and Business.9. Knowledge and Communication.10. Sound and Fury: Human/Animal Noise and Behavior.11. Uncommon Words for Everyday Things.12. Epilogue: Some Words that make Life Living.Chapters have further useful subdivisions. For example, the reader may choose an insult from such categories as: slobs and fops, gluttons, slackers, idiots, thieves and spongers, crummy kids, animal insults, dwelling places and eating habits, and miscellaneous unclassifiable nastiness. The delight you derive from this book will be directly proportional to your degree of word-geekishness. Most of the words in this book are not strictly  necessary .

One might be foAs I read through this perfectly innocuous book by Morton Freeman, I found it hard to believe that it was written as recently as 1997. One might be forgiven for thinking the publication date was a century earlier. This impression is a consequence of Mr Freeman's particular selection of entries and is bolstered by a certain claustrophobic quality in his prose, that evokes the mustiness of an Edwardian gentleman-scholar's library. Second-guessing an author's selection criteria is, of course, a little unfair, but what's a er to do? For a book like this, where the huge number of potential candidates for inclusion forces the author to make tough choices, the selection criteria are crucial. It's the particular words the author chooses to discuss, far more than what he says about them (assuming he's not a complete idiot), that make or break the book. So, as a er, one can't stop the involuntary eyeball-rolling reaction (""I can't believe he wasted a page and a half on X...., but Y doesn't even get a mention). One tends to focus on that maddening (perceived) room for improvement.Don't get me wrong. Authorial idiosyncrasy in the inclusion criteria is not only inevitable - it's good. We want to see the author's quirky enthusiasms. Except... that we do kind of hope they will overlap to some reasonable extent with our own... cuz otherwise, the ride could get pretty boring. So, with the understanding that there is no ""right"" selection, here are a few places where my choices would have differed from Mr Freeman's (I've paraphrased some of the definitions below, for brevity) Boulangism  ""a wave of hysterical anti-German sentiment that engulfed France from 1886-1889, provoked by General Georges Ernest Jean Marie Boulanger"" .... OK, fine, but this is supposed to be a book about eponyms, not a historical encyclopedia. Coueism? Coxey's Army? Fourdrinier? Bertillonage?  Huh? Was this just random arcana you felt you had to get out of your system, or were you trying to establish your erudition cred? Maybe a little passive-aggressive reader alienation? Brill  Abraham Arden Brill (1874-1948), born in Austria, immigrated to America at an early age, introduced Freudian psychoanalysis to the American medical profession .... yeah, yeah - fun stuff - but did he actually, yanno, introduce his name as a word to the English language. Because, in my dictionaries, ""brill"" is just a kind of fish, esteemed in England. And while we're on the topic, why the compulsion to include all these mini-biographical sketches of 19th century scientists? Not to disrespect Ampere, Ohm, Coulomb, Einstein, Faraday, Henry, Malpighi, Mendeleyev, Newton, or Watt, but how big a deal was it back in those days to get a scientific unit named after you? Note that I'm not objecting to Bunsen, Geiger, Edison, Fermi, Gauss, Celsius, Fahrenheit, Bessemer process, Archimedes' principle, Davy lamp, Marconigram, Salk vaccine, Sabin vaccine, Vernier scale, Volta or Maxwell. Though I actually don't think having a law or a piece of lab equipment named for you automatically makes you interesting. Freeman seemed pretty hellbent on getting his 250-word thumbnail biosketch of James Clerk Maxwell in somewhere: personally, I think ""Maxwell's demon"" would have been a more interesting hook than maxwell, the unit of magnetic flux. Let's think about this whole unit thing, anyway. Freeman includes the ampere, the coulomb, the ohm, the watt, the farad, the volt, the henry, the newton, degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit, the fermi. (Really it's just an excuse for him to engage in his favorite sport of microhagiography) But why stop there? What about the tesla, the svedberg, the siemens, the sabin, the lambert, the darcy, the sievert, the oerstedt, the pascal, etc. etc. etc? Why not include them all? Well, obviously, to do so would be incredibly tedious and boring. So why did Freeman think amperes and coulombs and henrys and farads were interesting enough to warrant inclusion? What  was  he thinking?The sad thing here is that there is actually some fun to be extracted from eponymous units of measurement: one could actually be mildly entertaining, with just a little effort. If I had space to include my dirty dozen favorite eponymous measurement units, I'd steer well clear of electromagnetism. How about instead -  the Apgar score, the Balthazar, the Scoville unit, the Smoot, the stimp, the degree MacMichael, the warhol, the millihelen, the centimorgan, the mickey, the billigram, the garn, the megafonziemeasures, respectively, of neonate status, champagne bottle volume, hotness of chili peppers, distance, the speed of the green on a golf course, viscosity of chocolate, duration of fame, beauty, genetic distance, detectable movement of a computer mouse, the weight an evangelist carries with God, severity of space sickness, and coolness. I have to finish this and go to bed. So what's my point? Eponyms are truly fertile ground. There is much fun to be had, so it should be possible to write an engaging, interesting, funny book on the topic. This ""New Dictionary of Eponyms"" is not that book.Two stars. Freeman doesn't really care about the words; he's really some kind of frustrated biographer of assorted 19th century public figures.Here are some eponyms more likely to amuse or entertain you: bishop, burke, dolly varden, cummingtonite, phryne, shepardize, namby-pamby, oblomovism, tantony pig, syringe, thersitical, St Anthony's fire, yentl's syndrome, Charles's wain, saber's beads, Pele's hair, Mother Carey's chickens.

Other ers have faulted it for lacking philosophical depth, but really - what could they have been expecting? The author makes no pretences, and the format of the book couldn't be clearer. It is what it sets out to be - 100 brief ""philosophy"" puzzles, each following a strict 3-page format, in which the puzzle/paradox/point of contention is described in the first page, then discussed (or resolved in those cases where resolution is possible) in the remaining two pages.So, yeah, that format doesn't afford much scope for teasing out an issue in great depth. But it works better than you might think. Different vignettes can be used to approach a given theme from different angles and Baggini revisits his more interesting themes several times throughout the book (each chapter cross-references others that are loosely related). I don't necessarily fault an author for having a gimmick - sometimes it's an unhelpful distraction, but sometimes it can provide a kind of structure that turns out to be entirely beneficial. This book was an illustration of how a constraint can be useful - the 3-page limit helped keep things focused.How well the book turns out is, of course, critically dependent on two factors: 1. How smart and interesting are the scenarios chosen for inclusion? 2. How good is the author at exposition? (which has a whole number of subdimensions - is his style academic? dull? accessible? sloppy? clear? irritating? credible? condescending? humorous?)Baggini acquits himself well on both counts. Though he doesn't quite manage to pull off the folksy humor to which he aspires, his style is brisk, without condescension and free of annoying tics. More importantly, he is effective at hitting a decent balance in tone between the academic and the popular. The selection of thought experiments was better than I had anticipated. Obviously, they're not all going to be winners - for instance, I personally no longer find anything even remotely interesting in Zeno's paradox, Buridan's ass, other people's famous inability to grasp the fact that coins and roulette wheels don't have a memory, the notion that living forever would suck all the joy out of life, or the inability to know how another person perceives color. But I do have a definite weakness for questions pertaining to ethical and moral choice, so those vignettes kept me entertained for hours. In general, the author covers the major bases - consciousness, perception, reality, pain, empathy, morality and ethics. For me, the most interesting scenarios were those which explored the nuances of moral responsibility in various hypothetical (but very concrete) settings. What sealed the fourth star were the chapters that nudged me out of my comfort zone. For example, the scenarios which addressed our stewardship of the environment and the ethical treatment of animals captured and held my attention. The book's format favors concrete, crisply formulated, scenarios - the kind that you find yourself thinking about days later. Many don't have an obvious 'right' answer, in these cases Biaggini is smart enough not to try to provide one - he just wants to get you thinking about this stuff. At his most effective, he's almost demonically successful - for the last two days I've been trying (unsuccessfully) to come up with a convincing argument to dispel the notion that I'm suspended in a pod of amniotic fluid with a computer feeding me all the necessary stimuli needed to make me think my virtual reality is 'actual' reality. Whimper... There are limits, however. Despite the cogency of the arguments presented as ethical justification for eating our deceased family pets, Boris and Natasha need have no fear*. The crockpot and the Foreman grill have no role in their future. *: Sadly, I understand all too well that this is the kind of sentimental foolishness to which we humans are susceptible. I have no illusions about the kitties' behavior should I drop dead and leave them unfended for. The transition from living food provider to dead food source would, I imagine, be rapid.But I digress. The bottom line is that I enjoyed this book quite a bit more than I had expected to -- the author's particular gimmick actually worked out pretty well....more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,not set,"Mar 14, 2010","Dec 31, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/282758.The_Pig_That_Wants_to_Be_Eaten

Though it's relatively short (220 pages, ~300 root words and phrases), the author manages to pack in a lot of information, in an engagingly natural style that is completely free of academic pomposity. Features of the book that I found particularly appealing were:* separate sections on the etymology of: - days of the week - months of the year named for legendary figures - chemical elements with mythological names - animals and plants with mythological names - planets and their moons - constellations (comprehensive and informative)* the author's willingness to go beyond just Greek and Roman legends and to include discussion of myths from other cultures as well. Egyptian, Norse, Celtic, Germanic, Arabian, and Sumerian mythology are all well-represented, even though Greek mythology - probably unavoidably - is most prominent.* the author has a kind of discursive style that some readers might find irritating, but which I actually enjoyed, if only because it leads her to include interesting nuggets of information in unexpected places, so that one stumbles across these little Easter eggs throughout the book. For example, an entry on (being struck by) ""Cupid's arrow"" provides not only the legend underlying the origin of the phrase, but also discussion of the phrase ""Cupid's-bow mouth"", Kewpie dolls, Rose O' Neill's Cupid drawings, and the etymology of the word ""cupidity"".One minor quibble: although entries are ordered alphabetically, and there is a fair amount of cross-referencing, an index would have been a welcome addition. Random stuff I learned from reading this book:*that the male equivalents of caryatids are called ""atlantes""*the name of the drug ""atropine"" is derived from Atropos (she who cannot be turned), third of the three Furies, and the one who cuts the thread of life and brings death*""seventh heaven"" is derived from the Koran*the drug prescription symbol ℞ is derived from the astronomical symbol for Jupiter, ♃This is a fine book: 4.5 stars overall....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Dec 31, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/844499.From_Achilles_Heel_to_Zeus_s_Shield

People across a wide variety of jobs were asked to talk about their work and the interviews are presented, wiThis book follows a very simple formula. People across a wide variety of jobs were asked to talk about their work and the interviews are presented, with minimal editing. Thus, the structure mimics that of Studs Terkel's 1972 classic ""Working"" Although there are a couple of famous names (Jerry Bruckheimer, Heidi Klum), the great majority of the contributions are from 'ordinary people'. It’s remarkable how well things turned out. The book is wide-ranging, consistently interesting, fun to read, and the contributions ring true. Almost every interview contained something that was surprising, funny, touching, or downright fascinating – many combined all these elements. I think the book’s success rests on two factors: the editors’ broadly inclusive, imaginative approach to the selection of ‘jobs’ to include, and their wisdom in adopting a relatively ‘hands-off’ editing style, allowing the contributors’ distinctive voices to come through. There is an appealing wit to the book’s organization as well. In the opening essay, the reader is welcomed by a Walmart’s ‘greeter’. Almost 700 pages later, Beverly Valentine, a funeral director from Mount Vernon, NY, offers us some closure in the final essay. There are very few duds among the 120 or so contributions in between. The scope is far-ranging. Contributions are grouped under the following broad headings:•	Workers and Managers•	Goods and Services•	Buyers and Sellers•	Transportation•	Plants and Animals•	Food•	Media•	Artists and Entertainers•	Sports and Gambling•	Sex•	Children and Teachers•	Lawyers and the Law•	Government and Military•	Bodies and SoulsThe relatively bland nature of these headings doesn’t do justice to the quirkiness of the individual essays. Kudos to the editors for having the imagination to invite representation from the following ‘professions’:•	corporate headhunter•	corporate identity consultant•	clutter consultant•	crime scene cleaner•	drug dealer•	dog trainer•	food stylist•	paparazzo•	television guest coordinator•	heavy metal roadie•	Elvis interpreter•	bookie•	porn star•	adult webmistress•	transvestite prostitute•	doula•	FBI agent •	prisoner•	army psych ops specialist•	lobbyist•	psychiatric rehabilitation therapist•	telephone psychicUnlike, for example, in Susan Orlean’s ‘The Bullfighter Checks her Makeup’, which focuses on the unusual, more standard professions (autoworker, sales rep, waitress, journalist, high school basketball coach, teacher, trial lawyer, nurse, minister) are well-represented among the profiles in this book. It is heartening (and maybe a little surprising) that the great majority of people interviewed are passionate about their work. Though not all, by any means – one of the funniest profiles is the UPS driver (‘usually, when I’m out there, I just do everything I can to not actually work. .... on my stops I watch TV, make phone calls, flirt with secretaries, call my friends, go shopping, read the newspaper, go swimming in the summer at a motel pool’ – and that’s when he’s not checking out the porn and donuts at his favorite delivery sites). If I had to pick a favorite, it would be the florist: ‘it’s like people come to me at the important occasions in their lives .... I think what I do brings beauty into people’s lives’.But the great majority of profiles in this book held my interest, and a surprising number were quite moving. I highly recommend this collection. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Dec 31, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/246041.Gig

The back cover contains laudatory blurbs from both Steven Pinker (“a clear and splendidly written account ...”) and author of “The Ghost Map”, Steven Johnson, (“a rare and delightful mix...”). Then there is the following gem on the inside jacket cover – “The First Word is not only a compelling historical account of our greatest intellectual faculty but a provocative consideration of what it means, finally, to be human”.Well, it seems hardly fair to hold an author accountable for whatever silliness her publishers might assemble on a book’s exterior in the interest of boosting sales. Let’s just say that this book is ambitious in its scope and that the author is obviously academically well-qualified. My own formal qualifications in the field of linguistics are non-existent, so this  is from the point of view of a non-specialist with a keen amateur interest in the topic.An obvious question: ‘is this a book for the non-specialist?’ I think that the publishers would like to market it as such, and that Dr. Kenneally possibly thinks of it that way. But, much as I wanted to like this book, if it is meant to be accessible to the general reader, I think it falls well short of the mark. This is not to say it’s not interesting – there are parts which I found fascinating. But it gives the distinct impression that the author did not have a well-defined audience in mind, or – if she meant it to be accessible to the general reader - she has not mastered the ability to write effectively for a non-specialist audience. The problems manifest themselves in two main areas. First, the question of scope and organization. There is a definite sense that the author wants this to be a totally comprehensive account of the current state of knowledge. This is fine, but ultimately greatly increases the indigestibility of the book. The book’s structure is unwieldy to the point where one wonders whether Viking actually had an editor read it. A “prelude”, followed by an “introduction”, leading in to a “prologue”? What were they thinking??? The sixteen chapters of the book follow an equally awkward organizational structure. Four are devoted to specific linguists (Chomsky, Pinker & Bloom...). Seven discuss specific features of human language, such as words and syntax, but are clumsily titled. For example, grouped under the blanket heading “If you have human language...” are the “chapters”•	You have something to talk about•	You have words•	You have gestures•	You have a human brain The next three chapters are grouped under the heading “What evolves?”, and are titled•	Species evolve•	Culture evolves•	Why things evolve That the author finds it necessary to remind us that a human brain is a prerequisite for human language, or does not appear to recognize that “why things evolve” does not answer the question “what evolves?” are, of course, minor details.

It's like 25 ""House"" episodes, but without the gratuitous obnoxiousness, condescension to the reader, or the ridiculous constraint that only a limping, misanthropic painkiller addict can be right. I found these essays much more satisfying than those in the Oliver Sacks collection I also sampled over the weekend (""An anthropologist on Mars""). Not sure why, but there is something about Dr Sacks that rubs me the wrong way - at the very least, I'd be happier if he cut all his chapters by 50%, I don't find his ruminations nearly as fascinating as he apparently does. I suspect I'm in the minority on this one, as each new collection of his seems to receive universal acclaim. Furthermore, to be fair, the possibility has to be acknowledged that my vague ""I do not like thee Doctor Fell"" reaction to Sacks can be traced back to nothing more than damning him by association with Robin Williams. Because didn't Williams portray the Sacks-figure in ""Awakenings""? After which there are just two words left: PATCH ADAMS ....Note to self: strive to be a less shallow person in 2008.

Hope springs eternal.Yet somehow, things never quite turn out as promised. Usually, there will be no more than two or three good stories, nestled in the padding of half a dozen or so truly mediocre efforts.

Deborah Eisenberg doesn't really succeed in doing so; as a result, her stories don't pack that much of an emotional punch. based on this collection, she falls squarely in the middle of the pack. There are just six stories in the book - only one (""Like it or not"") was outstanding. Two of the remaning stories were reasonably enjoyable, and one was innocuous (albeit completely banal).

A fictional account of life in a pre 9/11 Chicago advertising agency that is hitting hard times and where downsizing is suddenly a weekly reality, it's enormously readable.

All of these diseases share a common feature - they are transmitted by an infectious agent of a kind thought until recently by scientists to be impossible, and the incubation time from infection to manifestation of disease symptoms is remarkably long. The culprits are *prions*, which are a type of rogue protein. The idea that a protein could act as an infectious agent flew completely in the face of scientific received wisdom to date when first introduced and the science underlying this class of degenerative brain diseases is both complex and controversial. The author's exposition is reasonably clear, but ultimately I think he does not do complete justice to the material (which is really fascinating). It may be that his scope is too ambitious - with so much ground to cover, the exposition occasionally lapses into sketchiness. To be fair, there can be no single ""right"" level of detail that would suit all readers, and D.T. Max generally shows good judgement about what to include to keep the exposition intelligible while moving his story along.That said, the material related to kuru, cannibalism among the Fore, and the linkage to scrapie, CJD, and mad cow disease has already been presented in the 1998 book by Richard Rhodes, ""Deadly Feasts: Tracking The Secrets Of A Terrifying New Plague"". I preferred the Rhodes account - his exposition of the science was clearer, and I thought he told a better, tighter story. However, there's not that much to choose between the two, and Max's book does have the extra material about FFI, which is interesting in its own right. Max does make one misjudgement, in my opinion, which is to include an account of his own illness (he has been diagnosed with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease which, although it is a neurodegenerative muscular disorder, is neither prion-related nor an amyloid plaque). Inclusion of this essentially irrelevant material is a distraction, which just muddies the exposition. One final criticism is that Max includes an unquestioning discussion of putative geographical ""clusters"" of CJD cases, based solely on their identification by patients' family members, whom he refers to as ""Creutzfeldt Jakobins"" (a hideous, tin-ear coinage, which he seems to think is clever). These so-called clusters are almost certainly spurious, based on an incorrect application of the relevant probability models and Max's failure to identify the error detracts from his objectivity as a science writer and contributes to a presentation of disease spread scenarios which are unduly alarmist. The discussion of possible treatment options in the final chapter also struck me as weak, an over-interpretation of what are essentially just anecdotal data. One sees this kind of over-interpretation all the time in the popular press, but I would have expected better from a science writer as experienced as D.T.

I just hadn't expected it to be quite as *sad* as it was. Somehow, it wasn't the more obviously depressing aspects (e.g. the persecution and torture that were routinely practiced under the Trujillo dictatorship in the Dominican Republic) that got to me so much as the smaller stuff. The continued failure of the various members of Oscar's family to connect, the accumulated hostility between generations, as well as the meanness and bullying suffered by outsider Oscar throughout, were ultimately more depressing than the earlier, more overtly brutal, events in Santo Domingo. You keep rooting for Oscar to catch a break and he never really does. Equally depressing was the narrator's ongoing inability to transcend the machisto Latino stereotype of repeated infidelity because of an apparent need to screw any woman that came in range. Only the women are strong in this book, and only one of them appears to be granted a shot at happiness.Fortunately, the book is not a total descent into darkness - primarily because the main narrator is sympathetic, funny and smart. He provides insightful commentary on Oscar's family affairs (even if he is unable to translate the insights to his own life). Oscar's family history unfolds according to a relatively complicated framework, intercutting past and present scenes using several flashbacks. Handled inexpertly, this has the potential to be confusing and/or irritating*, but Diaz manages it perfectly. (* The execrable ""Behind the Scenes at the Museum"" comes to mind.)A few random comments: 1. Diaz doesn't eschew the apparently obligatory 'magical' element, but I found the symbolism of the mongoose-lion critter in the canefield a bit murky (though I did learn the new word 'chabin(e)' : Person of mixed-blood who appears to bear the characteristics of only the lighter skinned parent; sometimes referred to in English as being ""yellow."")2.

See, I guess at some point he put together some kind of massive 26-episode series of half-hour lectures on how the mind works for public TV. They would come on at some ungodly hour of the morning so that I used to catch them while scarfing down my nutritious Lucky Charms and locally squozen OJ before leaving for work. Doctor Z would introduce each episode with a kind of geekish seriousness of purpose that one totally had to respect. Plus he would always be wearing some seriously appalling fashion atrocity - most commonly a truly regrettable sports jacket or shirt. But some episodes he'd get those down only to spoil the effect with some kind of hypnotically iridescent tie whose width was at least a decade off the prevailing norm. But the programs were not actually an insult to the intelligence, for the most part - the material was decently organized, lucidly presented, with a minimum of pomposity. If I'm not mistaken, in recent months Doctor Z has resurfaced on my public TV dial with a fresh, updated, completely revamped  version of the lectures. One imagines lots of snazzy functional mRI s**t. But of course that's not Doctor Z's only claim to fame. It's a safe bet the first few sentences of his obituary will define him in terms of the (infamous) ""Stanford Prison study"". In the early 1960s Stanley Milgram had shocked the scientific community with his series of ""obedience experiments"" that showed how an apparently strongly hardwired obedience to authority could lead people to commit barbaric acts of cruelty (http://www.goodreads.com//show/...). A decade later Zimbardo eliminated any possible doubt when a simulated ""prison experiment"" he was conducting on the Stanford campus had to be discontinued early for ethical reasons because the behavior of the participating students had degenerated into ""Lord of the Flies"" savagery within a period of only 4 days. The first 200 pages of this book are given over to a description of the infamous Stanford Prison Experiment (SPE). The middle third covers lessons learned from SPE and summarizes other experimental work related to the problem of people behaving badly. The final 200 pages discusses events at the Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad, as well as other excesses of the Bush administration in terms of what has been learned about human behavior from the SPE and similar experiments. To me, it's this final part of the book that is the most interesting. The initial material is readable enough, but seems way over-extended. I suspect that very few people (or the kind of people reading this book) are unaware of the SPE, so summarizing the main findings in 20-30 pages should have been possible, instead of the 200-page account which helps inflate ""The Lucifer Effect"" to a bloated 550 pages.That said, I remain a fan of Doctor Zimbardo. Even if the book is a little too long, he is always clear. And though what he has to say can be depressing, it's clearly not wrong. Understanding our own weaknesses and the factors that can allow cruelty and evil to flourish seems more important than ever these days.

Any short description I provide is necessarily reductive - it's a reworking of the Faust legend, with an embedded exploration of the story of Pontius Pilate, in which the devil and his retinue visit Stalinist Moscow. From this premise, the author produces a scathing satire of the politics of his time (fully aware that the book would not, and could not, be published during his lifetime), as well as an extremely thought-provoking discussion of the role of the artist, and the necessity of mercy and forgiveness. What I really liked about the book is the way he wraps some fairly deep themes into a hilarious story - we are given some hugely enjoyable tall tales by a mischievous, extremely funny narrator. The style is reminiscent of Flann O' Brien at his most coruscating; despite broad swipes at some fairly obvious targets, the overall story is uplifting, as the reader finally comes to the realization that Woland (the Satan-figure) is actually working on the same side as the Jesus-figure.It's obvious why, upon its delayed publication, this book immediately achieved the status of a classic of modern Russian literature. A completely unexpected delight - I highly recommend this book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,Dec 2007,"Nov 29, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/117833.The_Master_and_Margarita

Miss Manners This  is predicated on t Gentle Reader:You, sir, are an anarchist, and Miss Manners is frightened to have anything to do with you. Miss Manners This  is predicated on the assumption that you already have in your possession an up-to-date copy of  Miss Manners' Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior, the  sine qua non  of civilized people everywhere. Should this not be the case, then get out there, buy one, and study it! Only when you have truly assimilated the wisdom therein should you even think about etiquette for more specialized situations. Because, no matter how hard you strive to attain the coolness of the rebel, if you haven't mastered the basics, you will always be a schlemiel at heart.It's my personal belief that there are few situations in life which are not covered by the assembled wisdom of Miss Manners, and that anyone who has made a serious study of the aforementioned MMGtECB should have little difficulty extrapolating its core principles to scenarios not explicitly considered therein. Thus, for instance, while the Etiquette for Outlaws crew might recommend tipping 10 to 15% of the cost of one's piercing, Miss Manners readers will already have placed this in the same realm as 'hairdressers and nail sculptors', and know that a 15 to 20% tip is appropriate.Similarly, those who have internalized the core principles espoused by Miss Manners will immediately understand rock star Dave Navarro's explanation of how his choice to sleep with prostitutes rather than groupies is simply a matter of observing appropriate groupie etiquette.Much of the advice dispensed in ""Etiquette for Outlaws"" qualifies as little more than applied common sense: ""If you bring handcuffs to the Fetish Ball, make sure you also bring the key"" ""When looking for a doctor to give you a boob job, it's best to get a referral"" ""Don't buy drugs at a rave"" ""If you want to make it with a rock star, bring your own condoms"" ""Don't expect to be able to return or exchange that dildo, once it's out of its hermetically sealed packaging"".If any of the above didn't seem immediately obvious to you, then you might benefit from ""Etiquette for Outlaws"". With sections devoted to booze, smoking, gambling, strip clubs, sex (basic, porn, alternative, swinging), tattoos, piercing, wheels, guns, knives etc., meat, leather & fur, basic street etiquette, fighting, jokes, music scene etiquette, most of the bases are covered. Should things not go as planned, the chapter on ""The Aftermath"" (Rehab, the law and you, going to court, jail, homeless etiquette, suicide) may be of some help. But really, unless you are saddled with a burning desire to read Ice-T's views on strippers, or how porn star Mr Marcus felt upon completion of his role in ""The World's Luckiest Black Man"" (in which he has sex with 101 women),  Miss Manners' Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior should cover all the necessary bases, and makes for a far more interesting read. An appendix dealing specifically with the peccadillos of politicians would be a wecome addition to either of the books mentioned in this ....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Jun 24, 2009","Nov 28, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1111839.Etiquette_for_Outlaws

Since I don't know any Italian, choosing a decent translation was one of the first questions to be addressed. I spent an hour in Cody's comparing various options (there are a gazillion translations out there) - this was one of two that I ended up buying. Surprisingly (to me at any rate), roughly half of the available translations chose the low road of not even bothering to preserve Dante's famous terza rima metric scheme, with the excuse that only a 'literal translation' can convey the meaning adequately. Fie on your lazy asses, say I - it obviously can be done, even if you are too lamebrained to try. So I rejected the 'literal translations' out of hand, for the same reason that I would not choose a translation of 'Eugene onegin' that didn't at least try to preserve Pushkin's meter, when it is obviously such an intrinsic aspect of the work.I can't vouch for the fidelity of Carson's translation, but I liked it a lot. (I liked the other translation I read as well, but that's part of a different ). He does well by the terza rima, while managing to achieve an overall natural flow of the language. At times it is highly colloquial, which might disturb the purists: ""Ratbreath, when he heard this, rolled his eyes,and hissed 'Don't listen, it's a dirty trick,so he can jump. He must think we're not wise.'And he, whose AKA was Señor Slick,replied: 'It's dirt indeed, to get my comradesin the shit; in fact, it's rather sick.'Now Harley Quinn, unlike the other blades,was eager for some sport. ""Canto XXII, lines 107-114.As for the work itself, I think you all know the story. I haven't read ""Purgatorio"" or ""Paradiso"" yet - it seems highly likely to me that the ""Inferno"" is the most fun of the three, if only because it's entertaining to see how he uses it as a vehicle for getting even with his enemies. But, if you've been putting it off for years because you're intimidated by its status as a ""classic"", don't be put off any longer. It's actually a lot of fun, and easy to read.Comparing translations is an auxiliary source of entertainment, for those (like myself) who enjoy that kind of thing....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,not set,"Nov 11, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34376.The_Inferno

I've revised it slightly below and taken Popco off the ""utter dreck"" shelf. Unfortunately, for this book at least, she still gets stuck with the 'intellectual con artist' label.Scarlett Thomas is the author of ""The End of Mr Y"", an impressive book which was highly original and quite entertaining. So I had high hopes for ""Popco"". Unfortunately, this time it seems that Ms Thomas may have bitten off more than she could chew. The discipline that was evident throughout the tightly constructed ""The end of Mr Y"" is sorely missing here - one senses early on that things are spiralling out of the author's control.This is an ambitious, but also a profoundly irritating, book. The author clearly has a point to make, but does so in a fashion that manages to be both preachy and clumsy. There's a lot of faux-erudition, the parading of little tidbits of knowledge for no particular reason. But the author fails the basic requirements of the writer's trade -- she doesn't tell a credible story, and her habit of breaking off the narrative to include assorted heavy-handed, poorly thought out, mini-lectures on everything from prime factorization to networking is disruptive and pointless. These various digressions do not move the plot forward, and ultimately lead nowhere - the account of how the final code is cracked is presented at such a sketchy level of detail that the reader simply has to take it as a given - so why all the little lessons in codebreaking along the way?Ultimately, the book just collapses under the weight of the various digressions, whose relevance is never really made clear.Better accounts of some of the topics dragged into this book can be found in:Simon Singh's ""The Code Book""Naomi Klein's ""No Logo""Malcolm Gladwell's ""The Tipping Point""A more successful synthesis of some of the ideas, incorporated in a skillfully told story is in Neal Stevenson's ""Cryptonomicon"".But give this book a miss.

I know that my own self-image is that of someone with catholic taste in reading, not so easily pinned down. Sometimes you have to walk the walk so, based on some excellent book group recommendations, I ended up reading three books in the last month that were distinctly out of my ""comfort zone"". Though the three are quite different, they share a common feature, the exploration of human behavior under extreme circumstances. The first two were Jose Saramago's ""Blindness"" (response to a mysterious, frightening epidemic of blindness) and Maria Doria Russell's ""The Sparrow"" (the fate of an exploratory mission to a newly discovered planet in the Alpha Centauri system. I would recommend both books unreservedly, ""The Sparrow"" in particular.The last book of the three was Russell Hoban's ""Riddley Walker"", a dystopic vision set in a future, post-apocalyptic England. In the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust, society has reverted to a level of Iron-Age sophistication; wild dogs roam the countryside. Most problematically for the reader, Hoban's view involves language and communication reverting to an imagined pre-civilized patois, and the entire book is written as a first-person narrative by the main protagonist, Riddley Walker, in this invented ""proto-language"". Think of the Russian-based slang of 'A Clockwork Orange"" and multiply the degree of unintelligibility tenfold. Here is an example:""The Ardship he begun to gether with the Eusa folk they all took off ther cloes and tangelt ther selfs to gether all nekkit and twining like a nes of snakes which they callit that some poasyum.

Thought-provoking and gripping and I still find myself thinking about the questions it raised while I was reading it.This was a terrific book, on many levels. An engrossing story, engaging characters, fascinating premise - I was riveted throughout. It's impossible to categorize this book - classifying it as science fiction (it's about an exploratory mission to a newly discovered planet in the Alpha Centauri star system) doesn't begin to do it justice. It also addresses deep questions about faith, relationships and human resilience.The author alternates skillfully between the book's present (2059) and flashbacks to the planning and execution of the mission, building suspense to the devastating climax. (Warning: the ending is fairly grim.)Other aspects are less successful. In particular the various members of the mission crew are presented as incredibly accomplished and unbelievably charming, and are made to act as mouthpieces for the kind of deep, meaningful conversations that sound completely forced and unnatural. I must confess that I didn't find them nearly as witty and charming as the author obviously seems to think they are. The kindly, infinitely wise, witty doctor/den mother figure was particularly hard to stomach. One could also take issue with certain aspects of the plot - for instance, the uncanny similarity of the alien society to that on earth, but this didn't bother me as much as the artificial nature of some of the main characters.So, an ambitious and thought-provoking book, which doesn't succeed at every level. Despite its minor flaws I still give it 5 stars. It will be interesting to see what Brad Pitt makes of the film version, if it ever gets done.

Somewhere in a box in **spoiler alert** Review updated January 10th 2008:My track record with foreign Nobel laureates leaves something to be desired. Somewhere in a box in this apartment there is a book by Patrick White. I've read the first 30 pages three times. Every trip to the bookstore involves wilful ignoring of undoubtedly worthy offerings by Naguib Mahfouz and Wole Soyinka, with Orhan Pamuk joining the list of guilt triggers last year. If it weren't for my totally catholic reading tastes in college (Canetti, Sartre, Lessing, Gordimer, Grass, Hesse, Milosz), my record would be wretched indeed.So I approached Saramago's ""Blindness"" with some trepidation and a slight ""time to eat my vegetables"" attitude. Sure, it came highly recommended by friends whose judgement I trust. But would that old Nobel jinx kick in again?The short answer: No worries. I should have known that my friends wouldn't steer me wrong. I steamed through this book in less than 24 hours. A powerful and disturbing story, Saramago's parable draws you in and grips you. Written in a deceptively simple style, it's horrifying, but thought-provoking and completely plausible.It has left me eager to read more of this author's work. I highly recommend it.Added January 10th, 2008 [SPOILER ALERT]There are two obvious points one could take issue with - why does the doctor's wife retain her sight throughout, and the general recovery at the end. Given the overall fable-like setting - neither of these issues bothered me particularly. The first seems completely essential - this character's humanity underscores the moral bankruptcy of the fear-induced government response, but also offers a note of hope in what would otherwise be a bleak and pointless story. The ending also seems to me to be dramatically necessary, similar to the rescue at the end of ""Lord of the Flies"", the book that ""Blindness"" reminds me of most closely.The dramatic necessity of the restoration of normality is beautifully discussed in DeQuincey's essay ""On the Knocking at the Gate in macbeth"":http://www.4literature.net/Thomas_De_... ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,Oct 2007,"Oct 23, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2526.Blindness

The books included in this comparative evaluation are:Bulfinch'sThis is the third in a series of six s focusing on books about Greek mythology. The books included in this comparative evaluation are:Bulfinch's Mythology (Modern Library Paperback Edition, 2004)Mythology by Edith Hamilton (originally published in 1942; Back Bay Books edition of 1998)The Greek Myths by Robert Graves (Penguin Books combined edition, 1992)Gods and Heroes of Ancient Greece by Gustav Schwab (Pantheon Books, copyright 1946)Don't Know Much About Mythology by Kenneth C. Davis (Harper Collins, 2005)Myths of the Ancient Greeks by Richard P. Martin (New American Library, 2003)As Goodreads is not really set up to handle comparative s smoothly, the discussion is split across the six book s. I've tried to evaluate each book on its own particular merits, and also give some idea of how it stacks up relative to the others. I based the comparative evaluation on three main general criteria - readability, accuracy, and scope (breadth and depth of coverage); I also looked at how each book handled two particular examples -- the life of Hercules and the story of Philomela and Procne. More details about the comparison can be found in the introduction to the first : Bulfinch evaluation  Gods and Heroes of Ancient Greece is a translation of Gustav Schwab's Sagen des Klassischen Altertums, a book that has been the canonical source for Greek legends for several generations of Germans. I have a previous history with Schwab's original version in German: http://www.goodreads.com//show/... but my comments in this  are based on the excellent 1946 translation by Olga Marx and Ernst Morwitz. Gustav Schwab's original version was first published in Stuttgart in 1837, so it predates Bulfinch by a couple of decades, Edith Hamilton by roughly a century. It's remarkably good -- Schwab's goal was to write a book which could serve as a reference on Greek mythology at a level that would make them accessible to the ""common reader"". He accomplished his goal - the book was an immediate success in Germany, and Germans still regard it as a canonical reference, almost two centuries later. The style of Schwab's text is clear, authoritative, and straightforward (mercifully, Schwab avoids the kind of syntactical brambles so beloved of many of his contemporaries). The translation preserves all the virtues of the original and actually forces me to break out the word 'awesome', because I think it represents an improvement in many places. It almost achieves King James status, by which I mean that the language often seems so right as to be inevitable, and anything else doesn't sound as authoritative (in the same way that all other translations of the Bible sound ""wrong"" after you've read the King James version).Although it runs to 750 pages and the illustrations are nothing to write home about, it's a clear, useful, beautifully comprehensive reference. Not my first choice among the six on the list, but it's very good nonetheless. Schwab's particular genius was an ability to synthesize material from different sources brilliantly, frequently enriching a story whose main outlines he takes from one primary source with episodes taken from other sources. He does this so seamlessly that it feels like you're reading the canonical version. With respect to the two 'test stories' that I sued for the comparative evaluation of all six books on the list, Schwab's treatment of the life and adventures of Hercules is exemplary. It was a minor disappointment to find no mention of the story of Philomela and Procne. Relative to the other books on the list, Schwab devotes more space to The Trojan War and its aftermath (rougly 400 of 700 or so pages). Note that he is not giving a direct translation of the Iliad and the Odyssey - it's more like an intelligent, well-written precis. If you already know the originals pretty well, then the last half of Gods and Heroes may not be all that interesting for you.This is a fine book....more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,not set,"Sep 30, 2010","Oct 20, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/431071.Gods_and_Heroes_of_Ancient_Greece

YouThis exuberantly brilliant book never fails to remind me of one of the more obvious puzzles surrounding those who subscribe to strict creationism. You know, the people who actually believe that the Lord created the universe according to the seven-day timetable laid out in Genesis. Quite apart from the convoluted mental processes needed to accommodate such inconvenient evidence as the entire fossil record, (remember, these people would have us believe that humans and dinosaurs coexisted, Flintstone-like, in some kind of post-Genesis theme park), why would anyone choose such a parched, unimaginative view of the natural world when the reality is so much more glorious? Whether or not one believes in the existence of a divine entity at the back of it all, the fact is that the magnificent variation and huge diversity of evolutionary survival strategies that are explained by Darwin’s theory imply a universe that is infinitely more fascinating than the simplistic view of the strict creationists.Olivia Judson’s “Dr. Tatiana’s Sex Advice to All Creation” provides a comprehensive, hugely readable, account of one of evolution’s most important aspects – sexual selection. Dr. Judson has chosen a particularly delightful conceit to enlighten and entertain her readers – the book is structured as a series of letters and answers, spanning the entire natural world, to the eponymous “agony aunt” of the title, Dr. Tatiana. From the opening letter from a golden potto in the Gabon who wonders why her boyfriend’s penis is covered in enormous spines to the scandalized primate in the Ivory Coast complaining about the slutty behavior of the female chimpanzees in the neighborhood, the vignettes presented in this book are informative, wide-ranging, hilariously funny – in a single word, awesome.

Not really sure why - probably sheer contrariness, reacting against the apparent ubiquity of Bryson books and an apparent constant presence in the bestseller lists. Also, I had read his 'history of English' a while back and wasn't that impressed - it seemed to tread pretty familiar ground, and lacked depth.But 'Thunderbold Kid' turned out to be a pleasant surprise. The main things it has going for it are a low-key, slightly loopy, style which is surprisingly appealing and the fact that Bryson manages to be hilariously, sneakily funny. Sometimes the humor is so corny or obvious you wonder how he pulls it off, but he does.So much so that I was motivated to track down his two books about living/travelling in England : ""Neither Here nor There"" and ""Notes from a Small Island"". Given my general lack of interest in nature and the great outdoors, I suspect I'll be giving his Appalachian Trail book a miss, though. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Jul 24, 2008","Sep 21, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/42882.The_Life_and_Times_of_the_Thunderbolt_Kid

I hope they are not as disappointed as I was, but greatly fear that disappointment is likely, almost inevitable. For the reasons in my  below -  ""Flatland"" is a hilarious romp, wittily and successfully executed. This book, with its oh-so-clunky title, is most emphatically not. This book takes as its starting point Abbott's ""Flatland"", the quirky 19th century mathematical classic which imagines life in a 2-dimensional world, and deepens our intuitions about geometry by imagining how a visitor from a 3D world might be experienced by denizens of the plane. Abbott's book is hilarious, witty, unique. Ian Stewart is a mathematician with a flair for writing well, both technically (his book on Galois theory is a masterpiece of elegant writing), and for a more general audience (e.g. his recent ""Letters to a Young Mathematician""). This book is a noble, but deeply flawed, effort to extend the Flatland idea to that of a 3D world, imagining how we would experience a 4th dimension. The conceit is an appealing one - you want him to succeed, but - unfortunately - the whole effort falls pretty, um, flat. The clunky title is a good indicator of the strained attempt to be clever that permeates this whole book, like desperation.An object lesson in the folly of trying to improve on a classic, this book does nothing to burnish Professor Stewart's reputation as a writer. It should not, however, steer people away from trying some of his other work....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,Jan 2007,"Sep 21, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/922815.Flatterland

Well, I'm not a fan of the method of criticism which dredges through an author's entire  oeuvre , selectively presents the worst sentences as being typical, then invites our mockery and rejection of that author's whole body of work. Since this pretty much sums up Myers's approach throughout this expanded essay, it's not an effort that I greet with unbridled enthusiasm.Sure, maybe it's useful to be reminded that it's OK to have one's own taste diverge from that of the major mainstream critics, though this is something that is evident to me every time I read one of Michiko Kakutani's s. Ultimately, though the book is something of an improvement over the essay, in that it presents more examples of prose that Myers admires, his selective approach to the work of the authors he takes down, and his evident glee in doing so, combine to undermine one's trust in his capacity to act as a neutral er. In particular, I think a summary dismissal of the entire work of Paul Auster and Annie Proulx is unwarranted; by extension, though I am no great fan of Rick Moody or of Cormac McCarthy, my impulse after reading the attack on their work by Myers is to give the remainder of their work the benefit of the doubt. So while this polemic is interesting, it is ultimately unconvincing. In fact, the overall effect may be to increase one's sympathy for the writers chosen for profiling, surely the reverse of the author's intention....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Sep 18, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/101435.A_Reader_s_Manifesto

The central conceit of this book didn't seem all that promising, and I hadn't expected to like it, based on its subject and the s I'd read. But Hornsby is a skillful enough writer to pull it off - he pulls you in and makes you care about his (in some cases genuinely horrible) characters. He also manages the four alternating narrative viewpoints very effectively. This book reminded me a little of Mark Haddon's ""A spot of bother"", both in its tone and in the ultimate message that I took away from it. I can't bring myself to give it four stars however, because one of the four would-be suicides seemed a complete caricature to me. Annoying beyond belief, her main purpose seemed to be to function as a kind of crutch used by the author to poke his other characters with. I'm as willing to suspend disbelief as the next reader, but when all the incongruities and awkward dialog stem from the same character, this indicates a structural weakness that is hard to overlook.One thing I like about both Haddon and Hornsby is that, although both are talented and skillful writers, they don't constantly beat you over the head with their own cleverness. Something I couldn't say about Will Self, Martin Amis, or Julian Barnes. Let's not even mention the insufferable Hitchens. This is a decent book, which I liked more than I had expected to, and which also prompted me to think.

This is the first of several inter-related s for the books listed below:1.	The New Spaniards by John Hooper, 2nd edition, 2006.2.

The Ornament of the World : How Muslims, Jews, and Christians Created a Culture of Tolerance in Medieval Spain by Maria Rosa Menocal, 2002.4.	Spain in Mind (an Anthology) edited and with an introduction by Alice Leccese Powers, 2007.5.	Homage to Catalonia by George Orwell, 1938.6.	South from Granada by Gerald Brenan, 1957.7.	Driving Over Lemons by Chris Stewart, 1999.Some people might feel that Hemingway deserves a place on this list. On your list maybe. The machisto ramblings of a drunken lecher are of little interest to me.Why Spain? Well, after quitting my job in early 2007 (slight midlife crisis) I needed to find something else to do, so I set myself the goal of learning Spanish. Since then, I’ve spent roughly a year living there – an initial 6-month stay in 2007, with several subsequent visits of 6-8 weeks during 2008 and 2009. Most of that time was spent in Madrid, though I also had a stint in Salamanca, with time also in Andalucia (Seville and Granada) and a few weeks in Barcelona. In 2008 and 2009 I also spent time in Mexico, Chile and Argentina. Besides learning Spanish, my hope was to bring my life back into balance; the challenge of 6-months total immersion in a foreign country, forced to speak a different language, had an appeal.I had a blast. I did manage to learn Spanish (total immersion works! and it’s not actually true that all the relevant synapses are sealed off at age eight). I also found out along the way that Spain is fascinating – far more complicated than I had anticipated. One example: the first time I used an ATM I realised that there are actually four official languages. Think for a moment about the hugely complicated linguistic and regional political ramifications. In Andalucia, the art and architecture are constant reminders of the Arabic influence on the culture; the same influence is evident in the language (just think of all the words in Spanish beginning with ‘al’). What makes contemporary Spain so interesting can be summarized in a single word – change. Predictably, Franco’s death in 1975 unleashed the winds of change. What was less predictable was the rate at which change unfolded, in almost every aspect of Spanish life, always sooner rather than later. Within the past 30 years, Spanish society has been almost completely transformed, with change becoming the country’s defining characteristic. Transformations that took generations elsewhere have been squeezed in to the span of a single generation in Spain. How was the transition from dictatorship to democracy accomplished so smoothly? How did a country noted for sexual repression find itself in the European vanguard in legalizing gay marriage? What is the fallout from moving so quickly from a predominantly agrarian to a technologically advanced economy? What explains the extreme decentralization of a government which used to be rigidly centralized? How is Spain dealing with the recent influx of immigrants from its former colonies? Given the central role of its civil war in its recent past, what residual effects, if any, are still being played out? Will the Catholic church continue to play a central role in Spanish life? What about the role of the family? The role of women? What’s the deal with the Spanish royal family? If you spend any length of time in Spain, you find yourself asking questions like this. No single book on the list addresses them all, but the combined list was helpful in overcoming my initial disorientation.The ferment of change and the Spaniards’ willingness to embrace it (for the most part) combine to create a certain vibrancy to Spanish life. Combine this excitement with the charm of the country’s less ephemeral attractions – the architectural, linguistic and cultural legacy of a rich and interesting history, and it’s a mixture that’s impossible to resist. (This paragraph is sponsored by the Spanish Board of Tourism).The New Spaniards John Hooper’s book is an extensive update to an earlier version, The Spaniards, which he wrote in 1987 after several years working as a foreign correspondent in Madrid, where he had been posted to cover Spain’s (eventful) transition to democracy. Some authors are lazy about second editions, doing little more than graft a cursory “update” onto the already existing version. John Hooper is not such an author – the additional material is extensive and has been integrated into the earlier text with great care. The result is an excellent book. I came across it in 2009 and immediately wished I’d had it during my stay in 2007. One of its major strengths is an outstanding account, in its first section, of Spain’s transition from dictatorship to democracy. In only 90 pages, Hooper provides a clear, insightful analysis of events from Franco’s death to the political upset that followed the terrorist attacks of March 2004. As a single source to help understand the key political effects of the last 40 years, and their residual effects on the current political scene, Hooper’s book is unsurpassed. Its first section alone makes it worth reading, though the rest of the book is also very good. In 31 chapters all the major bases are covered. Hooper organises the material according to a few major themes: Private Domains: with chapters on the Church, sexuality, the role of men and women, the role of the family, and the Spanish propensity for ‘living on the edge’ (gambling, addiction, prostitution and the like).King and Country: with chapters on the monarchy, the army, and their relationship to the government.A Fissile State: the Basques, the Catalans, the Galicians, autonomy in action.A Changing Society: immigration, housing, education, welfare, the legal system.New Perspectives: the press, TV and radio, the cultural revolution, flameco and bullfighting, art and artists, the new Spaniards.Hooper writes clearly; though his style might reasonably be described as dry, I never found him boring. He has a skilled journalist’s ability to leaven discussion of policy or political events with a well-chosen concrete example or anecdote, so the reader’s interest is maintained throughout. The book’s comprehensive scope and its brilliantly concise account of Spain’s transition to democracy are particular strengths. My only possible criticisms are (very) minor – a certain remoteness in Hooper’s tone (which other readers might consider a virtue), and that his commentary extends only to 2004. This means that Hooper is silent about very recent developments, in particular, the ongoing debate about the legacy of the Spanish civil war that has been triggered by the discovery of several mass graves throughout the country. These criticisms do not apply to the next book on the list, Giles Tremlett’s “Ghosts of Spain”, which was a helpful complement. For anyone with an interest in contemporary Spain, Hooper’s book would be an excellent point of departure....more",Notes are private!,0,60,1,not set,"Sep 08, 2009","Sep 04, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/182129.The_New_Spaniards

This means that you agree to be scentsitive, to avoid repelling other patrons and attracting yellow jackets (sic). Furthermore, enjoyment of your gourmet pickled flamingo haunches in an elderberry reduction sprinkled with ground cervine fewmets will be conducted in accordance with the prevailing Bay Area norms for sybaritic excess (no slurping, all food preparation to have taken place in a certified peanut-free cooking facility).Regrettably, if yesterday evening's experience is any guide, Amphitheatre Etiquette appears to be a one-way street. It does not, for instance, protect you, the patron, from the fundamental hazard of wilful random butchery of Shakespeare's play at the hands of some home-grown blithering idiot, generally the play's ""director"". In the case of last night's performance of ""Macbeth"", the blithering idiot turned out to be a resident of Minneapolis called Joel Sass, who cheerfully opens his program remarks by telling us that he ""doesn't regard Shakespeare's plays as sacred texts"". Rather, they ""invite and reward thoughtful, imaginative interpretation"". No argument there, except that he then proceeds as if ""interpretation"" were a synonym for ""butchery"".Newsflash, Joel, ol' buddy. Some of us are not so keen on your idiosyncratic meddling. Whatever happened to the concept of truth in advertising? If I plonk down my $60 per ticket to attend a performance of ""Macbeth"" by William Shakespeare, have I not earned the right to see exactly that, and not some annoying bastardized version in which (a) any character with fewer than 10 lines has simply been eliminated (b) half a dozen remaining characters have been concatenated in some weird way - ""by extending their arc through the story, allowing them to absorb additional language and linger longer in Macbeth's sphere of influence""(c) some characters have switched gender for no apparent reason - a female Thane of Ross ""to show the presence of a powerful woman as a member of Duncan's inner circle"". Oh, no wait, the real reason is here, if you read the codewords correctly - it was a ""creative response to the casting of the ensemble"". Normally, I'd be more forgiving of your efforts to find a spot for good old Delia, were it not for the fact that she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag and was, in fact, so excruciatingly bad that she disrupted the emotional flow of every scene in which she appeared.(d) the witches have transmogrified into ""faceless veiled nuns of an unnamed order, haunting the halls of an old asylum"" The old asylum trick, eh? Wow, that's novel. Spare me, Jesus. It's already some kind of Stephen King marathon weekend on the SciFi* channel.FWIW, Joel. None of your impertinent modifications to the play constituted an improvement. And WHO THE FRACK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE, ASSMARMOT?The Shakespearean part of the evening's entertainment was, of course, first rate. Even though half of the actors, including Macbeth, were truly appalling. And the fake blood was so ubiquitous, and of a texture so bizarrely glutinous, that it managed to upstage both Mr and Mrs M at key points in the drama.Fortunately, ""Macbeth"" is a powerful enough play to withstand almost any amount of (artistic) butchery. Fully conscious of the ethical issues, the Macbeths do a very bad thing. Things can only go downhill from there. But seeing that inexorable decline play out is just chilling.*: I simply refuse to lend any legitimacy to the illiterate rebranding of the SciFi channel. The barbarians need to be stopped.

There are good guys, and there are bad guys, and nowhere is there room for even a shade of ambiguity. This kind of cartoonish view of the world leads to books which might be better classified as propaganda than as historical fiction.This was certainly the case for ""Exodus"", which amounted to thinly disguised propaganda. ""Armageddon"", dealing with the Berlin airlift, also tended toward crude 'good guy/bad guy' categorizations, but didn't bother me quite as much. However, I found Uris's heavyhanded, reductionist approach to writing about the situation in my own country supremely offensive from start to finish. In addition to grossly oversimplifying political events and allegiances throughout, Uris is sure to include every lazy, faith-and-begorrah, bogtrotting cliche about the noble, bibulous, freedom-fighting sons of Erin (and the pretty colleens that love them). The best that can be said about Uris is that he probably believed his own reductionist, 3rd grade view of history and world politics. But be warned - it's not just his thinking is at the 3rd grade level - much of the writing is as well. Uris's dictionary is stuffed with cliches, heavy on adjectives, but the word ""nuance"" is obviously missing. But why would we expect anything else? Uris was a hack. The man was in the business of churning out bestsellers. Apparently most readers like their historical fiction in black and white - the s of ""Trinity"" on Amazon.com are even more creepily adulatory than the Amazon norm. (Though I really would like to send the Bookmobile round to the caves of all those readers who claimed this was their ""favorite book ever""!) Well, I disagree with all of those Amazon acolytes. I thought this was a dreadful book, an insult to the intelligence, and I would recommend it to nobody.

It took recommendations from several friends before I finally decided to give this book a try. The subject matter seemed so uninteresting to me.When you're wrong, you're wrong, and I was totally off base on this one. It was fascinating from start to finish. What I realise now is that books like this one, which document someone's obsession (doesn't have to be the author's) often turn out to be completely engrossing, if the author (as Obmascik does) succeeds in conveying the inherent excitement in a topic that gave rise to the obsession in the first place.Never thought I would say it about a book related to birding, but I just cannot give this book a high enough recommendation....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,not set,"Aug 12, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/478878.The_Big_Year

I think it is threefold:(a) Full disclosure - I have a master's in math, so was predisposed to find it interesting(b) Actually (a) may be more or less irrelevant. What I realize is that books wherein someone who can write well takes the topic of their own, or someone else's obsession, and communicates the essence of that obsession are, to me, fascinating. Other examples that come to mind are ""Word Freak"", Stefan Fatsis's book about high-fliers in the world of scrabble (the key point being, it is absolutely not a book about Scrabble, rather it's a book about people's obsession with Scrabble) and Mark Obmascik's ""The Big Year"", which follows the exploits of three obsessed birders over the course of a year.(c) Steve Olsen is an excellent science writer, and his treatment of the different competitors in this book is compassionate and fascinating.It has to be mentioned that if you forget the exact spelling of Steve Olsen's name and try to look him up on google, you may find yourself wading through an awful lot of entries on Mary-Kate and Ashley.

The citation mentions the 'dry wit and almost involuntary elegance' apparent in the twelve stories. The translation (by Karen Marker, published in 2003) manages to preserve both the wit and elegance - these stories were fun to read. Courting rituals of the Saint-Germain-de-Pres, a country vet's terrible revenge, or an indelible encounter between a wild boar and a Jaguar which cannot end well; there are stories about longing and loss, a few almost unbearably poignant; others hilariously funny. Remarkably, in many cases, it's only in the last few lines that Gavalda reveals her hand.Many of the stories reach the level of Dorothy Parker at her best, which is to say they are very good indeed. Gavalda shifts easily between male and female perspectives; in almost every case the result is moving, without being sentimental, and is told with a dry, often devastating, wit. ...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,not set,"Aug 09, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/47776.I_Wish_Someone_Were_Waiting_for_Me_Somewhere

In ""La Place de la Concorde Suisse"", he digs below the picture-postcard prettiness and deceptive blandness of Switzerland and its people to deliver a fascinating (and slightly sinister) portrait of the Swiss Army. One of his most interesting books, written before he gave himself over to the fascination with geology that has inspired many of his more recent efforts. To say that McPhee writes well is a gross understatement. He is the literary father of Malcolm Gladwell, with the same characteristic ability to take an apparently abstruse topic and write about it with extraordinary lucidity, weaving a fascinating story that draws the reader in and holds the attention right to the end. If you haven't read any of McPhee's work, this would a good book to start with.

The ""ghost map"" constructed by Snow, and the identification of the index case by Whitehead, were eventually successful in displacing the prevailing ""miasma theory"" by establishing linkage beyond reasonable doubt to contamination at a single water pump (the Broad Street pump).Johnson does an excellent job of providing a tightly-constructed account of the events during, and immediately following, the week when the epidemic was at its height. He is also very effective in placing the two men's discovery in historical context, and in giving a broader perspective on its significance.

Not American Idol. No, it's  NCIS . Nothing pleOver the past year, I have developed a disturbing addiction to one of America's most popular TV shows. Not American Idol. No, it's  NCIS . Nothing pleases me more than when Channel 42 runs one of their sporadic Saturday NCIS marathons, because I've come late to a series that's about to finish its seventh season, so there's a heap of old episodes I have yet to see. There are aspects of this new enthusiasm that I prefer not to analyze too closely, because every addiction has its dark side. With NCIS, what's clearly problematic is my emotional response as the team members routinely violate the privacy of each and every suspect the trail throws up. ""Violate"" doesn't even begin to describe it - words like ""rape"" or ""demolish"" might be closer. Objectively viewed, it's horrifying - and my blood chills at the thought that anyone would invade my life to that extent. But when I watch each week's episode, not only am I not appalled at the team's excesses,  I actually cheer them on . I think the show accomplishes this through a combination of the latest in gee-whiz technology and forensic science (like the CSI shows), by manipulating the pace of the narrative to avoid giving the viewer time to dwell on potential issues of individual privacy, and by exploiting the considerable goodwill that regular viewers are likely to feel towards the goodlooking, witty, charming, smart and essentially decent characters. After all, often as not they are trying to track down that terrorist cell in downtown Alexandria. So when Agent Gibbs, the quintessential good guy, has the sleazebucket strip club owner in the interrogation room, brandishing the threat of Gitmo in lieu of Mirandizing the suspect, well ... we know he has everyone's best interests at heart. Unless you are a sleazebucket. But here's the thing. Each of us has some aspect of our lives, past or present, in which we are essentially sleazebuckets. And maybe, just maybe, we have the right (even during a ""war on terror""; no, especially during a war on terror) not to have these parts of our lives held up to public scrutiny. Which is exactly the question raised by Boll in this relatively short, but powerful book. I was living in Germany when it was first published, and it was one of the first complete books I was able to complete in German. When it was filmed, a few years later, I had a summer job in Berlin, and I remember that there was much renewed public debate about the issues raised. It bothers me that public debate on the topic in the U.S. has been muted to non-existent. Given the extraordinary degree to which snooping is now possible, scenarios for abuse are not hard to think up. I revisited this book recently; it still retains its power. ...more",Notes are private!,0,11,3,not setnot setnot set,Aug 1974not setnot set,"Aug 06, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/69880.The_Lost_Honor_of_Katharina_Blum

I would have expected a writer as provocative as Camille to have afforded more insight into the poems chosen here. No argument with her selection, but her analyses didn't add a whole lot IMO.added December 3rd, 2008 - I was somewhat surprised at the Camille-love that seems to permeate other people's s of this book. I just don't see those penetrating insights. What I do see are relatively obvious points, articulated with supreme confidence and her signature dash of provocation or outrageousness. Which is hardly the same thing as genuinely smart insight. Writing in ""The Guardian"" about an article in which Paglia explains why certain 20th century writers didn't make the cut, John Dugdale comments: Familiar names from Donne to Yeats, Marvell to Plath made the squad, but Paglia's 20th-century choices were surprising, and in a recent essay in Arion (http://www.bu.edu/arion/Paglia16-2.html) she reverts entertainingly to snarling type in explaining why she left several giants out.Among those who, like her feminist enemies, fail to meet her standards are Pound (""Showy, arcane""), Auden (""dated ... vague blather""), Moore (""nothing deep, reflex jokiness""), Bishop (""sentimental, weary""), Rich (""clumsy ... bathos""), Ashbery (""florid and strained"") and Heaney (""second-hand Yeats""). Jorie Graham is rubbished as ""fey and precious"", John Berryman and Robert Creeley are so feeble their banishment needs no explanation, and even the critic Helen Vendler (""terminally prim"") receives a sideswipe. Perhaps she and VS Naipaul, who finds equally little that pleases him in 20th-century fiction, should join forces.  My favorite part is where Camille nixes Marianne Moore because she fails to match the ""high-impact, around-the-clock sports talk on radio and TV"". Or maybe it's where she disses Seamus Heaney as ""second- or third-hand Yeats"". I'm gonna go out on a limb and predict that Auden, Pound, Moore, Bishop and Heaney will continue to be read and remembered long after the strident, self-promoting bitch that is Camille Paglia has kicked the bucket.

Words are indeed the precious coins of our linguistic currency, and not to be squandered foolishly.

Sadly, its original 3-star rating didn't hold up - it's even more of a mess than I had remembered. And considerably less fun. Spending 300 pages inside the head of a main protagonist who is undergoing a mental breakdown, and who amounts to little more than a not very interesting caricature, is a dubious pleasure at best. Sure, Kirn gets in a few well-placed zingers at the weirdness that lies at the core of corporate America's culture of middle management, but it's not as satisfying or as entertaining as you might think. Satirizing the prevailing management culture is like shooting fish in a barrel, but in the end the reader, exhausted by 300 pages of unfocused, stream-of-consciousness rambling, is left wondering what point Kirn was trying to make.The huge differences between the film and the original book make this question even more puzzling. Kirn is on record as being ""very happy"" with the film treatment, despite the fact that the differences between the film and the book far outweigh the similarities. Maybe the explanation is that it's hard to screw up a book which had no clear message to begin with. Confession: I haven't seen the movie version yet, but it's bound to be more entertaining than the book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jan 07, 2010","Aug 05, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/30680.Up_in_the_Air

I think I was in my twenties when I first read ""The Sheltering Sky""; what seemed profound back then seems considerably less so now. The ennui of the main protagonists didn't bother me particularly when I first read the book; this time around I wanted to reach in and slap them to their senses. Many times over.

Why create a brilliant, memorable central female protagonist, totally capable of bringing teh awWhat is the deal with lady detective fiction writers? Why create a brilliant, memorable central female protagonist, totally capable of bringing teh awesome, only to undermine her by having her mope around after some overbred aristocratic prat? Case in point: that whole Havers-Linley dynamic would be infinitely healthier had detective Havers given pompous-assed golden boy Linley a good kick in the yarbles the very first time he tried to pull the whole tired aristo-boy superiority trick to put her in her place. Given the choice between Havers and Linley, I know who I’d want to have my back, and it wouldn’t be the effete aristocrat, no matter how hard Elizabeth George tries to protray him as a sensitive, noble, brilliant soul. But it’s Havers I feel sorry for – she really deserves better.*If you believe, as I do, that George’s apparent infatuation with her idealized aristocrat ultimately weakens the Havers-Linley stories, then what to make of the hero-worship that permeates the entire Peter Wimsey series? After all, isn’t Harriet Vane just an obvious stand-in for her creator, making Lord Peter nothing more than a vehicle for the vicarious fulfilment of Dorothy L. Sayers’s own romantic fantasies? Or, to use the terms I just recently learned from the infinitely amusing (but beware, it’s a complete timesuck) “Television Tropes and Idioms” website, isn’t Peter just the quintessential example of the  Blue Blood  trope, in response to Harriet’s  Author Avatar?Well, no. Not really. Although Harriet Vane surely reflects her creator to some degree (something Sayers vigorously denied), it would be reductive to regard the character as nothing more than an author avatar. Sayers’s personal life was actually quite romantically adventurous, though this was not generally known during her lifetime. More importantly, Dorothy L. Sayers was smart as all get out (when she translated Dante, she respected that terza rima**, not like some wusses one could mention – yeah, I’m talking about you, Professor Ciardi). Any way you look at it, Harriet Vane rocks (out loud, and on lingonberry toast). And while I personally find it hard to take Lord Peter seriously, at least he has the virtue of being vaguely amusing, and nowhere near the kind of pompous ass that Inspector Linley manages to be. “Gaudy Night” is my favorite of all the Harriet/Peter books. There’s no murder, but the stakes are high, nonetheless. Poison pen letters and obscene effigies are being used to target the female scholars of a prestigious Oxford college. Sayers’s depiction of the mounting fear and disruption, and of the emotions swirling beneath the veneer of academic rationalism, is riveting. Lord Peter is relatively scarce, so Harriet is center stage for most of the story. It’s a neat story, expertly told, with that irresistible Oxford setting. You can appreciate it without knowing anything about campanology or mithridatism. And if you do happen to care about the trajectory of the Harriet-Peter relationship, then the ending of “Gaudy Night” will surely warrum the cockles of your sentimental heart. This is Dorothy L. Sayers at her best.*: EG is not the only authoress to consign her sleuth-heroine to an unsatisfying emotional limbo. Consider Jacqueline Winspear, creator of the delightful Maisie Dobbs series. In five or six meticulously researched, well-written, generally tightly-constructed stories, Ms Winspear tracks the exploits of her charming, plucky protagonist Maisie during World War I and the decade immediately following. Despite the odd lapse (placement of the telling historical detail is sometimes a little heavy-handed, the high-minded purity of motivation of Maisie and her friends can be excessive at times), Ms Winspear delivers the goods – stories in the series are reliably entertaining. But across a timespan of 15 years, the heroine is allowed little more than the occasional chaste peck on the cheek; for the decade or so after the end of the war the only release outlet for her emotional energy was through occasional visits to her irreversibly shell-shocked sweetheart (mercifully killed off in the fourth or fifth book). The unremitting bleakness of the emotional landscape Ms Winspear imagines for her protagonist is really starting to get me down, though I understand she may be making a point about life after the Great War for women in Maisie’s demographic cohort.**: Actually, the Sayers translation is not particularly readable, but I give her points for effort.

In the spy-thriller genre, there was Erskine Childers' ""Riddle of the Sands"", and this book by John Buchan.Of course, I'd seen the Hitchcock film, but didn't really remember much of it. Someone posted a question, wondering if the book matches the excellence of the movie. In a word: ""absolutely"". I read the first chapter several weeks ago, then put the book aside. When I picked it up again last night, I finished it in one sitting (it is fewer than 100 pages).Nothing profound, or life-changing - just an excellent story, excitingly told.

Whatever the circumstances of his life and death, this story is a ""cracking good read"", one of the earliest novels in the genre of spy fiction. Don't be put off by the various maps and charts at the beginning of the book - it is entirely possible to enjoy the story without knowing anything about sailing (though presumably the fun of the story will be heightened for those who do have some knowledge of sailing and maritime affairs). The voice of the narrator is irresistibly charming, the story is an excellent one, tautly told. I feel almost ashamed to be discovering this story as late in life as I am. But better late than never. I highly recommend this book.(I remain infinitely grateful to the Penguin Classics series, available in Spain here for a mere €2.50 a book.

I read ""Goats"", his unusually sure-footed debut novel, to a background of faint grinding and whimpering noises, almost as if someone were throwing kittens into the machinery in the basement. Puzzling, as the basement is free of both kittens and machines. Finally I realized that the odd acoustic phenomenon was just the eldritch sound of Poirier's workshop classmates wailing and gnashing their teeth. As well they might. There are so many reasons for ""Goats"" to crash and burn. Mark Poirier makes one seemingly indefensible writing choice after another. Ellis, the main protagonist, is this incredible boy-wonder! He's athletically gifted! He's tall and handsome! He exudes coolness from every pore. He's academically brilliant, to the point where the mean Latin teacher has to invent criticisms of his Latin accent to justify giving him an A-minus. (Seriously, that's his main academic worry). Maybe Ellis is just super-blessed, because Mark Jude Poirier allows him to grow emotionally (the book is, after all, first and foremost a coming-of-age story). The same can't be said for Ellis's mother and her latest boyfriend, neither of whom is allowed to rise above the level of shrill, irritating caricature. For crying out loud, the goats who roam around the manuscript get way more character development than many of the people. Yes indeed, given the amount of page space given to those smelly, bad-tempered goats and their perpetually stoned owner, the number of blissed-out bong sessions, scenes of prep school angst that could have been lifted straight from ""The Catcher in the Rye"" (replace ""lacrosse"" by ""crew"", underage drinking spree in N.Y. by u.d.s. in D.C., the Dakota by the Watergate, ""run-in with surly hooker"" by ""unfortunate incident with belligerent transvestite""), it seemed inevitable that this book should collapse in flames. To my surprise, it does no such thing - the story has a kind of goofy charm that just continues to grow on you. MJP has broken any number of very sensible rules about story-writing, and appears to have gotten away with it. Thereby offering further proof that writing a novel that ""works"" is never really about observing a given set of conventions. A writer with sufficient cojones can get away with almost anything, if they* have enough talent, confidence, and if their* heart is in the right place. Genuine humor and an appreciation of life's absurdities are a help; understanding what makes people tick is essential. At the risk of succumbing to the biographical fallacy, it's tempting to link Poirier's ability to get details of his characters' actions so convincingly right** to his having grown up as the fifth of eleven siblings.Whatever the explanation, the combination of skills that Mark Jude Poirier demonstrates in ""Goats"" is impressive and appealing. There's not exactly a shortage of debut coming-of-age novels, but few are as good as this low-key, surprisingly engaging, story. Whether or not the goats have a deeper symbolism is something you'll have to figure out for yourself.*: ""they"" and ""their"" used to indicate the third person singular, of indeterminate sex.**: It didn't surprise me to read that he was scriptwriter of the excellent 2008 movie ""Smart People"" http://movies.nytimes.com/2008/04/11/....""Smart People"" is the kind of film that drives some people insane with annoyance and that some of us find totally irresistible, bordering on genius.

He's Latino, born in San Francisco of Mexican parents, but grew up in Sacramento. He's also Catholic and gay. Which apparently allows him to claim the trifecta of identity politics, that rare triple minority status.To give him credit, Rodriguez gained a certain notoriety as a young academic for his principled refusal to take advantage of the benefits that affirmative action policies offered him. Unfortunately, he does not seem to have been able to avoid the trap of allowing himself to be defined by his ethnicity, and to a lesser extent, his homosexuality. Disappointingly, Rodriguez's writing career consists almost exclusively of endless public rumination about the status of gays, Catholics, and Latinos in general, and his own life in particular. Though he can write a mean essay when he exercises a little self-discipline, far too often he descends into a kind of maudlin, whining, self-pity. One wonders how he survived adolescence at all, given the enormous size of the chip on his shoulder. Life is so unfair, and why couldn't he have been born as a popular straight white jock?Well, excuse me, but donnez-moi un break!. There are plenty of worse places than Sacramento to grow up, and he wasn't exactly raised in poverty. At what point did he decide that the alienation of the immigrant experience was going to be his lifelong shtick? At age 3? 6? 12? To date he has published three books, each of a more or less autobiographical nature, at roughly ten-year intervals (1982, 1992, 2002). Each contains some biographical sketches and copious ruminations on the status of minorities in the U.S. Of the three, the first is by far the best, and probably the only one worth reading - it's crisply written and avoids the deficiencies of the later books. I would characterize the main defects of the later books as (a) meandering, undisciplined navel-gazing and tail-chasing, worrying the whole ethnic identity question to death with ever-diminishing returns (b) a tone that is predominantly whinily self-pitying (c) a creeping pomposity of tone prompting my reaction(a) you could just get over it already(b) oh, for christ's sake, try counting your blessings, which are multiple(c) if you want to write about the widespread use of cell phones in Finland, don't write ""Everyone in the flaxen-haired capital of despair is on the phone, one hears"". For that matter, I'm sure the Finns might object to the glib ""Finland, a nation famous for sardines and suicide and short winter days..""Rodriguez didn't always write like a pathetic hack. But somehow he still walks around with that monumental stick up his ass and a pronounced sense of ""otherness"". Much to the detriment of his later writing.If he keeps to his schedule, we can expect the next volume of essays in 2012. Though you may hope that the Mayans have got it right and that we will all be spared a fourth volume. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,Jan 2005,"Jul 22, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/258885.Brown

Fiercely intelligent, she was born into an Irish-American fMary Gordon is a writer whose previous work I've found engaging and at times exasperating. Fiercely intelligent, she was born into an Irish-American family of strictly observant Catholics. Her upbringing - in particular, its devoutly Catholic aspect - is reflected in all her work; her earlier novels are invariably populated by Irish-American women trying to come to terms with the particular brand of misogyny their church was selling (and never quite managing to escape the creepy tentacles of guilt so effectively instilled during their youth). I gave up on Ms Gordon for a while, as she seemed unable to get beyond these concerns, which made her fiction a bit one-note and seemed a shame, given her talent.I can't report on her recent novels, but I did come across this collection of essays in the bookstore recently. Published in 1991, these essays confirm my impression of Gordon as an exceptionally smart and talented writer. The book is divided into three main sections:""Parts of a Journal"", ""The World, The Church, The Lives of Women"", ""On Writers and Writing"".For my money, it's the last section that hits paydirt, for several reasons. Among its dozen or so pieces are essays on each of: Christa Wolf, Ingeborg Bachmann, and Edna O'Brien, three writers whose work I really like and who most ers/readers seem never to have heard of. So it was a pleasure to read Gordon's smart, thoughtful take on the work of each. The title essay, in which Gordon bewails the prevalent tendency in American fiction ""to connect males with movement and life, females with stasis and death"", as illustrated by the work of Faulkner and Dreiser, contains as fine a smackdown of Updike as you're likely to come across, all the more effective for being eminently reasonable. She also has interesting things to say about Edith Wharton, Flannery O' Connor, William Trevor, Virginia Woolf, David Plante and Ford Madox Ford (to list the authors I care about). Two essays on Mary McCarthy (big fat yawn), as well as one on Stevie Smith and one on Adam Hochschild round out the collection. The general wisdom that informs almost all of these essays is in marked contrast to Gordon's inexplicable enthusiasm for ""the priestly comedy of J.F. Powers"", a writer whose work calls to mind some of the more regrettable excesses in the television portrayal of that delightful Hibernian stereotype - the perpetually bewildered Oirish clargyman, (curate, parish priest or monsignor) always quaking at the prospect of some fresh ukase from the Bishop's palace, browbeaten by the battleaxe housekeeper, and secretly adored by the entire female congregation. Just imagining a society in which Powers's particular brand of drivel could be considered relevant leaves one's soul a little deader. But everyone's entitled to at least one lapse - no surprise that Mary Gordon's has ecclesiastical origins.I firmly anticipated that the essays in that middle section (""The World, The Church, The Lives of Women"") were least likely to succeed, and boy was I wrong! The pair of essays ""Abortion: How do we Think About It?"" and ""Abortion: How do we Really Choose?"" are smart, clear, level-headed and thought-provoking in the best possible way; besides the clarity of her writing, I particularly enjoyed Gordon's ability just to *nail* Christopher Hitchens in passing - with no particular malice, she simply points out the ugliness that hides beneath his superficially liberal pronouncements. Two essays where Gordon continues to worry the bone of her Catholic upbringing and its legacy are likely to be of interest only if you're a (lapsed) Catholic with a masochistic streak (someone like me, say), but the piece called ""Offenses of the Pope"" should be read by everyone. The last essay in this group, ""I Can't Stand Your Books"": A Writer Goes Home, left me not knowing whether I should laugh or cry. Gordon explains her family's reaction to her books, and to her success, and it ain't pretty. At her uncle's funeral, another uncle buttonholes her to say ""I just want to tell you that I can't stand your books. None of us can."" Her cousin the nun drifts by to tell her ""Mary, I just feel the need to tell you that I think your books are dreadful.""Escaping that particular bunch of troglodytes cannot have been easy. Luckily, Mary Gordon is ultimately way too smart to allow others to tell her how she should think. The essays in this collection prove just how smart she is. I highly recommend them. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Jun 25, 2010","Jul 22, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/483102.Good_Boys_and_Dead_Girls

The author obviously wanted to use this incident to illustrate some point of his own, but for the life of me I couldn't really figure out what he was trying to get at. The general critical reception seems to have been favorable. For instance, Nicholas Royle, writing for The Independent delivers himself of this gem (they should take away his ing licence):""I'm going to stick my neck out and call it a masterpiece.""Alex Gibbons, of the New Statesman, is a bit more cautious, calling it ""a work of obvious passion and great skill"". Which suggests to that maybe Alex didn't quite know what to make of it.I wanted to like this book more (because, you know, giraffes).

In this book, an update of an earlierMichael Schermer is the founding publisher of Skeptic magazine and a contributing editor of Scientific American. In this book, an update of an earlier version, with a foreword by Stephen Jay Gould, he takes on a number of worthy targets, including:* believers in the paranormal and extra-sensory perception (ESP)* near-death experiences and those who channel ""past lives""* alien abductions* witch-hunting and the recovered memory movement* Ayn Rand and the cult of objectivism* anti-evolutionism and ""creation science""* holocaust deniers and other pseudohistorians* scientific ""proofs"" for the existence of God* assorted conspiracy theories pertaining to aliens and coverupsThe chapters containing the repudiation of these various instances of pseudoscience and pseudohistory form the core of the book. They are flanked by a three-chapter introduction, ""Science and Skepticism"", and two concluding chapters: ""Why do people believe weird things?"" and ""Why smart people believe weird things"".I have read a number of books along the lines of this one (e.g.  Damian Thompson's ""Counterknowledge"" , Robert Park's ""Voodoo Science""). Each triggers a fundamental question - who is the author's intended audience? Scientists, after all, are unlikely to need this kind of primer on logical thinking, and how likely is it that the kind of person who believes in alien abduction, the healing power of crystals, or past-life channeling will actually read this book. Isn't there an element of preaching to the choir that renders this kind of book superfluous? Among the three books mentioned, Schermer's is most effective in addressing this criticism, in my opinion. The particular examples that he considers establish that magical thinking is in no way confined to ""dumb"" people - there are plenty of very smart people on the roster of those who have embraced one kind of pseudoscientific notion or another. His third chapter, ""How Thinking goes Wrong (25 fallacies that lead us to believe weird things)"" and his final chapter, exploring the kind of cognitive errors that smart people may be particularly prone to commit, are particularly valuable. For instance, this overview of mistakes people make when given the task of selecting the right answer to a problem after being told whether particular guesses are right or wrong:A. Immediately form a hypothesis and look only for examples to confirm it.B. Fail to seek evidence to disprove one's current hypothesis.C. Show great reluctance to change one's current hypothesis, even when it is obviously wrong.D. Fail to consider more complex solution strategies in the face of more complicated data.E. Find ""patterns"" where none exist.All the evidence suggests that everyone, even ""smart"" people, is hard-wired to fall into these cognitive traps. Schermer's writing style is clear, lively, if a bit undisciplined at times. His refutation of some of the specific topics, creation science and holocaust denial in particular, is spread over several chapters, and could have been done more concisely. And the inclusion of the chapter on Ayn Rand struck me as being somewhat out of place, though it's always fun to read an articulate smackdown of her ridiculous ""philosophy"". For me, the introductory remarks on science and skepticism, and the final two chapters were the most interesting sections. Nonetheless, the book addresses important questions in a well-written, entertaining manner. I give it a strong recommendation. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Aug 15, 2008","Jul 19, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/89281.Why_People_Believe_Weird_Things

Its central conceit? Slater, a psychologist, ""revisits"" ten of the most (in)famous historical experiThis is a fascinating, monumentally flawed, book. Its central conceit? Slater, a psychologist, ""revisits"" ten of the most (in)famous historical experiments conducted in psychology, work which has played a key role in establishing the prevailing dogma about human behavior. Each experiment gets its own chapter in the book.Obviously, the success of this kind of gimmick depends critically on (a) the particular set of experiments chosen for inclusion, (b) the author's insight - her ability to interpret the experimental results correctly and to situate them within the broader context, and (c) (assuming that the previous step has been accomplished), her ability to communicate the message effectively to a non-specialist reader. Can she spark readers' curiosity and hold their attention? Can she chart a course between the Charybdis of breezy superficiality and the Scylla of excessive detail to write clearly, at a level that is appropriate for a general audience? Slater scores highly on the first criterion. The experiments she has included were thought-provoking when they were first published, and they remain fascinating. Many of them achieved canonical status precisely because the results were so counterintuitive, confounding expectations and forcing investigators to reexamine prior beliefs. This tends to be true in any discipline - often it's the experiment that yields anomalous results that turns out to be important. Among the ten experiments that Slater discusses are: B.F. Skinner's work on operant conditioning, Stanley Milgram's obedience experiments, Harry Harlow's experiments demonstrating that a (monkey) baby's need to be held and cuddled is more primal than the need to be fed, studies that showed the importance of ""social cuing"" and the bystander effect in determining people's response to an emergency or a request for help, and Elizabeth Loftus's work which essentially debunked the whole ""recovered memory"" trend that had become popular in the 1980s. What does Slater have to tell us about these experiments? The good news is that she is quite capable of providing a lucid description of the various experimental protocols, results, and explaining their significance in the broader scheme of things. This despite the fact that, at some fundamental level, the woman is borderline unhinged. This is someone who, as part of the ""research"" conducted for the book, tries to see if she can personally duplicate results of one of the earlier experiments (in which nine healthy subjects presented themselves at the admission units of different mental hospitals, claiming to hear voices in their heads saying ""thud"", to see what would happen - answer, 8 diagnoses of schizophrenia, with hospital stays ranging from 7 to 52 days, despite behaving completely normally and never repeating the initial complaint). I should note that Slater does this not just once, but  nine times: ""It's a little fun, going into ERs and playing this game, so over the next 8 days, I do it 8 more times"" (each time she receives a diagnosis of psychotic depression and a fistful of pills).Of course, long before reaching this episode, the reader will have figured out that Slater has a pathological need to make herself the center of attention. Almost every chapter contains a perfectly lucid account of the research and the issues, which is marred by whole swaths of extraneous irrelevant stuff about Slater's own life. This material is easily recognized, as the prose switches into a mode best described as ""histrionic"", but it gets very old very fast. Unfortunately, there are other, more disturbing issues as well. As the book progresses, it becomes evident that Slater's view of what constitutes truth in reporting is more flexible than one might wish in a science reporter. See, for example, these links:  Deborah Skinner's rebuttal  NT Times article To me, the most distasteful aspect of the book, other than Slater's persistent self-aggrandization, is her habit of adding superfluous negative editorial comments when describing people who have agreed to speak with her (she has a related tendency to engage in uncharitable speculation about the thoughts and motivation of people who are dead, and thus unable to defend themselves). And what kind of person seeks out one of the participants of the Milgram study and forces them to spend an afternoon resurrecting what are obviously extremely disturbing memories of their behavior during the study? Well, the same kind of person who evidently has no qualms about tracking down a Stage 4 cancer patient to browbeat them, not just once, but several times about what she perceives as ""dissonance"" between the patient's faith and her medical prognosis. It is a testament to Slater's monstrous self-absorption that she ends the chapter in question by reassuring us that she herself is at peace. It's as if the skinhead with the baseball bat came over to reassure you that he's OK, really, he'll be fine. Just a little blood on his boots, nothing that can't be cleaned up. And that he's never felt so invigorated.But, as we know, loathsome people sometimes write books that are worthwhile.

Driving Over Lemons by Chris Stewart, 1999.Some background information motivating my interest in Spain is given in my  of  The New Spaniards; I won't repeat it here.The books by John Hooper and Giles Tremlett are essentially factual; each presents a picture of contemporary Spain, both are reasonably complete, Tremlett's is a little more impressionistic.This book, edited by Alice Leccese Powers, is a terrific collection of pieces by ""great writers entranced by Spain"". Powers has assembled a wonderful collection, which includes pieces by all of the usual suspects (Hemingway, Auden, Orwell, Washington Irving, James Michener, Gerald Brenan, Langston Hughes), augmented by contributions from other illustrious literary pilgrims (Lord Byron, Henry James, John Dos Passos, Edith Wharton, Robert Graves, Anthony Trollope, W. Somerset Maugham), a smattering of poetry (Billy Collins, E.E. cummings, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Andrew Marvell, William Wordsworth), and a variety of travel pieces from such 20th century visitors as Rose Macaulay, Jan Morris, Eric Newby, Calvin Trillin, Joanna Trollope, Tim Moore, Barbara Kingsolver, and Mary Lee Settle.The result is an absolute delight -- a book that's small enough to be an unobtrusive travel companion, that one can dip into with confidence, knowing that one's faith in the editor's judgment will not be misplaced. The inclusion of pieces spanning three centuries provides a deeper understanding of context and historical background; the choice of authors helps the reader gain an appreciation of Spain's position in the literary and artistic imagination over the years. There isn't a dull piece in the book (Wordsworth's contribution is confined to one solitary sonnet, in case you were wondering; even I can tolerate a sonnet). It may be just a happy coincidence that the more recent contributions are by travel writers and authors who I've always enjoyed (Rose Macaulay, Eric Newby, Jan Morris, Calvin Trillin, Barbara Kingsolver, Mary Lee Settle).For centuries, travelers from around the world came to Spain -- drawn by its art, food, culture, all of which reflect a fascinating and chequered history. Dramatic landscapes, a Mediterranean climate, the peculiar Spanish blend of warmth, pride and machismo, and the cultural and artistic resurgence in recent decades are further attractions. As a travel destination, Spain is tough to beat. If you can't manage to make a trip in person any time soon, you could do much worse than pick up a copy of this book. Alice Leccese Powers has put together a collection of pieces which capture the country's essential spirit, with charm and panache.I'll close with one of my favorite selections from the book (though Billy Collins's  Candle Hat  is a close second):Lawrence Ferlinghettifrom A FAR ROCKAWAY OF THE HEART#76In the gardens of the AlhambraI stole a small orange and ate itThe pulp dry and bitterand the juice (acrid as an arab driven from his land)made a desert out of my mouthand shriveled up my tonguein the Sultan's last revengeAnd I fell on the groundin a deep swoonDeep as the duendein a gypsy's keening....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Sep 2007,"Jul 17, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/794318.Spain_in_Mind

The hilarious brilliance of my shape-shifting namesake in Indiana (aka David Kowalski). The astonishing popularity of ""Angela's Ashes"", whose fans appear to be legion. Said fans are also extremely vocal in their defence of Frank McCourt - of all the s I've posted here, my (negative) comments about ""A's As"" have generated the strongest reaction by far - I still get roughly two messages a month that try to persuade me of the error of my ways. Their tone is generally civil - most seem to be written more in sorrow than in anger and express genuine puzzlement at my failure to appreciate what the writers perceive as true brilliance on McCourt's part. The overwhelming majority of these messages come from women. I'm ashamed to say that I haven't always managed to respond individually; nor do I have any particular desire to extend the discussion thread following my . At some point one's interest in justifying dislike of any specific book starts to run out - the same opinions tend to be recycled. But I thought it might help illuminate matters if I identified an Irish memoir that I really, really liked. All of which is just a long-winded introduction to my  of Nuala O' Faolain's ""Are You Somebody""? There are many reasons not to like O' Faolain's memoir. Structurally, it's a mess. Apparently it was concocted after the fact from a bunch of previously published newspaper columns, with an introduction tacked on, and the lack of planning shows. Though there is some effort to arrange things in chronological order, this is perfunctory at best, so that the narrative shifts back and forth along the timeline, which may exasperate some readers. Another potentially exasperating feature is that Nuala O' Faolain was someone whose life could be considered a series of poor choices, certainly where men were concerned. There is a neediness that permeates this entire story that is almost frightening in its honesty. It's rare to come across a memoirist who seems less concerned with the kind of impression she is making. Despite its numerous flaws, I found ""Are You Somebody?"" completely engaging. It's precisely O' Faolain's lack of concern for how she might be coming across that makes this memoir totally riveting. It's an unforgettable record of how it was for one particular very smart woman to grow up in a society that had not yet evolved to treat smart women as something other than second class citizens. Some of O' Faolain's choices and compromises may make the reader flinch, but her story is never less than fascinating. She writes eloquently, never veering into sentimentality - there is a toughness about O' Faolain that offsets her emotional neediness and commands the reader's respect.It's gratifying to know that ""Are You Somebody?"" exceeded all pre-publication expectations, spending several weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, achieving a level of fame for its author that had previously eluded her. Nuala O' Faolain's story of a woman's struggle for recognition in a male-dominated society obviously struck a chord with readers. She followed this memoir with a second volume, ""Almost There"", and a novel ""My Dream of You"", published in 2001, both of which were bestsellers.Nuala O' Faolain died in May, 2008, of metastatic cancer. Her story, as told in this book, is well worth your attention. ...more",Notes are private!,1,44,1,not set,Jan 2002,"Jul 15, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/240188.Are_You_Somebody_

When Ghosts of Spain was published, late in 2006, he had been living in Spain for over 10 years, first in Barcelona, then in Madrid, where he is still stationed. The tone of his book is entirely different from John Hooper’s The New Spaniards, though both are excellent in different ways and complement each other nicely. Hooper’s tone is detached throughout; though his commentary is always smart and to the point, he maintains a certain distance. It is clear that his book was written by someone who is very familiar with Spain, but who no longer lives there (this may have been less evident in the first edition, which was written after he had just completed an 8-year assignment there). The reader learns very little about Hooper, other than his obvious expertise about Spain. Tremlett, in contrast, takes a much more personal approach – repeatedly drawing on his own particular experience to illustrate a general point, grounding his analysis in the quotidian details of ordinary life. As a result, there is an immediacy to Tremlett’s writing that is missing from Hooper’s book. Some readers might find Tremlett’s willingness to place himself in the foreground a little offputting – it didn’t bother me, as I found him generally engaging, smart, with the knack of a good journalist for asking interesting questions.Hooper takes a very systematic approach to a book that is obviously intended as a comprehensive treatment, with separate, clearly delineated sections (transition to democracy, private life, the monarchy, regional autonomy, social issues, culture and the media). I doubt that Tremlett was interested in writing a comprehensive account of contemporary Spain; his book is structured more like a collection of essays on different aspects of Spanish life. Though both books appear to have come out in 2006, Tremlett’s appears far more up to date, reflecting a journalist’s focus on topics of immediate public interest. Of course, as his book’s title indicates, understanding current events often requires an examination of past history, and this is nowhere more true than in Spain, where the ghosts of the Civil War have yet to be laid to rest. The specific trigger for a reexamination of past events was the exhumation of bodies for reburial from first a handful, later scores, of mass graves dating from the Spanish Civil War. The vast majority were bodies of Republicans killed or executed by Franco’s forces; many had disappeared with little or no information about the circumstances of their death, and had been buried in unmarked, communal graves. It took almost 30 years after Franco’s death, but suddenly, in the middle of the last decade, old wounds were reopened and old hostilities resurfaced as relatives of the dead began to demand exhumation, proper burial, and some measure of accountability. The question of the graves, and coming to term with the past, received a major increase in traction when the right-wing government of Jose Maria Aznar lost to Zapatero’s socialist party in the general election of 2004 (it was still a hot topic in 2009). It provided the impetus for the opening three essays in Tremlett’s book: Secretos a Voces (Open Secrets), Looking for the Generalisimo, and Amnesty & Amnesia (The Pact of Forgetting). The number of books about the Spanish Civil War now exceeds 2000, a number that gives me a major headache. Tremlett’s material is nonetheless interesting, because he is specifically focused on how it still affects life in Spain seventy years later. 100 pages examining the legacy of civil war, in Spain or anywhere else, isn’t exactly a walk in the park, though Tremlett is clear and engaging. Fortunately, each of the remaining chapters is largely self-contained, so they can be read in any order. Later chapters are (generally) given over to more cheerful topics, specifically:•	How the Bikini Saved Spain (Benidorm and the rise of tourism)•	Anarchy, Order and a Real Pair of Balls (the importance of enchufe, corruption and scandal)•	The Mean Streets of Flamenco•	Clubs and Curas (Sex. Prostitution neither legal nor illegal. Decline of the influence of the church)•	Men and Children First (Role of the family)•	11-M: Moros y Cristianos (terrorist attacks of March 11th, 2004 and the aftermath)•	In the Shadow of the Serpent and the Axe (ETA and the Basques)•	The Madness of Verdaguer (those crazy Catalans)•	Coffins, Celts and Clothes (Galicia)•	Moderns and Ruins (the frenetic pace of change)Tremlett and Hooper are obviously covering some of the same ground. Both are worth reading. What I particularly liked about Tremlett’s book is the way all of his writing is grounded in the vivid details of everyday life. He is much better at capturing how it feels to live in Spain. The cacophony of noise in Madrid, the necessity for having and using connections (enchufe) to get anything done that pervades all aspects of Spanish life, first-hand encounters with the health and educational systems through the birth and education of his child, a visit to the municipal jail in Seville (conjugal visits), a brothel in Almeria – the mosaic of Spanish life that Tremlett constructs is detailed, colorful and vibrant. Cumulatively his delightful collection of essays do manage to capture both the charm and frustration of Spanish life. I highly recommend Ghosts of Spain. ...more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,not set,May 2007,"Jul 14, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/94797.Ghosts_of_Spain

Don't get me wrong - there's nothing I find healthier than a little myth-debunking. So I was predisposI found this book to be a great disappointment. Don't get me wrong - there's nothing I find healthier than a little myth-debunking. So I was predisposed to like this collection of 21 essays, edited by Bauer and Trudgill. Each chapter takes a particular 'language myth' and then argues against the validity of the myth, some more convincingly than others. (Having tried to learn both Russian and Spanish as foreign languages, I think it's fair to say that the statement ""Some languages are harder than others"" is not a myth). The quality of the contributions is somewhat variable, though most are quite readable. This accessibility to readers who may not necessarily have any formal exposure to linguistics is the book's main strength, in my view. The reason for my disappointment is that, for almost half the chapters, I found the stated myth to be a straw man, which made those chapters not particularly interesting to read. There were two common problems - in some cases, the wording of the myth was so non-specific as to be meaningless, another common flaw was that the myth was worded in a very extreme fashion, essentially presenting a straw man for the author to demolish. For instance, myth 1 ""The meanings of words should not be allowed to vary or change"" is couched in such absolute terms that anyone expressing even slight disagreement is automatically made to seem unreasonable. Or take the example ""bad grammar is slovenly"". The author appears to interpret ""bad"" grammar to mean anything that deviates, even slightly, from some highly codified set of rules. The acknowledgement that one can communicate clearly, without ambiguity, without sticking to the letter of the law each and every time, is hardly startling, That said, there are some deviations from the rules which are not helpful, because they induce an avoidable ambiguity. This type of bad grammar is indeed slovenly. By arguing against a strawman of questionable relevance, an opportunity is lost to explore the question in a more nuanced fashion. Other allegedly widespread myths whose prevalence I found questionable were ""Some languages are just not good enough"" (what does this even mean?), ""French is a logical language"", ""Women talk too much"" (are these people serious?), ""Some languages have no grammar"" (does anyone over the age of 10 seriously believe this for an instant?), ""You shouldn't say 'It is me'"" (why single out this particular example?), ""Everyone has an accent except me"", ""They speak really bad English down South and in New York City"", ""In the Appalachians they speak like Shakespeare"" (even if one tries to take this seriously, the inevitable question rises unbidden: ""how would anyone know?"") I might have liked the book better if it had eschewed the ""mythbusting"" device, the effect of which was to polarize arguments unnecessarily, and instead had just explored the questions raised in a less artificially polemic manner....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,not set,not set,"Jul 12, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/173095.Language_Myths

I am not a great fan of Poirot, who is nothing but a collection of idiosyncratic tics, in my opinion, and does not even approximate a flesh-and-blood person. Though, oddly, I like the David Suchet TV portrayal, but it's more for the furnishings than the characters. My lack of enthusiasm for Sherlock Holmes probably stems from the same feeling - a walking bunch of mannerisms, not really assembled into much of a human being. That doesn't prevent some of the stories involving these two gentlemen from being quite well done, if lacking in human warmth. But those I prefer don't have Poirot center stage the entire time, something which this collection obviously couldn't avoid. Hence the single star.Confession: I read all of Agatha Christie's work one summer as a teenager, and have only revisited it sporadically ever since, sometimes through the auspices of the good folks on PBS. So my doling out of stars here is highly suspect, as it is a sure bet that I am not always associating the correct story with a given title. Caveat lector, as far as my ratings of the Christie canon are concerned.But really, almost any of the Miss Marple stories is superior to almost any of the Poirot books. There, I've said it.

It was during the ""Agatha Christie summer""*, when I polished off all the full-length AC books, one per night. By the end of the summer, I was a major fan of Miss Marple, while my loathing for Poirot knew no bounds. (I have the same problem with Poirot as I do with Sherlock Holmes. They're both kind of ridiculous, being nothing more than an assortment of silly mannerisms and annoying verbal tics. Conveniently presented against a background that includes the cliched plodding policeman, the obtuse veddy British sidekick, assorted vapid members of the British leisure class, their only function is to provide sneering commentary throughout and the condescending wrap-up at the end. It's impossible to think of Poirot as a real person. Eventually, his cumulative supercilious cleverness just makes you want to punch him.)I did enjoy the Christie project - by the end of that summer, I was pretty much in awe. Though the various plots and characters blurred together (inevitable, since the number of full-length stories was somewhere around 60 or 70), there were very few duds, and Dame Agatha certainly knew how to move a story along. And Then There Were None is definitely one of her best efforts. It stands out for a few reasons. The structure is atypical - no Poirot, no Miss Marple; in fact, there's no detective at all. Its charm lies primarily in the sheer audacity of the basic premise (ten characters are assembled on an isolated island; then they are killed off, one by one**) and the skill with which it's executed. Dame Agatha pulls it off in high style and the whole thing is great fun from start to finish. I'd managed to forget plot details since 1971, so the enjoyment was preserved when I re-read it this past weekend. * IIRC, the Agatha Christie summer was in 1971; the following summer was dedicated to the multiple delightful realizations of that one story that P.G. Wodehouse kept writing again and again. I'm not 100% certain, but I'm pretty sure that when I read ""And Then There Were None"" back in the day, it was under the considerably less PC title, ""Ten Little N***ers"".** I think most people know this, so it's not a spoiler, I hope....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,"Aug 12, 2010","Jul 12, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16299.And_Then_There_Were_None

Written in 1957, at the height of the Cold War, Shute also imagines a post-apocalyptic world. Nuclear war has annihilated the countries of the northern hemisphere* and the radioactive plume is working its way slowly down south, killing everyone in its path. By the luck of geography, Melbourne will be the last major city to survive.An American submarine has made it intact to Melbourne, and is now charged with the grim business of travelling north to try to assess whether the destruction is complete. But, as the novel progresses, and the radioactive cloud moves inexorably farther south, all hope for survival vanishes. In Shute's portrayal, his doomed protagonists move towards their end with dignity, calm, and a huge helping of denial. There's nary a spot of civil unrest, from Buenos Aires to Cape Town to Sydney. It defies belief, frankly, and though his writing is moving at times, the book is far more of a snooze than I had remembered. Plenty of grace notes in a minor key and an interesting reminder of how the world must have seemed at the height of the Cold War, the book now seems little more than an interesting footnote.*: The initial aggressor was - Albania - which I suppose was a politically safe choice of bad guy back in 1957.

The Fadimans all belong to that tribe whose members cannot read without simultaneously copy-editing. When dining out, they amuse each other by pointing out typos on the menu. It might seem obnoxious, but really they just can't help it. If you're blessed with the copy-editing gene you can't just switch it off. I have the same problem. When I read, typographical and grammatical errors leap off the page, assailing my eyeballs, demanding to be noticed. A distraction that I am incapable of ignoring, they hijack my attention and diminish my respect for the author. I want my own writing to be free of such distractions; it should be forceful and persuasive. I welcome constructive advice that helps me attain that goal. My copy of ""Modern American Usage"" is grubby and well-thumbed. I think its author, Bryan A. Garner, has accomplished something quite remarkable. He has written a usage guide that gives writers clear, concrete, reasoned advice, without being overly dogmatic or erring on the side of sloppiness. I hate sloppy writing. I also hate Strunk and White. Its popularity is inexplicable to me. Here are just a few of my objections:1. Their famous motto, ""Omit needless words"", is fatuous and has absolutely no practical value. (If I knew how to do this, I'd already be some kind of great communication guru.) Repeating this essentially vapid advice in similarly empty formulations like ""Be clear"" and ""Don't explain too much"" is of no practical help to anybody, and suggests that even the authors have difficulty in deciphering their own admonitions.2. The stylistic tips that are not simply platitudinous are often just silly, hopelessly vague, or reflective of the long outdated prejudices of a couple of old white dudes. For example - Do not inject opinion.Prefer the standard to the offbeat.Do not use dialect unless your ear is good. Write with nouns and verbs.Don't construct awkward adverbs.Avoid fancy words.Use figures of speech sparingly.Do not overwrite.Having trouble figuring out whether your ear is ""good"", your adverb is ""awkward"", or your writing is ""over""? Good luck with that. S & W will be of no help whatsoever. Why not?3. The examples used to illustrate ""bad"" style in the book are generally ludicrously bad. The need for correction is so glaringly obvious that the examples have little instructive value. The authors are well able to demolish straw men, but if you want advice on a subtle point, they are unlikely to be of any practical help.4. The fetishistic obsession with avoiding the passive voice is (a) baffling (b) profoundly irritating when some freaking paperclip starts to lecture you about it (c) so obviously idiotic that the authors themselves ignore it throughout the book. Other questionable decrees include the ukase that ""none"" should always take a singular verb, the prohibition on starting a sentence with ""however"", and the pointless ""which/that"" discussion.These exemplify one of the book's biggest problems, which - to be fair - is not necessarily the authors' fault. It has achieved the status of a kind of sacred text, with all of the problems that result. People become blind to the internal inconsistencies within the text, it gets quoted with the kind of self-righteous zeal characteristic to ""true believers"" and to similar ends. Instead of stimulating thoughtful discussion, S & W is wielded as a weapon to end it. Which might not be so terrible if the advice it contains were not so vague, idiosyncratic and frequently inconsistent. Probably the most infuriating aspect of writing our book was my co-author's continual invocation of Strunk and White as the final arbiter. One can only wonder by whose authority these two gentlemen were anointed God.In a cunning marketing gimmick, the latest edition of Strunk and White has been jazzed up by including illustrations by Maira Kalman. Ms Kalman is a delightful artist, whose work elsewhere I greatly admire. But she really should have said no to this particular project. Her illustrations are occasionally pretty, sometimes baffling, but generally pointless. They add no particular insight, though some readers may find them a welcome distraction from the barked eccentricities of the book's two main authors....more",Notes are private!,1,70,1,not set,Mar 2011,"Jul 12, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/453553.The_Elements_of_Style

Instead oThis is my favorite of all the various Feynman books, because it's not cluttered up with Feynman playing the lovable, picaresque, eccentric. Instead of the slightly buffoonish public persona (or ""curious character"") he (or his publishers) seemed to feel compelled to present in his various autobiographical writings, the letters speak for themselves. And, to my mind, the picture they paint is ultimately far more flattering than that which he himself tried to present. Sure, there are lapses - he is not always charitable towards colleagues, he is sometimes impatient, and there is that characteristic unwillingness to suffer fools gladly. But the traits that shine through again and again in these letters, so much so that one has to think of them as his defining characteristics are generosity and graciousness. Over and over he takes the time to respond to strangers, who have written him out of the blue, with letters that are astonishing, both for their empathy as well as for the obvious care that he spent in writing them. He may have preferred to be considered a rebel, a free-thinker, a bit of a rogue. And he certainly relished the opportunity to twit the imagination-free defenders of the status quo. But these letters establish, beyond doubt, that at heart Feynman was a true mensch. ...more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,not set,Jan 2006,"Jul 09, 2007",,cloth,view (with text),/book/show/5550.Perfectly_Reasonable_Deviations_from_the_Beaten_Track

Nobody with a funnybone can hate David Sedaris. And neither do I. But it has to be said - that last book (""Dress your family in corduroy and denim"") was quite a disappointment. Judging by the number of people showing up for his readings here in San Francisco, and its lengthy sojourn on The New York Times bestseller list, it obviously did pretty well commercially. And, based on the enormous amount of accumulated goodwill from his earlier books, I don't begrudge DS his commercial success. Not one bit. Well, OK. Maybe just a little bit. Because, for the first time, in this collection, we see clear indications that Sedaris is bumping up against his limitations. How so? I think (and make no claim for the originality of this analysis) it's because Sedaris is at his best when he writes from the point of view of slightly marginalized outsider. In his earlier stuff, he was poor, he's gay and he managed to achieve a tone of bemusement in reporting what went on around him that was completely hilarious. In the face of increasing commercial success, the edge that was conferred by his being poor became harder to maintain. But he and his boyfriend moved to France, thereby achieving automatic outsider status, and Sedaris was able to mine this for comedy gold (his accounts of misadventures while learning French are truly funny, and credit must be given for the way in which he makes the comedy seem so effortless). But that's his previous book Me Talk Pretty One Day. Problem is, the whole 'marginalized outsider' position seems less and less plausible for an author whose books spend months on the best seller list. Similarly, after a few years in France, the forces of assimilation are bound to cut down on the number of amusing misunderstandings funny enough to be worth writing about. This leaves one other area which Sedaris has mined fruitfully in previous books - anecdotes about his family. Indeed, the majority of the stories in this latest collection are family-based anecdotes. However, the stories in this collection do not come close to matching the wit and poignancy of those in earlier books, suggesting that this vein of inspiration may be close to being tapped out. Hardly surprising - any author would lead with the funniest material; this collection has occasional flashes of wit, but never reaches the 'laugh-out-loud' quality of the earlier books. Several pieces in this collection (describing his brother's wedding, his job one summer at the State Fair) are downright pedestrian, and a couple of pieces just fall flat - ruminations about apartment-hunting while visiting the Anne Frank house, accounts of visits with two of his sisters, whose feelings about being featured as bit-players in this, or subsequent collections are decidedly mixed. It's to Sedaris's credit that he too is ambivalent on this point, but his soul-searching on the issue doesn't make for interesting reading. One of Yeats's later poems is called ""The Circus Animals' Desertion""; in it, he bemoans the fact that the themes which inspired him early in his career have lost their inspirational power. ""Dress your family in corduroy and denim"" supports the notion that David Sedaris may be experiencing similar difficulties. But don't count him out yet. His previous books estalished Sedaris as a hilarious, extremely talented writer. Anyone can have one bad book. Let's hope he will leave it at that. ...more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,not set,not set,"Jul 08, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10176.Dress_Your_Family_in_Corduroy_and_Denim

I'm hoping that it's more than the fact that she writes about the kind of people I grew up with; my background is solid upper middle class - strong emphasis on education, high parental expectations, all that good stuff, so that the academics, barristers, doctors and other professionals who populate her fiction form a milieu which is instantly recognizable to me. But it is more than that - she is a bloody good writer, creating indelible characters that stay with you in prose that is terrifically effective without ever calling attention to itself. (OK. Let me go on the record, in case you haven't figured it out by now. I am not a particular fan of fiction that's clever/flashy/gimmicky because far more often than not it signals an author who's insecure, narcissistic, or both and is usually a harbinger of major deficiencies in important aspects like characterization and plot. I could name names, but the list would go on for days..)Gardam's calm, self-assured style may have something to do with her late start as a writer - her first novel for adults was published when she was 50. When ""Old Filth"" came out, in 2004, she would have been 78. I enjoy imagining the scene when the inevitable request must have come from her publisher to come up with a more marketable title - her photos suggest a woman who doesn't suffer fools gladly. But in this case one has to think that there must have been a better title - ""Old Filth"" is a slightly offputting title which gives no indication of how terrific this book is.FILTH is an acronym for ""Failed in London, Try Hong Kong"", which describes a particular sector of the British professional and civil service classes, with the not so subtle implication that those who chose to work in former outposts of the empire may not have done so as a first choice. The book is the story of Eddie Feathers, a successful Hong Kong barrister and so-called ""Raj orphan"", born in Malaya, orphaned, and returned to England to be educated. When the story opens, Feather is already retired; Gardam flashes back and forward along the timeline throughout the novel, so skillfully that it's never annoying. Although Eddie enjoys professional success, his emotional life is far more circumscribed and Gardam sketches its limits with subtlety, warmth and humor. Even better, she continues the story in last year's ""The Man in the Wooden Hat"". While ""Old Filth"" explores the Feathers marriage (and the love triangle that prevents it from being emotionally fulfilling) from Eddie's viewpoint, the sequel presents events from the point of view of Betty, his wife. TMitWH accomplishes the amazing feat of not just matching the brilliance of OF, but improving on it. The NY Times er  times  wonders how a writer of Jane Gardam's general awesomeness can remain neglected by U.S. readers who apparently find time to read the anemic maunderings of that one-note whiner Anita Brookner. To be honest, I'm a bit puzzled myself. This is a great book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,49,1,not set,Oct 2007,"Jul 08, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/37060.Old_Filth

I'm not sorry that I took the time to read this - parts of it were terrific. But other parts - huge, seemingly interminable, turgid undisciplinedHmm. I'm not sorry that I took the time to read this - parts of it were terrific. But other parts - huge, seemingly interminable, turgid undisciplined chunks - were frankly unforgivable. It's unfortunate that DFW's brilliance obviously intimidated his editor to a degree that did neither of them any favors. There is a sort of arc that describes my reaction to the book - for about the first 150 pages or so, it was touch and go. Then things improved dramatically, and for the next 500 pages, DFW had me riveted. The writing was more focused, there was something approximating a decent story arc. Only to have things peter out again over the final 200 pages. A major part of my difficulty (see the notes I made below as I was reading it) was with the whole Quebec liberation subplot, which seemed both ludicrous and pointless. In the end, it's like the rest of DFW's work - when he's on form, there's nobody else you'd rather be reading. Sadly, the lack of discipline that mars his other work is evident here - in spades.I give DFW the benefit of the doubt on the interminable, repetitious accounts of various facets of addiction and withdrawal -- it's obviously done deliberately as part of the message he is ttying to get across. That doesn't make the relevant sections any less mind-numbingly tedious to get through, however. I do think that having the most balanced (probably the only balanced) person in the book be the ever-chipper mentally retarded cripple Mario amounts to an unforgivable cliche. Though when I look back on it, Don Gately is the only character in the entire book that is more than a caricature. I think I'd feel differently if I'd stopped at page 700, because I thought the whole central part was working terrifically. And don't get me wrong - the book is studded with these absolutely awesome setpieces which leave you slackmouthed at DFW's brilliance, passion, erudition, and way with language. So maybe that's the way to read it - as a collection of riffs, some of which are transcendent. As a novel, however, I think it's a hugely ambitious, entertaining, sporadically brilliant failure.****************************************************************************I'm going to hazard a guess that the highly variable degree of reader-friendliness over the first third of the book is completely deliberate. DFW is a writer who is almost preternaturally attuned to the (register? tone? level? murkiness? accessibility?) of his own prose and with the skills to control it. So he presumably has a purpose in mind with the placement of those sporadic chunks of amazing tedium (the fetishistic recitation of whole subsections of the pharmacopoiea, bludgeoning the reader into submission with tennis arcana, ....). I hope there is more to it than just trying to have me, the reader, undergo some kind of vicarious experience of the intrinsic tedium of rehab programs. There is, of course, the whole tension between my prior admiration and awe of DFW before starting IJ and the ability to  it in any objective fashion. But I have to say that the ""wit"" of the whole ""Year of the Depends Undergarment"" gag doesn't even sustain the first 300 pages, and may cause ocular damage from repeated eyeball-rolling before I finish this sucker. But I wouldn't be the first reader to comment on the sheer physical discomfort associated with reading IJ.There are some very funny passages so far. But the book is far more depressing than I had anticipated.Page 500 - the half-way mark!After page 200 or so, things improved considerably and reading IJ no longer feels like a chore. The writing is more focused and, as the characters become more familiar, the earlier sense that the story was sprawling beyond the author's control is dispelled. But there is a definite 'kitchen-sink' quality to the book. It's obviously not really plot-driven, though it's not turning out to be as infuriatingly plotless as the first couple of hundred pages suggest. Maybe, as DFW continues to pull the various strands together, things will make more sense. But some parts just seem indulgent - not that they aren't intermittently funny and smart - but DFW's riff on the rise and fall of videophones, the whole 'crooning president'/sponsored calendar year stuff, the Eschaton episode (I suppose it's no worse than Quidditch, though I've always thought Quidditch was the most dispensable aspect of the HP series) - these do little to advance the story, which kind of lurches from one set piece to the next. Wallace already assumes much forbearance on the reader's part by inclusion of the endlessly repetitive descriptions of the assorted facets of addiction and competition, but that at least has an obvious point to it. Though it is starting to feel a little preachy, if not actually condescending.So far, the plot strand that makes least sense, and is most poorly executed is the ongoing encounter between Marathe and Steeply, which is just eye-rollingly irritating.With only 100 pages to go, I have to say that the entire Quebec liberation subplot seems like nothing more than an unmitigated waste of space, and a major irritant to (this) reader - a bizarre collection of weirdness and unfunny gags that interfere with the remainder of the text, which is tautly written and much of which manages to be surprisingly moving. But the whole AFR/FLQ plot strand is DFW at his worst - prolix, way too clever for his own good, and severely in need of major editorial discipline. Maybe the final 100 pages will convince me that this part of the book is more than superfluous verbiage, but I doubt it....more",Notes are private!,0,55,1,"Feb 08, 2010","Feb 15, 2010","Jul 05, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/75786.Infinite_Jest

Except for the disturbing ""Conversations with Hideous Men"" I have found his previous material to be so hilariously, intelligently, on-target that I was willing to overlook a multitude of stylistic transgressions (chiefly, the overly cutesy tone, gratuitous flaunting of the author's erudition, the footnote fetish). So I was reasonably disposed to like this book and was looking forward to reading it. Sadly, it turns out that this was a case where DFW's various idiosyncrasies combine to produce a book which is fundamentally unreadable. Normally, once I start a book, I feel enormous guilt if I don't finish. No guilt here - just exasperation. One can reasonably argue that DFW's enormous talent might justify certain peculiarities of style, but every author needs the discipline of a good editor. W.W. Norton seems to have dispensed with editors altogether, certainly with the sentient kind. A pity, because somebody should have explained to DFW that prefacing any section of text with the title ""Soft-news interpolation, placed here ante rem because this is the last place to do it without disrupting the juggernaut-like momentum of the pre-Cantor mathematical context"" is not just completely unhelpful. It is an irritating distraction, the sorry result of the inability of this talented writer to vanquish the demons which continue to plague his undisciplined style. Unfortunately, this kind of self-indulgent stylistic mannerism recurs with infuriating frequncy.

This is both his greatest strength and his potential Achilles heel as a writer. Personally, I will read anything this man writes, because I think he is a true genius with a rare sense of compassion, and a hilarious sense of humor. Even when his writing falls victim to its own cleverness, I still find it worthwhile - perhaps because one senses that the writer is a true mensch (not something I feel when being dazzled by the cleverness of a Dave Eggers, for instance).Oh hell, I want to be seated next to DFW on a long transpacific flight subject to major delays, OK? I have an enormous intellectual crush on this man. And when I cavil, it is done out of love, pure and simple.But when discussing this book of his, caviling would simply be out of place. It contains two of the funniest essays I have ever read in my life (the descriptions of his experiences on a cruise liner and at the state fair, respectively). I think you should buy your own copy, because I certainly am not going to loan you mine.Added on edit: so, I've noticed that goodreads seems to order books listed by  according to the wordcount of the s in question, from longest to shortest. A result of this has been that my negative  of DFW's ill-starred ""Everything and More"" shows up ahead of my 5-star  of this collection. This pains me enormously, as I really admire this writer's prodigious talent immensely - even his occasional misfires beat the pants off many a less talented author's best efforts. So I am shamelessly adding this paragraph in a transparent effort to game the system - the desired result being that my positive  of this quirky, talented author show up before the negative .

Predictably enough, the chapters that interested me most were those pertaining to books I had read, particularly those concerning books which had also spoken to me, upon first reading.My favorite chapter - the one about Salinger's ""Franny and Zooey"", an alltime favorite from my college years.

It probably deserves more than 3 stars, but its overall spottiness prevents me from giving it 4.

I think these four books are a real tour de force - he writes in several different voices throughout, but remains - I think - completely sensitive to the political and social complexities and subtleties of the situation in India towards the end of the British occupation. Very nuanced, extraordinarily sensitive writing.Only space on the shelf considerations prevents me from including all four of the quartet on my top 20 shelf (which is now full, and may eventually need to be expanded to 25). Though I do think, if I had to make a judgement that books 1 and 3 in the quartet slightly outrank the other two. But, overall, if you find yourself with time on your hands (even if you don't), the ""Raj Quartet"" is a wonderful world in which to lose yourself for a couple of weeks.Then check out the BBC series on DVD and marvel at just how perfect the adaptation is.

If Have you ever stood in front of a door, or a microwave, absolutely flummoxed, because the damned thing gave you no clue whatsoever how to open it. If so (even, I venture to think, if not), you will enjoy this book. In clear, coruscating prose he exposes the miserable flaws in the design of everyday objects which conspire to make our lives less convenient, more miserable, and sometimes more dangerous.The book is not just an exposé of the appalling laziness and hostility to consumers that is commonplace among designers(not just in the software industry, which is a story unto itself - see ""The Lunatics are Running the Asylum"") - it is also a clarion call to action. We need not live in a world where it appears that appliances conspire to make us feel like idiots. And when they do - when you can't figure out which button to push, or whether a door opens inward or outward - remember that you are not the one at fault. It is the lazy incompetent designer of the thing which is making you miserable who is deserving of scorn and ridicule. Far too often, in a design world which favors form over function and usability, crimes against the user get rewarded with prizes and the acclaim of the design cognoscenti. People who presumably never have to struggle with the consequences of their own reckless disregard for the usability of the objects they design.

Last year I read over a hundred books, yet I still feel I barely scratched the surface. There’s always the sense ofSo many books .... so little time. Last year I read over a hundred books, yet I still feel I barely scratched the surface. There’s always the sense of falling further behind. One can certainly understand the appeal of Pierre Bayard’s “How to Talk About Books You Haven’t Read”, if only as an aid to help keep your head above water, to help navigate the tsunami of new material which bombards us monthly.But that’s not what this  is about. Jane Smiley’s “Thirteen ways of Looking at the Novel” won’t help you to deal with the problem of sheer volume of new books that are published nowadays. In fact, weighing in at close to 600 pages, it may actually slow progress towards whatever numerical goal you may have set for 2008. Nonetheless, I urge you, I implore you, to get this book and to take the time to read it. Why? Because if you do, you will never read a novel the same way again. I have read no other book that comes close to this one in terms of enriching my overall reading experience.The structure of the book is straightforward. The first twelve chapters, spanning 270 pages, or just under half the book, have titles like  The Origins of the Novel, The Psychology of the Novel, Morality and the Novel, The Art of the Novel, The Novel and History. Each reads like a terrific tutorial by the professor of literature you wish you had had in college. Though these chapters are never less than fascinating, for my money it’s the next four chapters which make this book so brilliant. They are titled  The Circle of the Novel, A Novel of Your Own (I), A Novel of Your Own (II), ‘Good Faith: A Case History . Basically, Smiley uses the 100 pages or so spanned by these chapters to given an inspired tutorial, of unsurpassed brilliance, on how to write a novel. If I had my way, it would be required reading for all of the Rick Moodys, the Heidi Julavits, the Dave Eggers, the Deborah Eisenbergs, any of those too-smart-for-their-own good writers at work today who continue to foist off their whip-smart, empty-hearted, look-at-me-how-smart-am-I, metafictional experiments on the unsuspecting reader, passing it off as ‘literary fiction’.In the last half of the book, Smiley analyzes 101 of her favorite novels, ranging from ‘The Tale of Genji’ and ‘The Decameron’ to ‘White Teeth’ and ‘Atonement’, bringing to bear the ideas laid out in the first half of the book. This is done with such wit, intelligence, and sympathy that the effect is to make you want to re-read those books you were already familiar with, and to rush out and get the books she discusses that you haven’t already read. In short, this is one of those rare books that is genuinely uplifting, and will rekindle your enthusiasm for reading. I can give it no higher recommendation....more",Notes are private!,0,89,1,not set,not set,"Jul 05, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/32098.Thirteen_Ways_of_Looking_at_the_Novel

I was happy to be rid of it at the time - my brain did fine with analytical stuff like science and languages, but history was just too unruly to get a handle on and it always brought down my grade average. And, of course, at age 14 it was completely impossible to think of it as anything but useless.Naturally, I've ended up regretting that particular gap in my education ever since. The Great Cat Massacre was one of the books that helped me overcome my aversion to reading about history ( I Claudius  was another). It showed that history books didn't have to be dull and it re-awakened a curiosity I thought had been stifled. It also planted a strong suspicion that my previous difficulties with the subject were most likely due to the abysmal way in which it was taught. It seems silly now, but when I first read it (in 1985?) a ""history"" book that wasn't just a compilation of names, dates, battles and rebellions was (for me) an entirely novel concept. So I had fond memories of the book when I undertook a re-reading this past weekend. After 25 years, would it be as good as I remembered, or would it crumble to little more than that inspired title (which is pure genius, by any standards)?A brief overview of the book's structure and content. It comprises six essays, each of which considers a very specific aspect of life in France during the first half of the 18th century, using a particular incident or set of documents as a point of departure. The cat massacre in the book's title stimulates an examination of the precarious state of labor relations in the printing industry in the 1730s. An extensive description of the town of Montpellier in 1768 by an anonymous (but solidly bourgeois) citizens provides a remarkable glimpse of the power structure, relationships between the different classes and prevailing attitudes. Part of the responsibility of Joseph d'Hemery, a Parisian police officer, was the tracking of potentially seditious documents and their authors - as a result he amassed an archive containing dossiers on 500 writers and intellectuals. Ten years of book orders from one resident of La Rochelle in the 1770s give some idea of reading habits at the time (Rousseau was the decade's Stephenie Meyer). In the remaining two chapters Darnton considers the particularly gruesome nature of French folk tales and the organization of Diderot's Encyclopedia respectively. I suppose it was no great surprise to find that, although the book wasn't quite as brilliant or as fascinating as I remembered, it still held up pretty well. Darnton is very readable, though I found some of his inferences less persuasive on this second reading. The best essays are the title piece and the analysis of folktales; the glimpse into 18th century reading habits is also pretty irresistible. The other three essays were (for me) more problematic - there's an awful lot of listing going on, with Darnton's commentary being either perfunctory or unpersuasive, or both. Overall, the flaws are still pretty minor. Darnton is an intelligent and engaging writer, and the three standout essays in the collection are more than worth the price of admission. Though I'm mentally giving it 3.5 stars this time around, I'm more than happy to round it back to the original 4 stars.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,19,2,not setnot set,"Dec 03, 2010not set","Jul 05, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1085381.The_Great_Cat_Massacre

Written as a series of letters; as the correspondence mounts, the overall message becomes Quite simply the funniest book I have ever read in my life. Written as a series of letters; as the correspondence mounts, the overall message becomes hilariously clear. Never get between a man and his trees.Starring Humphrey Mackevoy, a man who loves trees, maybe a little too much. The sudden epidemic of holes bored into local trees, all 33 inches from the ground at an angle of 15 degrees to the horizontal, has everyone in town buzzing. The authorities are outraged at such wanton vandalism, the police are on high alert, the ornithological society is ecstatic, believing that the fabulously rare crested woodpecker has returned to the British Isles. Humphrey is more concerned with occupational hazards like splinter wounds and the toxic effects of the new pesticide being sprayed on the trees. What with the prison chaplain dedicated to making the Gospel more relevant by rewriting it as a Western (Posse from Galilee), assorted power-crazed local councillors, a sex-crazed sixteen-year-old girl desperate to get laid, and the ever-present Humphrey's Mummy, there is never a dull moment.Given the spicy gumbo that the authors have concocted, rich with every hilarious village archetype you've ever come across, the tree-porn sections are lagniappe. A certain bewitching laburnum stirs Humphrey to flights of soft-porn eloquence: ""Lasciviously I turned my face, brushing the cold bark with my lips, and began to explore its texture with my tongue. And you couldn't stop me, my laburnum, you with your branches pinioned in the air, leaving your trunk so bare, so bare, so unprotected, so vulnerable..."" I would be happy to loan you my copy, if I hadn't sent it to a certain goodreads member MANY MONTHS AGO (she knows who she is).Possibly the finest epistolary novel ever written. ...more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,Jan 1975,"Jul 05, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1444633.Melon_for_Ecstasy

In all of his stuff that I've read, the only obvious misstep was ""The Road to Wellville"", whose subject matter didn't hold up to a full-length novel.

Give me any of his awesome short story collections, point me to the nearest armchair, and I'm a happy camper for the rest of the afternoon. I mean, the guy is hilarious, he can spin a mean yarn, and his writing chops are impressive. Oddly enough though, his track record for longer fiction is distinctly spotty. Some of his novels are well worth checking out (""The Tortilla Curtain"", ""East is East"", ""Talk Talk"", ""Drop City""). But every so often T.C. gets the urge to pen an enormous tome about some historical American figure that catches his fancy. More recently there was one about Frank Lloyd Wright and his women, before that it was Alfred Kinsey, and ""The Road to Wellville"" is all about John Harvey Kellogg (the corn flakes guy). Because he's T.C. Boyle, and he has this phenomenal curiosity and apparently boundless energy and a kind of a geekish need to tell his readers all the neat stuff he learned while researching the project, you want him to succeed, you really try to like these efforts of his. But you pretty much know, about 50 pages in that it's just going to be a disorganized mess. You kind of wish someone could dissuade him. But, of course, he's T.C. Boyle - and presumably gets to do whatever he likes. And, god knows I don't begrudge him the occasional sprawling failure - it's a small price to pay for the brilliance of his stories. But let's be clear - ""The Road to Wellville"" is just that - a huge, sprawling mess. There's no reason to read it. There was no reason to make it into a bad movie with Matthew Broderick either, but these things have a way of happening. Avoid the movie, and avoid this book. Instead, find any of T.C. Boyle's short story collections and read it. They're all terrific. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Jul 05, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/24738.The_Road_to_Wellville

He brings us right to the edge of the abyss, then kicks us over that edge. King Lear is the most devasThis is where Shakespeare takes off the gloves. He brings us right to the edge of the abyss, then kicks us over that edge. King Lear is the most devastating by far of the Shakespeare tragedies -- this is a play which leaves the reader shattered as the curtain falls. The play has a kind of primal power, which I find hard to explain. The plot is fairly typically Shakespeare, perhaps a little more complicated than usual, mixing elements taken from legend and from the historical record. At the outset, Lear is a narcissistic, bullying despot. His two older daughters, Regan and Goneril, are a couple of bad seed cougars, both of whom lust after Edmund, an equally amoral hyena. Their goody-two-shoes sister Cordelia behaves with such one-note pointless stubbornness, it almost seems like she's not playing with a full deck. Over in the Gloucester household, Edmund (the bastard hyena) is plotting against both his brother Edgar and his father. Lear’s court is filled with lickspittle sycophants. Only two people have the guts to speak truth to power, and one of them wears the costume of a Fool. There's a nasty storm brewing on the heath. Fasten your seatbelts - it's going to be a bumpy ride.Characters in “King Lear” pay dearly for their weaknesses. Gloucester is blinded in order that he might see, but is denied any lasting happiness; after reconciling with Edgar, he dies. Lear will be driven insane before he finally learns to empathize with the poor and the meek. We watch him return from the brink of madness only to discover that’s not enough. Before the curtain falls, Shakespeare gives us what is arguably the most brutal scene in his entire work.Enter Lear with Cordelia (dead) in his arms –  Howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stone!Had I your tongues and eyes, I’d use them soThat heavens vault should crack. She’s gone forever. Even if, like me, you find Cordelia a saccharine, two-dimensional character*, this scene is shattering. Two pages later, after learning that his fool has hanged himself, Lear dies, broken-hearted. Edgar, Kent and Albany – literally the only characters still standing – are left to bury the dead and move on, as best they can.Why do I find this the most affecting of Shakespeare’s plays? (I’ve seen seven different stage productions**, and two on TV, and it only gets more powerful upon repeated exposure.) I can’t really pin it down – it’s a combination of various elements. The characters are idiosyncratic, fully realised, and their behavior is highly relatable, so the play is convincing at the level of the individual protagonists. But the fable-like nature of the opening scene also confers a kind of universal quality to its message, and the themes explored within the play – abuse of power, relationships within families, responsibilities of parents and children, the breakdown of the natural order and its consequences, the human capacity for enormous cruelty – are no less relevant today than in Shakespeare’s time. The skillfully constructed parallel plotting of the Lear and Gloucester arcs adds to the power of the story, the breakdown in natural human behavior is further accentuated by the raw fury of the elements during the storm scenes, where Nature echoes Lear’s fury. Ultimately, there’s no getting away from the uncompromising bleakness of the play’s message. In Gloucester’s words – “as flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods; they kill us for their sport”. The nihilism of “King Lear” has always disturbed audiences, and it was common during the 18th and 19th centuries to stage an altered version, in which Cordelia was allowed to live, implying a more upbeat view of human nature. But, given what the events of the last century demonstrate about mankind’s vicious capacity for self-destruction, one has to think that Shakespeare got it right first time. As usual.*: the character that Cordelia most reminds me of is the slave-girl, Liu, in Puccini’s “Turandot”. Neither is realised in any great depth, but each serves an important function in the way that their death effects a crucial change in one of the other protagonists.**: including one particularly memorable performance in Mönchen-Gladbach, Germany, where Regan and Goneril were decked out like biker chicks and roared on stage riding what appeared to be Harleys. ...more",Notes are private!,0,50,1,not set,Sep 1972,"Jul 05, 2007",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1401380.King_Lear

Though his talent was on a par with the genius of his contemporaries, Joyce and Beckett, he hFlann O'Brien is surely Ireland's most neglected writer. Though his talent was on a par with the genius of his contemporaries, Joyce and Beckett, he has never come close to achieving the same degree of recognition. There are several possible explanations for this. The simplest is that Joyce and Beckett managed to cut the umbilical cord - though Mother Ireland featured large in their writing, they both managed to make an escape, living the latter part of their lives in exile. This might not seem like a big thing, but the conservatism, stasis and repression that characterized Irish 'cultural life"" in the first decades of the new Republic were truly horrendous. Dominance of the Catholic hierarchy was absolute, writers were subject to heavy censorship at the hands of both Church and State, the appetite for novelty was non-existent. This was the Ireland of ""Angela's Ashes"".While Joyce and Beckett made their escape (hell, even the McCourts made their escape), Flann O'Brien stayed, working for most of his life in the Irish civil service. At Swim-Two-Birds, his first novel, was published in 1939. Although it was well-received (championed by Graham Greene, publicly acclaimed by both Joyce and Beckett), the timing was perhaps not the best. Europe, it is fair to say, had other things on its collective mind. Some first novelists are tentative, growing into their craft over time. Even those who subsequently mess with the rules often start out on a conventional note (Joyce had to work up to the horror that is Finnegans Wake). But occasionally there surfaces a talent so brilliant that the rules go out the window. Bulgarov's ""The Master and Margarita"" is an obvious example - a masterpiece not only because of the author's genius, but because he also had the confidence to give free rein to his genius, parting company with more or less everything you might expect from a novel. ""At Swim-Two-Birds"" shows the same kind of dementedly funny, astonishingly brilliant, throw-caution-to-the-winds talent. It is sui generis, absolutely hilarious, and breathtakingly accomplished. It's hard to describe adequately, but I'll give it a shot.From the very first paragraph, we are on notice that the book doesn't play by the conventional rules. The narrator, a literature student at University College Dublin, tells us that he disagrees with the notion that a book should have 'one beginning and one ending' and immediately proves it by providing three completely different openings. The first introduces the ""Pooka MacPhellimey, a member of the devil class"", another involves ""Mr John Furriskey, who had the distinction of being born at the age of twenty-five, entering the world with a memory but without a personal experience to account for it"", while the final opening features Ireland's legendary hero Finn MacCool, a man not only skilled in declaiming vast tracts of Irish epic verse, but absolutely hellbent on doing so. Within a few pages, characters from the three initially distinct stories are wandering in and out of each other's tales, with the situation being further complicated by the realization that John Furriskey is actually a character in a potboiler being dreamed up by yet another writer, Dermot Trellis, a scribbler so inferior that his characters ultimately rise up against him, refusing to act out the plot that Trellis has concocted for them. Add to the story the character of mad Sweeney, accursed bird-king of the Dal Riada, with a penchant for spouting serial mock heroic stanzas bewailing his fate. Mix in a ""fast-drinking cast of students, fairies, cowpunchers and clerics"", and there's never a dull moment. In the hands of a lesser author things could spiral disastrously out of control. O'Brien not only pulls it off, he is hilariously funny, with a command of the language that is unmatched by any other author that I know. There are paragraphs like this:I like gull-cries and the twittering together of fine cranes. I like the surf-roar at Tralee, the songs of the three sons of Meadhra and the whistle of Mac Lughaidh. These also please me, man-shouts at a parting, cuckoo-call in May. I incline to like pig-grunting in Magh Eithne, the bellowing of the stag of Ceara, the whinging of fauns in Derrynish. The low warble of water-owls in Loch Barra also, sweeter than life that. I am fond of wing-beating in dark belfries, cow-cries in pregnancy, trout-spurt in a lake-top. Also the whining of small otters in nettle-beds at evening, the croaking of small-jays behind a wall, these are heart-pleasing. I am friend to the pilibeen, the red-necked chough, the parsnip land-rail, the pilibeen mona, the bottle-tailed tit, the common marsh-coot, the speckle-toed guillemot, the pilibeen sleibhe, the Mohar gannet, the peregrine plough-gull, the long-eared bush-owl, the Wicklow small-fowl, the bevil-beaked chough, the hooded tit, the pilibeen uisce, the common corby, the fish-tailed mud-piper, the cruiskeen lawn, the carrion sea-cock, the green-lidded parakeet, the brown bog-martin, the maritime wren, the dove-tailed wheatcrake, the beaded daw, the Galway hill-bantam and the pilibeen cathrach. A satisfying ululation is the contending of a river with the sea. Good to hear is the chirping of little red-breasted men in bare winter and distant hounds giving tongue in the secrecy of god. The lamenting of a wounded otter in a black hole, sweeter than harpstrings that.O'Brien unleashed the book in 1939, hardly the time for ""exuberant literary experiments"". Sadly, when he submitted his equally subversive (and equally brilliant, IMO) second novel ""The Third Policeman"" to his publishers the following year, they rejected it. (Shades of Bulgarov, it was published posthumously in 1967)In 1940, under the pseudonym Myles na Gopaleen (Miles of the little horses), O'Brien began to write a regular satirical column in The Irish Times. It was, depending on one's place in the power structure, loved, celebrated, admired, respected and feared. Several collections of the pieces have been published - if you want to see pure comic and satirical genius in action on a daily basis, they are indispensable. Definitely a fundamental part of Ireland's literary history and some of the funniest, smartest stuff to be found anywhere.What I am strongly suggesting, folks, is that you take the trouble to seek out either of the two novels ""At Swim-Two-Birds or The Third Policeman and devote an afternoon or an evening to sampling one of Ireland's forgotten geniuses....more",Notes are private!,-3,35,1,not set,"Mar 19, 2010","Jul 05, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/97333.At_Swim_Two_Birds

At the novel's opening, the generals are still in power, and Garay is closeted and emotionally stunted. Toibin, who covered the trial of General Gualtieri as a reporter, is extraordinarily effective in conveying the sense of menace that prevails, and the way people are forced to hold their emotions in check in order to survive. The Falklands are lost, the generals lose their hold on power, and the story traces Richard’s gradual emotional development in parallel with the opening of Argentine society. The aspect of Toibin’s writing that I like best is his extraordinary emotional intelligence, which he deploys here to full effect, in a sensitive and moving account of Richard’s story. Richard is a complex, and not entirely sympathetic, character, but Toibin draws us in to his story, and makes us care deeply about his fate.An evocative and moving story, which I highly recommend....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,not set,"Jul 03, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/193897.The_Story_of_the_Night

In this novel, he explores the life and work of Henry James, spanning the period from 1895 to 1900.

It is the following belief, instilled primarily by my mother, an exceptionally smart woman who never suffered fools gladly, but had the mitigating grace to be one of the warmest, most generous women you could ever hope to meet, as well as having one of the greatest voices you can imagine  (Buttercup)  Here's the main thing she taught me: each of us has an inescapable responsibility to take whatever talent we have been given on this earth, and to develop it as far and as well as life allows.This is so deeply ingrained in my beliefs that I can pretty much trace every major decision I've made in my life back to it.What does this have to do with the price of eggs? Well, it's the reason Jerome David Salinger makes me as mad as all get out. Because I can certainly understand why, given the perfection of the stories in this collection, any writer might not want to risk spoiling his reputation by following up with work that might not reach the same level. Hell, nothing could possibly reach the perfection of the stories, ""For Esme - with Love and Squalor"", ""The Laughing Man"", ""Down by the Dinghy"", or ""Just Before the War with the Eskimos"". And while I'm not really a great fan of Seymour Glass, ""A Perfect Day for Bananafish"" is pretty damned awesome as well.So, yeah, J.D. - after those stories, it's hard to imagine anything better. Even anything comparable.But that's still no excuse for not trying, you arrogant egotistical bastard. You were dealt a monumental, unimaginable, talent. And for you to squat there in-fucking-communicado in your bloody bunker in New England, resting on your admittedly golden freaking laurels, is an act of unconscionable, unpardonable, selfishness. I could almost convince myself that your genius crossing over into madness was the explanation for your lack of output, but you seem craftily able to sic your lawyers on anyone perceived to encroach on your goddamned ""privacy"".So, while I can understand the impulse of not wanting to risk your reputation, I sure as hell can't forgive it. You were granted an incredible gift. You should be using it.And, sorry folks, it's far beyond me to locate exactly where the genius lies in the particular stories mentioned.

This may be just a residual consequence of having ""met"" her while I was in college. She had been invited to lecture by someone in the English department, and at the time I used to hang out with some of the women in English lit, so we ended up after the lecture having tea and biscuits in Josephine's flat with the eminent speaker, who was totally charming.I think the reason I enjoy her fiction is that she so often writes about the lives of strong, intelligent women. Her protagonists are interesting people, whose problems and issues I tend to understand and identify with. Sometimes they are academics, but she manages to avoid the parochialism that mars much writing about academia, and because of that her work has a broader appeal, IMO.Not sure why, but I like her middle novels the best - her recent novels have not engaged me that much, though she does write well, and interestingly, on relations between people of my generation and our parents. But even those of her novels that I've not enjoyed quite as much have stimulated me to think, and they are always well-written. She remains an author whose new work I am always likely to try. ...more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,not set,"Jul 03, 2007",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/105068.The_Realms_of_Gold

Van der Post explores the conflict between African and European cultures with sensitivity. I am normally impervious to nature writing, but van der Post's evocation of the Kalahari is impressive.

Impossible to categorize accurately, it's a kind of extended riff on the difficulties and challenges of translation, carried out with a kind of beguiling enthusiasm. It shares the playfulness that characterized ""Godel, Escher, Bach"" but I found it more accessible and more interesting.Starting with a single unifying thread that winds through the entire book (various* translations of a single 28-line poem by the French author Clement Marot, Hofstadter weaves a fascinating tapestry about the challenges facing a translator. There is a whole chapter dedicated to translations of Eugene Onegin; another discusses various efforts at translating Dante. Along the way there are fun digressions about such challenges as translating lipograms (text written with the constraint that one or more letters of the alphabet are never used), the paradoxical usefulness of writing under constraints of various kinds, be they artificial as in lipogrammatic writing, or metrical constraints, as in Pushkin, Dante, or the sonnets of Shakespeare, difficulties in writing translation software, linguistic issues such as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis**, how one would translate a 'dirty' joke to a clean version, while preserving the humor.*: I haven't counted, but there must be at least 50 different translations. Oddly enough, the accumulation of so many is not boring, but fascinating - Hofstadter's boyish enthusiasm helps to charm.**: (very) roughly, the linguistic notion that how we think is constrained by language.

Similarly, there is no shortage of books in which people in their twenties pass their time in self-absorbed navelgazing and low-level whining. Is this ground sufficiently fertile to warrant another visit? On the basis of this over-hyped mess of a book, I'd have to think not. The most annoying aspect of this book is the lazy way in which Messaud invokes the September 11th attacks as the ultimate deus ex machina to resolve the meandering, not particularly interesting, plot. It's as if tragedy trumps everything, including the author's responsibility to write a story that's credible. Messaud's writing style is fluid and the book is very readable, but given the shallowness of the characters and the author's laziness about the plot, the return on investment of time is low. ...more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,not set,Jan 2007,"Jul 03, 2007",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/918282.The_Emperor_s_Children

But self-indulgent enough, and trusting enough, to risk here on goodreads.I think the main reason I love this book so much is that, no matter how many times I read it, every time I do it feels as if Salinger is speaking directly to me. When I first came across it (from reading ""Catcher in the Rye"", of course) it felt as if I had been stumbling through this enormous library all my life when suddenly I came across this secret text that had been written just for me, and only for me. Now, I'm not an idiot, so of course one part of me knows that this isn't so - there are no ""magic texts"", nobody is out there writing just for me. But though, on the surface I am this consummate rationalist (I have a Ph.D. in mathematical statistics, for Chrissakes), thank God I am at some level smart enough to appreciate the magic in finding a text that seems to speak to me so forcefully.""I'm not an idiot"". No. In fact I'm super-smart (not arrogance, just a statement of fact). And often, before reading this book, this felt like more of a curse than a blessing. But it was Salinger's story of the hyper-smart Glass children that first offered me a viable way to come to terms with my own gifts. At one level, there's the advice that her siblings attempt to pass on to Franny, who has reached a kind of spiritual crisis triggered by a realisation of her own giftedness. There's the love, concern and humanity with which they try to help her through that crisis, to help her to make the realisation that her talent doesn't have to be something that separates her from the great majority of people. That there is a sacred responsibility to develop and follow one's talents. And any hint of elitism, or intellectual snobbery, or some of the other charges that are sometimes thrown against Salinger are rendered so obviously meaningless and beyond the point in the last few pages of this extraordinary love story:Zooey: ""I was furious. The studio audience were all morons, the announcer was a moron, the sponsors were morons, and I just damned well wasn't going to shine my shoes for them, I told Seymour. I said they couldn't see them anyway where we sat. He said to shine them anyway. He said to shine them for the Fat Lady. I didn't know what the hell he was talking about, but he had a very Seymour look on his face, and so I did it. He never did tell me who the Fat Lady was, but I shined my shoes for the Fat Lady every time I ever went on the air again ...""Franny was standing. ""He told me too"", she said into the phone. ""He told me to be funny for the Fat Lady, once""Zooey: ""I don't care where an actor acts. ... But I'll tell you a terrible secret... There isn't anyone out there who isn't Seymour's Fat Lady. ..... There isn't anyone anywhere that isn't Seymour's Fat Lady. ... I can't talk any more, buddy.""And I can't write any more right now....more",Notes are private!,0,54,10,not setnot setnot setnot setnot setnot setnot setnot setnot setnot set,Jan 1975not setnot setnot setnot setnot setnot setnot setnot setnot set,"Jul 02, 2007",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5113.Franny_and_Zooey
