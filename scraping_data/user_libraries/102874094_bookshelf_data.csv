Dr. Vogel, from the outside, appears the consummate professional who wants nothing but to help those poor ""morons"" and ""idiots"" (actual medical terms from the day) who were troubled enough to be entrusted into her care. Troubled meaning they were convicted of adultery, had a child out of wedlock, were thought promiscuous, or their husbands/families simply thought having them put away was the best option for everyone. These places were real even if the story is fictional. [It should be mentioned that these women were held, regardless of age or infraction, alleged or otherwise, until they were finished with menopause. The idea was that menstruating women were not mentally stable to begin with and it apparently took nothing to push them over the edge and into a place that required permanent institutionalization.]When Mary realizes one of the feebleminded women incarcerated was a brilliant girl whom she had known since childhood, she feels compelled to help her escape. There are numerous twists and turns with a zinger at the end I didn't see coming.Ann Leary does a fabulous job writing a compelling story set a hundred years ago keeping the tone of the day without losing the reader. But more than that, Leary brings to light how far women's history has come while showing us how tenuous it still is today. THIS IS A MUST READ, if for nothing else to get your ire up so you don't forget where women came from and how it would look if we backslide any more than we already have. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Apr 05, 2024","Apr 11, 2024","Apr 11, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/59366094-the-foundling

Beach Trip not only hit that mark, but it is written from multiple perspectives (each character) and from a present timeframe, when the group is mid-40s as well as back when they were in college and had just met. Beach Trip follows Mel, Sarah, Lola, and Annie, four unlikely friends brought together as college roommates, through the next few decades of their lives. Each of the women has their own secrets kept and needing to confess. The women meet for a long-time coming reunion on a secluded island where Lola has a house, a yacht, and what seems to be all the things a person could ever want. Mel, snarky as ever, has written ten mediocre novels by now, but couldn’t keep a relationship if she were paid. Sarah has family troubles that she has hidden from her friends, and Annie has a secret kept since college. During this week of over-indulgence, confessions come, fences are mended, and hearts are broken. Beach Trip takes a sudden, unexpected turn at the very end (which I sort of saw coming, but not in the way it played out), and leaves the reader with a lot to think about. But don’t worry, it has a HEA. This book was published in the early 2000s and when I researched other books by this author, I was saddened to learn she passed away of a terminal illness in 2013. Her family, however, has completed her other unpublished manuscripts. Bravo!If you like a solid, clean, yet complicated friendship novel, this one is lengthy, but worth the time it takes.

The two friends live on the same piece of property owned by Amir's father, ""Baba,"" in Kabul Afghanistan. It's the 1970's and Hassan's father, Ali, works as a houseman for Baba.As Amir and Hassan grow, Amir fights for attention from Baba who showers both boys with attention. Born of Amir's jealousy, hidden resentment, and cowardness to stand up for what's right spring and threaten to take over Amir. And when egregious atrocities are inflicted on Hassan by fellow Pushtuns while outside their property, Amir hides, turning a blind eye, rather than taking action. This cowardly behavior will haunt and define Amir for the rest of his life. When the Russians invade Afghanistan and the Taliban takes over, changing the landscape of the country forever, Amir and Baba flee to America leaving everything and everyone else behind. Decades later, a call comes from Pakistan, urgently calling Amir home, to rectify his wrongs, and make amends. In this powerful story of fiction (except for the truth of the author fleeing with his Baba from Kabul to the U.S.), Khaled Hosseini brings to light the damage of entitlement and horrors of segregation and discrimination in a way that makes the reader have a much better understanding of how the Afghanistan we know today came to be. The Kite Runner is filled with beautiful descriptions of a land long ago peaceful that is now demonized (and rightly so by all accounts), and how stealing, as told by Baba, is the worst of all sins: ""When you kill a man, you steal a life. You steal his wife's right to a husband and rob his children of a father. When you tell a lie, you steal someone's right to the truth. When you cheat, you steal the right to fairness.""My two cents on the banning of this book (for sexually explicit content, language, and age appropriateness - marketed for not under 18 and has been apparently read by and/or required of high schoolers) is SO worth the read. The sexually explicit content is more implied than overt and pivotal to the story to show the low depths man will go to dominate and humiliate. Language - meh, unfounded. Age appropriateness should be read by people mature enough to handle the truth about war.

I learned so much about code breaking, the former Prince Phillip of Greece (who then married Queen Elizabeth), and bits about the War years that I would reread the book to ensure I didn't miss something (and I'm not a re-reader). Add in the fact that The Rose Code is superbly researched, narrowly walks the fictional line, and is written by the incomparable, Kate Quinn - it is worth a once or twice read.

For parents of children who are not addicts, you will never know the grief, pain, loss, desperation, angst, guilt, anger, betrayal, and unimaginable fear we with addict children go through. I envy you. Beautiful Boy is a raw story of love and misery that one man goes through with his addict son. Sheff’s authentic introspection says it all: “I became addicted to my child’s addiction.” We parents of addicts become preoccupied, at the expense of other responsibilities, marriage, other children, work, friends, church. We justify. We beg. We make deals. We compromise, with them, and with our selves. And we never stop loving them. This is not a read for the weak. This is an in the trenches look at what it feels like to go through the ups and downs of life with an addict. This is not pretty. But this is necessary to know. Addiction is a disease of the brain that only the addict can choose to control. None of the platitudes work: They can just stop. It’s a choice. No one is making them take the drink/drug. And that is the rub for us parents: How can I not try to fix my child? How can I sit back and watch? How can they do this to themselves, to me, to their family? What could I have done differently? What did I do wrong? But again, this is about the addict and we parents just have to ride the waves, arms open for the fall; and the fall always comes. Hopefully, the fall will just be a slip, not a life altering or ending one. I have heard this book has been made into a movie, I’m sure it’s great. But my guess is that the book is far more powerful with its written descriptions of emotion, feeling, and fear. If you are going through it, or if you have been through it, or if you know someone who is in the through of a child with an addiction, this is one for you. I wish you well, you are not alone. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jan 30, 2024","Feb 03, 2024","Jan 30, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35721089-beautiful-boy

For anyone who has ever raised a child, been part of a community, or lived in a society, the fear of you or someone you know and love being involved in some type of mass violent event in today's world is a reality. Conversely, so is the thought that it may be someone you know, even if a few degrees separated, who committed the acts. We do not, nor can we ever know where someone's breaking point is and all the goodness brought to that person, all the appeals of love and understanding, may not be enough. We all think it couldn't or wouldn't be our child who could commit such a heinous act as a mass shooting, but what if...? What if it were your child who was bullied to the point of breaking? What if a never-ending drip of ""soft"" violence (a push, a shove, a spitball, a noogy, a trip, an upturned lunch tray, a word ""fag,"" ""homo,"" ""dyke,"" ""fatty,"" ""stinky,"" a mass email of humiliation were sent to an entire school) occurred to a child continuously until they suffered post-traumatic stress to the point of withdrawal, living in their own world (computers, gaming, anywhere to escape the meanness of the ""cool kids""), until one day they snapped -- could you see that happening? I can. This book hurt me deep in places I have tried to forget, didn't know other people knew, and was shocked to read about. I have been that broken child and have seen my children go through brutal punishment to be accepted, and sometimes worse, not accepted. I have seen my baby's soft, loving eyes turn hard, black, hateful at the hands of bullies. This is real.Does it mean all bullied children will become murderers or that this is an acceptable reason to murder - let's not be naive. The point: This is out there. This is happening.

Feel those feelings. Empathize with the pain, the hurt, the life that the least of these feel. No one is above being bullied.

All. Things. But in Beartown the players are only males, there is no female club. As with all things where there is a gender divide and where so much weight is placed onto the thing divided, the egos are huge, the entitlement is enormous, and coverups in the name of the club, a known given. When the general manager’s daughter is raped by the star player of the Beartown hockey team, lines are drawn, conjectures formed, socioeconomics defined, and genders separated, read: if you were on the hockey team, you prevailed. Fredrik Backman masterfully describes the intricacies of how the herd mentality works, how the good-ole-boys club rules, and how even in today’s age, if you aren’t in the right group, no amount of truth, rightness, or witnesses will bring justice. Beartown is raw and difficult at many points. It brings to light how easy the disgusting, vile side of humans can boil to the surface, be it the child who commits the wrong, or the parent who defends them to the death, even when the truth is known.Beneath the major theme, runs many additional, equally as important themes that Backman weaves and fleshes out throughout the gentle, slow-pace that makes Beartown unputdownable.

After reading Charles Martins’ Chasing Fireflies, I picked up The Mountain Between Us. Just wow — as I’ve said before, if you haven’t read a Charles Martin book, you are missing out. Due to weather in Salt Lake, commercial flights are canceled. Desperate to get home, Dr. Ben Payne hires a charter pilot, Grover, to fly him home to Florida to his wife and kids. On a whim, he asks Ashley, a fellow passenger who is on her way home for her wedding, if she’d like to join so as not to be late for her special day. The three, and Grover’s dog, beat the storm and head toward Denver when Grover’s heart gives out leaving Ben, Ashley, and Napoleon, the name Ben and Ashley give to the dog, to survive the Uintas Wilderness. Without filing a flight plan, and with neither Ben nor Ashley having told anyone of their change from commercial to charter, no one is looking or them. To make matters more dire, upon impact, Ashley’s shoulder dislocates and her femur breaks. Making it out of the vast, rugged, and isolated terrain alive will take more than shear strength. The Mountain Between Us is an incredible story that is superbly written, and worth every minute it takes to read it. I hear the movie is good as well, but I have no intention of watching it — why ruin a good book by trying to put the words on screen.

She has a story, and it’s not a bad plot, it’s got its moments of real fun and going somewhere, but it has been lost by someone’s idea to push this one through too quickly. This. Is. Not. Estes’. Fault. This is on the editor/publisher.

If that is the case, again, shame on the publisher/editor. Christina Estes, you deserve better that this. I can almost guarantee that I will be canceled, banned, never published, ridiculed, called out, run over, lambasted, and otherwise tarred and feathered for this , but seriously - editor/publisher, you may have ruined Estes’ future chance for readership by pushing this book through so early. Do Better. Anyone still reading this: Don’t discount Christina Estes’ ability - it’s in there. She can do this writing thing and we as readers need to give her another chance - maybe just with a different editing/publishing team.

Upon the sudden death of her husband, Willa Sylvester is faced with the reality that she will have to sell her husband’s dream, the town he named after his beloved wife: Willa, Montana. Thirty-five people reside in Willa, Montana, and Jack and Willa employed, assisted, housed, or otherwise cared for each one of them. Once Jack passed, Willa’s grief holed her up in their home and away from their friends, the residents of Willa. Months later, after crawling out of her grief enough to come up for air, Willa learns Jack’s secret: They are broke. There is no money. At the behest of her oldest friend, Bliss, Willa invites three women, a friend of a friend situation, to join her for the final week before the auction that will sell the town of Willa, Montana. The women converge on Willa’s home and learn the intricacies and beauty of wilderness, Montana, and being a middle-aged woman. And each carry their demons of their mid-life with them, hoping to find resolution. Bliss: desperately wants a child but has recently been abandoned by her husband. Harriette has fallen from the public’s grace as a motivational personality and is living as a hermit, and Jane has it all, doting husband, four perfect children, wealth, community, society, and a lover. She will have to figure out what makes her happy: family or freedom. Willa’s Grove is difficult to read in that it is a story about real life, the actual raw realism that befalls women of a certain age - we have lost ourselves to the “supposed to” of life. This was supposed to have happened, or that was supposed to have worked out, or he was supposed to have been with me to the end, or my children or career were supposed to have fulfilled me.There were times reading this where I wondered why am I still reading? It would have been easier on me to have DNF’d this one, but then I would have missed out on the community of the book, the “I am not alone” feelings, the “It’s okay to just be and be where I am” understanding that came with finishing the book. Beautifully written, I feel that Willa’s Grove will fly under the radar because of its difficult storyline, but the storyline is exactly why it needs to be read.

But when a life altering situation threatens the family’s multi-million dollar livelihood, as well as Essie’s way of life, she concocts a plan that will not only set her up for life, but free her from the stronghold she calls her family.

Jessica Strawser has crafted a great story about the Sequence, an underground group who help women in their last option in DV situations. If you need the Sequence, you are in the position similar to witness protection: You will leave everyone and everything behind, get a new name and new social security number, and get set up in an undisclosed location. The group, who use code names and works on the basis of anonymity, even within the group — for plausible deniability reasons, assist these women to the Grove, a nature conservation in the middle of nowhere.

Written through the eyes of journalist Chase Walker, once a foster child turned permanent resident of the questionable-of-character Uncle Willie McFarland and his wife Lorna, Chase is tasked with trying to track down the identity of the mute boy found just off the tracks of a car vs. train accident and goes by the name of Snoot. Immediately taken by Snoot's drawing skills, Chase changes the kid's moniker to Sketch. As Chase spends time looking into Sketch's background and any potential relative he may have, he is also working, as always, on the truth of how Unc' ended up in prison years ago accused of a crime Chase is certain his uncle could never commit. With the help of Tommye, a girl raised as a sister to Chase who also has secrets needing to be unearthed, a lot is happening in the Zuta.Numerous underlying stories are happening in Martin's Chasing Fireflies, but the overarching theme is one of fathers and sons -- strike that, one of good fathers raising decent sons. Chasing Fireflies is an easy to relate-to, soft approach to a hard-hitting, spot-on story of how boys need good father figures, guidance, love, hope, and a chance. The theme is not one of being perfect, it's one of being present, doing your best, owning your mistakes, and standing up when you need to. We all need an Unc' in our lives, and we all need to be an Unc' when called upon. You really MUST READ Chasing Fireflies.

The Shores, fallen football star Jack, and his college sweetheart, Elizabeth ""Birdy"" are struggling to keep their marriage together after twenty-four years. Jack, who once was the golden boy, has struggled for the past many years to climb back to the top by way of sports anchoring at mediocre television stations across the country. Birdy, who gave up everything about herself she loved, including painting to support Jack and his dreams, has finally found a house, a town, a life where she wants to grow roots, in Echo Bay, Oregon. Of course, Jack has now been offered the job of a lifetime, in New York. Now Birdy must figure out who she is, what she is, and what's important to her: should she follow Jack, again, or refind herself?

If I could sum up this  with any word or cliche that could entice others to read this book, it would be that my heart will never be the same. Asher and Lilly are seniors in a small New England town. They talk, they laugh, they learn about each other, they make love. They are exactly how all eighteen year olds are: fresh, experimental, hopeful, dreamers. But following a heated argument, Asher finds Lilly dead at the bottom of her stairs and is charged with first degree murder. It is then that everyone learns things are not as they seem. As simplistic as that summation may sound, Mad Honey is one of the most powerfully detailed depictions of life as a transgender person living in a cisgender world that I have come across. The way the authors have spun a thread of ‘normalcy,’ ‘sameness,’ and ‘perception’ stops the reader short when it is revealed half-way through this voluminous read, that Lilly is transgender. Every parent, every person, will love and understand Lilly, Asher, and Asher’s mom, Olivia. You will relate and feel your emotions and remember being a teenager in your first relationship and then BANG - you will be forced to check everything you thought was ‘real.’ Masterfully written. Superbly crafted to hook the reader so that even transphobes will be compelled to read to the end to see whodunit and why. Genius, really. Written from two perspectives, that of Olivia in the present and Lilly moving backward from the date of her death, the authors suck you in, draw you out exposing your underbelly until they zing you. I LOVE THIS SO MUCH. Mad Honey has filled my heart with hope that all people can be their true and authentic selves, fall in love, master a craft or a sport, lead a life filled with hopes, dreams, friends, lovers, and experience life to its fullest. As good as the book is, the author’s notes at the end are equally powerful and a must be read. If I haven’t yet sold you on reading Mad Honey, how about this: It’s been banned in many settings and many geographical areas. Why? Because it strikes a chord “they” don’t want you to feel. They don’t want you to relate to transgender people. They don’t want you to root for, fall in love with, hope for, or see yourself in the situation of either Lilly or Asher; where you might do all those things for and with a transgender person. They don’t want the thought of cisgender people loving, understanding, or accepting transgender people. I’ve said enough. I’ve not said a fraction of what this book makes me feel.

I am such a Frankie Elkin fan and in Still See You Everywhere, Lisa Gardner takes Frankie to new heights of ""What the--?"" Still See You Everywhere is fast-paced, action-packed, and filled with multiple characters you will love and hate.Still See you Everywhere finds missing person specialist Frankie Elkin in a women's maximum prison with serial killer, Kaylee Pierson, otherwise known as the Beautiful Butcher, having slain 18 men. Kaylee, now with only three weeks to live, wants to find her little sister, Lea who, according to Kaylee, has been kidnapped by a billionaire and will soon be on an off-the-grid atoll outside Hawaii. Frankie is being asked to go to the atoll, somehow fit in with the crew there, find and save Lea. But upon arrival, Frankie recognizes things and people are not what they seem.And here's where it gets good. Frankie, a recovering alcoholic, uses her sharp wit, snarky one-liners, and spot-on intuition to cull through the b.s. on the island, mostly. She also finds herself on the wrong end of a gun barrel, living with a wolf spider, and fearing coconut crabs. So who is Frankie and what makes her special? Frankie is the in-your-face, wish you could say the things she does, drifter who lives to help others find their missing loved ones. Frankie is special because Lisa Gardner writes her that way. I have loved all of the Frankie Elkin books (my first-ever series). I had no idea I could get hooked on a character but there is so much of me I see in Frankie and so much of her I wish I were me that I feel connected. Lisa Gardner's F.E. series has converted this stand-alone reader.Thank you, NetGalley and Grand Central Publishing for the ARC.

Remarkably Bright Creatures falls into the latter.On the surface, Remarkably Bright Creatures is a cute stroll with thirty-year old Cameron who doesn’t know his father’s identity, was abandoned by his mother at age 9 and raised by her sister in California. Of Tova, a 70-year old widow who lost her only son, Eric, when he was 18-years-old to an unsolved death (suicide according to authorities, Tova knows better), and works in Sowell Bay, Washington as the evening cleaning lady to the town’s aquarium. And of Marcellus a clever, Houdini-esc 60-pound giant Pacific octopus who understands humans. When a lead on Cameron’s biological father takes him to Sowell Bay, it is Marcellus who cracks the case that may solve the human’s mysteries.As fun as the story is, it’s the underlying theme that will grab your heartstrings. We follow all three through the steps of their unresolved grief, their feeling of abandonment, and bondage that keep them stuck where they are, figuratively and literally. In a creative twist, author Shelby Val Pelt walks the reader through the different types of feelings and reactions to loss, be it by death, captivity, or abandonment. A very remarkable story and one that, while wildly hyped, is worth it. You won’t regret reading Remarkably Bright Creatures.

I didn't find it terribly impactful, yet to critic it almost feels sacrilege given its subject matter. I appreciate what a horrific time and memory this must be for the author, and I give a lot of grace to the fact that it is his 15-year-old perspective written when he was quite some years older. That being said, for all the conversation (read hype) surrounding Night, I expected so much more; that is on me. As someone who has delved quite deep into this part of history, I feel there are far more detailed, perhaps even accurately portrayed writings available that will leave the reader with a better understanding of the suffering that occurred during the Holocaust. That being said, this book has its place, it just isn't the homerun read that it has been made out to be -- feels watered down.In learning more about the book and its apparent numerous renditions, that is likely what has occurred, the 800+ original score has been whittled down through each language translation. It now is just over 100 pages for us English readers. Too bad, really, as I think we could have taken away much more and the effect could have been far more powerful had the pages remained.

As her arthritic fingers are beyond their capacity to type such a long manuscript, Jude, a young student, is hired for the job. As Jude and Ruby begin to form an unlikely, if not unusual bond, Ruby pours out the story of the twelve men who have shaped her life. From the cousin she shouldn’t have known ‘in that way,’ to the loss of the love her life, to the spy, and her son, Ruby divulges all while secretly hoping to save her young scribe from himself. When the last chapter is all that is left, Ruby is dumbstruck by her publisher’s revelation that no one (including this reader) saw coming. This book is one of those I feel I need to break my comments into two parts: The book and the writing. The book is good, beyond good, very good, better than most good. Ruby is a hoot. She’s fresh, feisty, independent, witty, carefree (read doesn’t give a *bleep* about what anyone things), and is looked at as much more of a writer than she gives herself credit for. As for it being scandalous, the only thing truly scandalous is that some may think her 12 men are nearly a dozen too many. I for one, thought it refreshing to see someone write about a woman’s escapades rather than keeping the female boxed into a moral one or two lovers. As for the writing - have your dictionary or your Google close at hand while reading this one. I absolutely LOVE that Mandy Robotham did not dumb down her prose for the reader. I guaranty, there will be more than one word or turn of phrase you will learn from this one; why don’t more authors write this way? The flow of the sentences, the clever descriptions, again, the broad usage of language took what may otherwise have been a more average book to another level. Well done, Mandy Robotham.

As the eleventh of fourteen children, Draya learned young the lessons of all-hands-on-deck regarding household chores and growing, gathering, and hunting food. She also learned the nightmare of a cult-like religion wherein a sin of any kind is absolved by simply asking for forgiveness and then never spoken of again; including rape and incest.Through years of self deprecation, insecurity, and self-loathing, Draya clawed her way from the brainwashing religion while she did the work to heal herself and try to retain a relationship with her family. Continually running back to and falling into her comfort place of the wilderness, Draya puts her lifetime of skills to work with a dream job of being a small business owner as a hunting guide in the mountains of Colorado.What’s Her Wild is a very fast read, but it is not for the sensitive. Grangroth pulls no punches when she calls people out who have wronged her or people she knows. She is graphic in her depictions of hunting, killing, and cleaning game, and she is open about her abuse. While the subjects at time might be difficult to read, Grangroth is good at reminding the reader that this is her story and that she is not suggesting you must understand her path.This was a surprise read for me — in a good way. I came away with a message helpful for all people: You don’t have to live your trauma alone.FUN SIDE NOTE: I was fortunate to meet this powerhouse woman when I was at a camp for adult cancer survivors of cancer. Andraya was a whitewater raft guide on one of our excursions and I was fortunate enough to be in her boat. As with many camps, we all used nicknames; Andraya was known on the river as Forteener (as one of 14 children). At that time, Andraya was fairly fresh out of her family and church situation and just kicking around the idea of a book. She trusted me with a few of her first draft chapters.

Akin to Katherine Center or a clean Molly Henry, Strobos will make you fall in love with Tessa and Zeke. Set in New York City, both Tessa and Zeke are reeling from break-ups; her for being a workaholic attorney, him for dating a cheating/lying attorney. When the two meet during an art exhibit where Tessa is posing as an artist to catch a con-man, Zeke is interested but mentions he won’t date an attorney or a liar. Tessa feels stuck as she is posing and not being forthcoming. With the usual ups and downs typical to HEA rom-coms, Love is an Art checks all the boxes. I struggled a bit with the first-person dual protagonists, her/him, but once I got the cadence, it was a quick, easy read.Interesting note - author Kathy Strobos not only writes from a place of experience (she was a practicing attorney in NYC prior to her writing career), and she intertwines some of the characters throughout her several books. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Oct 05, 2023","Oct 07, 2023","Oct 05, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/199018011-love-is-an-art

This sweet romance (think no sex, only a couple of kisses, no heat) is set in the laid back, everyone-knows-everyone, small town of Bellbird Bay, Australia. Single mom Sandy has just lost her bakery to fire, her dreams gone up in flames. When she is wrestling with the police and insurance, she receives a call about Ruby, the octogenarian best friend of her grandmother, who has had an accident and requires assistance. Sandy uproots her 15-year-old daughter, Fliss, under the promise of only staying in Bellbird Bay for a couple months, just until Ruby is back on her feet. But when Fliss falls for Zack and Sandy’s temporary bakery and friendship with bike shop owner, Rob, take off, there is a real decision to be made once Ruby is well: Move back to Sydney and pick up their comfortable lives, or take a chance in business and love in Bellbird Bay. Although outside my normal genre read, Celebrations held my attention and I read it in one day. Maggie Christensen holds the reader’s hand as she walks them through this journey with just enough intrigue and desire for the happy ever after, that it is easy to continue to turn the pages.

First Son of the United States, Alex, is born to a Mexican father and white mother, who happens to be the first woman president. Alex and his sister, June, are the most loveable, hair-pulling, in-each-others'-business, typical siblings. Throw in Nora, granddaughter to the VP, and you have the three hottest 20-year-olds in the country. When the three are in London to attend Prince Phillip's marriage, Alex runs headlong into his arch-nemesis, Prince Henry. Wedding cakes are toppled, photos are leaked, drama ensues and a spicy web is woven. The tabloids pick up on things, and their tongues wag, always a step behind as Nora is seen with Princess Bea, June is hanging out with the BF of Prince Henry, and Alex and Henry, well, they are just Henry and Alex, the Prince of England and the First Son. But nothing is as it seems.Written in relevant, youthful dialogue woven into rich, complex thoughts about society, family, and duty and steeped in deep romance (with a lot of steamy sex), Casey McQuiston puts the rights of all people front and center, and she does it beautifully.

In that regard, When we were Friends touched my happy place. When a horrific-to-high-schoolers truth is revealed in front of everyone at prom, the friendship and their “Secret Gift Society” (a made-up friendship club) of Morgan, Paige, Tiff, and Emily explodes. The four have never spoken since. Nineteen years later, Morgan’s truth is exposed and she calls an emergency meeting of the Secret Gift Society. The women are no longer the carefree, rose-colored glasses teenagers they once were, life and the prom experience having changed them all dramatically. However, through twists and turns and a bit of sleuthing as back in the day, the women come to terms with their past and forge a new path to adult friendship.

Miller spins the story of A Christmas Baby at Goodwill House. Written with a Downton Abbey style of prose, the plot has a gentle, endearing sweetness.Lady Joanna Harcourt, a widowed 38-year-old, has fallen in love with lower-class 29-year-old John, a pilot for the RAF during WW2. The two have only met a couple of times when, scandalously, Joanna learns she is pregnant. Already the mother to newly-wed 19-year-old Sarah and adopted twins Joe and Liza, Joanna must relinquish her title and swiftly marry John.As John must carry on his war duties, Joanna stays in her in-laws’ estate at Goodwill House with her younger children and former mother-in-law, who ironically adores Joanna and loathed her son. (My favorite character is the elder Lady Harcourt; she’s spirited and openly honest.)

To pass the time and help the village children enjoy Christmas, Joanna and her family make homemade toys out of repurposed and found items in their large estate.John is lost at sea days before the baby is due, and Joanna suffers a crushing blow.

Margot had Eliza from kindergarten through just before their freshman year at Rutledge, when Eliza died at a party that Margot didn’t go to. And the last person to see her alive was Levi, who vied for Eliza’s attention from Margot.Starting her freshman year alone, Margot, a forgettable sort who would rather stay in than attend functions, limped through the year with her roommate, Maggie, doing her best to keep Margot afloat. When the girl in the bikini outside their dorm catches Margot’s attention and suddenly befriends her, going so far as to ask her to be the fourth in a 4-bedroom off campus house, Margot is beside herself. Could things be looking up?When Margot moves in with Lucy, the magnet who pulls everyone’s attention, Sloan and Nichole, she is bothered by Lucy’s peculiar behaviors that seem so familiar to Eliza’s; the same tics and mannerisms, the same pull on people. Margot chalks this up to her own overreach and falls headlong into the party life with her new roommates and the frat boys in the house next door. When freshman, Levi, pledges the frat house and becomes enthralled by Lucy, Margot is determined to prove he was responsible for Eliza’s death. But when a frat party goes very wrong, all bets are off as to what Margot thought was fact. Stacey Wilkerson, while new on the scene with this being her third book, has knocked it out of the park. She completely nails that deep, intimate bond with friends and their way of feeling and thinking; including their insecurities, power struggles, secrets, and clicks within a group of besties.

Saying goodbye to her betrothed, Simon, is difficult for Jess, but she does her best to keep him in her life by continually writing him. While in Africa, Jess helps two outlying villages on Sundays with lessons and rudimentary first aid. And as many who have ever volunteered, Jess is the one who learns many of the lessons that need to be taught.When Jess and her roommate meet Jim and Hank, two men from the U.S. who are in Ghana with the Peace Corps, Jess is instantly drawn to Jim through music and loneliness. But in keeping honest with Simon, Jess keeps Jim at an arms-length and in the friend zone. True to history, Drumbeats introduces the coupe of 1966 in Ghana, and Jess gets some scary, first-hand lessons about politics, power, and deceit. During this time, Jim disappears, and Jess is desperate to find him. However, a series of unfortunate events forces Jess home early without locating Jim. And now, she must face Simon and decide if her love for him was immature or strong enough to bind them still. Drumbeats is a well-written, sweet romance that is a fast cover-to-cover read. There is much to uncover regarding Africa, its environment, and the time of the coupe; it is in no way religious or preachy. Think wholesome and good morals. This book could be safely given to a teen (in fact, teens may learn some suitable lessons here).

Yes, there is more to the book, I think, but it is so surrounded by dreams and snippets of Biblical isms I got lost on what in the world the book was about - certainly not a lot of turning lead into gold. Part “The Secret” and part Bible, the Alchemist is a lot, and a little, and to me, not worth it. That being said, it was well-crafted and deserves a go if you are into preachy fantasy. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Aug 15, 2023","Aug 20, 2023","Aug 15, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18144590-the-alchemist

During those slow times, I pondered about a 3.5 or a 4 as a rating. Thank god I continued on and didn’t rate until the end. This book is a 5, and here’s why.Clover is a death doula - which is to say that she sits with and helps those dying navigate their end of life. She is also an extreme loaner. Raised from the age of 6 by her grandpa when her parents passed away, Clover fell into her profession due to a personal regret; not being with her grandfather when he passed.Throughout the years following her grandpa’s death, Clover, who is well into her 30s, has never had a romantic relationship. She’s never been loved in that way, she hasn’t even been kissed. So when she is hired by Sebastian, a quirky, yet handsome man from a wealthy family to be a doula for his beloved grandmother, Clover thinks her luck has changed. In the background of Clover’s tiny circle is her 89-year-old neighbor, Leo, and the new resident to her New York City’s building, Sylvie. Leo and Sylvie weave there way unexpectedly throughout Clover’s life and encourage her, along with her new charge, the illustrious Claudia, who is dying of cancer, to see life through a new lens, to take the advice of her previous clients and live her life. The Collected Regrets of Clover comes to a beautiful crescendo when Clover meets Hugo, the grandson of Claudia’s long-lost love, and he helps Clover piece her life together. The prose throughout is well-written, and the ending is simply beautiful. I can’t say I’m a note in the margin kinda gal, but two sentences in this book now have sticky notes on them and I leave them with you to ponder and to encourage you to read Mikki Brammer’s book, you won’t regret it. [WARNING: If you don’t want to spoil two of the best lines in the book, don’t read the next two paragraphs.]First, when Claudia is revealing some of her regrets to Clover she rawly states what so many feel: “I mostly regret putting the needs of others ahead of my own. But as a woman, that’s what I was taught to do. Your husband, your children, your parents — their happiness all mattered more. You were always someone’s wife, or mother, or daughter before you were yourself. It’s like I didn’t live my life for myself, as myself. Like I wasted what I was given.” —Oof. If that doesn’t resonate.Second: “...maybe we have different business with the same souls in each lifetime. And it doesn’t always work out how we want it to in every one of them.” —I LOVE this. There is hope for people with regret thinking they let their true love get away....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Aug 14, 2023","Aug 19, 2023","Aug 14, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61214136-the-collected-regrets-of-clover

This  needs to be broken into two parts: the book and the writing.Part One: All Adults HeMy first Emma Straub experience and it was a good one. This  needs to be broken into two parts: the book and the writing.Part One: All Adults Here.There are no giants in this book and no villains. Nothing will stand out as an ah-ha moment, and you won't be haunted because of shock value after reading it. There is an abundance of truth and openness about how the family is generationally dysfunctional in ways, perfect in others, closeted and open simultaneously, and just as crazy, unpredictable, and loyal as yours. There is a lot of head nodding, mm-hmm moments where you will recognize yourself, your siblings, or even your parent in one or another character. You will see that what you thought was uniquely off about your own family isn't. And that what you thought was remarkably special to your relationship is also noteworthy in others. In other words, All Adults Here will help you open your eyes to family, its imperfections, and its constraints. You will watch Cecilia be sent to live with her grandmother at age 13 because she did the right thing but was bullied because of it; it was easier on her parents to remove her than deal with it. You will see Astrid, the matriarch, find love in the arms of a woman after being a widow for decades. As the firstborn, Elliot will finally be able to express the pressures of the same. Porter, the unwed, pregnant by choice from a sperm bank, still having an affair with her high-school sweetheart middle child, sees she is loved by her mother and both her older and younger brothers. And Nicholas, oh, precious, last born, never at fault, Nickey shows his downfalls and fears just like his siblings. Set in small town USA, the townspeople are just as nosy and awful and loving and loyal and plagued with turmoil as in any other town; we all hate to love where we are from and couldn't imagine wanting to be from anywhere else if we were being honest. You will fall in love with some of the ancillary characters, root for Robin to find herself, and hope that Sidney falls off the float. That is All Adults Here. I love this book. It is a book about nothing and everything and is an important book to read if you belong to a family.Part Two: Emma Straub.What an insightful writer Ms. Straub is. She captures the tiniest of nuances in grand ways without making a spectacle. In one stroke she can paralyze you by seeing your deepest secrets and open your mind while allowing you to feel okay about all of it. She is a rare writer that requires you must read every. single. word. Because if you don't, you might have missed something. Scratch that; you will miss something. Take your time, read every word, and think about it. Put it into the context of your own life and come out the other side knowing you are not alone with how upside down according to the perfection on social media your life is. You are okay.

In the 1950s, it was more than unusual for women to be in the workforce, let alone in an area as cerebral as science. Elizabeth endured sexual assault, discrimination, sexism, and patriarchy as she worked for a fraction of the money in a lab filled with men who were nearly all less capable than her. While at work, she meets Calvin Evans, a thrice nominated Pulitzer scientist, and the two have chemistry. Along with their stray dog, that Elizabeth names for the time she met him, Six-Thirty rounds out the duos family. When Calvin is tragically killed, Elizabeth finds herself pregnant, something she never wanted. Like all patriarchies and sexist/discriminatory societies, Elizabeth is fired when her employer learns of her 'condition.' After surviving on covert science papers for her former co-workers following the birth of her daughter, Mad, Elizabeth has a moment where she turns her kitchen into a lab, centrifuge and all. Once Mad starts school, trouble with another kindergartner causes Elizabeth to storm into a television producer's office complaining about his child, and she is offered a new job as the face of Suppers at Six, where Elizabeth uses chemistry to encourage growth and education while teaching women how to cook nutritious meals for their families.With the help of a nosy neighbor turned best friend, Harriette, Elizabeth raises Mad and helps her tv audience learn pivotal lessons about life.Lessons in Chemistry was a serious page-turner and my only regret is that I waited so long to read it (I sometimes worry that the book won't live up to the hype - this one does.)...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Jul 17, 2023","Jul 19, 2023","Jul 17, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58065033-lessons-in-chemistry

The Mermaid Chair just didn’t hit all my hot buttons - don’t get me wrong, it was well-done, heartfelt, and definitely worth the read, but for me, was a bit too linear.Jessie and Hugh have been married twenty years, their daughter Dee is just off to college, when Jessie, an artist turned stay-at-home mom receives a shocking call that her mother, Nelle, has intentionally cut off her own finger. Back home on the tiny island where she grew up, Jessie works with her mother’s friends to try to get to the bottom of Nelle’s self-mutilation trauma. Jessie’s search leads her to the monastery where Nelle volunteers as a cook. Enter Brother Thomas.The Mermaid Chair is quite churchy without being about religion. It imbues the moral rights and wrongs of the world while still allowing its characters to be human. Read, Jessie and the monk hook up. The book ends up the way it is “supposed to” not the way, in my opinion, it should have; and this is where it felt linear - just too predictable.If you’ve never read or seen the 1983 blockbuster, The Thorn Birds, this book will be quite the original work.

It’s me, Margaret, or Summer Sisters, you won’t be disappointed by the writing of Judy Blume.Firstly, I love the title, Summer Sisters. Nothing more needs to be said, you already know what the book is about - just as the title states. Caitlyn has it all, the money, the looks, the opportunities. What she lacks in family stability, she makes up for with her free, if sometimes exaggerated spirit. Victoria, “Vix,” is Caitlyn’s opposite, lacking in wealth, not quite the stunner, and her opportunities are limited (so she thinks) because of these things. But for whatever reason, at age 12, Caitlyn invites Vix to spend the summer on Martha’s Vineyard with her Dad and brother. Summer Sisters is a decades long saga of the story of the girls growing up, growing together, growing apart, learning about their female “Power,” boys, friendship, life lessons, and the like. In wonderful Judy Blume style, the pages fly by, as to the years, ending with a bit of an unexpected heartbreak. This book made me smile with nostalgia, reminisce about days and friends gone by, and wish for all young girls to have he experience of a Summer Sister....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Jun 07, 2023","Jun 10, 2023","Jun 10, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/22695.Summer_Sisters

This book is not for wimps. Sing You Home follows the life of Zoey and Max and their 9-year marriage which involves 5-years of fertility issues. During this time, the couple’s relationship dissolves but their embryos remain. As Max, a failing alcoholic, starts over, again, with the help of a powerful and outspoken religious church (yes, I put the word religious in there purposefully - not all churches are as “religious” as others - read zealot) and a room in his brother and sister-in-laws basement, Zoey finds Vanessa. And much to everyone’s surprise, the two fall in love and get married. When Zoey asks Max for permission (required as he is the biological other half of the embryos DNA), to use the embryos so that she and Ness can start a family, all hell breaks loose. The church hires the country’s biggest anti-gay lawyer and off we go. DISCLAIMER: There were numerous times during this book that I almost put it down, away, and permanently off my shelf. I am glad I didn’t do any of those things. The plot, in Picoult style, was flawless, inspiring, enraging, endearing, heartbreaking, inflaming, and hate-filled (okay maybe all her books are not hate-filling). It was A LOT. My emotions and brain were all over the place. As a grandmother-in-waiting to a gay child who has yet to find their person yet wants to be a parent, I wanted to throttle Max, his lawyers, the church. But, as a beyond middle aged woman who works in the legal field reading a book written 12-years ago about the legalities of gay marriage, legal rights of embryos, and church versus state, I had to continue. I’m glad I did. The resolution is as it should have been - there were no red herring zingers at the end and I’m thankful; my heartstrings couldn’t have survived. Sing You Home should be required reading for those who believe there is only one way to be a family. Thank you, Jodi Picoult, for having the foresight, the inspiration, and quite frankly, the balls to write such a beautiful story. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"May 18, 2023","May 29, 2023","May 18, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/8554005-sing-you-home

Eleanor is a very wounded young girl of 16. Caught between child and womanhood, Eleanor struggles to be the glue for her young siblings in a house of horrors, thanks to her stepdad, a drunk who is unkind and creepy (there is no bathroom door, he leers at Eleanor, and as it turns out, is suggestive with his comments). After relocating, yet again, Eleanor finds herself on the bus sitting next to an Asian kid (her words), who turns out to be far more than she could ever have hoped. Park (the kid on the bus) comes from a polar opposite family, where the kid is embarrassed because his parents kiss, on the lips, with tongue, regardless of who is watching. Park and his brother's biggest worries are what's for dinner at their grandparents' house the following Sunday. While Eleanor struggles to stay unnoticed in high school, she wears unconventional statement pieces (men's ties, feathers, etc.) to cover up the fact that her clothes are used and often with rips in undesired places or several sizes too large. Park, the cool kid, wears all the right clothes, fits in without trying, even though he feels an outcast because of his ethnicity in all-white Omaha, and is unbelievably drawn to Eleanor's uniqueness. Over time, Park's genuine kindness and patience win out, and Eleanor gives him a chance to show her how she deserves to be treated and respected.

While emotions run high and unkind thoughts do prevail at times, the maturity of the plot and the writing leave the reader with positive introspection and positive lessons - people do fall in and out of love, and just because it doesn't work out doesn't mean someone is awful, and it is okay to move on when a relationship is done. In a world where everything feels so contentious and yet authors write about fairytale relationships that leave readers resenting their actual real-life relationships (because of their inherent fissures and fractures and wondering why their life doesn't look like the movies), Happiness Sold Separately is a refreshing, honest look at what real relationships can go through. This book should be required reading for married couples who are struggling. It won't save your marriage, but you may find a better way to disagree and let go if that time comes. So well done....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 27, 2023","Mar 30, 2023","Mar 27, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/89115.Happiness_Sold_Separately

Debut author Stacy Willingham knocked A Flicker in the Dark out of the park.Chloe Davis has spent the past 20 years doing everything she can to get past the events that occurred during the summer when she was 12, when her father was arrested and convicted as a serial killer of six 15-year old girls in their small town of ten thousand people. Following her dad’s arrest and conviction, Chloe’s mom stopped actively living and caring for her children, 12-year old Chloe and 15-year old Cooper. Chloe becomes a psychologist and meets the man of her dreams, Daniel. But within the month prior to their wedding, girls that had ties to Chloe begin to turn up missing; just like before. This is a fast-paced book filled with just enough this and that to keep you guessing who really done it - after all, Chloe’s dad has been in the maximum security prison for the past 20-years, so he can’t be the new killer. And does that mean he wasn’t the original killer?I can say I did not guess who the culprit was, I thought I knew where it was going, just as the author wanted me to—well done!

Yes, it is rom-comish, yes, it is happy ever after. Yes, it has the boy and girl meet, fall in love, split, and get back together curve - but the undercurrent makes this book so much more.Disclaimer: When I started the book, I was a little concerned I wasn't going to ""get it."" There is no denying Tia Williams and I come from different backgrounds, and I would be remiss if I didn't say that there were parts of the book I didn't understand, references to people, artists, and events, that are out of my wheelhouse. (This is nothing new, I don't understand a lot about many things, part of the joy of reading is what you learn.) BUT, what started as unknown for me became pure respect and fun as the pages turned. Seven Days in June is a light-hearted book with sprinkles of middle-of-the-road issues and some intense and disturbing ones. There is a well-spun mixture of all sorts of subjects in this book: children of neglectful parents who come together to help each other, invisible disabilities that need to be recognized and not shamed, self-harm, drugs, loss of life, great parenting, open communication, understanding. Seriously, this book runs the gamut.Eva and Shane have history. They knew each other when, and after 15 years apart, their lives collided again. Both have become well-known authors, Shane in a more traditional sense and Eva as a fantasy erotica novelist. When the two find themselves face-to-face at an event, their next seven days are a whirlwind of hot sex, deep conversations, uncovered truths, and unexpected realities. The book is great, but my favorite part is how it is written. Tia Williams doesn't shy away from her truth and the truth of those she writes about. Tia Williams is a black author writing about black people. I loved the way she wrote with the correct vernacular, slang, and terminology. Yep, I'm a 55-year-old white woman, and some of it went way over my head - and it was beautiful. I don't want to read the same ole same ole written only by white, heterosexual cisgenders (not that this book had anything to do with sexuality or gender, but you get the point). I truly enjoyed the new perspective I got from reading/seeing things from a different point of view.I also appreciate how Tia Williams spun the breakup part of the typical romance, HEA. In Seven Days in June, there isn't a huge deal-breaking, ""I never want to see you again"" moment where the girl (guy) storms out and bawls for days to his/her bestie and then 'poof' all better by some magical discovery of, 'oh, I didn't realize that was the case,' event. In Seven Days, the breakup is more subtle, realistic, and organic. Sometimes things don't work out, and we need time and space to figure ourselves out; that is precisely what Tia Williams allowed her characters to do, and I loved it so much.Read Seven Days in June. You will get a whole new perspective on invisible disabilities (more needs to be written about this), you will need to wipe your brow during the steamy passages, you will fall in love with Eva's daughter, you will root for Eva and Shane to get their s*** together for each other, you will appreciate the realness in the sweet story. And, you will understand and appreciate the difficulties involving family. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Mar 16, 2023","Mar 22, 2023","Mar 16, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55648820-seven-days-in-june

That said, when I leaned into the genre, I was glad I stayed the course. The Wolves at the Door is a very well-researched story about Virginia Hall, an American who, in the 1930s, worked for the government with aspirations of becoming a foreign service officer. However, due to an unfortunate accident that left the 20-something Hall without a leg and the fact that she was a woman, her career dreams looked to be dashed (No disabled persons, and especially no disabled women, were allowed as foreign service officers for the United States). But, Virginia was undeterred, and at the start of WW2, Virginia joined the British Special Operations Executive organization. The SOE dealt with espionage and sabotage against the Nazis. Throughout the next many years until the war ended, Virginia made her way through France, Spain, and England, assisting downed allied pilots to safety, coordinating the destruction of railways, setting up safe houses, and gathering intelligence. In short, the female, one-legged Virginia Hall, who became known as the ""limping lady"" to the Nazis and was one of their most sought-after combatants, was a badass.It took quite some time for Virginia to receive the recognition she deserved for the lives she saved and the war-changing intelligence she snuck out of Nazi-controlled countries to help the Allies. But ultimately, both Brittan and the U.S., quietly and without ceremony (her choice so she could continue to be an agent in the field), recognized Virginia as a well-deserved hero. The Wolves at the Door is a well-written book that deserves praise. Author Judith L. Pearson did a remarkable job researching Virginia Hall's story and the many other side and back stories that created the landscape within which Ms. Hall performed her duties. This excellent historical book helps shine a positive light on the limitless potential of persons with disabilities as well as females.

My first impression was I wished it were a bit more ""deep."" But as the days passed, I realized it was perfectly written. And here's why: Friendships are tricky. They are messy because they involve people whose lives change, and ours don't always stay in sync thereafter. Annie Cathryn has written a good book that, if you look past its light touch, beyond the fun banter, you will see a lot of depth here and some good lessons.The Friendship Breakup follows Fallon, an almost 40-year-old, trying to navigate her friend group of moms as they change and grow (some regress) and move on. Unfortunately for Fallon, the group's most assertive personality (read leader), Beatrice, behaves more like a high schooler regarding conflict resolution. Bea is going through some serious personal issues but relies on rumor and conjecture to base her decisions, which leads to her ghosting Fallon from the group. And, as in high school, the rest of the group follows Bea's lead.The book has so much more to it; Fallon wins a chocolate-making contest, gets investors to open a shop, has a good relationship with her husband and her daughter, works through her adoption issues, seeks counseling, and makes new friends - all of which help Fallon, in the end, get back to her confident, independent self, and surround herself with actual good friends. However, the meat of the story is when you look back on what you read. As all of us know, high school is generally not easy, mean girls bully lots of us, and we carry those scars throughout our adulthood and often into our adult female circles. The Friendship Breakup took me back to some mean girl situations in my own life, but through Annie Cathryn's lighthearted writing and fun dialogue, she was able to help me see that it is okay to break up with those so-called friends and move on. The Friendship Breakup is a quick, easy read that, if you let it, will help you see that we can and should move beyond the toxic friendship relationships - there are better people out there waiting to friend us.Annie Cathryn's debut is worth reading and will bring you joy and some good self-reflection. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Feb 27, 2023","Mar 03, 2023","Feb 27, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/61053861-the-friendship-breakup

And while Malibu Rising will not change the world or create a forever memory for generations to look back on, it is super good and SO worth the time to dive into the lives of the four (or maybe five) Riva kids. Thrust into early adulthood at age 17 due to her dysfunctional (read absent) father, superstar Mick Riva and the death of June, her mother, Nina Riva, navigates life as the eldest of four kids. She now runs the family restaurant, dropped out of high school to work longer hours, does the cooking, and cleaning, juggles the bills, and kisses the boo-boos, all so that her younger siblings, Jay, Hud, and Kit, can stay out of foster care and have a good life.The Rivas end up being quite the family, not only resilient but somewhat famous, Nina as a model, Jay as a surfer, Hud as Jay's photographer, and Kit at just 20, may become the most successful of them all with her future as a surfer. Malibu Rising delves into the ups and downs of Mick and June's tumultuous relationship: his rise to stardom, his philandering (he has children with other women while married to June), her drinking, her desperation, her unwavering, immeasurable love for her children. It also tracks the highs and lows of the children's lives after being orphaned: Nina's surprise at being discovered, Jay's penchant for surfing and making a living at it, Hud's uncanny photography eye, and Kit's discovery of who she is.

I do not read books based on trend or hype, or season; the fact that I read The Book of Lost Friends during Black History Month was purely coincidental. The Book of Lost Friends was developed as a suggestion, if you will, to the author by one of her readers. The reader had just finished another of Ms. Wingate's amazing historical fictions, and as she was volunteering to input letters from lost friends into a database, she thought Ms. Wingate might find inspiration in the same. And boy, did she!Written from two POVs, The Book of Lost Friends finds the reader in the 1870s with Hannie Gossett, an 18-year-old newly freed slave who sets out on a quest even she didn't know she was about to embark on, and in the 1980s with late-20s Benny Silva, a first-year teacher way out of her depth, culture, and understanding in Augustine, Louisianna. Hannie begins her journey thinking she will collect intel on what the young mistress of the house and her half-sister (a mullato girl that shares in common the mistress' father) learn of their father's papers regarding his land holdings. But this quickly turns into a quest for Hannie to find her own people who were ripped away from each other through slave trading. Benny only needs to do five years in an underprivileged school to get her student loans paid for; little did she know when she signed up to the mixed race, heavily black populated school, that she would not only save her students by helping them uncover their pasts but that she would find comfort of her own in understanding the way a past shapes the present. The stories don't intertwine per se (until one line toward the end when you realize that Ms. Silva's students have uncovered the history of Hannie Gossett), but the 'big house' where the Gossets, both black and white, all came from, anchor it. The stories of both Hannie and Benny stand alone and are remarkably well-told in their own right. But the over-arching theme of humanity, unforgivable family secrets (slavery), and the absolute need to preserve history, including all of its ugliness, strikes a chord that is hard to shake. I struggle to articulate this book's uniqueness because I am still in my head. Suffice to say, it is an absolute MUST READ. If we bury our heads regarding the past, we risk allowing the past to reoccur. Thank you, Ms. Wingate, for allowing me to join Hannie and Benny on their quest for truth. This book makes me want to dive deeply into the bunny trail of lost friends. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Feb 06, 2023","Feb 18, 2023","Feb 06, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53025903-the-book-of-lost-friends

But the beautiful thing is that Leo has taken a shine to Nora's kids, and they to him. Upon wrapping up the show, Nora figures its all finished, until she walks out the next morning to find Leo asleep on her porch swing. Leo turns out to be just a guy, an ultra-famous one, but just a guy nonetheless. He falls for the kids, helps out at the school play, signs autographs for the locals, and, surprise, falls in love with Nora.

Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., or Dougie as the Club calls him, is a fraud, a nobody who inadvertently kills the man who attacks him. Assuming he should discover who the man is, he grabs the dead man's ID and does some searching. Come to find out, the dead man is a serial who goes by the handle, Grandson of Barney, GOB for short. Following a roundabout way, GOB ends up in Chicago at a diner where a group of serial killers who use movie star names as their cover meets regularly. GOB takes on the identity of Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Four years into his fraud, Dougie is the club's secretary when a knock at his door reveals an FBI agent who insists that Dougie kill all the club members so that he can walk a free man. Dougie agrees, and his killing spree begins, killing the likes of Cher, James Holden, Burt Lancaster, and so on.

Queen of Thieves is set in the aftermath of war torn London where people were told to tighten their belts in an economy where there was hardly anything left to tighten. Nell, a young, unwed woman finds herself in the family way with a less than reliable boyfriend. She hooks up with Alice, known as the leader of the Forty Thieves, the all female group of holsters who make a living nicking fine clothes, furs, and jewelry from posh stores of the city. Following a short stint for being set up and collared, Nell has her sites set on revenge. Once released from jail, and at Alice’s request, Nell moves over to Soho to take up with King of Soho, who is the proprietor of gangland in that area. From here, Nell is poised to take over not just the Queen of Thieves, but the King of Soho.

Miranda Cowley Heller writes a beautiful book about Elle and her family. We follow Elle throughout her life as she hops from one time to another in a mostly seamless way (but occasionally, in the beginning, I couldn't keep straight if we were in today's Elle life or her younger Elle life). The Paper Palace is the main cabin, with a few outlying cabins that have been in Elle's family for generations. The Paper Palace holds all of Elle's fondest and worst memories.

It was felt in the jobs colored people could get, where they could live, how they were treated in schools, and the way the government took advantage of the often impoverished and under or uneducated people within that community. The novel, while fiction, is, as Dolen Perkins-Valdez states, loosely inspired by the real case, Relf v. Weinberger.

Dara offers herself in a vulnerable and raw state throughout the book and encourages others to not dwell in their grief but to learn to use the written word to help others know about people they have lost; i.e., Dara’s gift to her daughters was a mommy-daughter journal where they could safely communicate with their mom, and her own mother’s notes and letters as a way for her daughters to know the woman they would never meet.I took a lot away from I am My Mother’s Daughter.

I am nothing like Frankie Elkin who is an alcoholic, drifter, nomad, civilian in search of her next missing person's case, and all around BA when it comes to standing up for herself and others, but I totally relate to her. She has a moral compass and drive to help those who cannot help themselves, the missing. In One Step Too Far, Frankie finds herself in the wilderness in Wyoming, borrowing pack and gear, searching for a man missing for five years. Along with her are a professional guide from the area, the man's father, his three college buddies who were with him for his bachelor party the night he disappeared, a SARs handler and her dog, Daisy, a Bob, a Big Foot hunter. Who could not love this cast?Things go from tough to bad to WTF in a matter of a couple of days.

This is a really good book.Frankie Elkin is a disaster. An alcoholic who works in a bar and lives a nomadic life traveling from place to place as a civilian trying to bring home missing persons, all without pay. In this book, she is working on her fifteenth missing person case. The character of Frankie is relatable; she's smart, sassy, independent, and savvy. Yet, she is also lonely, confused, haunted by her past, and in love with a man she can never have. Lisa Gardner spins a fast tale about a missing fifteen-year-old in inner-city Boston who literally, it would appear, vanishes. No CCTV images, pings from her phone, sitings, or communication. Eleven months after she goes missing, she suddenly starts popping up here and there, dropping breadcrumb clues of her whereabouts. There are good twists and turns, and throughout the book, I had no idea who was the kidnapper.

In a nutshell, the book is about Kate Darling, who learns on her grandmother's deathbed about the woman who may well be her true grandmother. The story then takes us to Alice and Tom in the 1920-40s and jumps back to Kate learning her family history in the 1980s. It is well-written, well-thought-out, and worth the read.

There is so much good to be said here; let's start with the overall theme - slavery. Not a good subject, but in this novel by Sue Monk Kidd, it is brought to a level that all of us can understand. The story is broken into two distinct sections; (1) that of Sarah Grimke and her sister Angelina ""Nina"" is based on the author's research and retelling as well as fictionalizing these real sisters who, through a lifetime in a family of slave owners become advocates in real life for abolition as well as women's rights, and (2) Handful, the slave that Sarah was gifted on her eleventh birthday. The readers switch by chapter, between Sarah's life as an unwilling participant in a family of slave owners to Handful, Sarah's slave. Sarah takes the time to secretly teach Handful the rudimentary skills to read (before the two are found out and the lessons come to a painful halt) and does her best to befriend the young girl who is her same age. Sarah spends the book searching for ways to make slave life better and to show her family, and later the nation, how wrong slavery is. Handful shows the reader the toil and trauma, the physical tragedies endured by slaves. She also shows us the love of family, the bond that ties those in tragedy, and the willingness of a spirit to live free. The book is extremely well-crafted, unbelievably well-told, inexplicably touching, and equally heart-wrenching.

From the writing perspective, it took a minute to understand the suggestion, but now I get it. It was also a nice read. Walk Two Moons takes young Sal on a journey with her grandparents to retrace her vanished mother's steps from Bybanks, Kentucky, to Lewiston, Idaho. Given that I grew up 60 miles from Lewiston, Idaho, I thought how odd and fun. And it was. Along the way, Sal explains to her grandparents an intertwined, underlying story of her friend Phoebe and her mother, who mysteriously also vanished. The circumstances are completely different for Phoebe, whose mother comes back with her eldest, adopted son in tow. On the other hand, Sal learns that her mother had passed away in Lewiston and was never coming home. The book is a good life lesson for the 8-12-year-olds, written with a soft touch on the grown-up side and much realism on Sal's side. Any youngster, or oldster, would enjoy it. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Sep 07, 2022","Sep 15, 2022","Sep 07, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/53496.Walk_Two_Moons

When 40-something Nell breaks off her engagement, she moves back to England to lick her wounds and take up with her old friends, only they have all moved on with partners and kiddos. Nell is broke, alone, childless, homeless, jobless, and near pennyless when she arrives at Edward’s house to interview to be his flat mate. Edward is married with children, his wife and children live in the country and he lives in London during the week, gone on the weekend. Perfect set up for Nell. When Nell finally gets a job, it is to write obituaries for a local paper. One of Nell’s first obits is of a late playwrite. Nell becomes near besties with the playwrites 80-something widow and the two have some fun experiences. Nell struggles with the remainder of her core friends as she is the only one without a family.

I was quite impressed by how the author could draw in so many quasi-main characters (11 all toll) and not lose me. That is true artistry. I have read another Backman book, and it was an over-the-top winner. Unfortunately, it may have set an unrealistic bar, leaving Anxious People reaching in vain.When a bank robber botches their first attempt at such, trying to rob a cashless bank, they run across the street, up the stairs, and into an open apartment in the middle of an open house. The robber, also unskilled at taking hostages, ends up with 8 of them: two married couples, one of whom was pregnant, an executive, a real estate agent, an elderly woman, and a man in a rabbit costume who was hired as an open house spoiler. Throughout the book, Backman gives snippets of backstory for the characters and the two policemen who try to solve several mysteries during the book, including those of their family dynamic. There are some endearing moments in the book when the least likely of the hostages end up consoling or befriending each other, and the book ends with a surprisingly sweet twist (or two) that leaves everyone in a happy and good place. I still could have taken or left the book with all of this going on. I actually had to work at finishing it, not because it was dreadful, but more because it felt lackluster. Again, this may be because I was so over the moon with expectations due to my previous Backman read.  ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Oct 02, 2022","Oct 12, 2022","Sep 05, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/53799686-anxious-people

As an avid cruiser, I completely related to every step of this book, with a son who lives in Juneau, Alaska and actually works with cruise lines as part of his job, I could really relate to that part of the book. Greta is a musician, a damn good one who, the week following her mother’s sudden passing, held a breakdown on stage that led to several months of not performing. She takes the cruise in the place of her mother, sharing space with her dad and two of their couple friends. While aboard ship, Greta meets Ben, a profession and author, who is separated from his wife. The two, of course, pair up and have some fun, but that is just a subplot, and I was glad for it. The meat of the story is the strained relationship between Greta and her father; she has always had her head in the clouds, according to him, and he wanted her to be more grounded and focused on stability. The two never really stop butting heads and there is a point where I felt like their struggle was getting lost in the weeds a bit. However, just as I was about to roll my eyes with too much unresolved parent-child drama, Ms. Smith brings the storyline back around to a manageable feel. The ending, without giving anything away, is predictably tidy, for the most part. I actually liked that not everything worked out - Ms. Smith kept it real.

The book is an incredible story about the Allbrights, Ernt, a Vietnam vet/POW who struggles with serious deep-rooted demons, Cora, who is unnaturally loved by Ernt to the point of obsession and to which she reciprocates, and their daughter, Leni, who at the age of 13 is thrown into the wilderness without running water, indoor facilities, electricity, and so on.

I can't say I understand the title as it relates to the book, but no matter, the book is fantastic, the cover beautiful, and the title, well, maybe I'm just daft.

The story is easy to follow as it is realistic and simple without unnecessary plot twists. But it is also complex, as is life, in the way it peels the layers away from each character until the reader sees the full picture of each person: The 16-year old runaway, the average suburban housewife, the pregnant alcoholic, and the thirty-year-old having an affair with a 67-year old. Nothing in this novel is an overreach, and in Ms. O'Neal's lovely way of crafting a story, the reader can find their place amongst the characters and identify with one or more of them in an almost personal way to where you wonder if Ms. O'Neal had been a fly on your wall at some time. This Place of Wonder will not solve world peace or cure any social issue, but it will make you think about family, and where people are in their lives, and how they came to be.

It's quick, witty, fun, brought me to tears, and is easy to read. The Guncle is the type of book I found myself reading slower as the pages lessened; I didn't want it to end. Steven Rowley weaves a clever tale about GUP, Gay Uncle Patrick, once on TV, still reasonably recognizable, who has escaped the lights and glam of LA to leave a somewhat reclusive life in Palm Springs. After the death of his best friend/sister-in-law, his brother requests Patrick to care for his 6 and 9-year-old while he attends rehab. Begrudgingly, due to fear of raising the children for 9-months, Patrick agrees and the hilarity begins. The Guncle is rife with easy banter between the 40-something Guncle and the highly inquisitive, mourning children, and while doing his best to assist the kiddos with their grief, Patrick learns his own lessons about navigating grief. The messages are clear throughout the book: Be who you are, let others be who they are, and do it all without judgment. Perhaps for me, The Guncle struck a chord because I hope for my son to have an opportunity to shine with his future nieces and nephews the way Patrick does for Maise and Grant.Read this.

I’m fairly certain this was required reading in my high school English class, but if so, I used CliffNotes to skate by - sorry Mrs. Elvin (although she probably knew).Okay, back to the Great Gatsby or rather, the Great Mr. F. Scott Fitzgerald. Wow, what a writer! His sentences, so verbose, so colorful, so full of adjectives. It’s interesting how current writers seem to do their best to choose one or two descriptive words, or better yet, one big one that many of us need to look up in Webster’s, and mock those who use more, easier to read words.

He narrates the ups and downs of society high-life that he touches the outskirts of by happenstance - he lives, for a short season, next to J. Gatsby. Nick tells us of the going ons of the Buchanans, Tom and Daisy; how Tom is seeing Mabel Wilson, who is married to the mechanic at the gas station, and how Daisy is in love with Gatsby, and of the parties - oh, the grand parties. Nick himself is with Jordan Baker, socialite and golf pro, as a means to fit in and pass the time with the likes of those in society.

THE FUTURE OF WOMEN AND THEIR RIGHTS DEPENDS ON KNOWING THE PAST.This is a great book, and the fact that it is available during our current time in history is also incredibly timely. Serena Burdick takes us on a fictional ride during the turn of the 19th Century with Luella, a headstrong fifteen-year-old, and Effie, her sickly younger sister, who adores Luella. The girls grow up in an affluent family in New York City during a time when women have no rights and, at the behest of a male (think father, husband, judge), can be ""sentenced"" to a reformatory known as a laundry house. These sentences ranged from about three years to indefinite. The transgressions for landing a female in a laundry house were anything from kissing a boy to disobeying the head male of the house (again, think father, husband, or brother). Luella runs away, and Effie, who thinks their father sent Luella to Mercy House as punishment for her bold behavior, gets herself checked into the laundry house to find Luella. We follow Effie's days of work, torcher, and wrongful imprisonment at Mercy House.Catholic Nuns ran the laundry houses, wherein they took in the wash of the wealthy in the community and pocketed the money. The girls sentenced to these places were often literally worked to death. Many were left there and forgotten; all were abused and abandoned. We learn about these laundry houses from Ms. Burdick. They began in Ireland and sprung up all over the United States, hundreds of them throughout the country, where thousands of women were sent for any number of transgressions. Ireland has recognized its past in this regard; the United States has not. As a result, these women have essentially gone into obscurity; they are The Girls with No Names.This book, released in 2020, touches on many issues that people in 2022 need to pay attention to, lest the past repeats itself.

The sisters are Isabelle, whose voice we hear, a famous photographer and professional one-night stander; Cecilia, Iz's twin who is wholly angry, mean, has an over-eating problem, is a superb kindergarten teacher, and is in the middle of a divorce; and Janie, an OCD best-selling crime novelist who invents twisted ways to kill her characters while she herself cannot leave her houseboat from fear of the world, and the people in it. The cast is rounded out by River, the stripper mom, Amelia Earhart (grandma has dementia), and Carl, the long-lost Dad who shows up thirty years later. The family is ripe for disaster, with sharp wit and lots of heartaches as they navigate who they are and how they came to be. Cecilia's daughters add more color and drama as if either is missing from the plot.When Momma needs surgery, the girls come together to take care of the family and revisit their past to move forward with their lives. The dialogue is raw and painful, authentic to any dysfunctional family. The characters scream at each other, call all the right names to hit every sore spot that only family knows, and are loyal to a fault when push comes to shove. While the girls grapple with how awful their upbringing was, and it was horrible, mind-blowing, jaw-dropping, yet, so real and believable, Henry thrives being a dog walker for the shelter, helper at Wednesday and Sunday mass with Father Mike, Bunko set up master for the senior citizens, and sample giver at his family's bakery. Henry knows everyone, the goofy teenagers at church, the scary ""knife-face"" man in the leather vest, the mayor, the dogs at the shelter, the kids on the corner. And to all, he throws out a heartfelt, ""Jesus loves you.""When Henry takes ill, the family learns what family means - and this is when your reader's heart will break. I am officially listing this book, Henry's Sisters, as one of my all-time favorite reads. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Apr 13, 2022","Apr 16, 2022","Apr 13, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6131767-henry-s-sisters

To this, exasperated, I would say, ""Is it good?"" and he would always answer, ""Why, yes. All books are good."" What my dad was trying to tell me was simple, don't judge a book by its cover (or backflap). I have once again become a voracious reader, listening and reading an average of two books per week as well as reading all day for my job. I have long since stopped reading backflaps or snippets from promoters, there's no time to cull through the one million plus titles published each year (true!). So, I just pick a book because it's next in line on a shelf, or in the queue of the Audible lineup, or I found it in a stack from the local thrift store. And, like my father, I am hard pressed to find a book where I don't learn something (even if it's meaningless), or don't enjoy some part of it. Books are good.That all being said, and back to the book at hand, Perennials - I had no idea when I picked it up that it was published by a Christian house. I likely wouldn't have taken it on had I known, I would have judge the book before I picked it up. To my good fortune, I didn't know this until after I had finished listening (I did audio for this book). What a wonderful, moral-rich, non-preachy, feel-good, tapped several of the big societal issues (adultery, death, divorce, pride, bullying, regret, work vs. family; you get the point), without ever once making me squirm with too much religious overtones, or want to run off to confess my improprieties. As a flower child at heart, I loved the continual nuances of people and growth compared to good soil and water, seasons, and blooms. This book was beautifully done.Without a foul word one, a raunchy or explicit scene moving beyond butterflies or hand holding, I was intrigued, captivated, and anxious to read more. I strongly recommend Perennials on a day when you need a lift, need to know you are not alone in your struggles, and don't want to hear morality shoved down your throat.

In IN MY USUAL STYLE - SPOILERS ABOUND (But it's a good , you should check it out.)Objects of My Affection is a fairly lighthearted, easy read. In a nutshell and because I can’t help myself: Girl is dumped, out of work, out of her home, and sharing a room with her girlfriend’s 4-year-old daughter. Lucy is desperate to start over. This all seems like a typical start to an airy novel until you reach the part of her new job. Meet sarcastic, once-famous-totally-eccentric-now-hoarder Marva. Oh, how I love this old gal's snark. At first, the reader wants to shake Marva for her rude, impetuous behavior, but as the story unfolds, and it does so beautifully, we see the wounded, insecure person even those we hold in higher esteem (age, notoriety, status) hide.As the book takes its familiar feeling twists the underlying story, the one that hit a home run for me, is the relationship between Lucy and her son; a 19-year-old addict who uses and abuses his mother, rinses, and repeats. We learn why she is essentially homeless, penniless, and heartbroken.Jill Smolinski’s depiction of this volatile, gut-wrenching mother-child experience will resonate with anyone who has ever had a lost or wandering child, one who makes you feel weak, insignificant, a failure as a parent. Throughout the latter half of the book, Lucy and her son hit on raw, emotional, and real-life events, feelings, and thoughts that occur when dealing with a situation such as addiction. As is to be expected, everything works out for all parties as we would hope – all tied up in a nice bow. I’m not necessarily an advocate or fan of that type of ending, but, in this case, with so much at stake (child’s life, mom and child relationship), as a reader, I needed it to end this way. Not sure I would have recovered if it hadn’t. The ending gives hope to those of us who have walked in Lucy’s shoes, either in the past, present or future. Well, done, Jill Smolinski – you brought to light the ugliness of parenting an addict without a slap in the face. Marva, our brash antagonist is the perfect balance to bring levity to this heavy situation. Your message was not lost on this reader from a personal perspective: Never give up on your child. From an outsider's perspective, what I hear you say, is: You have no idea what it's like, but it isn't easy, and it isn't pretty.I would highly recommend reading this, or gifting it to someone who doesn't understand your shoes if you are a parent navigating child addiction; it will subtly get their attention....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 16, 2022","Mar 20, 2022","Mar 16, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13139565-objects-of-my-affection

But occasionally, a book is so well-written, so true to form, of prose and content, and believability that I not only enjoy the characters, I know them. I knew Ove. I loved Ove. I hurt for Ove. I laughed and cried and hoped for Ove. Ove (pronounced oova) is a man of 59 who sees the world in black and white. A true right vs. wrong, BMW vs. Saab kind of man, turned out from his job through forced retirement shortly after his wife, Sonja, passed. Without Sonja to care for and a job to do, Ove fails to see any reason to continue with life. And if it weren't for the meddling, needy new family who moved in down the road, comprised of a ""non-caucasian"" woman (Ove isn't racist, he's blunt, factual, matter-of-fact, and from Ove's perspective, a woman from Iran is in fact, not caucasian. That isn't a matter of being racist, it's simply the way it is), her ""incapable husband"" (again, from Ove's perspective, Patrick, who can't do so much as back up a bloody trailer without hitting Ove's mailbox, is not a capable person) and ""curious"" children (curious not only because they ask too many questions, but because they are strange little creatures to a man who never had children), Ove may have succeeded in dying. But things happen, plans change, tomorrow may be better timing.Ove, who insists on following the rules (no bikes parked outside the bike shed because the sign says so; no driving in the residential square because, again, there is a sign posted that says otherwise), tries desperately to join his wife in the afterlife, promising her he will do so while on his daily visits with her. Still, through whatever reasons, divine intervention, nosey neighbors, or pure luck, the non-caucasian woman and her incapable, curious family, along with a group of unlikely people which include an orphaned man in the house next to Ove's, the woman and her infirm husband who once was Ove's friend until the man purchased a BMW, a homeless, ""bent"" young man, his stand-on-ceremony father, and the bent young man's best friend who is too incompetent to change a bike tire, and a mangy cat with only one ear, half a tail, and patches of missing fur intervene. Showing Ove in strange, uncomplicated, and unplanned ways, Ove is still relevant and needed.Without exception, a Man Called Ove is one of my new favorite reads.

But, I should note, I tend to gravitate to a unique story or the way one uniquely tells a tale; Lillian Boxfish Takes a Walk fills both these requirements for me. I was more than surprised to learn that author Kathleen Rooney was neither old by any stretch, thirty-something young, nor she did write this novel based on her own grandmother's or any other elderly female's perspective within Ms. Rooney's life; she just made it up. Brava!It's New Year's Eve, and Ms. Boxfish takes a walk, in the literal sense of the word. That's it. But she narrates as she travels through New York City, and we learn snippets of her life; where she worked, who she loved, her child, her ups, and her most significant downs. As the once most highly paid advertising female, Ms. Boxfish is quick, witty, well-mannered, and biting; my kind of gal. During her walk, she also tells of the people she encounters along the way, a security guard, a store clerk, a chauffeur, three would-be muggers, and each adds to her story as she seemingly adds to theirs. It's simply delightful.

Sounds quite cut and dried until it is learned that moments before Phelan's swan dive, he pulls out a holographic will, scrawled in his hand, and signs it, nullifying all other wills.

In the afterward, Ms. Morrison pens that she doesn't want the reader to pity Pecola, but it's hard not to. As a mother, as a person who always found fault in her appearance, I read the book with a mixture of sadness, empathy, pity, and guilt (my eyes are not blue, but my skin is white). The book was not to derive my guilt but to enlighten me, I'm sure, which it did - I felt deeply for Pecola's dream to be what she could never; in her case, a girl with blue eyes. Ms. Morrison does an exceptional job at causing the reader to see their innocuous fortune through the eyes of those who are told they are not as blessed. I got lost a couple of times as the book wandered down a path to call out an example or point and then felt jolted back when the scene would shift, and I again understood where I was and with whom I was interacting as the reader.

Mr. Hosokawa, however, is there only to hear the operatic voice of Roxane Coss, the famous soprano.

It is beautifully written, using wonderfully visual, flowery words and phrasing, the characters are believable, likable, and endearing, and the story is good - and that's where it fell apart for me; the story was too good. Maybe it's just me, perhaps the older I get, the more cynical I become, or maybe, just maybe, my life is a unicorn, and all the pieces don't fall into a lovely, complete picture at the end of the day and I can't relate to such stories. The Language of Sycamores is a story of two sisters, one who partly chose and partly did not choose a career over family, the other who chose family. Through life circumstances (one sister loses her job and has a second cancer scare), the girls come back together, join up to help care for a neighbor girl who lives in what we can guess is a bad situation, and reunite their long-lost distant family. The jobless sister becomes involved in a summer children's program and gains a job with the organization. She doesn't have cancer, the neighbor girl presumably has a good rest of her life with the two sisters and their families, and everyone lives happily ever after. Throw in a preachy undercurrent that doesn't entirely develop until the last few pages, and all boxes get checked.Again, a nice story, nothing wrong with it, just so unrealistic to my understanding of the world it was difficult for me to lose myself in its pages.

I have heard/seen/know, that this book is coming out as a movie soon; I’m not big on reading a book after watching a movie and am generally disappointed by movies, so I clambered to read this before I got sucked in by the big screen hype. So glad I did.Without giving too much away, this is a love story, no big surprise there, but it is a bit unusual in that it spans several decades. Set in an era where women had no voice and were looked upon as empty-headed, judged for their beauty, grace, and ability to host a party, Jennifer Stirling is drowning in her life until she meets Boot, an arrogant, pretentious foreign correspondent who does not hold his tongue in front of upper society; Jennifer's world.Predictably, the two fall for each other and, predictably, cannot be together. In a time where communication is the written word, letters are written back and forth, beautifully crafted words of longing and hope, desperation and sadness sent back and forth.As with any good love story, there are insurmountable obstacles and near misses to the couple's happiness and the story ‘almost’ doesn’t end happily ever after. [People, it's a romance novel, it's required to end happily ever after; really.] There is an endearing underlying subplot set in the early 2000s wherein a budding journalist stumbles upon Jennifer and Boot's love letters and in order to save her career and quell her own curiosity, she hunts down the mysterious Jennifer and Boot, forty-years later. Oh, and of course she finds what presumably will be her happily ever after in doing so. It wouldn't be a good love story without this!As fun as the book is, I’d rather discuss the writing style of Ms. Moyes. In today’s world of fast-paced, quick to press, speed over excellence, it is refreshing to read a well-crafted, grammatically correct, highbrow novel. One that is sexy without smut, hard-hitting without foul language, and intelligent without overreach. If you are looking for an entertaining, yes, love story, that you could actually wrap your head around and fall into - The Last Letter from Your Lover is the ticket.

A book about privilege, about loss (due to events that happened in youth), about holding people accountable, about finding the strength to move on even if it takes decades to make the first step toward that, about one man's possible inability to move beyond and another's seemingly unwillingness to accept responsibility, the, it was so long ago and I'm not that person anymore mentality.That Summer is a sad, easy written (not an in-your-face slap) where the reader is sucked in by the lazy settings, the commonality of the lives until it culminates into one big sad mess of reality.While That Summer is obviously written more for the female audience, a similar book written for the male perspective could serve future generations well. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Aug 20, 2021","Sep 07, 2021","Aug 20, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55467800-that-summer

The Artist’s Way is an easy read This 1992 book feels like it may have been a stepping off point for the 2006 runaway hit The Secret; I enjoyed both. The Artist’s Way is an easy read on a complex topic - artist’s block. Ms. Cameron attaches a type of 12-step recovery program, if you will, to overcoming a block and terms the movement past recovery as the recovering artist. Cheeky, but effective. Following each of the quick twelve steps are not as easy as the reading itself, exercises. These are designed to help the artist jump start back into their art. Of note, and I agree with the author, she defines art as dancing, writing poetry, singing, sculpting, writing a book, a play, a sonnet, painting, etc. You get the idea.Don’t be turned off by the “spiritual path to higher creativity” in the book’s title. Yes, Ms. Cameron uses the word god, but also explains that god can be any form of higher power beyond self that we, the reader would like it to be. I like this. I like it because the book didn’t try to pound religion; it doesn’t refer or speak to religion at all. It simply states that by looking and trusting in something beyond self you can open yourself up to creativity.I would recommend the book to those who have and have yet to experience an artist block. The book will not fix the block, will not wave a magic wand for you, and may do nothing if you are unwilling to get out of your own way.

I would recommend this book, Barbara O'Neal has done a good job and has a good read here. SPOILER ALERT - or maybe this is more of a personal reveal - I think Ms. O'Neal was a fly on the wall regarding my lost sibling. A subject few, if any in my circle know about even decades after the fact, but one that shaped my life as a young adult - the effects of a missing sibling presumed to be dead. Unlike the protagonist, Kit, and while I appreciate this book was not intended to be a true account or hard-hitting for that matter, learning the sibling you thought for years dead is not only alive and thriving, but had conveniently just decided to hide from their grieving family for years, is far more a punch in the gut and unfathomable than in this softball pitch. That harsh statement aside, Ms. O'Neal broached the subject superbly and gave this reader much to think about in her real life. If you read this book and have experienced this type of personal ""loss,"" be prepared to have far more questions than answers and to be left with a pit in your stomach.

For reasons I am unsure, the book was not at all what I expected, but it didn’t fail me. It is likely my personal health issues that cause any falter I have with the book, not the book itself. I would recommend this title, you won’t cry, it’s not sad in that way, but you will be filled with numerous emotions as you travel through this woman’s and her child’s life after loss, the fact that it centers around food and Sicily is an added a bonus. I appreciate most the raw emotion Ms. Locke expresses about being a wife, a mother, a daughter, an unaccepted daughter-in-law. She is honest and forthright - no one gets a pass, but she is not degrading. The fact that the story comes together and is not fiction, is the perfect ending. ...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,"Mar 14, 2021","Mar 20, 2021","Mar 18, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/42202117-from-scratch

I read the book on a friend’s suggestion; I am glad I did. The Storyteller is an in-depth account of surviving, overcoming hate, and learning when forgiveness is yours to give. The story was intriguing and held my attention, but, and I know I’m in the minority here, there was sometimes so much detail I found my mind wandering - how is that a thing?! I wonder if my inattention was because the writing dredged up too much emotion in me...This is not a negative to Ms. Picoult or her writing, I wish I could write this intensely, but a comment to my own ADD. Reader beware, this book will suck you in but if you need a super fast-pace, or if connecting to your feelings is uncomfortable, you may find yourself wishing for less detail.

Written from the perspective of Death, as a being, who walks with people, sees everything, and narrates the story. A truly unique take on WW2 as Death stalks Liesel, Papa, Mama, Max, and Rudy; one is a foster child who comes to love and be loved by new parents, one is a Jew in hiding and one is a best friend. This book is moving in that it shows a side of the Germans not often seen in the depiction of WW2 stories; that they too struggled with the treatment of their fellow humans. That they too suffered great loss, heartache, and devastation.The author is extremely descriptive, using colorful ways to explain ordinary events by painting vivid word pictures. Not an easy read as the author expects his reader to participate in the art of language, with all its nuances and trickery. Personally, I found that as enjoyable as the story. I will admit this was the second time I picked up the book; the first time I was unsuccessful in finishing it. This time, I was sad that it was over. What changed?

I was at first concerned how such a subject matter could be conveyed with any strength in MG, without language, violence or sex (Not that sex is needed in this regard, but it is a no-no for MG writing). JOHN BOYNE did a remarkable job of bringing the travesty of the subject into full and clear view without the use of any language or violence (sex wasn’t even on the table for the book).

That being said, I find that sequels, even ones that are not necessarily typical, such as this one, often fall flat compared to the first in the series. Cilka’s Journey would fall into that category.The book was very good, very well-written, about a subject I can never get enough of; WW2, and more specifically, life in and around the encampments of that time - such as Cilka’s Journey. Cilka spent three years in Auschwitz (true story) where she met the tattooist written about in that book. She then was committed to a Siberian prison for fifteen years for war crimes ‘she’ committed as a prisoner in Auschwitz - the girl was raped by the leaders of the camp for her entire term and because she survived, it was misconstrued that she aided the Nazis. Cilka’s Journey was written from conversations had with the tattooist, his recollections of the stories, and those told to the author by others in the camps with Cilka, others who were her neighbors before and after her time in Russia. While I have no reason not to believe everything written, it felt a bit contrived, perhaps showing Cilka as too good, too innocent, too something - perhaps not intense enough given the multiple years, over a dozen, spent imprisoned. Perhaps if I would have read this book first it would have felt more genuine. I still give this a 5-star rating as it was wonderful, beautifully written, and deserves to be read.

Such fun, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. Filled with extraordinary visual pictures about a time and people where appearances mattered more than even money. Set in Savannah, a reporter follows the life of social elite, antique dealer, Jim Williams for the shooting death of male prostitute Danny Hansford. If that’s not enough entertainment, through in the eccentric Prentiss Crowe, transgender hottie, The Lady Chablis, and throw in lavish parties at Mercer House and how could this book be anything other than a runaway - and it is.I was surprised to learn this was Mr. Berendt’s first novel, I believe it sold something like twenty-five million copies and has been turned into a star-studded movie. Not terribly faced paced, and laced with a bunch of hoity-toity expressions and flowery words that sometimes leaves the reader feeling like a dictionary on standby isn’t a bad idea, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil is worth the time.

By this I mean his stories literally haunt me, taking me to places in my mind where I find it difficult to manage and let the memories go; I cannot read his books. But his writing. Mr. King is simply the master and occasionally I will dip my toe into his water and what a pleasure it is. The way he describes a scene, a smell, a tree for that matter. The man's writing is genius. That being said, I took a chance, having a long drive from Idaho to Colorado, and listened to this book. In a word (or maybe two or three or more): Wow. Amazing. Incredible. And yes, unforgettable.The Outsider is not the shocking horror that smacks one in the face with gore, not that I think that is the author's standard way, but it eases under one's skin and psyche, playing and teasing with the mind. Not fantastical in a way that is too out of reach, the Outsider toys with the idea that there are shapeshifters among us, persons, or rather beings, that slip into one's body, taking them over from the inside to do their bidding while their outside appearance remains the same. Oh, it was fun to read this book. The Outsider will leave you thinking, wondering, and wishing for more. I believe there is a movie, perhaps a series, but if you are a reader and willing to open your mind to a bit of psychological mystery about the spirituality of one's inner self - you must read The Outsider....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Sep 17, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36124936-the-outsider
