I was wrong. But the dream died hard. I didn't really think about settling down somewhere out there, more like a Star Trek existence. Exploring where no ONE had gone before. That dream had kind of died down, but then we went to the moon!! Over 50 years ago and we haven't been back.... as time went on, I forgot my dream. And really good science fiction, e.g. The Expanse had enough detail that it seemed like a lot of questions and problems had been addressed (or would have been in 200-400 years into the future) which helped sort of keep the dream alive. Not that I would be going - I aged out of the possibility long ago - but I still enjoyed thinking about it. But that's not the same as trying to work it out realistically. Enter the Weinersmiths.

I have come to regard the MCU as a colossal bore. Mad Max - both Road Warrior and Fury Road are just about 100% action movies. But. I think both are masterpieces. In both, I think I held my breath for two hours. When the Road Warrior came out (40 years ago!!) I tried to get some of my friends to see the movie because I thought it was one of the best ""see what happens when you destroy everything, humans"" pieces of propaganda I'd ever seen. Here's your humanity - little glory, almost all guts - I'd never seen anything to top Road Warrior. Then Miller comes out with Fury Road. My God.I truly have trouble believing that no one died making that movie. This book does a great job of explaining how. Such meticulous planning, such devotion - by cast, crew, craftspeople that make so much out of old junk - junk that would have survived Armageddon. And then there's George Miller. Twenty five years in the making, fighting the movie suits and the Namib desert (not sure which was worse), George wouldn't let go.I couldn't put the book down. And couldn't wait to watch the movie again - which I did, even though I'm sure I had seen it at least three times before. I even bought the movie - (BTW, I am a notorious cheapskate about buying movies, but I had to in this case). Having read this book, I was so much more aware of the details of the story and was brought to tears several times watching the movie.

A bit complicated, but like a good interlocking puzzle. Several stories are told and woven together, resulting in a magical sort of tapestry. And when you have finished it and see the whole work, it is astonishing.I cannot imagine how the author conceived of this ""whole"". And then he executed it.

More damage and heroic attempts at preservation bring a tattered version of it to the 20th century, where the next set of stories picks up until they are brought together as the completed story.Probably not a good candidate as an audiobook standalone.

It made me so sad thinking about where we are today.However, aside from that emotional reaction, I have to say it isn't a very good book.

It is a very thorough recitation of a lot of individual kindnesses that were remarkable, but it made for tedious reading.

Although I was (vaguely) aware of Apollo 8, I had almost no memory of the particulars, nor of its importance to the feasibility of the Apollo 11 mission. This book is very detailed (without losing the reader) - about the men and their families, the family that NASA was for the Apollo program, and the particular genius of using the other events of 1968 to show how much we (America) needed a win. Not just in the space program, but even more so the other, more shattering events. I turned 21 in 1968, and I can attest to how difficult a year it was. The Vietnam War was in full bloom (the TET ""offensive"" started the year off with many American soldiers' deaths), the USS Pueblo was captured by North Korea, Martin Luther King was assassinated in April, RFK in June, rioting was happening in all our major cities, and the Democratic Party Convention in Chicago showed police beating the shit out of college students. It felt like the country was on fire because it was.Yet, somehow in all of this, three dedicated and competent men (and yes, women were out of the question in those days) went about their business and demonstrated that we could get to the moon AND COME BACK. Even though no one stepped on the moon until July 1969, after Apollo 8 it wasn't whether it could be done, it was a matter of when. Pretty quickly, as it turned out....This book is a feat of reporting, and I am so glad I read it. It just makes me wonder how much else I have missed in all of my turns around the sun.Sadly, a cursory googling does not provide any indication of the enormous contribution that Apollo 8 made in opening the door to the lunar landing. This book remedies that.And, after all, America ended 1968 on a high note because of Borman, Lovell, and Anders and their quiet heroics. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"May 17, 2022","May 17, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35414997-rocket-men

Or sort of this, but the author avoids going down any common pathways. He confounded me.The first part of the book is titled, appropriately, Nostalgia. It is a lovely look back by the author when he was seated behind his grandfather plowing fields on his family farm. Just the first few pages thrilled me. The birds, the dirt, the smells, the five year old's perspective. This section was just pure joy.The second and third parts were also spectacular, but didn't hit me quite as emotionally. (Nothing like nostalgia to get the emoting glands revved up.) But they did trip the guilt switches. He kept surprising me - I thought he was on Path A - damn corporate agriculture, which he is, but he understands that's too simplistic; or then, Path B - if we just farmed like in olden days, everything would be wonderful; that is also too simplistic.Rebanks knows that neither Path A or B will work. He believes that we have to keep experimenting to find the right kind of balances. And he doesn't believe either path is sustainable. He just kept surprising me.Rather then continue babbling, my short comment would be READ THIS BOOK.A few quotations just to tease you:1. ""Farming for nature is economic suicide.""2. ""Cheap food is unsustainable."" (He is not the first to say such a thing.)3. ""There is a very thin line between idealism and bullshit.""4. ""Technically, the best thing we could do for nature in most landscapes is to not be there at all.""Well, that doesn't do justice either.

It fell off a bit at the end, but it was still good. The early part of the book was a terrific version of the ""geography is destiny"" lecture.Beginning with an extended trip with his parents in 1962, and ending with a trip by himself in 2016, Kaplan entertainingly brings you along for the ride. In 1962, the trip was limited to the eastern United States, and involved visiting many presidential homes - Buchanan, Jefferson, and of course, Lincoln - with an eye toward how each fit into American expansion. The history lessons imparted to Kaplan by his father were still very alive for him and he makes them so for the reader.Toward the end of the book, I think maybe Kaplan was pushing it to make his deadline. But he takes you with him as he visits diners, BBQ joints, regional fast food eateries, all with an eavesdropping ear for his fellow diners as he makes his way across the Great Basin and ends in San Diego. He makes quite a point of how little conversation outside of the Boston-NY-Washington corridor is about politics.

And of course, these women who were expected to become baby making machines were often subject to conditions that cruelly damage the chances of a healthy pregnancy - poverty, physical and mental abuse, and the dietary and housing shortcomings that come with those conditions.However, it is a glorious read.

Reads a lot like a novel, but it is written as a memoir/tribute to a mother. A mother who was born into an Orthodox Jewish immigrant family - a cold and unloving family except for her own mother, who was treated very badly by her itinerant rabbi husband and abandoned by her own family. That this woman ended up having 12 children with two wonderful and loving husbands and pushed all of her children to go to college, many of them to postgraduate and professional school, is a testament in and of itself. When her first husband died, she was only 37 and pregnant with her eighth child (the author, James McBride). In a few years, she had remarried and had four more children with her second husband. She may have lost her sanity at times, but her energy and drive didn't leave her time to dwell on her difficulties. In fact, she adopted Christianity and with her first husband founded a church in Red Hook (infamous projects in NYC), the New Brown Memorial Baptist Church - first in their apartment, later in its own building, that is still standing. Religion was very important in her life.There is a lot in the book about the confusion/difficulty of growing up biracial, especially when your mother refuses to acknowledge such a concept. McBride wrote this book as a way to find out about his own heritage, and tapped into an incredibly rich vein that is his own mother's story.I read The Good Lord Bird a few years ago, and it was, and is, one of my very favorite books. Reading this book was a completely different experience - not surprising, since they are very different stories - but a good experience, nonetheless.In these days of coronavirus and Black Lives Matter, it was also a bit jarring to read, but it throws a light on humanity that is ultimately affirming and generous.

Take a little science bending (a la Michael Crichton), mix with nonstop action (Dan Brown, maybe?), and throw everyone in a fast-moving story that has formidable assassins, science-y weapons, government treachery, etc etc. I had more trouble than usual with the defects of Rollins' writing - thin characters, just-in-time escapes and rescues, wanton destruction of treasures (in this one, he destroys the papal summer home; my least favorite was when he destroyed the Roman Coliseum in an earlier novel), ridiculous coincidences, etc. But, I have to admit he can write a page-turner. In this one, our happy protagonists are following Odysseus's path home, but via the gates of Hell.

It is a first novel, and the plot was interesting, but the mystery was a bit obscure and the writing was, well, not very good. I know that I decided to read it because it was situated in Alaska, which is always a draw for me. The author uses a device that usually appeals to me - embedding foreign words and including a glossary. However, there aren't a lot of words, and since it is based on a real native language which bears no relationship to English-Germanic languages, it seems more like Welsh (as in, VERY limited vowels) than anything else. In other words, pretty resistant to incorporating into a narrative without bringing the whole thing to a halt while you look up the word for the 112th time. (There are only a handful of words.)

I knew that James Taylor had issues with his mental health and that it “ran” in his family, but I didn’t have any real understanding of what that meant. It is a tragic story, especially since it was a history that was multigenerational. This only covers his early years until he was 21 or 22. While some of this story is painful to listen to, Taylor has his guitar and uses it to smooth out the transitions. Sometimes he just strums a few chords, sometimes song fragments, sometimes the whole song.

It deals very realistically with what the aging process takes from us and what makes life worth living. The specifics of the story are what they are (cancer-ridden woman but with her mental faculties intact and her husband with his physical ability intact, but his mind has lost a lot of ground and has the potential to lead to very dangerous situations), but generic enough to resonate with most of us.It is both an adventure story (leaving behind all the ""helpers"" - kids, doctors) and a love story at the same time of a couple who have spent some sixty years together and want live (and perhaps die) on their own terms.

First, this book needed an editor, just to make the reading of it less work. Chapters come and go with no particular ""chunking"" of the book. Characters are introduced and not explored at all. Some characters seem to have two dimensions by the end, but most are just names on the page. Protagonists and antagonists need SOME development - this is an all verbs and nouns book. (And I don't always object to that, but this was too much of it.)Many interesting sub-plots are developed (the overarching plot is - ""Oh my god, we're going to die"") and the particular sub-plots were interesting, but not particularly well developed.I read to the end, and am sorry I did. My particular frustration is that this teased an early Jim Rollins type writer, but while Rollins has the same problems with character development, he has a pretty tightly wound series of actions that are absolute page turners. And Rollins' ""science"" is much more rooted in actual science - he does the same thing Michael Crichton does - takes real science and adds a twist and rolls from there. This author just goes wild with multiple (maybe 6 or 7) science adjacent facts and jumps off of all of them.I think this author has promise - he just needs some discipline and probably an editor. Maybe he works that out, because lots of people like his stuff, and it doesn't surprise me. But for me, the promise of the novel was ultimately not realized. So.

No one writes about being in, or surviving in, the wilderness/outdoors better than Peter Heller. I also enjoyed the two main characters - best friends on a dream canoeing trip in the Canadian wilderness. Heller did a very good job of making you care a lot about them. And the trials and tribulations they endure - a massive out-of-control wildfire, a couple of drunk semi-Deliverance characters (in fairness, only one of them really is), and a couple that they hear quarreling in the fog early in their journey. And a day or two later, the man shows up alone, claiming his wife disappeared. At that point, the book kicks into high gear. What had been a nice, meandering river trip turns into a flat out race to outrun and evade the various terrors. And I really can't say more than that.One quibble - as much as I like his outdoorsy writing, there was a bit too much about the fishing gear - description of the various flies, rods, weights - for me, but I bet if you are into fishing you would love that stuff.

Even when he comes up a little short, I still love his writing. His characters and their interactions always ring true to me. His best writing usually has a fair amount of pathos mixed in with some slap-stick humor. 'Chances Are' is heavy on the self doubt and self loathing but too light on the humor. Still, as he always does, he drops me into my past - in this instance December 1, 1969 when every young man (and anyone who cared about them) was glued to the TV set, watching the lottery numbers being drawn for the draft. As summed up by a critic of the Vietnam War:""December 1, 1969: A Date Which Will Live in Irony. This was the date of the first Vietnam Draft Lottery, the day the phrase “to win the lottery” became, not a prize, but a death sentence.""And that's how it felt. And Richard Russo brings it all back by opening his story with three friends watching TV. These friends were close (enough) to graduation from college to feel the heat of the draft board - the same draft board that had granted them deferments until their graduation dates. (Note: the lottery numbers ran from 1 to 365, one for each day of the year. Your lottery number was randomly assigned to each day of the year, so your birthday date determined your fate. The higher the number, the better. Draft numbers 1-195 ended up being called in that first year.) Of course Russo creates drama just by assigning the three protagonists very different draft numbers: 9, 189, and 322. And all the air goes out of the room.So. That was the prologue. We now skip forward to a reunion, when these three friends are no longer young men but forty-four years older, meeting on Martha's Vineyard, commiserating over their lives and wondering where Jacy went. Jacy, the girl they were all in love with. Enter the mystery. And a lot of self introspection. I got very impatient with these guys at times. But I liked spending time with them, nonetheless, and finding out what they had been doing for all of these years. And Russo writes well enough that I enjoyed the time spent....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Sep 12, 2019","Sep 14, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/44037144-chances-are

Sometimes I really like it, sometimes I really get bored, sometimes both in the same work. But this parGenerally, I find Gaiman's work wildly uneven. Sometimes I really like it, sometimes I really get bored, sometimes both in the same work. But this particular ""novel"" (there is sort of a structure of a novel, i.e. beginning, middle-ish, and end) very much got under my skin. Wildly inventive and endearing characters - many of whom had no business being endearing (Chernobog, do you hear me?). The premise is that there is about to be a war between the old gods and the new gods. The old gods came to America with immigrants, who brought their folklore/gods (e.g. Irish leprechauns, Odin, Jinns) with them. But over time, these gods faded in the memories of the descendants of those who brought them to America and new gods have replaced them - such as technology and media. The old gods, led by Mr. Wednesday (Odin) have decided to fight back. This premise is either very appealing or silly as hell depending on your ability to suspend disbelief. I had purchased the book many years ago, but had not gotten around to reading it. When Starz announced that it was bringing it to the small screen, I decided to read it. I only got through the first third of the book before the first season aired, but luckily, it was fairly congruent with some notable exceptions. For instance, I like the character of Mad Sweeney in the book, but I love him in the TV show - evidently the showrunners did too, because he got a lot more coverage than in the book. As notices came around that Season 2 was coming up, I decided to finish the book. I don't know if this is the best way to absorb content, but it sure worked for me.I know this isn't a TV  platform, but Starz went all out for this series. The casting is just fabulous: Ian McShane for Mr. Wednesday, Ricky Whittle for Shadow Moon, Pablo Schrieber for Mad Sweeney, Orlando Jones as Mr. Nancy, and on and on. The lesser known actors have been a revelation to me - I am scouring IMBD to find content with some of them.So I hope others get as much out of this as I did. Part of the secret for me was to not rush, and sit awhile with the stories - many of which are wonderful novellas in their own right....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Mar 22, 2019","Mar 27, 2019",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/349347.American_Gods

While it is painful to remember just how awful previous historical periods were, he also reminds us that we climbed out of those low valleys. And although his overall construction is one of two steps forward, one step back, he does remind us that the overall trajectory over time is that we have improved. I generally accepted his thesis, with one big caveat. The most comparable disruptors and leaders of our downward trends in the past century were Huey Long and Joe McCarthy. We've never really had that in a president before, so I'm not sure how to project how low the valley will get, and if we can get out of it in a generation, or if the destabilization of the world order will have to be measured as more like three steps backward, two steps forward before the course correction begins to restore the balance toward evening out and then ultimately the upward trend restores itself.That said, I gained an appreciation of Lyndon Johnson and Andrew Jackson I had not had before. Reading the section ""Have You No Sense of Decency?"" made me weep. Having lived my most formative years in the 1960's, it was stunning to remember how low we were, and how we soared by the end of that decade.A remarkable book....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Oct 03, 2018","Oct 03, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/38385947-the-soul-of-america

First of all, I hate books that end with basically a ""to be continued"" and in particular in this case. Cork O'Connor has been constantly presented as a man who has (over and over and over) put himself and his family in danger in pursuit of his notion of justice. I don't fault him because his sense of justice is written in such a way as to compel the reader to share that same sense of justice. Further, I can imagine Cork cutting and running in order to keep his family safe, but I have two problems with the way he does it here - first of all, the creeps who are after him are said to be after his family also so if he runs, who will protect them; secondly, leaving without letting his family know anything seems very wrong to me and inconsistent with the pig-headed Cork that I have come to know.OK, so I don't like ""to be continued"" as a general rule. My larger issue:Krueger writes about the natural world in a way that is wonderful. I am often transported to his North Woods by his prose. Example: thanks to William's  on Goodreads, I could cut and paste this pretty easily... ""He could have told her. How the Canadian Shield, the stone mass that underlay everything there and broke through the thin topsoil in jagged outcroppings, was the oldest exposed rock on earth. How the glaciers two miles thick had crept across this land over the centuries, scraping everything down to that obdurate rock and leaving, as they receded, lakes as numerous and glittering as the stars in the night sky. How the land was still lifting itself up, released from the weight of that continent of ice, rebounding, a living thing unimaginably patient and enduring.""That is writing to die for. However, his character development often frustrates me. His sexism frustrates me (I am hanging on because this book is somewhat dated [2005]; the ongoing joke about Dina's push-up bra made me want to throw the book across the room (well, I was reading on a iPad and I'm not very likely to throw it across the room...). I have never found his kids very convincing. Or his wife. The Anishinaabe, however, he does wonderfully. Maybe they don't feel that way, but I find Kreuger's depiction of them to be masterful. He conveys a real reverence and depth of understanding that you don't often find (Tony Hillerman's Navajo are even better, but that is a VERY high bar).I picked these up because I was truly impressed with his Ordinary Grace (2013). I have been hoping that as these books (O'Connor) progressed, I would see his development as a writer begin to match that standard. So far, it has been very mixed. I'm beginning to believe that the more his true heart is in something, the more compelling the prose. But at this juncture, it almost seems that two different writers are at work here - the natural world and the Native Americans are written by someone with exquisite prose; his characters and their relationships, not so much....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Sep 24, 2018","Sep 24, 2018",,Audiobook,view (with text),/book/show/785395.Mercy_Falls

Not rainbows and ponies, but Cudjo considered his owner to be a fair man (as these things go) and the far greater trauma was inflicted by the rival tribe in Africa that captured him and sold him to slave traders, not his owner in America.

Very inventive and brought out nicely an artistic appreciation of mathematics/physics.

I forget that sometimes, and try to rush things along. And then I remember and go back and take my time with eRusso's writing is meant to be savored. I forget that sometimes, and try to rush things along. And then I remember and go back and take my time with each word and phrase and I am moved. As I was making my way through this collection of stories, some short, some not-so-short, I was becoming overwhelmed with the morose and beleaguered sensibility that Russo's work is often steeped in. And then I remembered.... ""slow down, you move too fast."" While these stories are not generally imbued with the slapstick observational humor I so adore in his writing (and which serves to leaven the woebegotten nature of some of his observations), they are full of wistfulness. And they are lovely gems. But if you read them, slower is better. Savor. And, of course, the last story made me weep. As your guitar gently does....or young boys and baseball. A few comments on each, with some lengthy quotes: 1. The Whore's Child - an ancient nun joins a creative writing class, and pretends she is writing fiction. Russo's introduction to the story, humor and despair paired together: ""Sister Ursula belonged to an all but extinct order of Belgian nuns who conducted what little spiritual business remained to them in a decrepit old house purchased by the diocese seemingly because it was unlikely to outlast them."" 2. Monhegan Light - Many years after his wife's death, Martin sees her through the eyes of her former lover, and finally understands how much he squandered. But first, a slice of that wicked observational humor regarding his wife's sister, whom he loathes: ""Of all the things that Joyce's sort of woman said about men, Martin disliked the he-just-doesn't-get-it riff most of all. For one thing it presupposed there was something to get, usually something obvious, something you'd have to be blind not to see. And of course the reason you couldn't see it -- as women were happy to explain -- was that you had a dick, as if that poor, maligned appendage were constantly in a man's line of sight, blocking his view of what women, who were not similarly encumbered, wanted him to take notice of, something subtle or delicate or beautiful, at least to their way of thinking. If you didn't agree that it was subtle or delicate or beautiful, it was because you had a dick. You just didn't get it."" 3. The Farther You Go - A man finally realizes the true depth of his wife's understanding of him. A strange, but ultimately beautiful, trip. Literally.4. Joy Ride - The most depressing of the lot. A child's first person experience with his parents' dysfunctional relationship.  5. Buoyancy - A sad, confused tale of a long and passionless marriage that ends with sunshine and unicorns. And you are made happy. But only after a lot of confusion and sadness.6. Poison - if you have read much of Russo, you probably know about his rage at the poisoning of the rivers and streams in his home town by a chemical company with the usual corporate greed. While all of Russo's writing never seems too far from his own experiences, this one is particularly and sadly close to the bone. The poison of the title is both for the actual poisoning of the town he grew up in, and the poisoning of his relationship with a boyhood friend who is also a writer, whose rage exceeds his own. I suspect Russo is both characters....7. The Mysteries of Linwood Hart - Ten-year old Linwood Hart, who has been described by school personnel as ""possessing an active interior life"", which as all who have been trained in edu-speak, correctly translate as ""he doesn't pay attention."" His father is a jerk (""Slick"" is his nick name), but sadly, his mother can't quit him. A lengthy passage, but one that puts you into Linwood's first person, and one, I have to admit, I greatly identified with... Someone asks him, what do you think you are? Special?""Lin understood that this was a rhetorical question whose answer was supposed to be ""No,"" even though most of the time, he thought it might be ""yes."" It was hard to imagine that all of his personal thoughts had already been thought. When he lay on his stomach in the grass and watched an ant climb up one side of a blade and then down the other, his truest sense of things was that in the world's long history, no one had ever witnessed this exact event, and he couldn't help feeling special to have done so. Why shouldn't his thoughts be special, too? What if he was right to think them, even if no one else had?For instance, why shouldn't inanimate objects be capable of desire? Take leaves. They wanted to dance, didn't they? He understood that it was caused by wind, of course, but this didn't explain why they didn't all get up and dance with each new gust, instead of just certain ones. Leaf A would rise and do its jig while Leaf B, right next to it, wouldn't even stir. The ones dancing in this gust might rest during the next, and to Lin, this meant they were expressing a desire. And Wiffle balls. Their frantic wiggle after leaping off a plastic bat suggested a similar desire, though his father, who at the moment wasn't living with Lin and his mother, explained that the symmetrical holes cut into the plastic sphere were responsible for the ball's erratic and exciting flight. Okay, but to Lin's way of thinking, the holes merely set free the inner spirit of the ball.""Having spent a lot of my elementary school days in such contemplation, I was all in with Linwood....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Jun 08, 2018","Jun 08, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/12366.The_Whore_s_Child_and_Other_Stories

Told from a first person POV, or first robot POV, a Sec-bot (security robot) who calls herself Murderbot has achieved sentience. Or free agency. Of course, to maintain that freedom, she must conceal that fact from her clients/employers or risk dis-assembly and brain wipe (I'm paraphrasing, but you get the gist). When we meet her, she is busy watching soap operas on a back feed while guarding some clients on a planetary survey. They are attacked by something with a large mouth and very big teeth; not to worry, Murderbot saves the day, but the real question is ""what was that thing and why were they not warned of its existence in the background information about the planet""?And we go on the ride while Murderbot and her human companions set out to find out why/how their expedition has been sabotaged.

Murderbot is not really a robot, she is a cyborg. Part organic, part machine. And that complicates things, mostly from the human point of view. As a machine, she is part of the furniture - a useful tool. As they interact with her more (and she with them) and they begin to realize something is ""off"", the interactions become much more awkward. Sort of like junior high school, but with implications of ""is this a slave relationship""? This question is explored somewhat, but at a remove because from Murderbot's POV, it isn't very interesting. When she's not in active saving-all-their-asses mode, she just wants to get back to her soap opera programs.So, on top of the thrilling adventure part, a real exploration of what it means to be human (or not) is beginning.

Yes, whilst. That is a clue. The story and mystery are modest. But the person of Isabella, aka Lady Trent, evoked my childhood reading in a powerful way. This book purports to be a memoir of her first adventure that involved dragons.By the standards of her day, Isabella was what in my day was referred to as a ""tomboy"". It was not a compliment. The setting appears to be a sort of Victorian England in a parallel universe. The major difference is that in this world, dragons exist. They are not romantic or friendly or even fire-breathing. And the idea of riding them is not even remotely considered. The nostalgia comes from such things as:(A) the naming of chapters and parts and their descriptions, e.g. ""Part One - in which the memoirist forms a youthful obsession with dragons, and engineers an opportunity to pursue that obsession"". Each chapter has many subparts and every page is subtitled in the same way as the parts and chapters are. Examples: p. 19 header: ""My obsession with wings""; p.21 header ""My family""; p.23 header ""The influence of Sir Richard Edgeworth"". (B) The pages are yellowed in a way found in books that have been in the attic for forty years, or at a used book store for ten. It even has a faint whiff of those books. I don't know how. This was published in 2013.(C) Fussy, fusty, formal speech. Here is an example, wherein Isabella is about to (illegally) participate in a dragon hunt wearing trousers: ""To his credit, Jim blushed when he saw me dressed so scandalously. He was a good lad. But he helped me bundle my hair up under a cap, and with it hidden, I believe I made a passable boy. I was not done growing then, and was all coltish arms and legs, with not much to speak of yet in the way of hips or breasts. (And why is it, I ask you, that my editor should complain to me of such words when I have written several books discussing dragon anatomy and reproduction in far more frank terms? He will not wish to leave this aside in, I predict, but I shall make him. There are advantages to my age and status.)""(D) There are illustrations. Of dragons. Pencil sketches! (See the cover.) They are wonderful.Isabella, Lady Trent, is a spunky heroine in the manner of Jo March in Little Women. Reading this book took me back to my early tween years (8-13 or so) when I would take ten library books on a one-week vacation with my family to Cape Cod or camping in the Adirondacks. Those were the years when my mother would be constantly exasperated with me because I never responded to her calls for help, or for coming to dinner, or going to bed, because I was in other worlds. Those were the years when one summer I read every Nancy Drew book in print. And all of the Black Stallion, Big Red books. Not to mention Jules Verne, or Marguerite Henry's horse books. And Edgar Rice Burroughs. And Dracula and Frankenstein. I could go on, but I'm assuming, dear reader, you get the point....and I am beginning to irritate even myself.So, yes, I was reliving those years when I read ""A Natural History of Dragons"".

Same devices used - star-crossed lovers, bad guys are very bad. However, it moved along and was nice historical fiction coverage of the religious wars in the late 16th century. And one highlight for me was a very nice blow-by-blow of the English fleet and the Spanish Armada encounter. The English didn't exactly ""win"", but they controlled the battles and strategically kept the Spanish from using their strength. And more importantly, prevented them from invading. Better than a draw, and total humiliation for the Spanish. I loved the fire-ships (Game of Thrones, anyone?) and the scrappy undersized merchant ships used by the English. The writing was clumsy. The characterizations were weak.

While brutality can bother me, it doesn't usually get in the way of my ability to appreciate something, but it did here.The concept - the lives of two half-sisters and their descendants are traced across generations for a total time span of some 250 years, beginning around 1760 and ending in the modern day - is brilliant. Their respective villages are on the western coast of Africa in what is modern-day Ghana, near the infamous Gold Coast Castle, a major port of departure for the slave trade. But one side remains in Africa, and the other is sold into slavery and transported to America.Through eight generations, the book alternates between Effia and Esi and their descendants. Bad things happen to both lineages. In the end, a connection is made between the two lines by their modern day representatives, but they have no idea that they have a common ancestor, Maame, who is the m0ther of Effia and Esi. But both Marjorie and Marcus, the current day descendants, are free and self-determining in a way that would be unimaginable to virtually all of their ancestors. They both have issues, of the type most of us can identify with. But more importantly, they still carry forward the damage done by the slave trade and colonialism over the generations. They are doing their best to understand their historical pasts. Marjorie, in particular, is a not-very-thinly-veiled stand in for the author. So it would appear that this novel is the fruit of the research she undertook to understand her roots. Her deep roots.A well done book.

The Martian was a page-turner - it started off with a bang and never let up. Every minute, every day was a fight for survival and science was his friend. A compelling, exciting story. This one is a weird heist novel, confusing and a caper for money - basically so she afford to buy housing that has her own bathroom. Pretty weak tea compared to staying alive as a motivator. Maybe that changes as the story develops, but I'm not going to stick around to find out. It is too painful. And the science in this book is a bore.

I already knew he was smart and thoughtful, and also knew he had to severely restrain his humor in order to run, get elected, and serve effectively.

But he has proven to be the exception to the rule. In addition to the aforementioned smart and thoughtful, he has a work ethic that is amazing. Further, he also is always searching for common ground on policy issues, without giving up any of his progressiveness. He admits this sometimes means he is limited to the small, yet important pieces.

I enjoyed this book, don't get me wrong, but not a strong entry in the Longmire saga.Good stuff: (1) explores Walt's early days as a deputy with Lucien Connelly (two weeks in) and his struggles with his marriage (four months in). I would have liked more Martha, but interesting to have her fleshed out at all. (2) Also the usual good stuff of spending time with Walt and the Cheyenne Nation, but not enough. (3) An interesting aspect was the split nature of the novel - half in modern day, half in 1972. (4) The usual side trips into details about some interesting topic - in this case, passenger trains. I love trains in general, but passenger trains have such a romatic lure. I happily eat up Craig Johnson's side trips.Problems: (1) I hate cliff-hangers, and this is where boy howdy is appropriate...it is a very frustrating cliff hanger. (2) The movement between the time splits was sometimes narratively confusing - it happened with no warning and often there wasn't enough context to have the light bulb go off until I was a few paragraphs in and muttering what just happened until ""oh, we're back in 1972"" or vice versa. (3) The mystery that WAS solved had a problematic basis - very dated psychologically...seemed very un-Walt like. (4) The structure of the mystery was a salute to Agatha Christie - murders on a train, red herrings, etc. Walt was even reading ""Murder on the Orient Express"" during the happenings. Have I mentioned I'm not a fan of English murder mysteries - overly complicated, overly populated with possible murderers, and the solution comes as a result of something that was not reasonable to my American (simple) mind.Overall, I am starting to believe that Johnson is being pushed too hard by his publishers. The need to have a new Longmire ""something"" is interfering with the quality of the product. I will always buy whatever Johnson writes, but I would rather wait two years between books than have a rushed incomplete (which is what cliff-hangers are to me) novel, two years in a row.

The prose can wander a bit, but those digressions seldom interfere (much) with the story. And, in the end, the digressions are purposeful, just sometimes too easy to get lost in them.There is a major moral dilemma at the beating heart of Beartown. While there is a clear right and wrong side of that issue, Bachman is masterful at dissecting the human frailties that make the right and wrong less clear - not as an outside observer/reader, but as a member of a tribe. The tribe is literally a hockey team; at one remove is the secondary tribe of the team's supporters, who live in the small isolated town that the team comes from.As you grow to know the characters, you are made to understand what it means to step outside and/or to exist outside of the tribe. And how punishing and unforgiving that position can be, and how powerful the yearning to belong is. Humans are tribal, morality is not.

She has several through lines with Harry Bosch - smart, obsessive, prickly, rules are for others, social life will always be stunted because the job comes first, second, third, you get the drift.

As I said, I like her a lot.She is clearly damaged goods, but that is something to look forward to exploring in future books.As a Connelly novel, the clues add up and puzzles are solved. Three cases are presented on the first night (the late show, get it), and all three are more complicated than first presented, and all are doggedly pursued to the finish. Admittedly, one is dealt with more completely than the others.Connelly also uses the casual sexism of law enforcement types to make several points, and does it well. For starters, one reason Ballard is on ""the late show"" is as punishment for bringing charges of sexual harassment against a supervisor - the charges were dismissed as the boys in blue closed ranks around her supervisor. But, again, that doesn't stop her. Since she is willing to work almost 24/7, the only problems posed are with the practicalities of her assignments.

(Also, if you are a science nerd, this one uses many common tropes that undermine its credibility.) However, this novel explores an area that is one of the best uses of science fiction that there is: the understanding of humanity by using a lot of not-humans. The crew of the Wayfarer is species divergent - humans, sure, but also a reptilian pilot (but don't use the term publicly - it is very speciest, kind of like the N-word to one of that species), a cook with 6 legs/arms and 5 vocal chords who has to do all the work in communicating with humans, and an especially endearing A.I. Of course, one of the humans is a nasty racist speciest, so everything is not all unicorns - hmmm, am I mixing metaphors, or just babbling?Lots of other species in their travels, too. And, lest I forget, humans are pretty low in the prestige chain, galaxy-wide speaking. Evidently a lot of disagreement about allowing them into the Galactic Commons, the governing body for everyone/body/thing.A lot of this book works on how such divergent beings can get along. And it does it by exploring the various cultures and their value systems through human eyes, and vice-versa (although not everyone/body/thing has eyes...). Kind of a galactic anthropology course through story telling.I am/was surprised how much I liked this book, because I value plot and character development above all else, and this wasn't especially strong in those categories. But it is a great exploration of how culture shapes values, and how species characteristics shape the perceptions that create those cultures and values in the first place.A quote that might sum it up: ""Harmagians had money.

Five have been included in previous anthologies, two new ones, ""Fugitive Green"" and ""Besieged"". Gabaldon tends to feature John Grey in her ""non-big books"" in the series. I adore John Grey, but not necessarily in these novellas. He seems to work much better when paired against Jamie or Claire or Bree. In the two new novellas, he is featured in ""Besieged"", which I honestly didn't like much. Whole bunch of to-ing and fro-ing, bit of focus on the zombie stuff (which I've never been a fan of) in a mission to rescue his mother (whom I like a lot). When the plot leaves something to be desired, the amount of verbiage dedicated to tastes and smells stands out, not in a good way. So, maybe two stars for that one. Maybe one.""Fugitive Green"" was more enjoyable, and tells the tale of how/""when Hal met Minnie"". Hal is John Grey's older brother (there's the JG connection), who is a minor, but important character in the main books. Gruff and cranky, he was responsible for Jamie being sent home alive after Culloden as a debt of honor John Grey owed to Jamie. Hal and Minnie (and their fascinating marriage) are nice interludes in the main books. While there was a lot to like in this telling of their meeting and ""courtship"", it does stretch credulity that a strong marriage would be the result of these interactions, but still, I enjoyed the story, more of a 3/4 star story.One of the nicest features of the book is the author's pretty detailed chronological outline of all her Outlander works - the big books, the novellas, and what she calls ""the bulges"", which approach more short story length. This includes the years covered as well as a bit of a description for each. Oh, as for the other five previously published works, by far my favorite (of all seven, for that matter) is ""A Leaf on the Wind of All Hallows"", which tells the tale of Roger MacKenzie's parents, and how/why he was orphaned, especially with respect to his father. Roger had been told all of his life that his father had ""gone down"" over the English Channel during World War II.

The girl was captured by the Kiowa at the age of six, and witnessed the slaughter/violation of her parents and sister. Four years later, she has no (or very little) memory of her life before the Kiowa, and is violently opposed to her separation from them.For his part, Captain Jefferson Kidd reads the ""news of the world"" for audiences up and down the state of Texas. He rents out a hall, and for a dime, people are admitted to hear him read somewhat dated news from newspapers of London, New York, Chicago, etc. He is careful to avoid anything about the politics in Texas, since post-Civil War Texas has not yet been re-admitted to statehood following its secession in 1861. Reading anything about that topic seems to be is a fairly certain way to be attacked if not killed. He reluctantly agrees to take the girl across the state to return her to her aunt and uncle, knowing it is not a good idea. If nothing else, the girl is fully capable of killing him in his sleep. Communication is impossible, since she remembers no English and his Kiowa is similarly non-existent.What follows is a beautiful, if violent and frightening, travelogue across Texas and the slow but growing bond between them.Read it.(Teaser: you will never view a roll of dimes the same way again....)...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Feb 27, 2017","Feb 28, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25817493-news-of-the-world

For instance, some of the girls' names (in addition to Calamity Leek, which is pretty clever) are: Annie St. Albans, Dorothy Macclesfield, Truly Polperro, and a trio of younger girls: Adelaide, Cinderella, and Fantine... you get the picture. A lot of googling on my part. And many, many rose varieties. WTF?The head of this operation is ""Aunty"" who is a cross between Miss Trunchbull from Matilda and Norma Desmond. Your introduction to her comes when several of the girls are somewhere they are not supposed to be, and you know Aunty is getting closer to their hiding place because they can hear her singing softly, ""I feel pretty, oh so pretty.."" then as she gets closer, ""I feel charming"", followed by ""see the pretty girl in the mirror there"".

It is hard to imagine how a book so dark and disturbing can also be so hilarious. First, there are the settings: (a) 100 miles north of the Arctic Circle in Siberia, and (b) Chechnya. And if Siberia isn't bleak enough for you, wait until you get a load of how much fun those it was during the height of the Stalinist purges (circa 1937) and then when the USSR collapsed and the economy went completely into the toilet (1990's). And, of course, we visit Chechnya during the Chechen-Russian ""conflict"" in the early 2000's.It is also hard to believe that an American could write such a book. The book is steeped in Russian culture/history and with the characters imbued with the DNA of the Russians that populate Dostoevsky's novels. That is, a general sense of doom and a sense that suffering is the national pastime. I don't mean to make light of it, because this is serious stuff. And yet. As I was writing this , my assessment changed. I now regard it in light of recent events, which changed my overall takeaway to one in which this book is disturbing. And still brilliant.The passage that follows might serve as an example of all of the above. The setup is that we have a young man trying to make ends meet through criminal (but nonviolent) activity. He is working the phone lines trying to bilk gullible Americans out of information that he can then ""monetize"", as in credit card numbers. When he is asked how he targets specific people (because, even if we are gullible, not many of us are that gullible), the exchange goes like this: [Vladimir is Sergei's father.]Vladimir: ""Why do these foolish Americans believe you?""Sergei: ""When I first started, they didn't....took a long time to understand the American mind-set. The fear of their cruel and capricious government weighs heavily on their psyches. They're more inclined to believe they'll lose what they have than receive what they want. Better to be the tax man than the sweepstakes, I decided. But it wasn't good enough. Too many skeptics, still. Then I remembered something you told me. Because your dad was an enemy of the people, you and your mom were on a special list. I figured that somewhere online, there must be a list of Americans who will believe anything, no matter how implausible or insulting to their intelligence.""V: ""Is there such a list?""S: ""Tom Hanks' Facebook fan page.""V: ?? (my translation)S: ""You remember how Mom had that embroidered pillow? When she got upset, she'd shout into it and no one would hear her. That's Facebook. And Forrest Gump, you must have seen Forrest Gump?""V: ""Is it a nature film?""S: : ""No, no. Classic cinema. About how every achievement in American society over the last fifty years was really just the dumb luck of a mentally challenged man.""V: ""This was a Soviet propaganda film?""S: "" No, it's a big Hollywood movie.... so I cross-reference the names and birthdays pulled from Tom Hanks' Facebook fans with White Pages. Why, you might ask, would they put their birthday right there on the Internet when it's one of the three pieces of information necessary to steal their identity? So that strangers will wish them a happy birthday! It's incredible, I know. When I called up Mrs. McGlinchy, I had her name, address, and birthday, told her I was from the IRS, and asked that she provide the necessary information to prove her identity. The trick is to make the American feel he must convince you of his identity, rather than the other way around. Tom Hanks' fans are maybe ten times more likely to fall for this than the average American.""V: ""Because there's something wrong with them?""S: ""I wouldn't go that far. I'd just say that those who enjoy his acting are unfamiliar with human nature.""So - there you have it. Given the events of the last few weeks, this is insightful. But very disturbing. And, nonetheless, hilarious. Darkly.I would also like to thank my book club - this is not a book that would ever have come to my attention in the normal course of events.

Two families are brought together in a harmful way (an affair between a two people who are married to other people), impacting not only the four adults in the mix, but the six children they have between them.The adults have problems which are not unusual - e.g. the mother who emotionally can't handle her own two children, let alone the other four brought to live with her for the summers, in the guise of visiting their father who promptly abandons her and the kids while he goes to work, and she in turn abandons all of the kids.

Fractured in time, characters, place and structure. And what characters and places! Probably set on our own Earth, after we have ruiFascinating book. Fractured in time, characters, place and structure. And what characters and places! Probably set on our own Earth, after we have ruined it, somehow. Fiercely drawn characters in terms of race/ethnic history/sexuality, much of which is foreign to a resident of Earth in 2016, but very much echoing mankind's own history and cultural splits and dysfunctions. There are three story lines, following Essun (woman in early 40's), Damaya (young girl), and Syenite (late teens). Over time you suspect they are one and the same, but that would probably qualify as a spoiler. An interesting approach the author takes is that Essun's story is told in sort of a toggling between first and second person (it is never clear who is telling the story or who the second person is until the end), whereas Damaya's and Syenite's stories are in third person, but switching on and off into first person reactions inside their heads). It was confusing at first, but a steady rhythm of narration took over. I don't know when it happened, just realized at some point that I didn't need to think about it anymore. The other major character (totally third person narrative), Alabaster, is my favorite. He is critical to the story in ways that aren't obvious at first, but he is truly the fulcrum of the story (that is a pun you will get if you read the book).A major development vis-a-vis ""normal"" humans is the appearance of ""orogenes"" - clearly a mutation of some kind which allows those who possess that gene to manipulate earth. Literally, as in stones, tectonic plates, etc. using a sort of telekinesis. Those who possess this ability are viewed with hate and suspicion by those who don't. And frankly, someone who can cause earthquakes when they get upset can be a bit dicey to be friends with. Especially if they have not been trained in controlling it yet...So, the novel is quite the puzzlebox. Very rewarding if you like this kind of thing, possibly totally frustrating if you need to be grounded in reality. Filled with its own mythology (""stonelore"") and history curated by those who rule - which ain't the orogenes, in case you were wondering... but I loved it.This is not an easy book to read. Not just because of the fracturing, but because of the content. (However, if you can deal with the violence and heartbreak of Game of Thrones and Outlander, you will be OK.) But it is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO worth it. (I would note that I consumed this novel in what is becoming my favorite method of ""reading"". Listening to an audiobook version for a couple of hours, then re-reading it in print until I catch up to the audiobook. That way I can reinforce what I heard, spend more time with the details I may have missed, and skim over most of the print.)P.S. While I was frustrated to find out at the end of the book that it is Part 1 of a planned trilogy, the story arc is reasonably complete - or at least complete enough I can stand the wait for the next two._________________________________June 2019Just finished a re-read.

A father who was determined to know everything he could about the black diaspora in America, African roots, and dedicated to making that alternative to the usual rendering of American history available through his own basement publishing efforts.

But I recently read a somewhat stand-alone book (Curse of Chalion) by this author, and it was wonderful, so I decided I really should get to these books. I finally have, and it didn't disappoint. And considering that is was one of her first, if not the first, novels, it is amazingly good. (It does have few issues related to having been written 30 years ago, but it would have been very forward thinking at the time. Hell, just having a female protagonist 30 years ago was a novelty.)Bujold is into characters. Wonderful characters. The plot was overly complicated, but in a Game of Thrones way. Old families, some with inbred madness popping up every other generation or so, political machinations, lots of double dealing.I will definitely be following up. Not for everyone, but I think I will really enjoy this series.

As always, Rollins starts with an interesting scientific premise and then turns it on its head to produce an amazing, page-turning thriller. However, I was really excited about this one because I coincidentally was also reading a nonfiction book (""Sapiens"", Harari) about the same scientific puzzle regarding a period of accelerated growth in human intelligence. That is, by complete chance, I was reading a novel and a nonfiction book about the same phenomenon. As it turns out, about 100,000 years ago there were several hominin species living around the world at the same time - sapiens, erectus, Denisovan, neanderthal, australopitheus, floresiensis, maybe more, but you get the picture. Then something happened. Somewhere between 70,000 years ago and 30,000 years ago, most of those species disappeared, and homo sapiens began to thrive dramatically, both in numbers and in geographic coverage. The questions both authors explore are (a) why, and (b) is this necessarily a good thing for the ultimate survival of the sapiens species. Based on the evidence from that period, homo sapiens did not appear to have any particular advantage over the other hominins. But all of a sudden, sapiens began to differentiate itself in several ways such as art (think cave paintings in France) and the ability for abstraction, such as burial rites which indicate the contemplation of things that are not concrete, such as an afterlife.At this point, the books take different paths. This book is a thriller and examines the acceleration of human intelligence via Rollins' good ole Sigma Force v. evil-doers. Which, for the record, I am getting tired of. You read Rollins for the adventure, not the character development. He has created this Sigma Force group which is an efficient way to not have to spend time on who they are. You get to know them by what various expertise they have in the context of the team.There are two parallel investigations - one scientific, the other historical. The science track is what Rollins (and Crichton before him) does best. The historical goes around the bend in this one, consisting of many features more likely to be found in the DaVinci Code - consipiracies, numerology, and mathematical coincidences that are unrelated (in my mind, anyway) which purport to provide support for some fantastical theories. He even drags poor old Neil Armstrong into it at one point, for chrissake.....So. Interesting scientific jump-off point, great thriller pacing and utter nonsense for historical component. I like Rollins, but this seems to be formulaic, and not in a good way.I am, however, enjoying Sapiens, and look forward to continuing it now....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Feb 17, 2016","Feb 17, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23644800-the-bone-labyrinth

It is a special book, and it made a real impression. I was vaguely aware that Krueger had written a series of books with a protagonist named Cork O'Connor, and made a mental note to try one out. That is this book.As a first novel in a series, it is remarkably good. I do like murder mysteries, and this is a pretty good mystery, albeit overly complicated. Cork O'Connor is a deeply flawed man, an ex-sheriff who still acts as if he is still the sheriff. And dogged in the way Harry Bosch is dogged, as in obsessive. In fact, this book reminds me somewhat of Harry's adventures, but Krueger's prose (in this book) is not as cleanly elegant the way Michael Connelly's is. Still, the fact that I would even compare them at this point is remarkable in and of itself.I also like the way Krueger weaves in the native american (Anishinaabe/Ojibwe) history/culture throughout the book. (O'Connor is one-fourth Anishinaabe.) The first murder mysteries I read were the Joe Leaphorn/Jim Chee books by Tony Hillerman, which got me hooked on the genre. And similar to those (and Craig Johnson's Longmire series), this book is a valentine to both the cultures and the setting (northern Minnesota) that go a long way with me. Another similarity is the notion that justice and the law are two very, very different things, especially for these communities.However, one similarity to the Longmire books that I find difficult is the horrific beatings, shootings, etc that the protagonist (and others) suffer. Most normal human beings would be damaged for life, probably in a wheelchair, and requiring a LOT of personal nursing care. I find this problematic, but I guess it isn't any more unrealistic than some of the plot elements, just far more unpleasant.And where O'Connor comes up short, especially compared to Longmire and others, is that he has absolutely no sense of humor. At any rate, a great first novel, but with enough flaws to keep me from giving it 4 or 5 stars. I expect that will change with his subsequent novels, because by the time he wrote ""Ordinary Grace"" his writing was wonderful....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Feb 06, 2016","Feb 08, 2016",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/175828.Iron_Lake

However, she is also an anthropologist and is driven to understand the culture and to try to understand the ""how"" of their survival.

But I did really like it.The novel is a mashup of two of my favorite genres: science fiction (end of the world coming, compliments of asteroid ""Maia"" on a collision course with Earth) and murder mystery (did the hapless insurance actuary commit suicide or was he murdered?). The policeman of the title is Detective Hank Palace, who is endearing and irritatingly earnest in equal measure...you know, the kind of guy who (sincerely, not being a smartass) calls you ""Miss"" even when you are clearly of an age to be collecting Social Security.The mystery is tricky for several reasons. First, the notion of motive is seriously skewed when the earth is supposed to end in six months. Answering the question of why do people do what they do is tough in ""normal"" circumstances, but in this case, suicides are pretty frequent and even expected. Second, the work ethic is not quite what it used to be for much of the population (including the police force) for the same reason - many people find bucket lists and drugs much more interesting than working - especially the nitty gritty of police work. And one of the best reasons that this one is tricky is that the author steps you through all of the investigation, including many, many wrong alleys/red herrings/choose your own trite phrase. As frustrating as this is, I think it is much truer to actual police work (not that I know anything about actual police work), and ultimately more rewarding than following the bread crumbs that are the usual puzzle of murder mysteries.All that said, it seemed to drag at times, which is why I can't give it five stars. But it deserves at least the four stars for its clever premise.(Another note: this is the first of a trilogy - if I read the other two, perhaps I will change my mind.

No pulp in that book. So. How does this happen?

What a treatise on free will vs. fate it turned out to be. And without telling you what the answers are. Or should be.

An amazing ""you-are-there"" novel which brings home the horror - and camaraderie - and sheer adrenalin - of combat. Clearly the author-was-there and this book, among other things, is his declaration of the bonds and the love and respect he had for the men he served with. (And maybe the not so much respect for the higher ups calling the shots.) Vietnam was probably the United States' last war where service in the armed forces was considered an obligation to be shared by all segments of society. There was a draft and everyone was subject to it. While deferments were plentiful and the poor have always been overrepresented and the rich underrepresented, service was still pretty universal. And while that plays a part in this story, the story is really about the horrors of combat and the toll it takes.A secondary, but no less powerful, theme was how race relationships were a deadly addition to the mix. This was the 1960's, and civil rights in this country were marching up the road at the same time as Vietnam played out. It is painful to read about how raw all of that was; but interesting to note that all of that friction disappeared in combat - it was in the down time that the problems really boiled up.Interestingly, I think the two best books I've read this year are about war - this one and ""All the Light We Cannot See"".

I almost gave up on this book several times. The first half (two-thirds?) dragggggggggggggggeeeeeeeddddddddddddd. I kept picking it up, reading a couple of pages, and then found other more interesting things to do, like the laundry. I know (and knew while I was reading it) that the author was working hard to establish texture for the translation in traveling into 1882 from 1970, so that the reader would really feel/smell/see the differences. But it was sooooo boring. Under normal circumstances, I would have quit, but several people whose opinion I value thought it was a wonderful book, so I kept telling myself to keep slogging on, since there must be a payoff. I also had problems reading something written from a 1970 mindset - for instance, in the introductory pages where you meet Simon Morely (protagonist) at work, all the men have first and last names and titles and all the ""girls"" only have first names. And the men like to wander through accounting [or wherever], because that's where the ""cute"" girls work. Now, this IS how it was. I was there, all right? But it was just so startling. And awful. (Full confession: some of the 1960s and 1970s is so painful to recall, that I also can't watch Mad Men, no matter how good it is.) But. I digress. And the good news is, there is indeed a payoff.The last half/third all of a sudden slammed into gear, and was wonderful. And very, very clever. Several twists I didn't see coming, painful choices made with a recognition that living with those decisions wasn't going to be easy, and the plot moved like a runaway freight train headed for disaster into the terminal. So.The moral to the story is - if you are going to have a bad half and a good half, always go with the good half last (kind of like this )....Just thought of a way to make my point: the first half/two-thirds of the book took me two weeks; the last half/third took one day.

I had avoided this book since it came out, largely because of the cover.

But as the book moves from ""just"" laugh out loud episodes, it becomes a real exploration of how what you see depends on where you sit. Bernadette starts off as a bat-shit, defiantly NOT-hipster mother who over time gains your sympathy. She is very disturbed, but it turns out, she has reason to be.

Maybe, to some extent, it does, but it is much more than a plot.The most interesting aspect for me was that it evoked a sense of my own childhood, thrilled and reading my way through Nancy Drew's adventures in the 1950's and 1960's. However, this book is well written, and whoever Carolyn Keene was, she was not a very good writer. What evokes the memory is that sense of alien-ness of another era. Nancy Drew, in her sporty blue roadster, was definitely a creature of another time - the 1930's and 1940's; daughter of Carson Drew, prominent lawyer (I hope these references are accurate, just operating off of memory), and a crime-solving wonder.Maisie Dobbs is definitely a young woman of a long gone era also. In this case, World War I in England and France, and the years before and immediately following. In contrast to the well-born Nancy, she is a young woman who has risen above her class due to a brilliant mind and some devoted mentors.It was a decent mystery, but for me, the biggest enjoyment was that the time and place were characters equal to Maisie....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Feb 21, 2015","Feb 21, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/462033.Maisie_Dobbs

The casual racism of the 1940's and 1950's in Malaya and Australia is quite jarring, but I'm sure it is an accurate reflection of the times.I watched the miniseries adaption by PBS/BBC in the 1980's, and was absolutely enthralled. I had always meant to read the book, and now, only 30 years later, I have.There are two distinct, but related, parts to this book: first, a truly harrowing tale of a group of British women who were captured by the Japanese in Malaya in 1942, and second, the reunion of two of the protagonists from the wartime event and their efforts to build a town in the Australian outback.Shute is a master of narrative detail: you sweat, starve, and are eaten alive by mosquitoes along with the women (and children), who suffer the ultimate humiliation of not even being wanted as prisoners by the Japanese, but not allowed to leave, either. Shute draws a surprisingly sympathetic picture of their ""guards"", the equivalent of enlisted men, while clearly condemning their superior officers.The lovingly detailed descriptions of the Australian outback are similarly well drawn out. Where Shute gets into a bit of trouble is over-killing on the details of things like lists of items needed to construct a workroom for manufacturing items made from alligator skin, or long, drawn-out exchanges of a dozen or so folks providing necessary communication by radio... it was sort of like reading the transcripts of a police scanner's exchanges without any edits. Kind of reminded me of the irritation I had at times with Stieg Larsson's ""Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" and the itemizations of what the characters had for breakfast, and the brands of their clothing and kitchen appliances.

And the cynical, observational style. And how a book written in the 1960's by and about a gay man held up so well. This was/is a gay man comfortable in his own skin, which I don't think was very common then. Not that his world view, as well as his assumptions about what others thought of him, wasn't heavily influenced by being gay, but that he didn't have any doubts about himself being gay - that's what he was, and he had no interest in anything else.But in the discussion I came to appreciate Isherwood's strong sense of place (geographical, macro and micro) and style, his appreciation of the beauty in the human form, and his ability to think in ways that all of us can identify with.

And impossible to take. But the narrator, Michael Boatman - who I now believe to be incredibly gifted - switched gears effortlessly to John Brown and as the narrator begins to change while in the company of Brown, loses the shuffling massa speak and becomes a whole person - childish and selfish [he is very young]. His voicing of John Brown is remarkable.As I said at the beginning, I cannot meaningfully capture my reactions to this book.

Almost unimaginably precise, yet fluid at the same time. Beautiful conceptualizations of fairly sophisticated ideas about self and memory and aging. How reliable are we as witnesses to our own history? And does that change with age? There are many discussions of a philosophical nature that are attributed to the protagonist's recollections of his secondary education in England during the 1960's. Those discussions are elegant and fascinating.Where the book bogged down for me was in the plot narrative. Plot may be too strong a word. But many painful events are recalled from the trials of adolescence and early adulthood as the protagonist is looking back forty years and becomes involved in a mystery of sorts. Someone leaves him money in a will that comes as a complete surprise - having last seem the woman who left him the bequest over forty years before. In trying to unravel why the mother of an old girlfriend left him money, he wanders down memory lane and discovers to his chagrin that his memory is a bit faulty and pretty self-serving. That's as it may be, but the real problem for me is that there is considerable ambiguity with respect to the motivations of people from that distant past who figure into his search for an explanation. Nasty people did nasty things to each other and one of his old friends even committed suicide, but I never could decide why. There are possible explanations that wend around the class system in England, sexual repression in the 1960's, and the bitterness of betrayal in virtually every case. The mystery itself is fairly tidily resolved, but the ""why"" as to what people did what they did is left to the reader's interpretation. Not my favorite situation. I can tolerate some ambiguity, but the gap here was a bit unsatisfying.So - raves for the writing - easy to see why it won the Man Booker - but points off for not satisfying my need for resolution.

The Gabaldon was Well, this is a bit unfair, since I only read the two stories I was interested in - the ones by Diana Gabaldon and George RR Martin. The Gabaldon was fine, not great, but the Martin was awful.The Gabaldon story (Virgins) is one of Jamie and Ian as 17 year-olds, on an adventure while they were mercenaries in France. It was a nice visit with the boys, but didn't shed much light on anything. I mean, if you have read the books you already know about Jamie's status when he meets Claire, and you probably don't really care about Ian's virginity. So. The back and forth between the two of them is - as always - enjoyable. Just not very illuminating.The Martin story (The Princess and the Queen) is just dreadful. Set in Westeros about 150 years before the events in Game of Thrones, it does answer the question ""where did the dragons all go""? Not very surprisingly, they all (well, not all, but damn near) kill each other as weapons in battles that are held in a dispute over who is next in succession when the king dies. The two sets of offspring of the dead king - one side from his first wife, the other side from his second wife go at it. We move from one battle to another, one assassination to another, in about the same scintillating style as the Bible enumerates all the begatting that takes place. To add to that, for those of you familiar with the Targaryen style of naming themselves, this gets very tedious and confusing. I guess since most of the offspring is the product of brothers and sisters, it's not surprising that the names would be repeated (A LOT), but it is confusing. We have several Viserys, Rhaenyras, Aemons, Aemonds, Dameons, Aegons, well you get the picture. I kept losing track of who was on which side, and finally realized I didn't care. There is NO character development to speak of. I love the Song of Fire and Ice books because I care about Tyrion, Arya, Jamie, etc etc. and what happens to them. There is nothing here to care about.I don't know what the quality of the other stories is, but this sort of anthology has become a very lazy way of living off of previous good work.

As always, Grafton doesn't preach, just sort of puts out the facts for you to decide - although it just added to my already conflicted thoughts/opinions about the homeless.But the mystery itself is the usual carefully crafted, methodical (that's a good thing, in my opinion) exposition that Grafton always provides. She has the same sort of approach as Michael Connelly, but her protagonist, Kinsey Millhone, is not the tortured soul that Harry Bosch is - or for that matter to a lesser degree, Mickey Haller.Two corpses are brought to Kinsey's attention - one someone she knew, one she didn't.

I can't remember the last time that I read a book that truly explored new territory for me. This book had two such areas: foster care and the language of flowers, which was a Victorian notion of communication by using the meaning of flowers. (It isn't only a Victorian notion, but it seems to have had a heyday back then.)The story is told from the point of view of a young woman who is aging out of foster care at 18, and who is very emotionally fragile. It was tough going in the first few chapters because the first person point of view feels like an alien mind, and also because the chapters flip back and forth between current day and a period about ten years ago.My main difficulty with the book, however, is that it was uneven. The first third was powerful and moved along quickly. The middle third slowed down, but was still compelling.

A fascinating, horrifying account of what happened in Memorial Hospital in New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina hit and the events afterward as families and law enforcement officials tried to piece together why certain patients at Memorial had died.

There were mistakes made. Tragic mistakes, and errors of judgment.

The ending was at the same plot point as the first, but with a bit more information. The third, Maddaddam, filled in lots of spaces and enriched the entire story.

It seems that Atwood got a lot of feedback about the ambiguous ending to Oryx and Crake, which she addressed by writing this book. As such, the Year of the Flood is not really a sequel, but a different and deeper look at the events that unfold in Oryx and Crake. While the first book focuses primarily on two young boys/men, this book takes a much broader perspective with several different points of view of the events in Oryx and Crake.That said, I found the Year of the Flood much more satisfying. It unfolds in the same way, but instead of one unreliable narrator, there are (at least) two.One of the things I truly enjoyed was the development of the culture and mythology of the God's Gardeners sect, which was a counter-culture movement/group that despaired of the havoc that humans have visited on our planet. Atwood develops poetry, speeches, and a sense of the politics of that group which serves to deepen the story. It reminded me of the approach that Ursula LeGuin often takes - creating whole societies with their unique anthropological and ethnographical(?) roots.In this world, God's Gardeners recognize every day as a Saint's day. Some of the saints are obvious - Rachael Carson, Dian Fossey - but most are not. I really enjoyed visiting Wikipedia at the beginnings of every chapter to find out what a particular ""saint"" had contributed to a body of knowledge, usually environmental/green causes.I still remain puzzled by the impact Atwood's books have on me. While they are brilliant and often compelling, they are still somewhat remote, as though intellectual thought can create an almost physical barrier.

The narrator is also superb. Reading the journal entries by different authors, he does wonderful British posh, British workingman, soft Scottish burr, and nasal Aussie voices equally well.Even now, it is hard for me to believe that anyone actually survived this expedition, let alone the entire crew (well, minus some bits and pieces). These guys were perpetually wet in temperatures below zero. I did live in Alaska for a while, and I was given to understand being wet was death at sub-zero temperatures. So I still don't get it.

And the people - aboriginal, Russian fur trader descendants, lower 48 transplants, and their intermixed offspring make for an interesting, frustrating brew.

Or, more accurately to the northern California coast so we can stay in the woods (sort of) with a full kitchen, wonderful bathrooms, and breath-taking views of the ocean.Bryson is an amazing writer with an amazing mind.

The first I've ever read by Binchy, but based on this, probably not the last, especially since her long time fans seem to indicate that this is not the best. Great characters, very little plot. The novel is organized around one Chicky Starr, and her efforts to restore an old estate and convert it into a full service inn. The first third or so is devoted to meeting Chicky and the small community of Stoneybridge on the west coast of Ireland. The balance of the book is developing the backstories, joys, and heartbreaks of two sets of characters: those who work at Stone House and the set of guests who come there in its first week of operation.While the setting and the cultures are very different, this nonetheless reminded me very much of the Ladies No. 1 Detective series. The same gentle and mostly kind observations about people that serve to remind us of our similarities as human beings, and how petty are most of the things that divide us.

Scott parked across their entrance, and got out. The older attendant was a Latin man in his fifties with short black hair and a red vest.

From the author notes on the jacket, it appears that she is no longer so self destructive, and clearly she believes that this trek was instrumental in that aspect. Probably was.

During the 1950's, I ""discovered"" science fiction, and a major influence was Heinlein's juvenile series, e.g. Red Planet and Have Spacesuit, Will Travel. I loved them.I remember being thrilled by this book (Moon is a Harsh Mistress) when I read it, no doubt in the 1960's when it was published. Then I read Stranger in a Strange Land, and decided Heinlein had lost his marbles. It wasn't so much that it violated cultural norms, which it did, it just seemed like pointless ramblings. Didn't read much Heinlein after that. Along the way I became convinced (don't know exactly why) that Heinlein had gone crazy. Like batshit, Howard Hughes crazy. Now I don't know why I thought that. But back to Moon is a Harsh Mistress.In some ways, this book holds up better than many others written fifty years ago...my god, can it really be that long ago? Because Heinlein was smart and an engineer, his scientific underpinnings were unusally strong and have held up fairly well over time. And he could always tell a good story. Re-reading this book, I wonder what I got out of it before - other than a good revolution always makes for a good read.Now his writing strikes me as quite didactic. His philosophy is a mashup of several different belief systems and is strongly underpinned by his libertarian stance. Using the convention of a new society that has evolved in the lunar colonies out of necessity (such as a scarcity of women), he fools around with family structure, governmental organization and general cultural norms. It is really quite interesting, but at times feels more like a how-to manual for revolution, or just creating a new society free of previous conventions. And sometimes the lectures go on a bit.I am glad I re-read the book, but realized I had no real memory of what I had read before - just that I had enjoyed it as a story of throwing the bastards out. Never really appreciated the clever, well-thought out strategies and tactics that were used in the revolution, or recognized that the real heart of the book was a condemnation of most of the forms of government used by humans....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Oct 24, 2012","Oct 24, 2012",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/120273.The_Moon_Is_a_Harsh_Mistress

I finally understand the phrase ""deathless prose"". I remained glued to this book/(audiobook) even though the story was painful. The events in this book closely parallel Stegner's own life, and a tough one it was (or at least the first 30 or so years of it covered here). Born to two remarkable, if deeply flawed parents, this story follows a younger son in a family that survives, but does not triumph in the early 20th century. Some of this was due to the economic situations of the era, but most was undoubtedly due to the father's endless get-rich schemes that inevitably failed - either outright or because he would ride the scheme through early successes until it finally busted.The book begins with a quick overview of the father's own childhood, and sets the table for his impulses and drive to succeed. The courtship of Bo and Elsa Mason (the parents) is probably the most purely enjoyable section of the book. While the events that take the reader through the courtship, early marriage, parenthood, and finally the coming of age of the two sons produced in the marriage can be enumerated fairly easily, what makes the book stand out is the prose. Even at the depths of the worst situations, the prose held me in thrall. Lucious, overdone, discriptive beyond any need to advance the story, the prose just sings.The reader of the audiobook is also fabulous, and I will try to get my hands on other books he has narrated, not the least of which is Stegner's Angle of Repose.This is a classic in every sense of the word that I can think of....Note: there are several phrases/word usages that we have grown past - politically incorrect in today's world - that are a bit jarring, but it needs to be remembered that this book was written in the 1930's....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Sep 07, 2012","Sep 11, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10801.The_Big_Rock_Candy_Mountain

Absolutely compelling subject matter about how Mugabe has destroyed his country under the guise of throwing off the colonial yoke of Dutch/Scottish/British settlers in Rhodesia/Zimbabwe by murder, theft, intimidation and just general thuggery. And a first person account, no less.But the writing. After slogging through the first 100 pages, and skipping through the rest (while checking Wikipedia about some stuff), I understand why editors are important. The writing is deadly awful. Still could mostly forgive that, but the writer ends up justifying his stubborn refusal to leave Zimbabwe because he believes that is what God wanted. Maybe. But having three kids under the age of 10 and a wife subjected to being shot at and having their home burned around their ears, hard for me to stomach. OK to risk your own skin, but not OK to risk kids.Zimbabwe is a human tragedy of the first order, and it is rare to get such a close-up of a madman and his minions.

Sometimes I really don’t like what he writes, particularly when he doubles down on the horror aspects. After reading Cell a few years ago, I swore I would never read another Stephen King book. Well, so much for my principled stances…In 11/22/63, his writing skills are employed to his fullest and best use. While he still occasionally meanders too much in the yuk factor, for the most part he tells a compelling story based on the premise of a time traveler’s attempt to stop the assassination of JFK. (Given the title of the book, don’t think this qualifies as a spoiler…)While dealing with all the paradoxes introduced by time travel events in more or less standard fashion, the heart of the book is about star crossed lovers -- the protagonist, and a woman from the time he travels to. It reminded me emotionally and thematically of the Star Trek episode “The City on the Edge of Forever”, possibly the best Star Trek episode ever done. (Notwithstanding Harlan Ellison’s complaints about Roddenberry screwing up his script.) He makes you care about the characters, and evokes the past in a way that you can smell it and taste it (often, but not always, a good thing). King and I are only about a month apart in age, and he brings back the 1950’s and 1960’s so hauntingly that my own memories were triggered.

She paints the landscapes - both the bleak, cold, wet London and the contrast of sunlight that is so bright it hurts the eyes and the starkness of the windswept territory that is New South Wales. The protagonist is William Thornhill, a riverman by trade, who knows every curve and current of the Thames, who is sent to a land with rivers that are unknown to him. And his ability to navigate by the stars is gone. He learns over time that the Southern Cross is as reliable as the North Star, but these are not easy lessons.The heart of the story is the clash between two cultures - the colonists and the native people. And, predictably, not all goes well. In fact, it goes horribly wrong. Some of the colonists are truly despicable people. Thornhill is not, but he is no paragon of virtue, either. He is very human. And while none of the aborigines are portrayed as bad people, it really doesn't matter. The clash between two cultures that are so different never goes well, so it isn't a surprise that it doesn't here either.I believe this is required reading in Australia's schools, and I can see why.

Or maybe more like a mashup of a few episodes from different seasons.What was disquieting was that several of the more colorful characters were included, but details were different. For instance, the story arc in season 2 of Justified was built around a wonderful character named Mags Bennett, a matriarch of one of the hollers and queen of potgrowing enterprises for most of eastern Kentucky. She has several dim-witted sons - Dickie and Coover among them - who float through several episodes. In the book, instead of Dickie and Coover Bennett, we have Dickie and Coover Crowe, dim-witted sons of Pervis Crowe, patriarch of one of the hollers and king of potgrowing enterprises for most of eastern Kentucky.

I was in a rage last night when I finished it, now just angry. This is a really unappealing story with unlikeable characters (only likeable character gets killed, I guess to prove this is a really harsh world we've entered). The talent of the author, however, is considerable. The first third of the book flew by - first person narrative by illiterate protagonist is a device I like a lot, where you have to figure out what is going on by decoding the events as seen through the eyes of someone for whom communication is a stuggle. Lots of nifty stuff - talking dogs. I mean TALKING DOGS!!! Almost worth it just for that. Half the population (women) able to hear what is going on in others' (men) heads, and, in fact, can't shut it out as much as they would like to. Author does a really good job depicting the downsides of such a system - the trilogy is not subtitled ""Chaos Walking"" for nothing.But the big reveals were telegraphed early and often - very anticlimatic when ACTUALLY revealed. (Side note: annoyingly, when the narrator gets an important insight, it is not always shared with the reader. I mean, what's up with that? Part of the payoff of a first person POV is being in the character's head. So having a curtain drawn for big insights is truly mystifying, although, as I already commented, not much of a curtain, since the plot points were so obvious in coming.)And for anyone complaining about the violence in The Hunger Games, they should avoid this series. Graphic gore, and evil characters WHO WILL NOT DIE. The author might as well have made some of them zombies - I mean, when a bad guy loses an eye, and enough facial meat that you can see his jaw and teeth, hasn't bathed in probably a couple of years, and has lots of dried blood festooned all over his body, what is the difference between him and a zombie for general unattractiveness?And for the last third of the book, which is basically an extended chase scene (actually the whole book is an extended chase scene, but this part is one continuous one), the author uses his considerable writing skills to shamelessly create a page-turner.

Wouldn't have been much help for young men to read this while the Nazis were trying to spur nationalistic fervor.May be the saddest thing I have ever read (or more accurately, listened to). Poetic, sad, sad, sad. The amazingly articulate (and this had to have survived a couple of translations for me to comprehend it, since my German doesn't exist) description of young men losing their humanity during World War I is very powerful. Its POV is a first person narrative of a 19 year old German boy/man/old man/human/not human who is so transformed by his experience of three years at the front of a most horrible war that he decides after his first leave home that he will never do that again. If he survives, and the war ends (something he really can't imagine) he will go home. Maybe. But for sure, not otherwise.The author's ability to articulate the disconnectedness of this young man to everything but his comrades on the front with him is incredible. And did I mention sad.This is an unrelenting tragedy as it unfolds. For instance, in contrast to the Killer Angels, a book about the Civil War battle at Gettysburg, this book takes you down early and never lets you up. The Killer Angels describes a tragedy, to be sure, but the attitudes of those fighting and the respect that many of the participants had for each other (across Blue/Gray lines), in addition to understanding the battle and its strategies and tactics has a glorious, if horrifying, aspect.In this book, the young men have no sense of what is going on outside of their pitiful patch of ground, which is probably not much different from the field at Gettysburg, over a three year period, as opposed to a three day period.And then at the end, they all die. The last one, the narrator, dies in October 1918, a few weeks before Armistice Day. I don't mean this as a spoiler, but to offer a sense of the hopelessness. It is probably one of the most powerful antiwar books ever written....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Sep 20, 2011","Sep 20, 2011",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/355697.All_Quiet_on_the_Western_Front

Got through 2 discs out of 11 or 12 and just couldn't stand it anymore. Two problems - the substance of the book, and the reader on the CD version I was listening to. The author starts off by telling you that very little real evidence exists about Cleopatra's life and that most of what we ""know"" was written by three biographers none of whom were born before she died and who (in the author's opinion) had agendas to grind with the idea of a powerful woman. So they created this image of her as a wanton, seductive teenager. OK, I can buy that. But as the book progresses, every time anything about Cleopatra's life is explored, many many caveats about the accuracy of the information is restated ad nauseam. The author tries a technique of trying to use the context of the times to paint a more realistic picture of Cleopatra. Not a bad idea, just becomes a boring lecture after a while. For instance, in describing Cleopatra's education, the author gives a description of what an education for a wealthy Alexandrian child would have looked like - OK idea, but then the overly detailed listing of curricula, down to what topics in geometry would have been covered, all the while stating over and over about how ""we don't know what she actually received for an education, but a reasonable assumption would be that it looked like this""...You get the picture.

There are many characters in this novel and each one has his/her own reader -- all of whom are excellent, but I have to admit my favorite was the reader for the Irish priest (whose character may or may not have been inspired by the actual Berrigan brothers).The construction of the story is built around events on August 7th, 1974 in New York City, ""anchored"" by Phillipe Petit, better known as the guy who tightrope walked between the twin towers in NYC on that date.The structure of the book takes narrative turns with a set of very disparate characters who appear absolutely unrelated at first, but whose fates are intertwined in the events of the day in ways that will surprise you. One of the s I read of the book compared it to the movie ""Crash"" and I think that is an apt comparison.Judges, Irish immigrants, hookers, bereaved mothers, drug-addicted (yet commercially successful) artists are all pulled together over the telling of the story in a series of wonderfully drawn character portraits. And NYC has to also be considered a character. McCann has the ability to draw word pictures second to no other author that I can think of... his scenes have so much texture - noise, color, scent, sweat that you are there.One of my favorites in a long time.October 2021: re-read for book club.

I think as a girl growing up in the 50's and 60's, I was the perfect target for the Dragonrider books. Having been told I could not pursue either of my dream careers (astronaut or [large-animal] veterinarian) simply because I was a girl really crushed me. Along comes Lessa, destined to become the greatest dragon rider of all Pern. I was caught up and transported to this strange world where a girl beat the odds. And on dragons, too. (Yup, not a very subtle substitution for horses.) So I was enthralled. Now, some 30 or 40 years later, I am determined to conquer my generally-unused iPod nano by loading an audiobook from the library. And so, because I am more interested in the PROCESS of downloading, rather than caring WHAT I download, I begin my search with a parameter limitation to ""books that are available"", and I begin to browse in sci-fi and fantasy (as is my wont), and one of the first books up is ""All the Weyrs of Pern"" (as in starts with ""A""). Pern. Happily, after much swearing and downloading of recalcitrant software, All the Weyrs of Pern is on my Nano. And what a good time I had. I love the fustiness of the society and its stilted language and customs, the silliness of descriptive prose that serves no purpose but to keep reminding you that you aren't on Earth anymore -- how many times can you be enticed by a ""flagon of steaming-hot klah""...without laughing?? Descriptions of all the holds, weyrs, and halls (generally speaking, the structure of Pern society) - and the master craftsmen etc etc etc... are ridiculous and florid and detailed and wonderful (makes Steig Larssen seem like Hemingway in comparison). The victorian/almost dickensian mores and customs are so silly yet provide a real grounding in another civilization that echoes our own, but not.So, I've decided that I may re-visit the several series that have grabbed me and allowed me to escape into another existence - Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series, McCaffrey's Pern, Novik's Temeraire, the wonderful Jo Walton's Sulien books, Tony Hillerman's Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee mysteries, and Alexander McCall Smith's Ladies No. 1 Detective books.

After thinking about it, I guess it has something to do with my American sensibilities whilst reading British mystery writers. Dunno. But setting that aside, the writing is fantastic, the characters pop out of the book and run around -- in fact, sometimes you ARE the characters -- the humor is my cup of tea (so to speak), and the various ""case histories"" are fascinating and extremely well drawn. As the book progresses, the author takes what appear to be three/four unrelated ""cold"" cases, and as Jackson Brodie, our flawed self-flagellating protagonist picks up these cases and begins to investigate, the threads start to weave together into a tapestry, getting more drawn together and intricate as the pages fly by. And they did fly by. But the way the tapestry ended up being resolved left me a bit unsatisfied, and I won't say more in case some of you decide to read this. And I would encourage anyone who likes great character development, interesting/flawed protagonists, and mysteries to give this a whirl.

And the characters who weren’t, were the abused.

He goes on back to the homestead (yes, I know it has a proper name, but not coming to me now) and leaves without ever really talking to her. Or something like that.

(It has been several years since I read it.) Since the literary detectives are fairly low-level in the MI branches (oh yeah, this all takes place in England), our protagonist, Thursday Next [see how clever! see how British!], has to team up with other low-level detectives, such as vampire and werewolf hunters.This is just fun and imaginative and well worth anyone's time.

I kinda want to give them 5-stars, and maybe I should, but reading them tires me in some way. Maybe that is because I stay up late into the wee hours reading them. I really like inserting dragons into history, and this series does it well. But it is much more than just making sense (and fun) of Victorian sensibilities. Actually, the author does a very good job of putting you inside the head of someone who believes dearly in honor, the Crown, and the superiority of British civilization, while having him over time come to the realization that many of these very conventional foundations are rotten. Civil rights for dragons. For women. And he comes to realize that in this book via his exposure to Chinese civilization – which, if my stereotypes hold, was and is not the most favorable toward women…but in this book, women’s rights in China are a byproduct of the Chinese reverence for dragons…so, take it where you can get it.In between the (aerial, as in on the back of dragons in flight) swordfights is political intrigue – the rather obvious plodding politics of Britain in the Victorian age, the more sophisticated politics of the Chinese Emperor’s Court (which are complicated by the related dragon issues, as compared to the British who assume they are superior to dragons, just like they are to everyone and everything else on the planet) play out. (Someday, I’ll figure out a way to express my run-on parenthetical thoughts without destroying the underlying sentence, but obviously, that day is not yet here.)So, enjoyable and a lot of food for thought. Will Laurence, the annoyingly endearing British Naval officer converted to dragon handler, is moving through a lot of evidence to refute his heretofore unassailable belief in everything he has held dear and it will be interesting to see if he will use this knowledge to better the situation of dragons and women in Britain, or at least try. And for his dragon Temeraire, this is a nice if very unusual coming-of-age story….imagine a brilliant mind and adolescence in a 20 ton dragon and you get the idea….but Temeraire has a much clearer view of the world, and it is through his questioning of duty and Crown and everything else that Will is growing beyond what he has always “known” as the truth.I look forward to the other books in the series, but I need a break from dragons for a couple of days…the (necessary) slaughter of many beeves, sheep, and tunnies (tuna) that is required to sustain dragons wears on me.

It was charming, informative (about things that are of little or no interest generally, but become so with this author), playful, snarky, and above all, affectionate in the portrayal of the settlers/citizens of the hamlet of Stay More, Arkansas. (Happily referred to as Stay Morons.) I have to admit to a personal bias here, having been born in northwest Arkansas to a native Arkansan and a DamnYankee (who had only ventured out of the Hudson Valley to attend the University of Arkansas). Although we left for the Hudson Valley when I was very young, I have always had a somewhat romanticized notion of my Ozarks roots, and this book addresses many of my preconceptions. But even without that, this is a gifted author who skillfully (and again, very playfully) recounts a fictional history of the Arkansas Ozarks. The gimmick he uses is to begin each chapter with an example of architecture associated with the characters and history to be covered in that chapter. The point isn't the architecture, other than as it reflects the life and times of the people in this historical (but fictional) narrative.Mr. Harington knows whereof he speaks as an architect (at one point he was on the faculty of the University of Arkansas) and as an observer of human nature. And his chapters all start with a drawing of the architectural example for the chapter.An overlay at the beginning of the book is a quote from Frank Lloyd Wright:""The true basis for any serious study of the art of Architecture still lies in those indigenous, more humble buildings everywhere that are to architecture what folklore is to literature or folk song to music and with which academic architects were seldom concerned....These many folk structures are of the soil, natural. Though often slight, their virtue is intimately related to the environment and to the heartlife of the people. Functions are usually truthfully conceived and rendered invariably with natural feeling. Results are often beautiful and always instructive.""A wonderful book that I thought about a lot both while I was reading it and after I finished it.

The prose is uncomplicated and straightforward, with a good ear for dialogue. The book begins as the older brother returns home after three years of service in the military, a good deal of which was spent in combat. While unspecified, the desert played a large part, so you can infer where the combat occurred. And you realize it doesn’t matter. Combat changes people forever, whenever and wherever experienced. The characters are well developed, especially the younger brother and his two best friends.As the older brother struggles to come to terms with his experiences, he isolates himself from the world, locking himself in his room for days, refusing to ride in cars (or buses or taxis or trains), and rejecting overtures from his family and old girlfriend. The younger brother desperately wants things to be as they were “before”. The journey (literally and figuratively) to connect with his brother leads to his growing understanding, and finally acceptance, that the past is not recoverable. And the end of the younger brother’s journey provides for the beginning of the older brother’s journey to recovery.Another interesting point of contrast in the book is between this generation's experience of military service and the experience of the parents (and even grandparents) of the brothers. The brothers are modern day young adults, so military service is unevenly distributed across the population, and is very unusual in their middle class suburban existence. When the older brother made the decision to join the Marines, his family and friends were horrified...after all, he had been accepted at Cornell, Columbia and Berkeley. So why was it he joined the Marines? In contrast, the father and grandfather of the brothers were Israeli, and their military experience was culturally universal, one that everyone they knew had experienced. Nonetheless, after emigrating to America and raising a family, they were still dismayed that their older son decided to join the military rather than going off to the university of his choice. But the father and the sons actually talked about the differences in expectations and experiences and how that affected their re-entry (or difficulty in re-entry) into ""normal"" society.Finally, like many YA novels, it is also a quick read, and that helped me like it even more…....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Mar 04, 2011","Mar 04, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7507905-the-things-a-brother-knows

It is so comfortable to read his stuff that it partially makes up As much as I love Michael Connelly's writings, this one didn't hit the spot for me. It is so comfortable to read his stuff that it partially makes up for some of the shortcomings. This book features a (relatively) new character, Mickey Haller, a defense attorney. (Haller is first introduced in The Lincoln Lawyer, which is evidently about to be released as a movie with, someone please save us, Matthew McConaughey as Haller. That, in and of itself, is enough reason for me not to see it...and I'm not a particularly discriminating movie-goer, as evidenced by the fact that I intend to see I Am Number Four tomorrow.) Sheesh. Back to the book.The story is tidy, well-laid out, and moves quickly to a reasonably satisfying conclusion. The real problem is that I don’t find Haller a particularly interesting or compelling character. Connelly’s Harry Bosch, however, is both. And he is also in this story, which only serves to make Haller even less interesting than he is.The plot explores the interesting games that defense lawyers and district attorneys play in their respective parts in delivering “justice”. And, just like a lot of Law and Order shows, justice is subverted by the complexities of real life and real people and real problems. Luckily, Connelly’s villain deserves everything coming to him – but it certainly doesn’t happen because of the trial process. I really like Connelly’s clean expository style (if memory serves, he was an LA Times reporter before he started writing full time). Anyway, an easy read, and satisfying – just not the best that Connelly has produced in the past with Harry Bosch. (I do have to acknowledge I almost gave up on Harry Bosch in Connelly’s last book – “Nine Dragons”, I think – because his self-destructive tendencies caused hideous collateral damage.. while his behavior often creates havoc, but it was to an extreme that made me a bit ill in that book.)...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Feb 21, 2011","Feb 21, 2011",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7936809-the-reversal

The ending of that novel/movie was when his protagonist made an awful choice between two options (bad and much worse – he picked much worse) by returning four-year-old Amanda to her skank of a mother after taking her from a wonderful couple (that, it has to be noted, had kidnapped Amanda) who loved her and were raising her with love, affection, and stability -- circumstances her mother was notably unable to provide. Lehane is an incredibly skilled author – he specializes in exploring the uncomfortable seam between our system of justice and justice itself – and if you think they are remotely related, you haven’t read Lehane. His protagonist, Patrick Kenzie, is a “good” man who leaves a trail of grief and havoc wherever he ventures. Anyway, now-sixteen-year-old Amanda has disappeared again, and Patrick once again goes in search. In this search, he introduces his usual cast of thugs and psychos, some of whom are also “good” guys – a Russian hitman, who’d a thunk it? – and truly bad guys, who are often people in authority in various bureaucracies – cops, social workers, etc.I don’t know if Lehane takes all readers out of their comfort zones. He certainly does me. And while I rated this a four-star – as much for sentimental reasons about Amanda’s resolution as his skill, I do have to confess I am getting a bit tired with the “my Boston thugs are way tougher, meaner, more psychotic than your thugs”. Not to mention the unbelieveable skanks (I really don’t use that word a lot); maybe I saw this too soon after “The Fighter” which brought to the screen true skankiness in the form of the mother and the seven sisters of the titular hero. And again, from Boston (OK, Lowell, but close enough)….So, if you like Lehane and you can deal with his unrelenting violence, read this.

And one of the things he does best is coming-of-age stories, especially with adolescent misfits as the protagonists. “The Lost Gate” has such a misfit, Danny North. Danny is the only kid in his village who can’t do magic. He is smart and athletic and funny, but he can’t do the simplest magic. Sadly for Danny, magic is not only the most valued skill, but also the ticket to success and status in his community. So Danny feels pretty sorry for himself until one day he figures out he CAN do magic – unfortunately, it is the one kind of magic that is forbidden; and they aren’t kidding around. If his elders discover he can do this particular kind of magic, he will have to be killed. So, of course, he is discovered and has to flee. And thus the story begins.I wasn’t as stunned by this book as I was by “Ender’s Game”, but not much has the kind of impact that book had. And I like that Card is developing this as a basis for a series – not dependent trilogies, but books you can read and not be pissed off because it ends in a cliff hanger.If you like fantasy, this is a nice easy, fairly quick read. And Card has a real ear for dialog, especially adolescent patter. And snark.Warning: maybe it was just me, but I did get a bit confused in the last third of the book when Danny’s skills are advancing so quickly I had trouble keeping up…but I think a lot of this is laying the groundwork for subsequent books in a “Mithermages” series.

After slogging through 766 pages, there is this nonconclusive series of depressing events that happen to several of the main protagonists on the last few pages.

And while I love sci-fi and mindless thrillers, I don't like horror, and this verges into that territory with the creatures (called smokes by the civilian survivors, and dracs by the military survivors) that prey upon our intrepid heroes and heroines. I DO love the geeky detail of surviving -- how will we keep the lights on, folks (and lights are VERY important to survival in this book)? The reason for the survival colony being near San Gorgonio Pass is that's where all those wind turbines are, and they keep on trucking (not without significant maintenance, mind you, but nonetheless). But OMG! Those batteries are not very good at holding a charge after 100 years, so a contingent of our plucky survivors must head out on a cross country journey where they will be snacked on by the smokes/dracs and have many, many close calls and assorted adventures!! My favorite character is Michael, a mechanical/electrical/computer programming genius, affectionately nicknamed ""Circuit"" by the civilian survivors, and ""Lugnut"" by the miltary guys. Turns out he prefers ""Lugnut"" to ""Circuit"". Who knew?Also, this is being marketed as a vampire book. And while the creatures certainly have some ""classic"" vampire qualities - fangs, sunlight kills them [into smoke - get it???] -- they seem more like (fast) zombies. And I really don't like zombies. Or reading about them, or watching movies with them. Vampires, sometimes yes. If they are witty and cultured... And no, I don't mean Twilight. I don't think much of sensitive vampires with teenage angst.So if I had known this was part 1 of a trilogy and about vampires, I probably wouldn't have picked it up.

Berger is probably best known for Little Big Man, and his cynicism shines brightly in this send-up of the King Arthur legend. The problem for me was that while each page was in and of itself hilarious, the literary and historical references demonstrated for me that while my education was good enough to recognize that they were in fact references, my education was not good enough to appreciate them without a little digging/research. I like a good King Arthur story (for me by far the best take is the trilogy by Jo Walton, starting with The King's Peace -- the best of the trilogy) as much as the next person, or more than about 95 out of 100 persons, but clearly there are those who must be into it WAY more than I am (that 5% is INTENSE about their Arthur).At any rate, as I said, each page shines. It is the totality that wore me out. In fact, I didn't finish the book, and that almost never happens. I'm pretty compulsive about finishing books.

For those of you who adore Jane Austen and/or Pride and Prejudice (I adore Colin Firth and Matthew Macfadyen, not so much Austen) you might get a kick out of this. The novel purports to be the diary of Mr. Darcy during the same time period that the events of Pride and Prejudice unfold. The guy's point of view, as it were.Unfortunately, it brings to life in excruciating detail, the point that Mr. Darcy is a bore. First an arrogant bore, then a sympathetic bore. And Lord Byron is a real a-hole. Passionate, funny, misogynistic, slovenly, self-absorbed. Not someone you would want to spend time with, especially if you are female, or a young boy.And sadly, while I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice, there were aspects of it that bothered me a lot. This book brings all of those warts forward without the charm. Even understanding that P & P was written in class-riven 18th century England, I still had trouble with the relationships between the landed gentry (poor and wealthy alike) and their servants. This book reflected those sensibilities, consistent with P & P. Example -- Mr. Darcy, spending some time at Lord Byron's, has difficulties because his own valet was injured and unable to accompany him to Byron's, and Mr. Darcy was crippled in performing his toilette because no one brought him hot water and he (gasp) had to dress himself without assistance. (Note: Byron has servants, but they perform services of a much more personal nature than getting dressed, if you get my drift....)Anyway, I really liked the concept, but I kept waiting to be entertained.

I think the plot was less cluttered, and more fast paced. But I found myself annoyed at the author's penchant for brand names and specifications for all of the toys his protagonists use. I don't really need to know what the make and model computer, car, Ikea specifications, etc etc. In fact, the technology specifications in particular make the book seem dated. Written in 2003 or so, the exponential growth in technology over the last 7 years really screams out at some points, whereas if he had just made more generic references, it might not leap out so much. That said, this book is a great read, and it was probably a good choice to be my first ""Kindle"" book.

Wonderful movie, wonderful book.Russo can write. His prose is full of biting wit and clear-eyed development of tragically flawed yet sympathetic characters, such as the aforementioned Sully. And it rings true to my memory of the people I grew up with in that town. The retired 80 year old school teacher (8th grade English), Beryl Peoples, reminiscing at one point about her former students (""the militantly unteachable"") and her deceased husband (""Clive Sr. had not been a profoundly stupid man, but he missed his fair share of what Miss Beryl referred to as life's nuances..."").. She also understands herself well, and acknowledges to herself [heaven forbid, not to others:] that she has learned to trust her own judgment by questioning others' judgments..And Sully. What a wonderful character. I think I would have loved him even without seeing Paul Newman in my mind's eye. He is charming and obnoxious. Hard-working and a true screwup. He is also Miss Beryl's tenant, much to the chagrin of her own son, who has always been threatened by Sully and has grand designs on Miss Beryl's house, if he can only get her out of it. The heart of the book and movie is the relationship between these two unlikely, but true friends. They have honest respect and affection for each other and it shines like a new penny.This is not plot-driven prose. While there is a plot, it meanders to a non-conclusive conclusion.

The search was recent (2005), the disappearance was in 1925. In my youth, I relished a kind of ""literature"" that included Conan Doyle's ""The Lost World"", much of Jules Verne's stuff, and the Tarzan and Mars books by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Well, Percy Harrison Fawcett (and if that doesn't scream Victorian gentleman to you, you probably have no idea what I'm talking about...) was a REAL Victorian explorer who became obsessed with finding ""The Lost City of Z"" - better known as El Dorado in Amazonia. On his umpteenth trip in 1925, he disappeared, along with his son and a friend of his son's. It was quite the media sensation at the time, since he had been sending regular dispatches, that just... stopped. The author, a writer for the New Yorker, became interested in the story and went on his own quest. Part of the book is his own growing obsession, and his absolute incompetence in undertaking this pursuit. (He comments that at an REI store, the clerk who was helping him sort through the possible offerings, ventured to guess that ""you've never been camping, have you?"") The book is also an interesting compendium of the horrors one could suffer in this kind of exploration -- the pestilence, the possible accidents one can have while wielding a machete, the critters, and starvation in the most life-filled places on earth; all serving to reinforce my preferred status of armchair exploring. My only reason for not giving this 5 stars is my own preference for tauter, plot-drive novels. However, this isn't that kind of a book, and perhaps the meandering is not only understandable, but necessary, for the telling of the tale.

This is the second book that focuses on Pike and makes him more three-dimensional. Not really, more like two and a quarter dimensional. And Crais' previous book about Pike, The Watchman, did it better. Nonetheless, Crais writes a good page turner -- this one is about very bad people from Eastern Europe who learned their craft in places like Odessa and Bosnia.I also appreciated the fact that he dedicated this book to Harlan Ellison, who is a science fiction writer that has turned out some wonderful stuff. Crais also lists some other folks by first name who are clearly science fiction writers also.

No murder mystery here, just a thriller about a potential assassination in which you aren't sure who to root for or against. This book, like Farthing, is set in post WW2, where England and Hitler reached an agreement to co-exist and the USA never entered the war (under President Lindbergh...).The truly creepy, scary stuff in this book is not about the potential assassination.

However, I am reluctant to recommend it to anyone because it was NOT an easy read. It is an alternative telling of the legend of King Arthur, complete with Welsh nomenclature, such as the term ""caer"" for identifying cities/town, e.g. Caer Sacramento, and the naming of people after their fathers with the ""ap"" form, e.g. Glee ""ap Stanley"". Plus the story breaks several conventions with the ""traditional"" Arthurian lengends. So for a long time reading the book, it felt just a little ""off"" as my brain tried to translate...e.g. ""Isarnagan"" is this world's term for Ireland, ""Vincans"" are Romans etc. It is both rich and dense at once -- somewhat like reading Lord of the Rings -- you just have to adapt to the nomenclature to get into it.That being said, it is a fascinating world, and describes the conflicts and efforts of King Urdo (Arthur) to reconcile two cultures -- early Christianity with a variety of well-established paganism, all of which are very rooted in the physical aspects of the land.If you are a sucker for Arthurian legend, early (roughly 6th century) English history, and the military aspects of early greathorse cavalaries, this is your book.

There are aspects of this book that clearly deserve 5 stars, and others not so much. Roughly speaking, the book consists of three parts: (1) childhood in Hawaii and Indonesia and back to Hawaii, (2) as a community organizer in Chicago, and (3) looking for roots in Kenya. I liked the first part, was bored and irritated through much of the second part, and absolutely transported by the third part.In the first part, Obama describes becoming slowly aware of his “otherness”. What I found intriguing about it was that I believe that he is relating a much more universal experience in that virtually all of us come through our childhoods certain that we “don’t fit in”, or that we are awkward, or lacking in some way. To me, that is everyone’s story – the reason for that it is the “all about me” perspective for those pre-adult formative years. It is only with the gift of hindsight that you can see what things probably really looked like from a view somewhat larger than what is in front of your own nose.The second part was heart-breaking but oddly tedious. I think the points that he was trying to make about what might or might not shape a community, especially as seen from the black, African-American experience, were so cerebral as to lose much of the meaning. Maybe I had trouble with it because I am not black, but I think as a woman I know some of the underlying fear that is a constant presence in situations that might or might not be threatening…usually involving moderate to large amounts of testosterone…But the third part was lyrical and heart-breaking. The description of his travels in Kenya to meet his cousins, half-siblings (of which there are many), aunts, uncles, and the ultimate discovery of who his father was and what had shaped him was incredibly poignant.

I love the way Sarah Vowell writes -- snarky enlightenment. Her research/scholarship is only exceeded by her ability to recast weighty events into Valley Girl speak. This book is about pilgrims, not THE Mayflower ones but the arguably more important ones, the 1630 Arbella contingent that settled Boston and was led by John Winthrop. A typical Vowell rendering of one of the sendoff speeches by the reverend John Cotton: ""Cotton's sermon is titled 'God's Promise to His Plantation'. He begins with one of the loveliest passages from the book of Second Samuel, an otherwise R-rated chronicle of King David's serial killer years. Chapter 7, verse 10: 'I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and I will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more'. Sounds so homey, like that column in the real estate section of the New York Times about how people found their apartments. Until I remember that talk like this is the match still lighting the fuses of a thousand car bombs."" See what I mean about her writing? And this is from page 2.The problem I'm having is that she is essentially writing a column or a long essay (sort of New Yorker length) but goes on for 250 pages. I sit there and am enlightened and laughing out loud, but the 15th time it begins to wear. It is somewhat like watching one of your very favorite half-hour TV sitcoms that has been ""brought to the big screen"". Imagine if they'd tried to make a movie out of Cheers. Or more on point, Seinfeld. But this is comedy combined with Masterpiece Theater and the (good parts of) History Channel.Anyway, I'd recommend it and dare you not to laugh out loud and then feel ashamed of yourself.Vowell is really good, but overall this kept feeling like a dozen or more columns strung together making mostly the same points, but each one wonderful....the sum was less than the whole of its parts, I guess I'd have to say.There's a lot of fascinating stuff in here -- she is a wonderful researcher and brings you along to the musty library reading rooms with their devoted librarians and the treasures they guard. Not to mention the cheesy motels in Plymouth with the Mayflower replicas, complete with the water slide out of the hold into the motel pool....and a truly hilarious encounter between her nephew (who seems quite a bit like Sarah herself) and a ""Pilgrim Archie Bunker"" - one of those role players in the ""authentic"" village recreations...Her writing is incredibly informative and laugh out loud funny/tragic.I don't usually go on at such length, but I wanted to share my dilemma with the book......more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"May 18, 2009","May 18, 2009",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2845287-the-wordy-shipmates

Example: the protagonist's explanation of his reluctance to try hypnosis to recover some repressed memories:""I'm deeply suspicious of anything with a whiff of the New Age about it -- not because of the practices themselves, which as far as I can tell from a safe distance may well have a lot to them, but because of the people who get involved, who always seem to be the kind who corner you at parties to explain how they discovered that they are survivors and deserve to be happy.

I guess you'd call it a thriller and a murder mystery. It took me a while to get into it, because it was written by a Swedish author and tranlated into British English.

The observations about race and gender are still powerful, but 2008 is pretty different from 1976. However, the comparisons between the status of blacks in the 19th century (in the south, pre-Civil War) to 2008 (or 1976) are still pretty valid. I read a lot of scifi, but this only uses a convention of scifi (time travel) as a plot device and never attempts to explain how it happens, etc. Nonetheless, the point is to explore a modern (1976 California) black woman's experiences when transported back in time to an 1815 plantation in Maryland, and that is undeniably powerful. If you can get past that (and I can because one of my favorite-of-all-time series is Outlander which uses exactly the same device to send a ""modern"" woman back to 18th century Scotland), you will enjoy this book.

While I hugely enjoyed them the first time, I think I am enjoying them even more this time around, especially the later ones, such as this one. The first time through, I was so enthralled with Jamie and Claire that I was actually impatient with the ""side"" stories of Roger and Brianna, and in fact, was pretty annoyed with Brianna most of the time. This time through, I am enjoying them as characters in their own right. Also, I am realizing that there were a number of plot threads that I gave short shrift to, which now are much more meaningful. As I move to the next two volumes, however, I have a different worry. I originally read the books in print form. On the re-reading, I have done them all in e-book form. Now, as I move on to ""A Breath of Snow and Ashes"" and ""An Echo in the Bone"", I actually own them in hardcover, and I've gotten spoiled by not having to lug them around. It will be a good test for me. I once had trouble believing that I would ever enjoy reading in electronic form, and now I'm dreading print. (Mostly because of the size of these books, however.
