In fact it is nothing short of excruciating—in a good way. This is how it is when the truth, with all its contradictions, fear, love, and deceit, is the story. Through the tale of a Canadian Jew (her father is Jewish; her mother is not; so by Jewish law, her Jewishness is a choice) studying in Israel who falls in love with a young Israeli soldier, Rebecca Sacks writes the whole mess of Israel vs. Palestine, Jewishness, the Israeli army, racism, fear, rigidity, unfairness, and desperate young love that is a prayer to the Big Love—to exist above the fray, and finally the choice to live “on the wrong side of history.”Everybody is real and has a point you can identify with. Everybody is right at some point that gets so distorted it veers into wrong. Nothing is simple. And thus, the excruciating pain.This leads me to wonder if people take extremist positions in an attempt to avoid this pain of almost ripping apart from understanding the humanity and worth of everybody. When you blindly justify killing—Palestinians or Jews—you wipe out the truth of everybody’s pain and humanity.I am a writer who read this book in the midst of my literary environment roiling with a tsunami of antisemitic extremism that I never dreamed could happen. (I will put some links to stories about this at the end of this , in case you are not informed about the recent happenings.)I read this book while progressive liberals are canceling writers who want to write both sides of the story. Both sides, with people hurting, is now cause for blanket condemnation. This too hurts, but there is no love involved. I’d rather hurt from a true story that sees that all people are whole and hurting and loving and desperate and responsible for choosing extremism and inhumanity because it simply allows them a sense of power. I’d rather get ripped apart and expanded by that.This book is that kind of truthful work. It is not predictable, so assume nothing and allow it to take you and hurt you. You’ll grow from it.______________To read about the literary community and antisemitism: https://michelle-cameron.com/2024/03/...To read about the brouhaha at Guernica magazine over publication, then cancellation of a gorgeous essay by Israeli translator Joanna Chen about her efforts to aid hurting people on both sides of the conflict, as well as writer Meghan Daum’s experiences in an MFA culture where people are silenced before they can write: https://meghandaum.substack.com/p/gue...A solution, Peace Lovers Unite: https://www.betsyrobinson-writer.com/......more",Notes are private!,4,14,1,"Mar 27, 2024","Apr 04, 2024","Mar 24, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/63241100-the-lover

It'll be out July 2nd, but it's available for preorder wherever you like to buy books and e-books.BlurbDespite his psychic gifts, healing teacher Joshua Gardner never saw student Harmony Rogers coming. Cats on a Pole is the story of two psychically-gifted people who are isolated—like cats stuck up on a telephone pole. But their belief that they don’t fit in actually makes them more like most people than either of them will acknowledge. A passionate love affair without physical contact, a battle of wills without speech, a psychic duel between male and female equals who have, for the first time, met their match. Cats on a Pole is an intense, sexy, sometimes funny, metaphysical love story that “outs” the insecurities we all have, exposing our overwhelming commonality.Book Trailer of inspiration for Cats on a Pole...more",Notes are private!,2,7,1,not set,not set,"Mar 15, 2024",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/205682052-cats-on-a-pole

I didn’t believe I could finish it in the space of a library Our Hidden Conversations is an almost 3 lb., 9.5x7.75-inch, 471-page world of all of us. I didn’t believe I could finish it in the space of a library loan, so I posted an early , which I’m replacing with this one now that I have indeed slurped it down well before its due date.This is us. This is everybody—all races, genders, the whole mess.The book is packed with remarkable stories, history, analysis, and real-people quotes. (It’s the perfect follow-up to Isabel Wilkerson's The Warmth of Other Suns, which I just ed.)From a section by author Michele Norris:""I find it deeply ironic that there is such a fierce battle to evade and erase historical teachings about slavery because, in the time of enslavement, there was such an assiduous effort to document and catalog every aspect of that institution, much in the way people now itemize, assess, and insure their valuables. The height, weight, skin color, teeth, hair texture, work habits, and scars that might help identify anyone who dared to flee were documented. The menstrual cycles of enslaved women and their windows of fertility—because producing more enslaved people produced more wealth—were entered like debits and credits in enslavers' ledgers."" (178)Michele Norris’s commentary is wise, compassionate, objective, and elucidating, and the effect of all these stories—they came out of Norris’s The Race Card Project which invited people to send postcards with 6-word thoughts on race—is to showcase how much we all have in common. Everybody is pained by being judged and put in boxes they don’t identify with, asked ignorant questions, insulted by others’ lack of understanding that they are even being insulting. Everybody is in this book, and so that includes plenty of White people who tell their stories of difficulty and deprivation. There are first-person accounts of the struggles we have at other people’s assumptions, biases, and projections. Black, White, Native, Arab, Middle Eastern, Asian, mixed-race people and families, adoptees and adopters, gay people, people with disabilities, poor people, White men who are turned down because of being White men. Nobody is left out. And it seems that most of us believe that nobody but similar people with difficulties really understands what we face.But the more I read, the more it came clear that if you are abled and White and from a marginalized place (poor, don’t speak the language without an accent, gay, uneducated, from extreme dysfunction and/or deprivation), you still have an option to change your situation that non-White and disabled people do not have. You can get an education, change your accent, learn a language, get therapy, change your ethnic name, work four jobs, learn what you don’t know. I’m not saying this is easy or fair, but still you do not face what disabled people and people who are not White face just because of their appearance. Many of the people in this book, and many of us, seem to think hardship is a contest. This book puts that in perspective in a way that everybody will receive or not receive according to their openness.It is hard not to quote large sections of this book, but suffice it to say that Norris’s essay about lynching (pp. 382-384) is a work of monstrous art. That this practice was legal for so many years, that the pride and display associated with doing it were common should turn all of our stomachs. (Personally, it hits me the same as the Nazis’ proud mass extermination of Jews, complete with saving relics and records of the acts.) This, too, is us, and to quote the last line of the essay: “If you are unwilling to do this work [acknowledge, face, and discuss this truth]—and it is work—then leave the word [lynching—and I would add: any comparison or debate about equivalent suffering or proclamation of innocence, which is totally moot and has zero to do with what should be a communal disgust at what did happen] alone. (384)” [I apologize for that long interrupted quote, but I’m steaming and am not going to edit it out.]I have certainly heard many of the stories in this book from individuals, but there is something incomparably powerful about having them gathered here together, along with color plates and commentary from every kind of person. And what comes into the sharpest focus is the necessity to know everybody’s story, know true history, and thereby empathize rather than defend or compete to have had a worse or equivalent hardship. I think everybody could benefit from reading this book. I certainly did....more",Notes are private!,6,18,1,Mar 2024,"Mar 09, 2024","Mar 01, 2024",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/191004852-our-hidden-conversations

My feelings of love and grief and agony were all equal. One morning right after I'd entered the park and was making my way up West Drive, two women came toward me. I had just curled around Maya in a quick kiss and I saw one woman react--BIG. ""Can I take your photo?"" she asked as we got nearer. Numb, I assented. I didn't pose or smile.

Likewise, I usually abandon books where the writing is decent, but the voice, topic, or way of storytelling isn’t awful, but it’s just not my thing.Claire Oshetsky’s work hits my favorite head: “admiring, somewhat larcenous, writer’s head.” This is a place where I’m gulping down the story, while also admiring the writing or technique so much that another part of me is whispering, “There is something I want to steal here.

And because it works—switching voices, times, points of view, locales seemingly willy-nilly—there is no way to tell how Oshetsky worked it out.Simply put, Claire Oshetsky is a brilliant, inspired storyteller.

And yet I read every word of it. Screw the fact that I understood very little and retained even less of the specifics. I weirdly enjoyed this explanation of a science that basically is a never-ending quest with no definitive answers.Although the comprehensiveness of every section and topic was exhausting, there were so many times when information suddenly burst into light for me, compelling me to highlight it, stop reading, and try to digest it.The general message seems to be that everything is dependent on everything else—genetics, environment, experiences, etc.—context, context, context! And there is no simple consistent predictive power of genetics. The brain and human beings are incredibly malleable and adaptive. So my take-away is screw my lousy childhood and scrambled genetic mess. I’m so lucky to have such an active brain. And if I decide to change, I can. I have. And I will continue to. So for me this was an incredibly optimistic look at neuroscience and behavior.Second takeaway: Our brains work on automatic, so most people have no idea why they think what they think. They just believe their thoughts and judgments. And since most of the world will never slog through the neuroscience of thinking and behaving, we may be doomed. Our unconscious rules and it is a far more destructive machine with far worse potential than AI. On the other hand, Robert Sapolsky wrote a book that can change people. It can remind us of our potential, of the potential of individual people to change the world with an action. I’m grateful to him for writing this book and I’m grateful for anyone who reads it. It can only make us better to understand how out of rational control we are and how our ignorance of this keeps us arrogant and deluded.Caveat: The captive animal studies and torture we humans obliviously subject other species to in the name of learning made me queasy....more",Notes are private!,2,10,1,"Dec 19, 2023","Jan 30, 2024","Dec 19, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/31170723-behave

Like her other work, its singular mission is to lift readers up, let them know their worth and beauty, and help them to understand what might be getting in the way of their happiness.Beauty Thieves opens with dead spirits talking, a woman lying in a dark pit, and incubuses hovering above longing to attack her, and proceeds into a typical relationship tale of said woman handing her power to a controlling boyfriend, and from there to a supernatural adventure of good vs. evil.What’s not typical of this kind of story is that it’s being told as a kind of teaching parable—a spiritual/supernatural story complete with a “chosen” Black female superhero on a mission to save beauty.Full disclosure: I am not remotely objective about Bertice Berry. I’ve been part of her Stories to Tell Facebook group for a couple of years and am about to travel hundreds of miles to the top of a mountain to attend my second workshop with her. That said, what I admire most about this story is that she is practicing something she explained in one of her daily video stories (I’m too lazy to find the link, but she has a YouTube channel). In the story she talks about something she learned from a well-known comic when she was touring doing standup (yes, she was, for a time, a comic). He was Black and he got a mixed audience laughing at the same stuff; the Black people laughed from the inside of the material and maybe some white people did too, but not necessarily. Even if white people didn’t understand what he was talking about from the inside, there was a level of stuff that was still funny enough for them to guffaw just as hard as the Black people. Bertice wanted to know how he did this. He explained about levels: (I’m paraphrasing from memory) every story was multi-leveled and the trick was to have every level tell a truth. So people could laugh no matter what level they lived at (and I’m saying “at” instead of “on” purposely; you’ll understand that, depending on your level). Some people knew all the levels, so they probably laughed hardest. But even if somebody didn’t know the existence of levels other than their own, there was something for them in the material.That is what Bertice Berry does with this simple, commercial, paranormal/religious/spiritual/whatever-you-want-to-call-it story. I’m not religious or even sure there is a being that I would call God—my experience is that there is an All That Is that fits no word—yet I had no problem with all the Christian stuff, and there is a lot of it—so probably Christians will relate to this aspect in ways I can’t. I’m white, but this is also a Black story for Black people, and I felt welcomed into that. I don’t relate to Biblical good vs. evil scenarios, but I had no problem with the appearance of an incubus and a nasty energy-eating monster.In other words, this story is written in chords. I used to be a very bad violin player, and we called them “double stops” which is what this whole text feels like: part Buffy, the Vampire Slayer if Buffy were a Black sociologist/TV talk show host; part Biblical horror stories which I’m not educated in; part no-name understanding of the way energy works (that’s my level); and I’m sure much more that I’m not picking up on—there’s something for everybody.Some of the chord notes are not my usual fare, but I support anything Bertice Berry does to lift people en masse. And I’m certain there are hoards of church-going, Bible-educated people who will benefit from this book....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Sep 27, 2023","Sep 28, 2023","Sep 27, 2023",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/199184543-beauty-thieves

Author Sarah Everts investigates every aspect of sweat and sweat-contiguous subjects, not all of which interested me, so I skimmed or skipped certain parts. For instance, a long history of saunas, the section on various devices to monitor health through analysis of sweat, a whole chapter on perfume, and several other sections. However, when she spent time on smell—of course relating it to sweat because smelling is how we receive the information—I was mesmerized. Likewise, a chapter on an “odor artist” who recreates smells of historical places and times and conditions. My interest went in and out in the chapter on deodorants. My mother was a copywriter and used to say if you could get people to believe advertising, you could control what they think. The marketing of deodorants and antiperspirants is a case in point; it played on people’s insecurities and thereby created a market (one that I have no doubt is expanding with the recent tsunami of advertising for a host of new whole-body deodorant products for places most people never thought of as requiring such a thing). I’m convinced that my olfactory system has more in common with canines than humans, and after reading about it here, I suspect I simply have more receptors in my nose than the average human, and so I loved reading about smells of diseases (I can smell cancer, etc.), and other things that dogs pick up when tracking smells. I loved learning there is a job for people with my ability: sensory analysts who test all kinds of things. Everts writes as a journalist, telling first-person stories about her research trips and adventures (nude group theater-watching in a sauna!), and it’s entertaining.

When I was at book #18, I met the man when he spoke on a panel here in NYC where I live. I’d broughJames is the 22nd book I read by Percival Everett. When I was at book #18, I met the man when he spoke on a panel here in NYC where I live. I’d brought my copy of Erasure for him to sign. I’d chosen carefully—the newest looking of his books on my shelf. I wanted to present him with something pristine.After the panel discussion, I crept out of the audience, around the circle of panelists’ chairs, and, like a teenager with crush, smelling my own sweat, I said, “Mr. Everett, would you sign my book?” He couldn’t have been more affable. And as he wrote, I blurted, “I’ve read 18 of your books.” “Oh, so you’re the one!” he joked, a line I sensed he used a lot to those of us in what was then a small cult of fans. Undeterred, I further blurted, “When I first discovered your work, I felt like my head exploded.”He smiled kindly and handed me my paperback, fully aware that I was as in love with him as a reader can be from only an author’s books, and I didn’t know what to do with the feelings.Every one of Everett’s books is different, but having read so many, I feel like all of them have led to James. James is far more accessible than a lot of his other books, and it is perfectly timed to convey his essence to the huge audience he has “suddenly” evoked due to a movie based on Erasure that he had virtually nothing to do with. (I have not seen it because I like the edge in his books, his anger, his uncompromising intellect—even when it is over my head—and his refusal to mitigate any of it with anything that would make his work more accessible, and I’ve heard that the movie softens all that.)What is Percival Everett’s essence?For me, it is the thing that made my head explode on first contact: he is absolutely himself. He refuses to fit into any box, under any label designed by someone else. There is loneliness to this kind of a life. A loneliness that can become a choice because at some point you know that nobody—or very few people—will see you as you know yourself to be. (He writes about this in not only Erasure, but I Am Not Sidney Poitier, Dr. No, God’s Country, and many of his short stories.)In James, he has parsed this out for the masses, using Mark Twain’s Huckleberry Finn as a launch pad. Why this book now?Because it’s legal—The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, written in 1884, is now in the public domain. But more importantly, perhaps because the masses are now open to hearing that Black people are and always have been individual people with individual thoughts, ideas, and peculiarities just like all human beings.This sounds obvious, but in our country it is anything but—proved by the stereotypes that make Black men “dangerous” and all the other notions that weave through our culture. As in many of Everett’s books, James disarms us with humor. There are the fools, the clowns whose cruelty is matched only by their idiocy. As in one of my favorite of Everett’s short stories, “The Appropriation of Cultures” (in his anthology Damned If I Do), there are ingenious absurd yet logically-obvious-except-nobody-has-thought- of-them plot twists. There is the unpredictable picaresque journey (I Am Not Sidney Poitier, Dr. No). And there is also an undertow of “yearning to be seen and known.” (I wrote about how subversive this is in the book-within-the-book of  Erasure; I have no idea if Everett would agree with my take, but it’s what I felt.) This is what gives Everett’s books a subliminal heartbeat . . . and it hurts—in a good way.New in this book, although there are aspects of it in other books, is the utter exhaustion of the code-switching Black people have learned by necessity by the time they have social interactions. And, here, that is married to the exhaustion of living in a slave culture of “duplicity, dishonesty or perfidy (195)” where you can’t tell who is telling the truth or who might act like an ally but turn out to be the worst kind of enemy. But because of Everett’s genius, reading James is never exhausting and always entertaining.And for me, the newest aspect of this book is a full pulsing catharsis—set up by the ending of his remarkable God’s Country in 1994, delivered in an almost mythical form in 2021 in Trees, and finally, in James, experienced through the heart of a man who loves his wife and young daughter, who loves the son who didn’t know him as a father, and loves life enough to fight for it.Oh, my heart!...more",Notes are private!,20,63,1,"Mar 23, 2024","Mar 26, 2024","Jul 15, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/173754979-james

I liked that in a strip club men’s contempt of you was out in the open. In the outside world, misogyny was always hovering in your peripheral vision, meaning you could never quite trust your instincts. In a strip club, groups of men are in a safe space where they’re encouraged to play up to hypermasculine ideas—and because they believe no one in power is watching them they project all their shame and irregular feelings about women onto the strippers, who they believe exist in a vacuum and won’t ever speak out about their behavior or, say, write about it in a tell-all memoir. (180-181) International comedian sensation Fern Brady (who I’d never heard of until actor Bob Odenkirk recommended this memoir on Twitter) has written an educative memoir about learning in adulthood that she is autistic.There was much I resonated with, even though I’m not autistic (I learned that unequivocally). I never have any problem intuiting what is going on in social situations or trusting my instincts, but oh how I resonate with Brady’s hard-won conclusions—as in the case of the above quote.Chapter 13 is a description of what causes a meltdown and a blow-by-blow of an autistic person’s brain experience that anybody who wants to know about autism should read, and it should be a requirement for law enforcement officers who so often are called upon to deal with people going through something they have no understanding of. I give this chapter a standing ovation and wish somebody would base a course on it that would be widely offered. I knew nothing about most of this and I feel as if will affect me for the rest of my life.And the final chapter 14 is perfect.

Through it one can see that Wokeism is nothing new. It dates at least back to 1827 and probably way before:NYS abolished slavery July 4, 1827, Emancipation Day. “To commemorate the event, William Hamilton [a member of the “Black elite,” a successful group of Black people who lived on what is now the Lower East Side of Manhattan] delivered an oration . . . [at a parade] . . . “His voice dripping with sarcasm, he attacked all hypocrisy of the founding fathers, and Thomas Jefferson in particular, whom the nation had paused to commemorate that very day:‘I know that I ought to speak with caution; but an ambidexter philosopher, who can reason contrarywise, first tells you “that all men are created equal, and that they are endowed with the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,” next proves that one class of men are not equal to another, which by the bye, does not agree with axioms in geometry, that deny that things can be equal, and at the same time unequal to one another.’On the spot Hamilton resolved the question that had stumped Peter Williams [another member of the Black elite] some twenty years earlier: How can blacks become Americans? His ready answer was education. “White men,” he angrily intoned, “say you are not capable of the study of what may be called abstruse literature, and that you are deficient in moral character.” But, he asserted, “I feel, I know, that these assertions are as false as hell.”I’m not going to rate this book.

I’ve been reading a lot of history full of pain and statistics. Greg Marshall’s memoir was a welcome and uplifting relief.One complaint: the cover art of a perfectly proportioned naked man bugged the hell out of me. It was chosen by Lithub for a list of best covers for June of this year, but I would love to hear from others who have actually read the book—a book whose title refers to a badly distorted leg and a lifetime of experiences that are affected by that.(By the way, I felt the same thing about the original hardcover of Susan Jane Gilman’s equally hilarious novel The Ice Cream Queen of Orchard Street—a pair of elegant ankles—when a major character feature is the protagonist’s damaged leg/ankle.)Leg’s cover design is striking, but imagine how much more striking it would be if it accurately portrayed what’s inside this fabulous memoir about having Greg’s leg and body’s condition willfully kept from him, being gay, and being part of a family that made all that, as well as cancer, dying, ALS and more hilarious! Not only is the perfectly proportioned man given in front view, but he’s on the back cover in rearview, and as if to put a button on the lie, there is a gorgeous well-muscled leg on the spine. I protest this design and can imagine the endless meetings discussing it: “We can’t show a real crippled body and leg—people won’t buy the book; they’ll be turned off or shocked. Focus groups have shown people may say they are accepting of differently abled people, but when it comes to spending money, after seeing an image of one . . . !” Have the balls (yes, big balls also make several appearances) to match the cover to the daring, irreverent, explicit interior. Trust the reading public to be intrigued and want to read it even more. (If somebody is turned off by an accurate cover, they would probably not be a happy audience for this work.) Because I liked this book so much, every time I picked it up, those pictures felt like an insult, and I can only imagine how a person with a disability would feel.Images matter. If we don’t see it/us/them in artistic representations, it is foreign—even to the people who live with being “different.”Now back to the actual content of this memoir: it is as good and honest as the cover deception is dishonest. It even confronts that kind of dishonesty and how it feels to the one who is betrayed—in a remarkable chapter about a pathological liar. No punches are pulled, nothing is airbrushed, everything is raw, honest, and therefore so funny or heartbreaking. This level of truth is usually one or the other, or, in its most honest form, both.

Where we are now—grappling between remaining a democracy or becoming an authoritarian country—has long roots, and in Parts 1 and 2, she starts at the beginning of American history and follows those roots into global history (mostly chronologically, but when she backtracks—specifically tracing the Nazi rally in Charlottesville, VA, back to its historical beginning—it is organic and easy to follow). Once we advance into the events of the last few years, people who follow the news will already be fully informed, but this is a book that will stand as a valuable history for future readers, so it is great to have all this documented in story form.I cannot possibly reduce this work (or even retain as much as I’d like—this is a book to read multiple times), so suffice it to say: it is readable, fast, understandable, and rather than throwing in absolutely every detail as a lot of historians do, she opts to tell a specific American story efficiently: the story of American democracy—a belief that all people should have equal rights and have a government by their consent.Because I’m interested in why people are so vulnerable to manipulation, power-greediness, and a herd-like compulsion to move with others even when doing so makes no sense and undermines democracy, I was particularly struck the very first time I read about a nonsense statement that split people into warring cultures:[In 1971] Phyllis Schlafly said: “Women’s lib is a total assault on the role of the American woman as wife and mother and on the family as the basic unit of society. Women’s libbers are trying to make wives and mothers unhappy with their career. . . .” (pg. # NA)This kind of statement, assuming that if anybody gets something (or said another way, if everybody gets equal rights), somebody else must lose something, is key to Movement Conservatism (creating rifts between oneself and others who are deemed “bad”) that Cox traces back to 1937. And it is key to the intentional attempt to destroy civil society, establish chaos—which most people will do anything to stop—and thereby lay the foundation for people’s desire for a “strong man” to make it stop, evoking authoritarianism and extinguishing democracy.You could plug into this kind of “this causes that hurt/loss” statement any number of things: true history that includes our racist roots; the right to decide what we do with our bodies; climate change causes; etc. This critical false equivalence (lie), I believe, can only be combatted if people decide to think—use common sense—rather than react in fear of chaos. And common sense is a real possibility: In Part 3 of this book, Cox writes about how powerful common sense was in moving us to independence: Thomas Paine’s pamphlet Common Sense rejected the idea that any man could be born to rule others and called “ridiculous” the notion that an island should rule a continent. “Paine’s spark set to flame more than a decade of accumulating timber,” writes Cox, leading to declarations of independence. The real revolution Americans experienced was in thinking rather than fighting.Here’s my common sense: It is absolute nonsense that women having equal pay and rights could hurt marriages. How? Women who want to be homemakers will not be forced to work. Teaching true history will not hurt white people; I and most white people I know will grapple with questions about our own commitment to what’s right and would we have been strong enough to act as an abolitionist? I don’t know anybody who identifies with slave-holders. If somebody does not want to accept equality and history of inequality, they don’t have to, but true history can still be taught in schools. If somebody doesn’t support the right to body autonomy for themselves, they don’t have to; nobody will ever force them to have an abortion and if they don’t want to make their own medical decisions, they can find some authority to hand responsibility over to. If somebody does not accept that our actions are destroying the earth, they are free to believe that. Yes, pollution regulation will change lives, but I wager that anybody who wants to pollute their home will still be able to do so. Nobody will have to love people they don’t love if others have the right to love who they love. You don’t have to believe what you don’t believe. There is no loss for anybody if more people do better by telling the truth and having equal rights. The whole notion of consequent loss is nuts!And it is on this belief in false equivalencies that this book’s history relies. As Cox writes about Trump’s attack on the Mueller investigation: “if he could get Americans to reject the truth and accept his lies about what had happened, they would be psychologically committed to him.” And this commitment has been expertly cultivated by a string of calculated lies, starting with something as seemingly stupid as inauguration crowd size, all the way up to saying a coup where people were killed and terrorized didn’t happen and insisting an election was stolen in the face of 60 courts and a Republican Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in the United States Department of Homeland Security declaring there was no election fraud. During Trump’s impeachment hearings over obstruction of justice and using the power of the presidency to try to steal an election, the Republicans used their majority to acquit, but Cox writes, “. . . the forty-eight senators who voted to convict Trump represented eighteen million more Americans than the fifty-two Republicans who voted to acquit. It was increasingly obvious that a minority was gaming the system against the majority and that their only hope of retaining power was to repress that majority. (pg. # NA)”This is where we are. But Heather Cox Richardson doesn’t leave us there. Part 3: Reclaiming America begins with a rousing question about whether equality and government by consent is even possible, and ends with a fanfare of all the marginalized individuals who believe in and fight for a more perfect union. It is community, she points out, that is the real backbone of this country: rather than lone cowboys riding the range, it was the barn-raising communities and everybody working together to make life possible. “Working together, across racial lines, ethnic lines, gender lines, and age lines, was what enabled people to defend their rights against a small group of elites determined to keep control of the country. (p. # NA)” This feels like an infusion of oxygen after the dire history in the first half of the book. And I welcomed beginning American history anew in this section, including not only white male founders, but everyone who was here, enumerating their accomplishments and participation in education and innovation, and above all, making vivid their fervid belief that with hard work, they could have the American dream—a belief that was and remains steadfast, despite the concurrent history of denial of their equal rights.Now is not the first time our democracy has been in a fight for its life. In 1863, Cox writes, “. . . Americans had woken up. They realized that the very nature of America was under attack. They were divided among themselves [over slavery] and at first they didn’t really know how to fight back, but ordinary people quickly came to pitch in however they could. . . . Once awake, they found the strength of their majority. (p. #NA)”I believe most of us want a democracy. I believe we are a huge majority—as proved by the 7 million more voters who voted to preserve it rather than support an autocrat in the last election. All that is required to preserve democracy is for the majority to wake up, use common sense, and refuse to mindlessly allow our freedom to be stolen by those who wish to divide us into warring factions based on bogus zero-sum concepts. Heather Cox Richardson has certainly done her part to sound an alarm clock.***I received a free advance reading copy of this book from Penguin Random House.

That’s the fastest way to describe this writing, this story, this world birthed by David James Duncan.For almost 800 pages I’ve been swimming in the Ocean of Sublime—an ocean you can just as easily drown in as float. I’ll get to that in a moment.Second and third thoughts: How the f**k did he write this (let alone get it published) and how on earth can I convey what this is to people who may consider it a foreign language as well as the few humans who live for this stuff?I don’t know the answers to either of those questions. In addition, I don’t know who besides me would be so drawn into this book.I can tell you that there is a mythically romantic tone throughout and there are two main characters who start the book in separate stories in Portland, OR, and Seattle, WA (location is as much a character as any person): a boy-man, Jamey, and a girl-woman, Risa. I can tell you that they are idiosyncratic, independent thinkers who feel even more deeply than they think. I can tell you that Jamey is a people-loving, irrepressible clown with a father and a dog you fall in love with. I can tell you that Risa falls in love with Sanskrit sounds and language and Vedic sages and the whole world they birth and then lives with Grady, the funniest horniest philosophy student ever written, and then with Julian, a good-looking prick who is threatened by her love of “Skrit” and the inner journey. And I can tell you that the first-person narrator feels like a person-god, who I don’t believe in, but he has such a great sense of humor that I more-than-willingly suspended my disbelief. There are plenty of other characters who appear first in their own chapters. For instance: a mountain climber and a singer who love, have a kid, then don’t love; an ex-Jesuit priest and his twin brother, a street nonpriest-sadhu who gathers a flock anyway, whose epistolary history of the Catholic Church’s persecution of the Beguines mesmerized me (if Herman Melville had been this joyfully light-hearted and in love with his history of whales, he could have gotten away with it). And in a symmetry that makes subliminal sense, these people finally begin to converge in the mountains of Montana exactly halfway through this epic in an “Eastern Western”—meaning “When East [spiritual traditions] touches West [the region of the USA], the central struggle is against cosmic illusion . . . (p. # NA)” And this is when the storytelling starts to crank up, so if you get bogged down in the first 400 pages, but are liking it, stay with it . . . particularly because, very soon after the convergence begins, the god-person narrator actually explains the unorthodox structure of this massive book, and hearing it can make you sparkle, as well as spiritually roar in the backtracked scene when Risa and Jamey finally start their journey together.I found out the hard way that I needed to take breaks. Everybody speaks within a style of cascading thoughts, although it’s slightly different for each character. (Think of Shakespeare’s iambic pentameter or Aaron Sorkin’s smart-smart-smart speed-demon, fact-laden intellectual torrents.) When I tried to read too many chapters without a rest, the spiritual stream-of-consciousness became tedious. So subsequently I took many breaks, and when I returned, I was open to the Voice behind the voice and ate it up; I realized taking breaks also evoked contemplation about what I’d read, and it was in contemplation that the heavy text got light and worked on me. Also, there are enough heavenly narrative actions and descriptions (see sample below) to break up the thought tirades.If your life is completely focused on the surface of here and now—plot-plot-plot—and you are uninterested in awareness, enlightenment, or any kind of transcendent journey, let alone the power of the sounds of language beyond its literal meaning, you will not be interested in this book. In fact, you may feel like the distracted bar crowd who “don’t get” what makes Risa, Jamey, and readers like me spiritually roar during their ecstatic convergence over a story of Gandhi’s death.But if you are a person who longs for Oneness, who is compelled by the debate between the counter-evolutionary force of ego vs. the evolutionary force of enlightenment (to embody “free nothingness at Ocean’s [consciousness, All That I] service” (p. # N/A),” if you’re convinced that enlightening yourself is the only real work to be done in this life, if you pace yourself, eagerly surrendering, even to a language that sometimes strikes your poor undereducated head as chicken-scrawled squawks and the poetry of a holy fool (think Paul Beatty’s screamingly hilarious The Sellout, only substitute the literary classics, mountain climbing, and Eastern philosophies for research psychology and The Little Rascals), you may end up in a blindingly brilliant roofless Sun House of indefinable dimensions—happier and more heartbroken than you imagined possible.Writing sample: . . . Jamey espied a seamstress’s shop on Hawthorne Street with a bright-colored, new-looking, hand-painted sign that read: DAMSELS IN THIS DRESS. Typical of his modus operandi at the time, Jamey charged inside to inform whoever thought of the name that he or she was a genius.The woman he found within—perched on a stool at a counter that doubled as her sewing table, hand-stitching spaghetti straps onto an altered prom dress—was the most spherical person Jamey had ever seen, yet also one of the most delicate. She struck Jamey as the thoroughly charming progeny of a Victorian-era porcelain doll and a beach ball—and when he began extolling the shop’s name, the entire orb of her lit up! (page # N/A)Thank you, Hachette Book Group, for the advance reading copy. (You can buy book, audiobook, and e-book at the publisher’s website.) And thank you to very smart marketing people who placed an excerpt (that reads like a short story) in Orion magazine where I first encountered it, lighting a flame inside me that ignited my desire for more.For  readers who may want more—some good advice:“‘Stop chasing your thoughts,’ . . . ‘Watch people closely, the streams of them, without getting diverted by judging them, . . . and you’ll start seeing these little acts of love. They’re everywhere . . .’ (page # N/A)”A compliment: There is not the tiniest speck of commercial concern in either the writing or the publishing of this book that will probably appeal to a small population of readers. If anyone reading my  feels drawn in some subliminal way to this material, I hope you will investigate it.Future: Nature, mountain climbing, and Earth life are central to this 776-page story. Reading it is a marathon. I’m glad I did it, don’t anticipate rereading it, but this book will have a future life with me. Once read, it is the perfect treasure trove for bibliomancy—blindly selecting a section and reading. This works best with hard copies, and since I have an e-book, I can’t let it fall open, point, and read where my finger lands. But I’ll find a way. I’m so glad to own a copy of Sun House.Day after finishing postscriptI am completely shut down. Can't take in anything but music. This has happened to me after life-changing experiences: all I can do is sit and let whatever is going through me do its work. I don't pretend to know what it is and have no desire to know. I can't remember the last time a book did this to me. Thank you, Mr. Duncan.8/15/23 postscriptLast night I watched the Swedish movie As It Is in Heaven made by Kay Pollak (borrowed from the NY Public Library). It is referenced in an amazing scene at the end of Sun House, and seeing it and how much Duncan borrowed from it, repurposing it, allowed me to sink even deeper into this book. I highly recommend seeing the film after reading Sun House....more",Notes are private!,2,65,1,"Jul 25, 2023","Aug 08, 2023","Jun 05, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/64000510-sun-house

A foreboding. But it never played out into anything plot-wise in individual stories. Kleptomania is introduced in one of my favorite stories, but then it was dropped. Another story featured the Alamo, and other than mourning the deaths that took place there, the politics of what happened never made an appearance. However, had a couple of stories connected to the larger world, the cohesion of this collection would have suffered. By the last three stories, I realized that by wondering about this lack of connection to something bigger than the singular couples and triples (other single men or women play important roles in relation to couples in some of the stories), I was doing the same thing Porter’s characters did: looking to the outside for some sense of connection. The book comprises quiet slices of domestic life with an insular point of view, well written, easy and enjoyable to read. And the build from one story to the next, and the final velvet-gloved slug to your heart was all that the foreboding could have promised: you finally realize how disconnected these people are so that, in a sense, they “disappear” . . . as we all do at the end of this human journey. All the characters smoke and drink. I don’t, but I imagine that this collection has a lot in common with drinking a glass of wine slowly or that slow burn of a cigarette as it disappears down to an ember, then dead ash.So many short story collections lack cohesion or structure; rather they seem to be a dumping ground for whatever the writer could come up with to fill out a book. This is the opposite of that: a perfectly made, intentional collection that makes sense as a literary work of art....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Jun 06, 2023","Jun 12, 2023","May 29, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61327505-the-disappeared

Once again, I’m astounded at her ability to turn research into visceral reality aI just recently discovered Geraldine Brooks through her novel Horse. Once again, I’m astounded at her ability to turn research into visceral reality and deliver nuances and complexities.March is the story of the father, Mr. March, in Little Women, which I have not read. I recall my nursery school teacher reading it to our class during naptime (ca. 1955) and I either fell asleep or spaced out every time she began so I never heard a word of it. Similarly, over the years I’ve tried to watch several movies of the book and failed to stay with them. But I had no problem staying riveted to Brooks’s book.She makes you live the pain and dichotomies during the Civil War. Nothing is simple. Everything feels true. And in her Afterword, Brooks explains her research and more: It was in researching the role of New England clergy that I became intrigued with the story of the contraband [enslaved people who are “liberated”] and the North’s mixed record of high idealism, negligence, and outright cruelty.In a further back-of-book section, A Conversation with Geraldine Brooks, she recounts that while living in a small town in Virginia that was steeped in Civil War artifacts, she found herself pondering “the moral challenges the war presented for [the people], [and] that kindled my interest in imagining an idealist adrift in that war.”(view spoiler)[And when asked to discuss March’s return to his family after the war, Brooks says, “I don’t think he can go back. Nor do I think it is necessarily desirable. Moral certainty can deafen people to any truth other than their own. By the end of the book, March is damaged, but he is still an idealist; it’s just that he sees more clearly the cost of his ideals, and understands that he is not the only who must pay for them.” (hide spoiler)]I’m an idealist and I have no idea how I’d deal with being in the fire of war, so this interests me. And, once again, Geraldine Brooks’s unflinching fiction has enhanced my understanding of myself and true, complex history where nobody is all good or all bad.

I was approximately one-quarter of the way into it when I thought I figured out the “what happened,” and I wondered if this was way too early and would there be any mystery or had Slocumb blown his wad too early—exposed plot prematurely? I should not have wondered or worried. Slocumb knew exactly what he was doing. At page 235, a little more than halfway through the symphonic construction, he brings what’s been a lurking threat to the surface—ka-blam!—like a bass line you’ve heard from the beginning but suddenly it takes over, and add the brass section. The good vs. evil nature of the characters becomes operatic, but, hey, opera is music, and this book is a musical composition.I found myself enjoying this construction as an editor as well as a writer. I suspect people who deal with writing technique and structure have a lot in common with musicians, and it is so much fun to watch this book spool out, revealing themes and undercurrents with symphonic precision.I’m not usually interested in seeing adaptations of books, but if my hunch is right that author/musician Brendan Slocumb is at least entertaining the idea of adapting this very commercial story about White theft of Black property into another medium—Opera? Musical? Movie?—I’d like to see it. It’s a mass-appeal treatment of such a historically important story that it would be wonderful if it could reach an audience of people who don’t necessarily read 400+-page novels._____________Addendum The back-of-book Author’s Note is edifying. Don’t skip it. There are so many true stories that inspired the creation of this novel, and one that I love is the fact that junior year of college, author/musician Brendan Slocumb was invited to play the Suite for Violin and Piano by William Grant Still, which he was “dumbfounded” to learn was written by a Black man like himself. Slocumb “had never imagined that Black composers even existed.” (428) Shocked at the composer’s name, I looked him up to see if he was the same William Still who wrote the 1872 classic The Underground Railroad Records: Narrating the Hardships, Hairbreadth Escapes, and Death Struggles of Slaves in Their Efforts for Freedom. According to a quick Google search, William Still (1821-1902) is an ancestor of William Grant Still (1895-1978)! This book is full of dramatic concentric circles of fact and fiction. All the more reason to translate this symphony of words into an opera....more",Notes are private!,2,17,1,"May 23, 2023","May 29, 2023","May 09, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/62110516-symphony-of-secrets

Also, the male characters sometimes felt fantastical—without the full spectrum of human complexity.Still, I was always interested. Maybe because I knew nothing about the main character and the experience of being a well-off Kenyan student living in New York—so many assumptions that seem bigoted to her Black American friends.

I could not have explained this to you as a very young child, but I have never believed in the validity of hierarchies of importance and entitlement. I could not have explained this to you as a very young child, but that is when I clearly saw the fallacy—in my young mind, “craziness”—of the whole notion that grownups were superior because their greater size and strength enabled them to brutalize me, or that boys were more important than girls, as my mother tried to tell me in the 1950s. As far back as I can remember I knew that people were no more important than each other or animals or plants. We all “were” and therefore we deserved to be. And later when I learned about religions, that too made no sense. Deities? Beings or powers so great that they deserved worship? If something is truly great, worship by others is irrelevant, as is fearing or fawning. Great beings see with equal eyes and want everybody to know their own greatness. Perhaps they are lonely and want eye-to-eye company.When I grew up and made my living in offices, my habit of addressing male bosses as equals drove several of them crazy. I believe hierarchies are a good method for achieving certain goals in an orderly way, but that has nothing to do with superior worth or entitlement of individuals, and respect has nothing to do with servile subordination.When I got my first dog, I was curious about who she was, what she liked and wanted. I went to a training school called “People Training for Dogs” which appealed to me; it helped us learn one another’s language and therefore become a better team. None of my subsequent dogs were “pets.” They were my family, my partners, and we merely had different responsibilities: mine were to take care of them, protect them, love them; theirs were to be in the moment with me, loving and clear.The more I’ve learned true history and the historical roots of slavery in various monarchies—a hierarchy founded in the belief that monarchists are superior beings directly descended from God and therefore others must obey them for their own good—the more I’ve been baffled by the insanity that this was accepted by enough people to have it exist and grow into doctrine of Manifest Destiny that made genocide, slavery, torture, and all manner of cruelty rational.I watched Harry and Meghan’s interview with Oprah and found myself alone in my interest: to hear from an outlier the true psychology and cost of the distorted values of a monarchy. I was on the edge of my couch as Harry described a family in shackles, constricted, dependent on the press for its existence, on constant edge and undermining one another in a desperate performance to survive. Again, I found myself exclaiming: This is nuts! And yet most people I heard from only wanted gossip on royalty or were judgmental that somebody so privileged was whining. What?! I wanted to scream. Don’t you see he is telling us our history—how we came to be and the insanity that birthed it?It was only because I wanted to know more from an apparently sane person who just wants to be free that I read this memoir. When I took it out of the library, the check-out woman smiled and said, “Oh, some royal intrigue!” I thought about just nodding, but instead answered, “No. I really want to understand about the monarchy.” She looked puzzled, then responded, “I hope you get whatever you want out of it.”Spare starts off as you might expect. You get a heavy dose of the current discomfort between Harry and his brother and father, then jumpcut to the past and dealing with his mother’s death with complete submersion into the day-to-day life of a royal family member, boarding school, etc. It’s interesting and I thought how much I wouldn’t like having to live that way, always in the public eye, but since I don’t really care about royals, I got a little bored . . . until in the aftermath of his mother’s death, Harry accompanies his father to South Africa where he attends a lecture about a legendary battle between Britain and the Zulus in 1879, and Harry suddenly injects the sanity I was reading for: he says the war was “a source of pride for many Britons, . . [it] was the outgrowth of imperialism, colonialism, nationalism—in short, theft. Great Britain was trespassing, invading a sovereign nation and trying to steal it, meaning the precious blood of Britain’s finest lads had been wasted that day . . . . But I was too young: I heard him and also didn’t hear. Maybe I’d seen the movie Zulu too many times, maybe I’d waged too many pretend battles with my toy Redcoats. I had a view of battle, of Britain, which didn’t permit new facts. So I zoomed in on the bits about manly courage, and British power, and when I should’ve been horrified, I was inspired.” (33–34)This, to me, tells the whole story of the whole mess: truth vs. our love of the stories we’re accustomed to. Our love of drama that turns some people into “other”—be it into superior beings who will protect us or whose lives we can consume like a bowl of sweets because we fancy it is so romantic or exotic, or beings who are treated as property. Harry was twelve when he had his response to this story of theft, but his qualification as an adult gave me hope that I would learn something of value in his memoir—because he has obviously learned something different from what he was conditioned to believe. And in the next few pages, when he displayed his capacity to see the bird’s-eye-view absurdity of a grown man frantically dinging a little bell in his boarding school’s cafeteria to quiet a roomful of chatting boys who couldn’t hear him, I settled down for a good read. And he began delivering: After the press makes great hay out of him breaking his thumb, he blurts, “Centuries ago royal men and women were considered divine; now they were insects. What fun, to pluck their wings.” (46) Harry is experiencing the flip side of the distortion that began our heinous history, and he was a child! I share his outrage. I want to scream the obvious adult bird’s eye view: If you idealize people, if you proliferate lies of superiority, eventually the distortion will flip! Nobody is royal. Nobody is superior or more entitled than anybody else! Yes, we are all different, we have different levels of intelligence and physical capabilities, but nobody deserves a higher place in a hierarchical system than anyone else! However, despite the occasional seasoning of insights, Spare turned out to be mostly a basic memoir that probably will appeal primarily to people who idealize royals, allowing them (the readers) to be moved, shocked, or outraged (depending on their own situations) that royals are just people who do stupid things like everybody else. For me it was the long story of a normal guy—a middling student, a gregarious hunter who was also so hunted that he found peace in being a professional soldier with comrades at war (this takes up a substantial part of the book and would probably be better appreciated by vets than the general reading public). He is a fairly young man who already has lived an extraordinarily huge life, a guy who in other circumstances would not stand out in a crowd, however he has been born into an abnormal family that allowed him unparalleled privilege, educational opportunities, and travel, but all of it in a bizarre fishbowl world [“fancy captivity” (199)] where the public’s scrutiny and fascination with him had zero to do with who he was or anything he’d done. From this distorting magnifying glass of their vision, courtesy of the “paps” (more on the paparazzi in a second), the only options were to burn up (he suffers panic attacks), contort himself into something untenable for the rest of his existence, go numb, or try to escape. I can relate to Harry’s panic attacks. I relate to him (although his and his family’s enjoyment of killing animals for sport twisted my stomach; but hey, we all have contradictions). I’m grateful that he has exposed the insanity and symbiosis of the royal life and the carnivorous press. I admire his decision to work on himself and then to share it with others—another act of soldiering. I hope that writing this memoir was deeply therapeutic, and I wish him and his family well and hope they eventually get to live as close to normal (whatever that is) lives as is possible. But I profoundly disagree with his disconnect between everything he has experienced and a monarchy that was sick, is sick, and deserves to be laid to rest. On page 386 he writes: “My problem has never been with the monarchy, not the concept of monarchy. It’s been with the press and the sick relationship that’s evolved between it and the Palace.” To me, this is an amazing blind spot. Particularly since a few pages later he realizes, during a fight with his brother: “But now I saw that even our finest moments, and my best memories, somehow involved death. Our lives were built on death, our brightest days shadowed by it. . . . we steeped ourselves in it. We christened and crowned, graduated and married, passed out and passed over our beloveds’ bones. Windsor Castle itself was a tomb, the walls filled with ancestors.” (399)Ultimately, this book is very moving and it ends with the death of his beloved “Granny,” the Queen. And I found myself wondering: as he matures further, will he one day realize he can love his Granny but decry the imbalances that gave birth to her position as a direct descendant of God in a monarchy?Now, time for one more personal story: It was a night of what became known as “wilding” in New York City—the night of the infamous “Central Park jogger” rape. I was walking home from my night job in a law office. It was about 11 p.m., and as I hit the Columbus Circle corner of Broadway and Central Park South, I was suddenly—within a second—surrounded by boys. And I mean children, 13- and 14-year-olds. They glommed onto me like bees. Most of them were shorter than I was, laughing and grabbing at my body. But one was my height—5’3”—but at least 30 pounds heavier, a big guy! I will never forget his face, three inches away from mine, grinning as he grabbed for my crotch. He was evil. I blocked him with an oversized purse, but I couldn’t move, completely boxed in, and he liked that. The boys were Black. An older white man on the corner saw the whole thing and didn’t make a move to do anything. As fast as the boys had swarmed me, they disappeared—probably off into Central Park across the street.As I read Harry’s stories of a life being swarmed by men with flashing cameras, I shuddered, reliving that night. Just imagine if this were your everyday existence.I hope eventually there will be no more monarchies and that all of us will evolve into beings who see ourselves and one another with egality.

On the fictional independent island nation of Nollop, off the coast of South Carolina, all is not well. The founder (also named Nollop) was the writer of the alphabetically complete “The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog,” and when the letters of that sentence begin falling off the statue of him, all hell breaks loose.I read this brilliant 2001-published novel at a time when a judge in Texas is deciding whether the whole country will be prohibited from taking an FDA-approved pill that, for 20 years, has been used in early abortions and to help women with horrific decisions to make. I read it as another Texan is suing for wrongful death three women who helped his ex-wife get an abortion. Simultaneously in Florida, the government has declared war on books that somebody merely decides (without having read them) are not right for children or people of any age. I’m writing as authoritarian lie-based declarations are threatening to demolish our democracy. This was perfect timing.If you decide to read Ella Minnow Pea, make sure to read the increasingly hilarious names of the months as Nollopians are banned from using the letters of the alphabet that have fallen off the statue of the founder. It became increasingly difficult to make sense out of the permissible letters used to write this epistolary novel, but the struggle to read made the book funnier and more tragic. (This is not a book to listen to on an audio; you’ll miss half the humor—although I am curious about what an audiobook reader might do with it.) To make sense towards the end of the story, I resorted to reading it out loud to myself (but this is vastly different from having a professional narrator read, and therefore solve the mysteries for you, diminishing the humor).It felt so good to laugh at the insanity of this novel and our country at this moment.****Thanks to Cheri for ing the soon-to-be-published illustrated 20th anniversary edition of this book....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Mar 10, 2023","Mar 17, 2023","Mar 10, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16200.Ella_Minnow_Pea

This is what Europeans wiped out. What would life be like if Columbus et al. had asked questions instead of murdered and plundered? I can’t even imagine it, but I’d like to imagine it for our future. I’d like to imagine it’s not too late to ask people who have cultures different than our own: What advice do you have for me? Tell me about your home? How do you survive? What do you love? What do you value?I learned two important words from this book: “antiphony” and “biophilia.” Antiphony is a call and response—which requires listening; how could one respond without listening to what one wants to respond to? Biophilia is a love of land—land that we might practice antiphony with for a life of paradise on this planet.Here’s a small quote that I’ll probably reread for the rest of my life, after my hard copy of this book arrives: I [Barry Lopez] remember a Nunamiut man at Anaktuvuk Pass in the Brooks Range in Alaska named Justus Mekiana. I was there working on a book and I asked him what he did when he went into a foreign landscape. He said, “I listen.”And a man named Levine Williams, a Koyukon Athapaskan, who spoke sternly to a friend, after he had made an innocent remark about how intelligent people were, saying to him, “Every animal knows way more than you do.”And another man, an Inuk, watching a group of polar bear biologists on Baffin Island comparing notes on the migration paths of polar bears, in an effort to predict where they might go. “Quajijau-jungangitut,” he said softly, “it can’t be learned.”I remember a Kamba man in Kenya, Kamoya Kimeu, a companion in the stone desert west of Lake Turkana—and a dozen other men—telling me, you know how to see, learn how to mark the country. And he and others teaching me to sit down in one place for two or three hours and look.When we enter the landscape to learn something, we are obligated, I think, to pay attention rather than constantly to pose questions. To approach the land as we would a person, by opening an intelligent conversation. And to stay in one place, to make of that one, long observation a fully dilated experience. We will always be rewarded if we give the land credit for more than we imagine, and if we imagine it as being more complex even than language.In these ways we begin, I think, to find a home, to sense how to fit a place....more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Mar 02, 2023","Mar 02, 2023","Mar 01, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/16881.The_Rediscovery_of_North_America

It is 475 pages that I only put down when my eyes felt swollen: a novelized true story of Berest’s family’s experience when Nazis invaded and occupied France and Berest’s investigation of that many years later. It is only called a novel because Berest wanted to write it as a nonlinear novel with dialogue and full characters, changing names of collaborators so that their descendants would not be persecuted, but this is a copiously researched investigation of what happened, who did what, and how Berest came to be a secularized Jew—when she began her investigation, she didn’t identify as Jewish, look Jewish, had never followed the religion or been in a synagogue and had no experience in the culture.This mystery, quest, hunt—told with all the dramatic tension of such stories—quickly became one of the most deeply personal experiences I’ve had.When my parents married, both had had bad experiences of being Jewish and they mutually decided to erase the whole thing. We kids were only told that if we’d lived in Hitler’s Germany, we’d have been killed in ovens, but other than that, we had no religion or affiliation.I found a sister in Anne Berest. As she wrote memories—of her grandmother trying to tell her something when they were alone together, something Anne could not understand, but in retrospect, now that she is investigating her roots, she thinks it has to do with the story she is telling—as I read this, I recalled my grandmother telling something I cannot remember but I remember her voice breaking in a cry as she said the word “pograms.” I’ll never know what that attempt to pass on history was about, but as an adult I can imagine my parents shutting her down.Unlike Berest, I look like a typical New York City Ashkenazi Jew, so my experience was that the outside world was constantly labeling me; as a young actress, I was qualified as an “ethnic” and therefore not considered for most commercial jobs in the 1970s and ’80s. Yet I had no background to match my look and was forever furious when other Jews made assumptions about me that had nothing to do with my life. (See my use of all this in my first novel, Plan Z by Leslie Kove.)And yet I feel Jewish. I feel it in my bone marrow.Anne Berest’s book throws illumination on this. At the same time that I was reading this, a friend on Facebook posted this remarkable 18-minute documentary, giving the history of the Jews through the Barbie Doll, whose inventor was Jewish: The Tribe.And here is a wonderful bookstore-recorded talk by Anne Berest: Anne Berest on Diving into Her History for The PostcardHowever this most definitely is a book for everybody. It is a compelling and necessary book for all of us at this critical time when we seem to be blindly repeating history:The uniqueness of this catastrophe lay in the paradox of its insidious slowness and its viciousness. Looking back, everyone wondered why they hadn’t reacted sooner, when there had been so much time to do so. How they had been so blithely optimistic? But it was too late now. The law of October 3, 1940, stated that “any person with three grandparents of the Jewish race, or with two grandparents of that race if his/her spouse is Jewish” would be considered a Jew themselves. It also prohibited Jews from holding any sort of public office. Teachers, military personnel, government employees, and those who worked for public authorities—all were obliged to resign from their positions. Jews were also forbidden to publish articles in newspapers or participate in any of the performing arts: theatre, film, radio.[Anne talking with her mother in present day]“Wasn’t there also a list or authors whose books were banned?”“Quite. The Liste Otto, named after the German ambassador to Paris. Otto Abetz. It listed all the books withdrawn from sale in bookstores. All the Jewish authors were there, of course, but also communist ones and French writers who were considered ‘disruptive’ by the regime, including Colette, Aristide Bruant, André Malraux, Louis Aragon, and even some dead authors, like Jean de la Fontaine. (98–99)”How does one ever trust anybody again after living in a country where neighbors or a postman (all who remain your neighbors and postman after the war is over) report you to the occupying forces, where a “white-haired, kind-faced clergyman, was in reality working for German military intelligence, paid 12,000 francs per month to be a double agent. A priest and member of the Resistance by day, by night, he lived on the rue Spontini, in the 16th arrondissement, with two mistresses—whom he supported with the money he earned as a collaborator. His specialty was encouraging young people to join the Resistance—then betraying them and pocketing the reward. (415)”?A major prize-winner in France, The Postcard deserves all the adulation and press it is getting. It is that rare page-turner drama with something that the world needs now more than ever. I hope if you read it, it’ll wake you up in whatever area you are asleep. For me, it was about my right to call myself a Jew—without confusion, apology, or explanation. For others, it may be a needed shove into activism, fighting book bans, bigotry in all forms, and the dissolution of personal body rights and democracy....more",Notes are private!,8,33,1,"Jul 18, 2023","Jul 24, 2023","Feb 23, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/63880836-the-postcard

Perfection: Bertice Berry's voice reading this material. It doesn't get any better than this.Where to begin with this astonishing project—because it is way more than this hardback with a velvety cover of Charly Palmer’s painting of author Bertice Berry, Ph.D.’s direct route to BlackWorld. It’s more than a project. Perhaps a better word would be “movement.”Do you want to know the movement of history? Do you want to really understand where we are now as a nation and a world with a legacy of slavery and genocide? Do you long to know how we can heal and move through and on from this mess? Do you ever feel as though your dreams are school—that you’re with a bunch of people, being instructed by elders, or that sometimes you are even one of the instructors or helpers, visiting people and places that have nothing to do with your everyday life, so why on earth are you dreaming this stuff, and why do you wake exhausted as if you’ve been traveling to other worlds? What if this dream schooling is an alternate realty? Do you want to learn about all these questions and their answers in a way that is fun? I know that sounds ridiculous, but that’s what this movement called BlackWorld offers.BlackWorld is a whole not-so-underground railroad. It is both an entertaining novel about a young doctoral student named Rose who inherits a bundle of money and goes on a quest into alternate reality prescribed by her dead Aunt Bertha, even though it requires she abort her sociology studies at a pivotal time and fly away to parts unknown and, for readers, voila: it is the route to move into healing. In BlackWorld, author Bertice Berry, a sociologist, has liberally lifted from her own remarkable story from hard beginnings to become a best-selling writer, television host, and sought-after diversity trainer/inspiring speaker for huge corporations. And this book is one part of a much bigger movement: to start a publishing company, Freeman House Publishing, dedicated to publishing stories “that need to be told, stories that uplift, inform, inspire, and give hope.” Through this company, Berry and her partners are attempting to do the impossible: own their own work. Own their own story of Black people. Control how it enters the world. Hence, you will not find this book on Amazon and there will be no middle men taking out chunks of the profits. This is a book that will go out into the world the same way protagonist Rose does—from a place called “Freeman,” paid for by her dead aunt’s sweat and tears—and embodying the very story Berry is telling.The hardcover is pricy and probably a collector’s item. I’m glad to own it (I bought it), but I will uncharacteristically encourage serious readers (and particularly students) to wait for the ebook or the audio. The ebook is going to be filled with hyperlinks to find out more about the historical figures who are dropped in by the barrel-load, like rare gems in this treasure-land called BlackWorld. Rather than lurch up and down from a book to your computer, you’ll be able to click a link in the ebook to find out more about each of them. And Bertice Berry is reading BlackWorld on the audiobook (which I haven’t heard, but I’ve listened to her daily video stories long enough to know that her voice can heal). As I write this, neither the ebook nor the audio are for sale, so you have plenty of time to decide how you prefer to take this in. An official pub date is still up in the air.Just know that however you take this story in, you will be nourished with the option/responsibility to become a moving participant in BlackWorld:When President Obama came in, people sat down like he was going to fix everything all by himself. Worse still were the folks who complained how he wasn’t doing enough. There ain’t a man born who can fix everything all by himself. Even Jesus had disciples.Anyway, as I was saying, people sat down and waited to be handed a change. It came, but not the way folks were thinking. Obama’s presidency brought forth the very element that had been clogging the drain all along. (175). . . Having a Black president didn’t fix America, but it set her on a path to finally get right. Just like we implored the heavens to create BlackWorld, we have implored the Creator to allow us to reveal the power of BlackWorld to all the world. Because God knows, we need it; we all, every single one of us. (178)* * *I’ve noticed that book theme clusters seem to haphazardly come to me—a bunch of books with commonalities that scream for me to notice.BlackWorld is the third book I’ve read in a fairly dense cluster of Black people’s road-trips. Each book has idiosyncratic characters and plot; each has a unique way of dealing with truths that need to be completely revealed and accepted by all people; and each has, in publishing parlance, an element of “magical realism”—although from my point of view, I would characterize it as hyper-real. BlackWorld, in this trio, was preceded by Percival Everett’s Dr. No, and Ladee Hubbard’s The Talented Ribkins. I did not plan this reading sequence, and for that reason, I feel as if its appearance comes from a higher order of plot and message than I could consciously construct....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,"Feb 09, 2023","Feb 15, 2023","Feb 09, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/108516758-blackworld

I felt like we were intruding so I tried to walk as softly and quietly as I could, reveling in the eruption of animal play, and I swear even the trees were in on it. With no traffic, the air cleared and New York City was pristine in two days. What was most stunning was how fast the climate changed in the middle of one of the biggest cities in the world with just the cessation of human activity.

I prefer to call the object of this satire ""mindless herd movements."" Jane Roper slays them all.And here, I join the society of shame by confessing, I am obsessed with understanding herd movements in human animals, and therefore there’s a part of me that is jealous of this book. Were I a lot younger and a different person, this is a book I’d be proud to have written. Alas, I’m of a different generation and I never could have written this.But boy can I appreciate it.And another shameful confession: I almost abandoned it because in the first scene, the protagonist, Kathleen, is less than respectful, let alone aware, of her dog. And this reaction on my part—to dump a whole book because I was turned off in my sensitive area about animals—is the very thing Jane Roper brilliantly presents and razzes. (And it turns out that initial dog problem is an important plot point! I'm hitting myself upside the head.)I belly-laughed all the way through The Society of Shame and have signed up for Roper’s reading in NYC’s P+T Knitwear on April 17th. I can’t wait to see this comic genius in person and give her the standing ovation I erupted in on finishing the last inspired page. And one more completely unshameful quasi-confession/beef: I write funny novels, or novels with humor in them, so I'm always on the lookout for other writers who write funny. I have an article in issue 010 of Oh Reader about how difficult it is to find female writers who deliver belly-laughs and substance, and now I can add Jane Roper to my list. However, either because there is a problem publishing and therefore finding a lot of wonderfully written books by women with authentic characters that are also deeply funny, marketing departments try to compare anything humorous, with a female point of view, to a few writers whose sarcastic shallow characters sell well. Roper's book does not belong in that category. The Society of Shame has more in common with Richard Russo's Straight Man, if you must find a comparison. In her Goodreads  of that book, Roper writes, ""As a writer (specifically, one who tries to write fiction with a healthy dose of humor) I am in awe of Russo's ability to blend the funny with the poignant."" But Roper's book is not only grounded in a poignant mother/daughter relationship (Kathleen and her daughter, Aggie), but, way more complex than Russo's book as it slyly marries crazy satire (about a menstrual leak starting a whole social media movement, #YesWeBleed) with truth: menstrual shame is a real thing holding women back around the world. This marriage of absurdity with a sneaky vein of truth actually reminds me more of Percival Everett's iconoclastic Erasure (although the two books share almost nothing else so it would be wrong to use it as a comp for marketing purposes).But I really dislike comparing books. The Society of Shame is its own animal and I wish that one day there will be so many female writers publishing funny one-of-a-kind material with real complex characters, moving plots (and I mean that as both speedy and emotionally affecting) with a cultural/social/political satirical purpose so that finding appropriate comparisons (for marketers) will not be a problem.[image]First page of Oh Reader article which unfortunately is not available online...more",Notes are private!,4,53,1,"Apr 06, 2023","Apr 11, 2023","Jan 27, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61282523-the-society-of-shame

I wish I could remember what it was, but it’s evaporated.In the beginning oI bought this book after I read a quote from it that filled me with peace. I wish I could remember what it was, but it’s evaporated.In the beginning of the book, I was in awe. I’d read a small titled section and sink into contemplation and maybe contemplate a single idea all day. I did this over the course of weeks.Then I came to a section about childhood that was so alien to my own that I experienced visceral disappointment. O’Donohue writes in sweeping generalities, even attaching them to traumatic childhoods, and he doesn’t know what he’s talking about. I closed the book and put it away for the rest of the day.Then I came back to it and began to read what helped me and jump over what didn’t.There were concepts—sections examining different kinds of presence—that were sometimes helpful, sometimes felt more like writing prompts O’Donohue had given himself on the topic.I read, I skipped sections, read, was inspired, and it was in the middle of a topic called “The Architecture of Belonging” when, discussing the inborn human characteristic of experiencing everything within frames (something cognitive scientist George Lakoff has written about extensively) when O’Donohue definitively stated: “You cannot belong in a vast, nameless space. There is no belonging in the air except for the birds who ride its currents. Belonging is equally difficult in the ocean; the vast expanse of water is anonymous. . . . Where there is anonymity, there can be no real belonging. (71)”—it was this moment when I understood my difficulty and O’Donohue’s frame: O’Donohue’s whole point of view is informed by Christianity, a belief in duality—we are one thing, God another. His insistence on framing things that I, as a person raised without religion, an agnostic who is quite content to not know whether there is or isn’t an actual being called God (which itself feels like a constriction of something I can’t understand, but would bet money is not a being in human terms) brought some clarity about my reaction to this book. My most essential longing (which is the subject of this book about “belonging”) is for what I can’t frame—for instance, infinity. My heart swells in the moments I merge with whatever the great infinity of life is. My most essential wish is to be nothing in being part of it. And this does not preclude belonging through relationships and being who I am. In fact, for me, deep belonging comes when this indefinable, unframed ocean of nothing becomes our common ground. So O’Donohue’s constriction of my deepest love of that which cannot be framed put me off.I think this is a great book for bibliomancy—opening it blindly, pointing, and reading whatever passage your finger lands on. So I think I will  this book before finishing it, and use it this way myself whenever I feel so moved.* * *AddendumI have so many progressive, contemplative Christian friends on Facebook that I asked for their thoughts on this . One, a Christian chaplain, Alice Hildebrand, gave me an education. I'm copying it here (with her permission) as she wrote it in a message:ALICE HILDEBRANDIn response to your  of John O'Donohue. (you can share whatever, if anything, of this, i just didnt want to clog up your page.) I dont like his writing as he is too much of a certain kind of Christian for me. i admit that i havent done more than dip into him, but was not drawn by his thought. since i have been in the religion business for a long time, and read a lot, i could give you lengthy critiques of the nuances of many modern Xian thinkers, but the shorthand version is that they usually have an underlying assumption about ""God"" that is very traditional, especially if the writer is Catholic, and therefore, i lose interest. But, to offer something for your thinking -- duality is not a Christian construct, it comes right of paganism via Plato. Much of what is problematic abt Xian theologies comes out of the Greek philosophical tradition, and much of what is helpful comes out of Judaism and the Mystery Religions of the middle east at the time that the first Xian writers were constructing the new religion. And, all the religious and philosophical traditions that i know of deal with problems of location -- where do i, do we, fit into this infinite space we find ourselves in, both space-wise and time-wise? many, many people want to believe there is order, there is meaning, and want it to be nailed down in creeds etc and many, many people look at the Somethingness with awe and wonder and are OK with the looseness -- mysticism is able to embrace the unanswerable via relationship to/with it, which is where it sounds like you are -- but many, many folks want something a little more homey-feeling. Hence, religion. Hence, as an example, Christianity, with its sense of ""God"" as ultimate, transcendent holiness (from Judaism) and its sense of down to earth, just-like-me immanence in the Christ figure which got identified with a Jewish teacher named Jesus. In the 200 or so years before Jesus' life (if he was a real person and not a composite, but in any case that's how we do our dating), Jewish thought began to posit intermediary figures between the transcendent god and humans and that helped pave the way for the theologies around Jesus. So, i think in your  and description of your own philosophy/spirituality, you express this so beautifully -- ""My heart swells in the moments I merge with whatever the great infinity of life is. My most essential wish is to be nothing in being part of it. And this does not preclude belonging through relationships and being who I am. In fact, for me, deep belonging comes when this indefinable, unframed ocean of nothing becomes our common ground. "" and that is congruent with many Christian thinkers, even in ancient sources. Awe, gratitude, amazement, relationship. i also think that so many of us had such terribly fucked up childhoods, with parents who couldnt parent well, that in our political and religious lives we still want a Super Parent who will make sure we are rewarded and ""those people"" are punished.

It builds up a tension which is the same tension felt by living life in a never-ending false performance—as Black first-person protagonist Belle Marion Greener negotiates society in her White self as Belle da Costa Greene, claiming a Portuguese grandmother to explain her coloring.It also seems right for the period.However, people don’t always talk in full sentences, and after a while, for me, the dialogue became false. Even in her thoughts about her charade, Belle never drops the formality of full sentences without contractions.So although I really enjoyed this book—for me, it was a learning experience more than literary enjoyment—the product of these two writers became a generic literary exercise and I longed for some expression of soul and more authentic character to leak through.These reservations are addressed in wonderful back-of-book statements by both authors: Almost nothing was available about Belle’s personal life—she destroyed anything that might have informed a researcher. And when, in frustration, Black writer Victoria wrote contemporary dialogue, White writer Marie revised it into stiff full sentences. So my issues were intentional decisions based on the period and what was available. Rather than create an authentic inner self, they largely left it out. And when sexual intimacy happened it has the quality of an airbrushed romance novel.The Good Morning America blurb on the cover says: “Historical Fiction at its best.” And I guess this is accurate. No detail of time, place, or décor is left out. And this is certainly a story of a person who deserves attention....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Jan 18, 2023","Jan 21, 2023","Jan 09, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55333938-the-personal-librarian

I was surprised to see that I was the only one concerned primarily about the quality of the writing. I can read anything if it’s really well written. It’s more important to me than genre, plot, or educational value. For me, good writing makes its subject worthy of reading, and usually (not always) there is something as vibrant as a good plot and educational value.But for my “best” list for 2022, focusing on writers and writing, I’m adding one more quality: these are books that remain vivid enough to talk about long after finishing reading them—books whose titles make me happy when I see them because the reading experience is still alive. (That rules out many well written books by terrific authors.)Without further ado, my favorites are:Richard Powers: BewildermentHelene Tursten: An Elderly Lady Must Not Be CrossedSteve Toltz: Here Goes NothingAndré Alexis: Fifteen DogsKathrine Kressman Taylor: Address UnknownAnn Patchett: These Precious DaysMarcy Dermansky: Bad MarieEthan Hawke: A Bright Ray of DarknessAlison Jean Lester: The Sound of ItI’ve read a ton of good books this year and I’m grateful for all of them.

And the cover blurb that declares that this book is hilarious is patently untrue; however I’m grateful as that was the blurb that got me to click “buy.”I’d read and lauded Alison Jean Lester’s funny novel Lillian on Life, so as soon as I was assured this new book was funny, I couldn’t wait to get ahold of it. I’m so glad I was tricked.The characters are so complex and deeply felt that they’re hard to talk about. But let me try.Jeremy and Su fall in love and decide to build a new house together for themselves and their blended families of Jeremy’s two sons and Su’s daughter. The writing is so skillful, keeping you identified with Su (using alternating third-person omniscient point of view sections in one font and first-person Su’s perspective in another font) that when Lester first introduced a “diversion” (I’m doing you a favor by being as oblique as I can) in Jeremy’s thoughts, I was so disbelieving that I thought she (Lester) had gone off the rails. This is completely unbelievable, I may have written in my journal. Nobody would do this.But I was wrong. I was so wrong, and therefore felt as betrayed as you would be if your soulmate betrayed you, and the unwinding of that complication makes for one of the tensest and most heartrending stories I’ve read.I don’t have children and have never been married, but I found myself having personal associations to Su’s dilemma of simultaneous love, protectiveness, and loyalty along with unforgivable betrayal that would seem to cancel the actions directed by love, protectiveness, and loyalty.The only cover blurb that is accurate is: “I’ve never read anything quite like it.” —Fiona Mitchell, author of The Swap....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Dec 14, 2022","Dec 22, 2022","Nov 25, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/63261427-the-sound-of-it

The musical lingo, German, and references were over my head and education. And just as often it was simply the poetics and syntax that stymied my understanding. And yet …I understood deeply what this book is about.

I found myself reading in small sections because the writing had repeated grandiose, sweeping builds, and I simply reached capacity. To use Powers’s own description of a critic’s reaction to one of the musical performances described: “’If anything, the sonority suffers from relentless divinity. Too many peaks; not enough valleys.’ (538)”But I was never bored.There is never a sense that Richard Powers is showing off; this is just how he thinks and expresses himself, and he sounds like a musical and mathematical genius.The sustained music sections were one thing, but over and over I found myself relating to the complex personal dilemmas of being “other”—not fitting in a box; being raised to be something without a name, something that did not have a place in a world of race, racism, and tight categories. I loved the sections where physicist David Strom explained time—a main theme of the book—and that everything exists simultaneously and forever, and I loved Powers’s ability to express this, and I loved the mystical ending.Although it was exhausting, I am so glad I read this book.

They live on the other side of a wire fence from all the cadaverous Jewish slaves, none of whom can understand what’s going on. The SS treats these people civilly, plays with the little kids (who don’t exist in the rest of the camp because they are immediately murdered), constantly assures the families of their concern, and yet, because of his job in the camp, Walter knows these thousands of people are scheduled for murder in exactly six months. Walter has found purpose by memorizing data—numbers of people who arrive, numbers killed every day, etc. He believes that if he can commit as much data, as much truth as his brain will hold, and escape, if he tells people what is really going on—people who have been convinced by the SS that all of this is benign relocation—they will rise up and do something.However this belief is rattled when he sees that the Familienlager know about the order to kill them, and yet they don’t rise up.His [Walter’s] faith had been firm that, once people knew that death awaited them, they would not walk quietly towards it. Now he understood that information alone was not enough. The inmates of the Czech family camp had had the information. They could see the crematoria with their own eyes; the chimneys were just a few hundred yards away. They had known that the Nazis were murdering the Jews they had brought to Auschwitz. The trouble was, they never believed this scheme applied to them.. . . Only when it was too late did they see that they had been entirely wrong.. . . And yet life in the family camp went on as it had before. The musicians staged concerts, the amateur actors put on plays. The rival political factions kept debating the ideal future, even though the only certainty was that they had no future. Walter concluded that even incontrovertible knowledge of one’s fate was not enough. If people were to act, there had to be a possibility, even a slim one, of escaping that fate. Otherwise it was easier to deny what was right in front of you than to confront the reality of your own imminent destruction. . . . (136–137)The quoted material is the message. I will only add to it that the purpose of the Familienlager charade was simple propaganda: a show of normalcy to dupe Red Cross inspectors or anybody who might investigate; photos of normal families were excellent bogus public relations materials used to hide the truth of brutality that was so extreme most normal people would not believe that it could be how humans were treating other humans.In other words, “Ha, ha, ha—nothing but big lies and witch hunts. The truth is . . .” The Nazi machine had only to repeat their big lies incessantly and people believed them rather than the obvious, unbelievable truth.Walter and another Auschwitz inmate, Fred Wetzler, do the impossible: they are the first Jews to escape. But lest you believe, as they did, that merely getting the detailed information of what was happening out would change things, there is this: At every juncture, their copious written report (created by resistance forces who grilled them individually for days, fact-checking their reports against each other) met lethargy, procrastination, convenient incredulity allowing inaction, or ineffective action from everyone from Winston Churchill to Franklin Roosevelt to the pope. The critical information, which Walter and Fred had intended to save the soon-to-be murdered Hungarian Jews by warning them to rise up en masse and refuse to get on the “deportation” trains was not only kept from them because of secret, futile negotiations between Hungarian Jewish leadership and the Nazis, but they were delivered willful misinformation—bogus “Everything’s fine” postcards written by their relatives in Auschwitz at the direction of their murderers moments before they were shoved into the gas chambers.Does any of this resonate with misinformation campaigns today? With the difficulty of battling big lies with truth? With worldwide campaigns to create inaction or self-sabotaging actions among people who accept carefully crafted public relations, or, worse, only care about protecting their own positions?Walter, now known as Rudi Vrba, Wetzler, and two other Jews who escaped after the first two, were more frustrated than you probably are at this point of my recount, so what did they do? They decided to disseminate their report themselves.Author Jonathan Freedland wrote this astounding, riveting story because Vrba’s life deserves the same attention as other Holocaust celebrities. Vrba probably had zero interest in this kind of notoriety cum power. And that plus a possibly paranoid personality that made him suspicious of everybody seems to have been the secret of his success. His only interest was his mission to save lives. He rallied his strengths for this mission: a keen ability to observe and will everything he saw to memory. He was not a genius, but by sheer conviction and dedication, he developed a kind of savant memory for details. He believed change was worth any risk.And change did come—much slower than Vrba and Wetzler wanted—and it came because the Vrba-Wetzler Report finally reached a few people who would act. And pressure began to build against the Hungarian deportations. And a Hungarian government who really didn’t mind the deportations, acceded to the pressure. And gradually more people with none of the ethics and mission of Vrba and Wetzler began to act. They acted as a herd. And two young Slovakian Jews saved 200,000 Hungarians who would never know about them.We are herd animals and apparently most of us are not directed by an inner compass. Nevertheless, Vrba’s story shows that a few people with relentless will to do the right thing—and the requisite craziness to carry out the mission—can actually change the direction of a world herd.The above paragraph is a take-away from this story that I need and believe is true. But what I like most about this book and the complex character of Rudi Vrbo is that both refuse to fit pithy boxes—of hope, possibility, or even what a Holocaust survivor is. Vrbo was arrogant, unforgiving, ruthless in his criticism of surviving Jews who refused to disseminate the information they were given. In interviews, he stood tall, laughed and smiled a lot even as he described the atrocities. This is real. This is true. It is the way of people who have lived through violent absurdity; if you survive it, you develop a shell over the hurt and when talking to civilians, you might be sarcastic, because there is no possibility that they can grasp the reality you’ve lived through. This book is a wonderful conveyance of the only thing (besides his two daughters) Vrbo was committed to: truth.________I learned about this book in a New Yorker Radio interview with the author....more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,"Dec 29, 2022","Jan 04, 2023","Nov 14, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60194141-the-escape-artist

But boy, some 65-year-old Asian actress should grab movie rights and make it happen for herself. (Michelle Yeoh, are you reading this?)Hornclaw is sixty-five—not really elderly from my vantage point of almost-seventy-two—and she is a professional killer. How she comes to that is a moving story, despite the matter-of-fact prose that is woven into the narrative with flashbacks.There is a kind of clunkiness, or inelegance, to the narrative, but after reading a lot of work translated from Japanese, I’m wondering if meandering expositive sentences that sound like something is being told in person, rather than crafted into writing, is a quality of Asian languages. If anybody knows, I’d love to be informed about this.The inelegant blow-by-blow fight narrative works the way screenplay stage directions work (although some screenwriters do craft this stuff for literary impact). So if this book were adapted to film, it would work on a whole other level.On one level this is a kind of thriller, but for me it is a character portrait: how a young girl, severed from her family, severs from her own feelings, and yet . . . Somehow an essence of empathy and will to live transcend the many other ways a person might cope: depression, suicide, etc. Hornclaw is a survivor, and no matter how many brutal things she does, I was in her corner for the whole astonishing story....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Jan 10, 2023","Jan 14, 2023","Nov 10, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57938998-the-old-woman-with-the-knife

But even if you don’t have a debilitating fear, the research here about all these animals, delving into myth, religion, science, history, psychology—basically everything—may feed you. Dawn Baumann Brunke is a topnotch curious researcher and journalist, and once again, she’s packed a book with everything you could possibly want to know about the animals that so many of us project our terror onto.If you want to know what you are hiding from yourself about yourself, read this, or just page through the sections that pertain to your curiosity. (I have a particular interest in frogs because of a dream that is still so vivid decades after having it that it still affects me. Although I’m not afraid of frogs, my dream history made me find fascinating every single fact about frogs in the metamorphosis chapter, whereas I found myself skimming or just looking at the generous photos that pepper chapters on other animals.)My animal fears are place-specific: if a mouse or a waterbug (a giant NYC cockroach—as long as your thumb and an inch wide—that sometimes flies) suddenly appears in my apartment, I have been known to scream. Outside, I have no problem with them; I think mice are quite cute and endearing, and New York City waterbugs are the intellectual equivalent of any human—I’m not kidding; confronting one, you know you are being assessed and you can feel their minds at work. But please, not in my apartment.There are many exercises in this book to help you shift from fear to acceptance, and therefore know yourself better. But the best recommendation I can give comes from the experience, very early in the book, of following Brunke’s directions to list the characteristics of both your favorite animals and the ones you are afraid of. I was surprised to see that “fast” appeared in all my descriptions of my least favorite if they are invaders. And speed (in thought, in work, in insight) is actually a quality I like about myself. Well, following this contemplation, my dreams shifted! I often dream of invaders, and last night I had a happy, sweet dream about new people coming to live next door, me helping the managing agent, being excited about new neighbors, etc. This is huge!I got an advanced reading copy, but you can get the book (great cover!) in November.

This book has everything, and the title Grace reverberates with multiple meanings: it defines Obama’s style, but it also defines this book—Keenan’s humility and awe at the position he finds himself in.The plot follows ten consecutive days, centered around writing a eulogy of Pastor Clementa Pinckney who was one of the nine victims killed during Bible study at Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston, SC. However, concurrently the Supreme Court is making landmark decisions on the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and marriage equality for LGBTQ people. By backtracking to previous events, Keenan skillfully weaves an enormous story of the art of dealing with nuance—the mandate of a speechwriter for the leader of the free world to tell the truth (Keenan’s wife is a take-no-prisoners fact-checker on the staff) and also consider all the different sensitivities, beliefs, and responses of all the different audiences. An impossible tightrope trek that Obama demands and walks himself.This memoir is an education in the complexity of politics. But at the heart of everything is Grace.

I stuck with it because the characters were unique and charming; in the opening scene, protagonist Poppy Carew sits by her father’s deathbed in a way that is surprising, charming, and demands that the reader stay for the whole book to see what happens.What happens is a sprawling tale of funerals, lovers, seductive locales, and bad decisions that I thought would work wonderfully for a British TV series, and apparently others felt the same because it was produced for the BBC. I haven’t watched it, but may eventually.I need pleasure she [Poppy] thought. A meal of pleasure, a creative bout, a crash course. There had been precious little pleasure of late with Edmund [her former partner]. If she admitted the truth it had always been a bit rare and if there was any going Edmund scoffed it. (221)This little bit is the engine of need that drives the entire novel.And maybe it drives most of our species. Unlike most women I’ve talked to, I was grateful for menopause. It was like waking up from a bad dream—mainly pleasure-craving that I believed at the time was true desire rather than fluctuating hormones. At age almost-72, I prefer being directed (rather than driven) by a more transcendent engine.Interestingly, this 1986 novel was written when author Mary Wesley (1912–2002, aka Mary Aline Siepmann) was 74. My guess is she wrote it because the material charmed her and she knew it would sell. She only began writing in 1970, at the age of 58, when she was widowed and destitute, and she ended up selling three million copies of her books, including ten bestsellers in the last twenty years of her life.

It was a trade that “was always unjustifiable, but inattention and interest prevented, for a time, the evil from being perceived.” He describes the political culture in Africa that participates in this trade. Then after a short reprise of the “packaging” of humans on board, recounts what awaits them when they land:Yet, perhaps, they would wish to spend the remainder of their days on ship board, could they know, beforehand, the nature of the servitude which awaits them, on shore; and that the dreadful hardships and sufferings they have already endured, would, to the most of them, only terminate in excessive toil, hunger, and the excruciating tortures of the cart-whip, inflicted at the caprice of an unfeeling Overseer, proud of the power allowed him of punishing whom, and when, and how he pleases.This very short text, considered historically important, is available free many places.

(page N.A.)Kevin Wilson’s new book Now Is Not the Time to Panic* (HarperCollins, November 2022—thanks for the advanced reading copy) is a multi-level exercise on the opposite event: something in a couple of adolescents’ heads erupting into an unexpected something.What feels like a Y.A. story in the beginning (despite an opening chapter that clearly lets you know it is not) grows into an unpredictably large tale.Two lonely, alienated teenagers create something out of their imaginations that they then force-feed the world, resulting in a herd action that goes to places they never could have imagined.Since I am obsessed with understanding our human herd actions, I had plenty to contemplate. But other readers, and even Kevin Wilson, may see this story as much more personal—a coming-of-age tale about a desire to create and affect the world.Because Kevin Wilson is a terrific writer, readers can go wherever the story takes them.

Funny. RealThis novel about a trans woman (she transitioned in prison in Ithaca) coming home to Brooklyn after 22 years away starts like gangbusters. Funny. Real. I laughed a lot.I read it for my book club (all white women) and one mentioned that it was a challenging read, so she opted for an audiobook. Once into the book, I assumed her challenge was because it was written mostly in Ebonics (Black urban English) with an idiosyncratic use or nonuse of punctuation. Sometimes it shifted from first to third person and none of this bothered me for the first half of the book. I was right there inside protagonist Carlotta Mercedes’s head. But suddenly, a little more than 40 percent into it, the shifts from inside this wildly wonderful trans woman’s first-person head to standard English third-person narrative (sans punctuation, sans paragraph break) felt awkward, tedious, and just weird. I became increasingly impatient because it began to seem messy. There are many long examples of this, but here are a couple of short bits: [Third-person narrative:]As she scoped right, into the kitchen and out to the backyard, the crowd became more female and food-focused, and the dance music overwhelmed the TV. She saw deep aluminum tubs piled with fried chicken, barbecued chicken, potato salad, probably ribs, collard greens, corn bread, and something she couldn’t see—okra? [First-person narrative:]At least I ain’t spent none of my cash down at fucking Junior’s. What I was thinking? Look like I could get seven lunches here for free if I wanna—which I do. . . . (137)[Third-person narrative] Somehow Carlotta hadn’t caught anyone’s attention either, even when she climbed onto the fire escape ladder, which trembled violently and could have collapsed as she descended [No punctuation, switch to first-person narrative] An maybe kilt my own ass too. But din’t nobody pay no mind. That’s a sign you got a good-ass party goin! [Switch back to third person] Another ambulance shrieked through the neighborhood, and Carlotta paused to listen, worried that it was screaming about her future. (251)I could imagine an actor inserting punctuation and paragraph breaks via pauses and voice changes that are not in the written text. This might make the book clearer, and I’ll be curious to hear from my book club members who listened to the audio.The book is wonderful in character and invention, but the shifting voice took the steam out of it and I found myself reading in my “editor’s head” (not a lot of fun when I’m not getting paid). It almost felt as if the author got tired of writing from Carlotta’s perspective, so he shifted to traditional third-person narrative. Not only that, but the last two chapters, a fury of Mercedes’s stream of consciousness, were absolutely exhausting. I slogged through, at least hoping for a plot surprise from two obvious set-ups (a drug test result that didn’t make sense and promised to be explained, and a character who seemed destined to own Mercedes’s house through a reverse mortgage). Both of those set-ups were dropped with no surprising resolution. Even what should have been highly emotional—Carlotta’s recounting of events that had happened to her in prison—droned like a researched report.I don’t know if there was a problem with the writing or if, mid-book, I’d had my suspension of disbelief destroyed to the point where I simply didn’t believe what I was reading anymore. In short, I lost my connection to the story in the second half of the book, despite its colorful character and exciting voice, and because this is not an editing job where I’d be obligated to go through the book to discover reasons, I’ll simply leave the causes for my disconnection and disappointment ambiguous....more",Notes are private!,2,26,1,"Sep 18, 2022","Sep 21, 2022","Sep 05, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60901544-didn-t-nobody-give-a-shit-what-happened-to-carlotta

Hawke isn’t just funny. He is wildly hilarious and literate. He tells a great story that ripples with all that human intestinal squishy stuff we don’t want anybody else to see.I spent many years in the theater as an actor and playwright, so the world of A Bright Ray of Darkness is one I know well. This is one of the best pieces of writing I’ve ever read to convey the art of pretending to be somebody else in a made-up story in front of hundreds of people who, in the best case, suspend their belief that you are really a regular schlub. Add to that the raucous insanity of a bunch of people whose real emotions don’t know the difference between what they’re pretending and being a regular schlub, and even if they do, sometimes they get overwhelmed by the professionally evoked stuff, but, unlike regular schlubs everywhere, these schlubs get distorted by all the applause, so they think what they do is a matter of life and death. But you don’t need a theater background to enjoy this first-person tale of a self-involved drug-addled film actor who’s destroyed his marriage by cheating and, in the throes of anxiety and self-pity, is making his Broadway debut in a production of Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2. One of the things I love most is that while protagonist William Harding’s behavior is out of control, it is matched by what cumulatively feels like a chorus of equally addled advisors who deliver increasingly wise wisdom: a coked-up actor; a poor dresser who is just trying to get William on stage so he (the dresser) doesn’t get fired; William’s coked-up mother who babysits his children at the Mercury (god of messages; there is no such place in real life) Hotel where he’s bunkered during the run of his play; and so many others. Over and over narcissism and drugs are married to wisdom, or, as in the title, there’s dissonance that makes a bigger truth, and it is hilarious.

I’ve found a treasure trove of a writer! I discovered Dermansky through her newest book, Hurricane Girl, and I suspected I was in for a long, delicious ride reading her previous books.She could get away with being “quirky” (don’t get me started on how much I despise that word as a character descriptor), but she has things to say.But instead of spelling them out and ruining your reading fun, I’ll tell you another story:Freshman year of college in 1969, kids from another school invaded our campus. I was a pretty private person. It never would have occurred to me to invite strangers into my dorm room, but I wasn’t given the choice. In the middle of the night my next-door neighbor deposited somebody, saying so-and-so needed to sleep on my floor—bam! I was barely awake and didn’t protest. But grogginess gave way to stupefied horror as this first person, a girl, was joined by a boy who lay down beside her, then demanded my bedspread so they’d have cover as they proceeded to fuck (another word I’m not fond of, but nothing else will do here). Yes, they went at it twelve inches from my head.Do you want to know about people who act this way? I do. Not within breathing distance, but in a book, yeah, bring it on. Show me, let me feel the motivation and rationales that allow people to behave in ways I never could. I can’t get enough of this stuff. Narcissists, psychopaths, amoral real people. When they’re true, whole characters, there is nothing better. I get a good laugh and, finding them in myself because they are true and therefore easy to identify with, I expand.When I decided to write my own last published novel, The Last Will & Testament of Zelda McFigg, the need to embody and celebrate the worst flaws I’d ever suppressed or could imagine suppressing took over. And it was glorious. Liberating. All this stuff is hidden inside all of us. I certainly have felt like Dermansky’s protagonist, Marie, completely unmoored, making life up as I free fell. To let it rip, let it be hilarious—well, I can’t imagine a more fun writing and reading experience.In Steve Toltz (most recently Here Goes Nothing) and now with Marcy Dermansky, I have found other members of my karmic writers’ pack.

Since 1973 I haven’t eaten sugar , so no candy. Also no booze. I love broccoli so much there was a time I ate an entire bag of frozen organic broccoli every night. I don’t eat bread.

Every now and then I remember eating chocolate which I would never do because if I started, I couldn’t stop and I’d quickly weigh 200 pounds, and I really like being svelte and fit. I am unashamed of my eating life in the presence of meat eaters, candy addicts, drinkers, and bread makers. I am as unashamed as all of the characters in Marcy Dermansky’s story of people doing all the things people really do and normally try to hide, but in this book, they tell the unseen reader, maybe sometimes knowing they should be somewhat abashed, but the fact is they are not because they simply want to do what they do.If this book were my kind of candy, it would be broccoli covered in sugarless chocolate that tasted like the real thing. And no matter how much anyone else scoffed at that, I’d give them a “huh” look and simply scarf it down.Marcy Dermansky’s characters unabashedly live their hilarious scrambled sexy lives, admitting everything. And food plays an important role in this book (as it does in the previous two novels I just read, Hurricane Girl and Bad Marie).

The flat way of making emotionally right-angle turns and the sudden spewing of judgments and hilarious violent fantasies. Robin Yeatman has invented her own genre. I particularly enjoyed (and had some “holy cow” moments because I’ve written a similar theme in two unpublished books) the juxtaposition of somebody on a spiritual-seeking path, rife with so-called psychic abilities and experiences, who simultaneously is in the throes of all our ego maladies—judgments, aversions, general hate and hostility. This is honest and wonderfully accurate. One would hope if one were evolved enough to have out-of-body experiences at will or to lead a massage client in a self-acceptance relaxation exercise one would not simultaneously hate everybody around them, but this simply isn’t true. I love that Yeatman pulled no punches.Protagonist Victoria Cavanagh and her husband Eric can’t stand each other’s bodily functions, or bodies, or personalities. They got married by rote, shoved together by their parents. They live and work in upscale Montreal. Victoria, a rabid bookworm who even finishes tomes that she hates, thinks about murdering Eric. And Eric? Who knows what he’s thinking beyond becoming a partner in his law firm?This book is inventive, funny, creepy, and fun.

It's on Netgalley right now.Original ReviewI feel as if I’ve been hearing about this book for more than a decade but that’s impossible because it was published by Milkweed Press in 2013. So maybe I just began hearing about Robin Kimmerer when I commissioned an article for the magazine I was working at in 2009: Tracy Basile’s “Saving Sacred Species”. A few weeks ago a friend began mentioning Braiding Sweetgrass on Facebook, then Tracy joined in and mentioned it again and I ended up visiting her—only our second in-person meeting in 23 years; how I originally met her when she, a complete stranger, rescued me at the desolate taxi-less train station of my childhood town on a dark night in 1999, well, it’s one of those stories with octopus legs into the future that is far too long to tell in a book .But all of these so-called coincidences only matter to illustrate that sometimes the universe shouts by mentioning something over and over, and I’m glad I listened and finally got around to reading this amazing book.Braiding Sweetgrass blew my head apart, and along with that, decimated the carefully constructed guard walls around my heart. It happened when botanist/ecologist/professor/mother/Potawatami Native Kimmerer wrote an utterly sensible chapter about the notion that if I love the Earth, the Earth may love me back. Literally. Then she broke this down with science. Then as the truth of the statement hit, as my heart and head exploded, I had to put the book down and go for a walk; and walking about New York City in a state of buoyant gratitude was a whole new experience.Kimmerer mentions how she proposes this notion of reciprocal love to her botany classes full of ardent ecologists who have been feeling, to their sensibilities, unrequited love for the planet. The very visceral idea that the thing, the being, they love so deeply actually truly loves them back explodes their (and my own) notions of existence.Read this book! Buy this book—when your heart explodes, you’ll feel good knowing that you’ve reciprocated by sending Kimmerer a royalty. And you may want to mark it up; I bought it a few pages into a library copy because the impulse was overwhelming. Rather than a linear story, each chapter is like an essay, and some blew me apart; others were more quiet and horrifying. They ranged from memoir-ish to straight ecology to the visceral history of consumerism and consequential disrespect for Earth and her resources, but what they had in common was a refrain of reciprocity with plant and element beings. I suspect each reader will find sections they want to mark and go back to in order to re-evoke something. For me it was the shattering of walls as love destroys all boundaries. When you feel that, you also feel hope and possibility. To paraphrase Kimmerer, when you love and know you are loved and valued in return, you are compelled to honor and protect your Earth lover.Here’s one of the passages I marked:Philosopher Joanna Macy writes of the oblivion we manufacture for ourselves to keep us from looking environmental problems straight in the eye. She quotes R. J. Clifton, a psychologist studying human response to catastrophe: “Suppression of our natural responses to disaster is part of the disease of our time. The refusal to acknowledge these responses causes a dangerous splitting. It divorces our mental calculations from our intuitive, emotional, and biological embeddedness in the matrix of life That split allows us passively to acquiesce in the preparations for our own demise.” (325-326)And to end on a note of hope—because this really is a book of hope and potential restoration: Respiration—the source of energy that lets us farm and dance and speak. The breath of plants gives life to animals and the breath of animals gives life to plants. My breath is your breath, your breath is mine. It’s the great poem of give and take, of reciprocity that animates the world. Isn’t that a story worth telling? Only when people understand the symbiotic relationships that sustain them can they become people of corn [light people who live with gratitude and humility], capable of gratitude and reciprocity.

Although I got a little tired of the cute persona voice, there were times when real emotions came out and I found myself relieved and tuning in. This book belongs to right now—an era when wealthy people buying admissions are finally prosecuted for misdeeds and self-conscious liberals put their feet in their overactive mouths and a Black person with smarts (the admissions director) knows exactly what is going on all the time.This was my book club’s pick for August—probably not a book I’d read on my own; just not my thing, but absolutely nothing wrong with it. Well written, sometimes funny, part broad-stroke farce, part romantic fantasy.

As an editor, I often receive manuscripts that go completely haywire when the writer has no sense of chronology but has tried to pack a story with past events. Most often, I’ll suggest movements of whole sections to make the line more chronological.McEwan would be right to eschew such notes. He breaks every rule of clarity through chronology and instead moves through history by logical mind moves: A memory evokes a scene from childhood, and then a space break icon in the text suffices to bring us back to present. A memory within a memory takes us to further past, and then somehow the natural movement spirals back to first memory or present. Never hurried, it is nothing to have protagonist Roland Baines, a poet who has been jilted by his wife and left to care for his infant son, suddenly pick up a book, evoking the entire plot of a Conrad novel. Or to go from the Cuban Missile Crisis to one of the most surprising, honest, and original love scenes I’ve ever read, launching character and plot through human complexity and depravity that was worth waiting for—perfectly crescendoing to the end of Part 1.In all this meandering (in three parts; 431 pages) there is no dead time. No stasis. No confusion. Even when it got a bit too slow for me, I found that I appreciated—required—what I’d learned during those intervals as soon as he returned to the present-day plot. This book moves to its own pulse, and, for me, this was like being rocked like an infant, secure in my mother’s all-protective heartbeat under my head.Until suddenly, a third of the way through, I realized what I was being seductively rocked into without awareness of the grooming going on. This is a breathtaking dance. So subtle and ultimately shocking that I dare not say more.But I lie: The central event to which I’ve just alluded turns out to be only a chapter in a sprawling whole-life drama. There’s history, political tirades, hurts, betrayals, and finally our incredible smallness in this mysterious, magnificent story of life.Just let McEwan take you. Assume nothing. Surrender. And, writers, read this book for a master class in narrative writing. Although my style (tight, fast, funny) is almost the opposite of McEwan’s in this book (not all his books are this meandering), I so admire his narrative that I’m sure I’m picking up things that I will one day steal without acknowledging any theft....more",Notes are private!,0,61,1,"Sep 24, 2022","Sep 29, 2022","Jul 18, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60092581-lessons

My introduction was The Dutch House where I gushed not only about the story but about the cover art. My next book was State of Wonder where I was in awe of her technical prowess and range, but baffled by a strange censorship.In These Precious Days, Patchett's friend has a dream about her and has the overwhelming sense from the dream of Ann Patchett's ""completeness."" That expresses what I feel about her writing, this book, and the person I've just spent days with. There is something so satisfyingly complete about her that even though our backgrounds are so different, I always resonated with her and felt as if I could have responded to everything like an excited friend.I loved the shop talk—about writing and book covers, etc. I got to learn not only about The Dutch House's cover story but about the two (yes, two) covers on the book I was holding. I hadn't realized until reading the essay on book covers that it has two front covers—on the front and back—and they are painted by the much-celebrated friend of two of the essays, Sooki Raphael. In addition, I think I may have an understanding of the weird censorship of any peeing/pooping explanation in State of Wonder via my new understanding of Patchett's father's influence. I love this woman! I love her work.

Or if dialogue is really awful, I’ve commented that “people don’t always say (or even know) what they’re really thinking” and in well-written dialogue, the reader sometimes understands more about subtext than the characters do. Instead of ever writing those criticisms again, I wish I could just will those writers to read a copy of Marcy Dermansky’s Hurricane Girl before they publish again.This is how it’s done!

A worthy subject, but boy oh boy, was this slow. Although the writing is well done, for me there is a heady flatness to the first-person narrator's affect—almost like the voiceover of a narrator in a movie—even as she describes personal experiences. In a movie this flat sound, when it echoes with omniscience, works because it's laid over a tapestry of full characters and dramatic plot that we, the audience, are actively witnessing. Here, it's just the narration, sans omniscience or tension of any unsaid subtext, and, although sometimes I briefly got intrigued and a couple of times, moved, when the situations got dramatic and, as a writer, I am certainly interested in the content, for the most part I wasn't invested in the characters or the story and had to push myself through it.

That story, originally publisheI sought this novel out after reading Kathrine Kressmann Taylor’s perfect goose-bump of a short story Address Unknown. That story, originally published in 1938, received much-deserved notoriety in its time and was later republished as a stand-alone paperback with an afterword by the author's son giving the back story of this riveting epistolary exchange between two Germans, one a Jew and one a budding Nazi, at a pivotal time in history. It is an international best-seller.I'm guessing Kressmann Taylor's son, Charles Douglas Taylor (who contributed back-of-book comprehensive and illuminating histories about and by the real man* on whom Day of No Return was based), was motivated by the short story's success to self-publish (through Xlibris) this 2016 American edition of this out-of-print novel that has only 4 s on Goodreads. I would like to remedy its unmerited obscurity.Day of No Return, first published in 1942, is equally necessary and horrifying. And it should be read by Americans who love democracy and are frazzled by our current history. If you enjoy reading history, this novel may be for you. I'll explain:I was not brought up with a religion and one of the good parts of that is that I have no sense of any religion being superior and am comfortable with a live and let live attitude. But this background has also made me obtuse to the dynamism of religious fervor and power and how it can be used to take over and demolish democracy. For all its flaws, our Constitution and the founders were absolutely brilliant in their proclamation of a republic with a separation of church and state—a separation which insidious forces are eroding as I type.The similarities of the trajectory of Germany into a Nazi regime and what's going on now in the USA are unmistakable. But without the knowledge of the historical precedent, we Americans are missing the chance to do a course correction.If you are not interested in religion, some of this book could be daunting—the changing politics affecting the German Lutheran church and its pastor, as told by the pastor's son. Even if church doctrine and politics are not your thing, I encourage you to read this, because it is identical to what is happening here in the States with a carefully choreographed merging of State and willing Evangelicals and the impending elimination of women's rights to their own bodies by establishing the primacy of one religion's beliefs and codifying it into law. (Jews and Buddhists have entirely different beliefs about what constitutes an in-utero person, not to mention all the beliefs of people who do not ascribe to any organized religion, not to mention the plethora of individual traumas and circumstances that determine a woman's choice to give birth or not.)In Germany, citizens got drawn by the magnetism of power—a leader who established a cult and declared it a religion. This religion that is not a religion takes over organized religion, pushing out people who truly believe in God and loving their neighbor. It's like a virus. And what's left is a religion called ""German Christians"" which has zero to do with the Golden Rule or a Loving God, let alone mercy. And it happens step by carefully choreographed step—like judges here being appointed who'll do away with women's right to bodily autonomy; —like election officials being replaced by people with loyalty to a party or doctrine rather than democratic elections; —by having a so-called member of the fourth estate act as a propaganda machine; —by enacting legislation to encourage people to spy on one another, investigate miscarriages, and prosecute anybody who may have broken the Christian Right's ban on abortion. Unlike the USA, there was no established separation of church and state in Germany's former republic, however this allowed the Nazis to take over the customary teaching of religion in schools, substituting Nazi (aka ""German Christian"") doctrine and ""Aryan blood theory"" for Lutheran spiritual teaching—which sounds a lot like the book banning now happening in Florida and elsewhere. ""They are not teaching our boys to be Christians any more. [says one distraught mother] They are teaching them to worship the state, to worship the Fuehrer instead of God. They make fun of the Bible,' a woman with tear-smudged cheeks began. (180)""But nothing is as it seems. It is really all about power, not about beliefs. But people who believe are pulled into it; so are people who feel lost or victimized or disparaged. And those who merely go about their lives, ignoring the whole thing, oblivious to what is happening on what seems to them to be the edges of their comfort, don't have a chance.People with a church background will have a much easier time with this novel than I did and perhaps appreciate more of the intricacies of the Lutheran resistance to what happened. But if you can't get into anything religious, I hope that, through this little , you can still hear and heed the warning and message this book has for this moment in American history:We must vote in huge numbers to protect the separation of church and state. Ignoring this virus is not an option if we want to keep democracy as we've known it.I live in New York State where our representatives overwhelmingly support democracy, but I intend to try to affect the larger republic through participation in an organization called Vote Forward—sending nonpartisan letters to sluggish registered voters in states with upcoming midterm elections, simply stating why voting is important to me.If you are a Christian who believes in separation of church and state and a democratic republic, you might feel called to action by the heroic resistance of the Lutherans recounted in this book. What that action might be, I have no idea.If you are living in Putin's Russia right now, there is a whole other level of stuff for you in this book.____________* Rev. Leopold Bernhard (b. 1915, d. 1985)**, the real pastor whose story this is, escaped to the USA, subsequently was threatened by Nazi supporters in this country, reported his experience to the FBI, who arranged the meetings with Kressmann Taylor. She wrote his story (this book) under the title Until That Day with unofficial government backing and private financial support. The book was on track to be a best-seller, Book-of-the-Month Club pick, and movie, but all of that was cancelled after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, ""which made it unnecessary to raise anti-fascist sentiments in America. (226)""**An unfinished autobiography of Bernhard's is included in the back of this book. (I didn't read it. Maybe eventually I will.)*** BR Note: The Nazi Christianity is referred to in this book as a ""pagan"" religion in a disparaging way. This is a misuse of the word. Paganism in truth is an authentic religion deriving from Ancient Greece and Rome whose practitioners believe in the sacredness of nature. There was no reverence for anything other than Hitler and Aryan blood in the Nazi Christianity.5/18/22 UpdateAs everyone who lives in the United States is probably aware, Saturday, 5/14/22, a white supremacist vigilante took it upon himself to carry out his mission to murder, directed by the Nazi-espoused ""Replacement Theory"" now given wide publicity by Fox News and the internet. This morning, historian Heather Cox Richardson, in her free newsletter Letters from an American, quoted President Biden's remarks at the site of the Buffalo mass murder: “What happened here is simple and straightforward,” Biden said, “Domestic terrorism. Violence inflicted in the service of hate and a vicious thirst for power that defines one group of people being inherently inferior to any other group. A hate that through the media and politics, the Internet, has radicalized angry, alienated, lost, and isolated individuals into falsely believing that they will be replaced—that’s the word, “replaced”—by the “other”—by people who don’t look like them and who are therefore, in a perverse ideology that they possess and [are] being fed, lesser beings.”Biden called on “all Americans to reject [that] lie.” He condemned “those who spread the lie for power, political gain, and for profit.” “[T]he ideology of white supremacy has no place in America,” he said. “Silence is complicity.” ...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"May 06, 2022","May 14, 2022","May 06, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/42349211-day-of-no-return

Violeta seems to me to be a history told through one woman's life story, as told to a relative in a very long letter. But mostly it's history; not a lot of novel-like plot. The country it takes place is never named. It's Chile, but I had to deduce that based on where Allende was born as well as other geographical clues (it's next door to Argentina). Likewise, the capital is never named (Santiago) but referred to as ""the capitol"" and the named cities do not exist in my World Atlas. I don't understand the reason for this obfuscation, but I guess there is one that eludes me. I feel smarter having read the tale of dictatorship, revolution, corruption, torture and genocide, as well as the USA's role in all this, and domestic abuse—woven into a woman's life story. But despite a well-done technical wrapping up at the end—lost people found, revenge delivered, and an absolutely beautiful end-of-life scene at the end—this felt less like a novel than a historical recounting and sometimes reporting.

She then became fluent in one week. I feel as if I'm in a similar story reading this book, my second by André Alexis. I've never had an affinity for mythology or poetry, I'm not Canadian and am unfamiliar with the political or cultural idiosyncrasies, but I found myself mesmerized, understanding references beyond what I remember reading. And even if I missed the root source of some of the material, I had no problem understanding it like a language I've privately spoken forever.The novel starts like a realistic story: a young man, a botanist, agrees to accompany a professor on an odyssey to research the life of a poet. But very quickly this becomes a modern-day myth with references to ancient ones (the botanist's name is Alfie Homer), and the sandwiching of Greek mythology with a modern story, plus the general zaniness, sometimes makes this hilarious. Other times, it was like finding a map to my life and psyche, and therefore it became an ocean of something I sank deep into, staying as open as I could to absorb whatever wisdom and life acceptance might be there for me in my idiosyncratic life in New York City. Over and over, I had moments when I suddenly felt clear, as if I'd awakened from a dream. And I think this might be the experience of any reader who is on a lifelong quest—call it spiritual, self-awareness, or whatever you like—to understand what we're doing here.The writing is understatedly wonderful; you have to notice—it never shouts, ""Look at literary me!"" So that gives a regular reader (one not well-versed in mythology) a connection. I'm sure I could (and may) read this book many times and keep understanding it differently. But for this first reading what penetrated most was our human inability to ever really see things without projections of our own. And how if our projections are somehow shattered by the reality of the person we are projecting onto, we lose interest; or if we are the object of somebody's projections, the kiss of death can be insisting that we are not who they see. [""I'd hate to have my image of him (the poet the professor is researching) destroyed by facts, (132)"" says the professor at the prospect of actually meeting the man whose life he is chasing.] Or, if we willingly shatter our own projections, there is the possibility of something privately numinous.Seeing this ridiculous quest as the norm was oddly a relief. While reading, I often felt myself surrendering the fight for perfection—perfect knowing, being perfectly known—and it always is a relief to stop trying to do something that is futile . . . and instead allow the shattering, sometimes lonely, unknowing to direct us. (And if you choose this third option, this book is very good company.)...more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Apr 12, 2022","Apr 15, 2022","Apr 06, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/40993282-days-by-moonlight

Rocksy's mom and I became very close, so we visited after they moved back to New Mexico.Maya died January 18th of this year. Rocksy, a couple of years before that.

I was so curious about and reverent of her dogness that I attempted to understand it on every level open to me. My olfactory system is more canine than human and I found I learned to use it better by mimicking Maya's way of using her nose; I knew her different smells and what they meant and if she spent a day away from me, I was all over her when she returned to learn about who had touched her. I spent a lot of time on the floor, looking at things from Maya's height and perspective. And when we were outside, I often shifted to seeing things from her perspective in my mind's eye. I did all this privately and it would never have occurred to me to share this … until reading Fifteen Dogs.Just when I was almost ready to give up on the human species, there is this: a man named André Alexis has the imagination, wisdom, and skill to write an apologue where gods imbue dogs with human thinking, and thereby expose the story of our entire mess.I laughed.

About a quarter of the way through Death and the Penguin, a dark post-Soviet Union story of an obit writer in Kiev, Ukraine, who lives with a pet penguin and then a young girl in his charge, I felt so ignorant that I stopped reading and instead read a long Encyclopedia Britannica history of the country that left me feeling overwhelmed by the complexity of the changing politics there vis a vis Russia. The best I could do was to understand that the current country is a very new democracy with a long history of corruption.And this story is about that corrupt, brutal, homicidal society in the 1990s. It is impossible to read the arbitrary killing here and not think about Putin's army's indiscriminate bombing of Ukraine. But reading Kurkov's story also gives me a clue about the roots of the incredible will to fight and live of everyday Ukrainians. If your past is what's in this story, you will do anything not to return to it. You will die to protect your right to liberty, even if you make mistakes and manage to elect corrupt leaders.The book, my club's pick for April, is described as a dark comedy. The dark part, I get.

I suspect a lot of us feel that way right now about our planet and the environment and all the disappearing animals and habitats.I loved Bradley Somer’s novel Fishbowl, a fine literary tale of a fish’s slow fall from the terrace of a high-rise, so I’m interested in reading anything he writes.

My heart pounded during fights, I yelled things like “Oh no!” and of course, I rooted for the bear.The ending was completely unexpected and wonderful. Rather than give even an inkling of what it is, I’ll say that, based solely on the ending, I would shelve Extinction beside Richard Powers’s The Overstory, Richard Flanagan’s The Living Sea of Waking Dreams, and Charlotte McConaghy’s Migrations.Thank you, HarperVoyager, for the advanced reading copy....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,Dec 2022,"Dec 07, 2022","Mar 04, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/60152101-extinction

So whWhen I read Steve Toltz's A Fraction of the Whole four years ago, I felt as if I'd met in Toltz a member of my personal writers karmic pack. So when I heard he had a new book coming this May, I instantly requested and then gobbled down an advanced reading copy of Here Goes Nothing.If you like to laugh wildly while simultaneously obsessing over the meaning of existence, the hopelessness of our human egos, what may or may not happen after death, and if there is an afterlife, will there be constipation and diarrhea? this is a book for you.Angus Mooney, the protagonist, is a thief, a romantic, and a philosopher who is dedicated to the easier path of not learning or understanding anything. Despite his skepticism about just about everything and the value of anything, he falls in love, marries, dies, and . . . Well, that's where the excitement really begins and to tell you about the wild ride that follows would be a disservice.Author Steve Toltz is his own man and writer, but to give you an idea of the speed and spontaneity of his literary inventiveness, imagine if Robin Williams and Joseph Heller gave birth (they'd figure out how) to a prodigy writer son and they left him alone for a few years in a room with a typewriter. (Somehow this picture demands a typewriter, with its clamor, its swinging and dinging parts, and paper being rolled and ripped and sent in crumpled balls across the room.) Now imagine the kid grew up and, during the growing, read every book he ever got his hands on, developed a writer's skill for structure and language and ways of seeing that were utterly his own, and he decided to write a book about life, death, and everything in between and after.That's this amazing, hilarious book.Thank you, Melville House, for the ARC.

A writer who strives to tell the truth acknowledges, first, that it's impossible. The minute you put something into language, you are once-removed from its essence. And when you try to write the truth about somebody other than yourself, the chances of getting it right are almost nil. And if you try to tell the truth about yourself, you are in for the battle of your life.In this funny, moving memoir about Brian Morton's complicated irascible mother Tasha, Morton not only does full battle with himself to tell the truth, but he strives to get it right about a woman whose last words to him were, ""I hate you.""And somehow Morton makes his striving, full of conversations with himself in an effort to get to truths he may be ignoring or hiding from himself, absolutely riveting.I loved it.

Something + nothing is the perfect state (not that I’ve ever experienced it for more than a second). In fact in a novel my agent is trying to sell, I wax poetic about it:  [It was] Nothing like anything Lily had ever felt. She disappeared in its ocean. No more Lily. Nothing. And to try to preserve this feeling, she began her lifelong habit of keeping a diary: “I felt nothing today.” And only she understood that this was a sublime event. But enough about me.Percival Everett has written a whole novel about nothing.“ . . . Nothing is everywhere and nowhere. It exists all the time and at no time. It doesn’t change or move and experience or exhibit any kind of change, so time is unintelligible when considering it. Nothing is so dangerous.” (179) A professor who is a professor of nothing gets involved in a villain’s villainous caper to steal nothing ... until the professor realizes what the villain’s really doing. The professor’s name (not his real one) is Wala Kitu—two words that mean nothing. He is a mathematician who doesn’t use a computer. Some ers have said this book is a parody of James Bond movies—I’ve seen a few, but don’t remember them well enough to relate to that. This book is filled with references and word play that I’m not educated enough to understand, but since I am a person obsessed with nothing, this is my kind of book.You can contemplate for days about the randomness of life. You can despair that nothing spoken means anything true because it is once-removed from its root, and likewise, can anything even exist without a vector* to focus on? You can wonder about the whole notion of contingencies in a random universe. You can laugh about how we assign value to nothing. You can fall into a black hole obsessing about which is “real life”—what we call dream life or the awake one so many of us can’t agree on? And, as long as we’re going there, how many so-called realities exist and are they simultaneous? You can ponder whether we (material beings) can connect to Nothing (capital “N” intended—the great Nothing that is the result of clearing the mind completely), and if we can fully do that, might we disappear? You can notice how observation of Nothing makes it something. Then you can grind your grey matter, craving Nothing while simultaneously knowing you are negating the effort with the grind. You can long for the ability to become so expanded that you can simultaneously be something and Nothing.Or you can ignore all this and just laugh. (Although you may have to contemplate some of the topics in the previous paragraph to understand what you’re laughing at. And if my previous paragraph gives you a headache, this may not be a book you’ll enjoy.)This book is funny, but not as wildly so as its precursor Glyph (about a child version of this character) or I Am Not Sidney Poitier (where Percival Everett appears as a character very much like Wala Kitu, and there are some other characters similar to ones in Dr. No). If you’ve read a lot of Everett’s many books, you’ll recognize certain themes. Yet this novel is, once again, its own species. The slower I read, the more brilliant this book became. It is not a book for people who require unnuanced, shallow anything. You have to enjoy contemplation about our very existence and, if you do, you may be astounded at Percival Everett’s accomplishment writing about nothing.Thank goodness a man so obsessed with nothing keeps putting out something! And as long as he continues, I’ll keep reading whatever he has to say about absolutely anything.______*Vector, per Merriam Webster:a. a quantity that has magnitude and direction and that is commonly represented by a directed line segment whose length represents the magnitude and whose orientation in space represents the direction broadly : an element of a vector space An understanding of this word will greatly enhance your reading pleasure.**And one picky note: There are a lot of typos in this book.

Okay, I thought, and I began interpreting the metaphors, but by the time I got to the owl birth, forget that. I had somehow sunk all-into metaphor—a place where you feel and interpretation is no longer an inclination.When I worked for a spiritual magazine, we received a story pitch and submission from a woman who wanted to instruct readers about “spiritual parenting.” And as I read her story, my blood increasingly chilled.

I dropped the subject.Maude, the titular elderly lady of this wonderful book—called ""Stories"" but really it's a well-constructed novel in chapters with story titles—is a breath of fresh air right now, and certainly somebody with whom I could share my dark impulses. Maude, too, is practical about problem solving, but without any moral inhibitions. I'm not going to kill anybody, but I think I, as well as most people, are capable of it—for instance, if we are facing death at the hands of a madman or his stooges. So it was therapeutic reading about a character with absolutely no qualms about acting as mad as any mad killers I can imagine and, in a weird way, as sane as the most heroic hero....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Feb 25, 2022","Feb 27, 2022","Jan 01, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/57534442-an-elderly-lady-must-not-be-crossed

I really enjoyed it, but it makes me even more eager to see her next book, now that Wolitzer is in her nineties and still writing strong.An Available Man is about a happily married man who is widowed, with step-children who remain ""his children,"" and how he negotiates ""dating after death."" It's about people who live normal domestic lives and grapple with love, loss, and loneliness (alliteration in honor of Wolitzer's fun-making of same in personals ads—the humor in this book is gentle and kind).In any other hands, a story like this might bore me after a while because it is from the normal-domestic-lives side of the street that I have never inhabited. But I'm suspecting that anything Hilma Wolitzer writes will excite me. As with her short stories, here she writes real people. There is no nicey-nice, no airbrushing, no Hallmark anything. So for me, inhabiting the life of protagonist Edward Schuyler and his family was like re-education into what normalcy can be—no horrendous violence; there is a little insanity from a former girlfriend, but honestly, by the time she came along, I was so wallowing in normal love that she is the only character I wanted to get away from.I cannot wait for Hilma Wolitzer's next book.

They may even step one foot over the line, but seeing that they can come back and choose sanity has a healing effect.This book will give you that experience.In the genre of “Sociopathic Girl Children” (SGC) books that I’ve read, this is one of the best and therefore most upsetting—both for the same reason. The sociopathic child, Chrissie, is someone you are forced to identify with.* As I read, I felt every single one of her horrible impulses and emotions, and it was mesmerizing and sickening. But I couldn’t stop reading.The other two SGC books that come to mind are Reasons She Goes to the Woods by Deborah Kay Davies and the almost impenetrable masterpieceThe Swallower Swallowed by Réjean Ducharme. Both of the sociopathic girls in these books have stayed with me, and I don't know that that is a good thing. But I never got so fully pulled into them as I did with Chrissie in Nancy Tucker's book.Tucker's book is straight-forward prose, great dialogue, a regular novel. The Davies book is like a poem that swirls you around and all thinking stops. Likewise, if you can stick with the Ducharme book, you stop thinking and just feel, and what you feel is sickening. Tucker never shuts off your brain.And she makes you feel the whole, very complicated emotional story that starts from a baby's need for love and food, and how if there is even a small window of that, a healthy baby will attach, and then what happens when that attachment is rejected and abused—over and over. How that initial love becomes something to hate as well as crave, how it turns into a festering wound of hurt that can blossom into the most heinous kind of hate. It's all here.But unlike the other books I've mentioned that just leave you with feeling sickened, Nancy Tucker blessedly pulls you into healing and redemption.The book (amazingly, a first novel) is riveting and, for me, was a workout that requires some convalescence.____________*Chrissie, unlike the girls in the other books I mention, changes and feels feelings that a true sociopath would never feel. Hence, calling her one is inaccurate.

I’m incredibly stupid about things involving groups, and therefore it has taken me years to understand their benefits.For instance, it was years between joining Goodreads (because a bunch of writers and publishing people told me if you were a writer you had to be on this site) and realizing that by writing what I think about books (something I never thought I’d want to do), I learn what I think and in the process, make friends with people who care as much as I do about reading and they in turn enrich my choice of books and therefore my life more than I could ever convey.So thank every single one of you for writing s and being my friend here!Similarly because I am slow, I’ve resisted the end-of-year wrap-up. My reasons are that I have no interest in comparing the books I read and selecting favorites; each book is its own entity. But as I’ve read other people’s wrap-ups, I’ve seen how everybody uses them in their own way—to thank others in the community (again, THANK YOU!), to tell year-end personal stories, etc. And it’s suddenly dawning on me (even though I’ve already used a previous year to laud my discovery of Percival Everett’s work) that if I try to articulate what this year’s reading has been for me, I might better understand it.Looking over my 2021 list, I realize that the books that stand out for me are not necessarily my favorite ones, but they are the books that changed my thinking and helped me grow within the political and cultural tumult. Some of these books are not particularly well written and some are gloriously written; some were actually arduous or painful to read and some were a celebration. But all of them got inside me and made me think and feel and helped me understand what’s going on and my part in it.So, in no particular order, here are those books from 2021:Earth’s Wild Music by Kathleen Dean Moore (bought and read twice within a couple of months; glorious writing about our incredible home planet)Tulsa 1921: Reporting a Massacre by Randy Krehbiel (arduous but necessary)You’ll Never Believe What Happened to Lacey: Crazy Stories about Racism by Amber Ruffin and Lacey Lamar (entertaining and educational for a White person)Persist by Elizabeth Warren (one of the most pleasurable educational experiences I’ve ever had about subjects I’ve assumed were boring; long overdue information)The Passenger by Ulrich Alexander Boschwitz (I intensely disliked the experience of being a Jew on the run in Nazi Germany; everything about this book was claustrophobic and overwhelming but I’m glad I read it because I can never not know what I felt.)The Reckoning by Mary Trump (history I already knew but told with such clarity to tie it to our present trauma)The Trees by Percival Everett (because Percival Everett makes my head explode and I’m just so glad he incarnated the same time I did)Hell of a Book by Jason Mott (a story that needs to be told and Mott figured out how to do it hilariously, heartbreakingly, and ingeniously)People Love Dead Jews: Reports from the Haunted Present by Dara Horn (because I’ve recommended it to two siblings and a childhood friend.

Welcome to Dara Horn’s mind and anthology of essays. If you have had the experience of walking into a place that has airbrushed out nuance, a place filled with sirens blaring off-key reverential music and you cannot understand why everybody else isn’t cringing in pain—why on earth are they acting like this is reverence at all?—you may appreciate this book. If you are interested in history told in an engaging voice with something riveting and original to say, read it. If you are member of any group whose culture, language, and traditions were willfully destroyed (i.e., Native American whose kids were taken away to boarding schools in order to “destroy the Indian and leave the man” and Black people) and now see that parts of your culture have become popular to revere, making those who do so feel better about themselves, you may be interested in the commonality of the Jewish experience. If, like me, you were not brought up with any Jewish or other religion or culture, yet somewhere in your bone marrow, you have a truth detector, you may love this book.Dara Horn is a Jewish literature scholar with a virtual toilet paper roll of credits and degrees. I am not a scholar, and as I mentioned, I was not brought up Jewish. Generally I get bored by commentaries on literature, but I was on the edge of my intellect inhaling everything Horn had to say in this compelling book of essays. Despite my vacuum of a background in anything religious, I realized so many things, one of which is that the bone marrow truth detector inside me that I so value is a Jew!There is so much to think about in this book that I could not begin to enumerate the ideas and quests, but the one that evoked my bone marrow epiphany is that Jewish literature does not favor neat, happy endings; instead it leaves things open-ended, accepting not knowing or ambiguity. And following in that tradition, not all of Horn’s ideas are crisp—and I particularly like her choice to favor the search rather than the conclusion about what makes a person (Varian Fry) leap into action to rescue people he doesn’t know (Jews in Nazi-occupied France). I’ve always deeply felt not knowing is more honest than its opposite (what that is I’ll leave for others to fill in). So for me, this is a book of deep truth.With that, I’ll refer you to Elyse Walters’s ecstatic response which is what propelled me to read this indescribably powerful and intellectually exciting book....more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,"Dec 03, 2021","Dec 06, 2021","Dec 03, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56769532-people-love-dead-jews

Never has a great American novel been so necessary and so justly recognized.Original ReviewHow on earth do you  or even talk about such a devastatingly funny and shattering work of art? How can you begin to convey the nature of a story that tells the untellable?I haven’t a clue. So instead I’ll tell a story I can tell:About forty-five years ago I was grocery shopping in Food City, the long-gone supermarket at the corner of my block, West 70 Street, and Columbus Avenue. I was standing in the checkout line when an old pasty-faced White man came storming in, yelling, “Nigger! Niggers!” and slathering hate like a sudden tsunami of mucous. Like most of the people in the store, I was (and am) White. I think I stopped breathing, hoping he’d come nowhere near me and would leave soon. No management showed up to see that that happened. This is New York, they probably thought if they even noticed. Another whack job.About a minute after the pasty-faced whack job entered, three little boys with bikes came trundling in, laughing and talking. They were maybe 10 and 8. Instantly the manager told them they couldn’t bring those bicycles into the store, so the two older boys sent the 8-year-old to stand with the bikes outside the entrance while the 10-year-olds picked up snacks.I paid for my groceries, exited the store, and I think resumed breathing. But not for long. Thirty seconds behind me, the pasty-faced nut job exploded out of the store, and seeing the little boy with the bikes, yelled, “Nigger!” either spitting or doing it with such force that the child almost fell over. And then he, the man, took off.This is not my story—it is the boy’s; but to completely tell it I have to say what I did: I about-faced, and took care of the little boy until his friends came out of the store. I told him all sorts of things about how the man was crazy and we were all just waiting for him to leave, and there was nothing wrong with the little boy and he should not for one second imagine that this craziness had anything to do with him. Then I asked permission to stand next to the boy until his friends came out. He nodded, speechless; in fact I don’t recall him ever saying a word. But I will never forget his shocked saucer eyes. And I will never forget his numb nod once his friends came out and I asked if he would be okay now. And I will never forget a moment of devastation I witnessed and the ripples of damage that came before it and would go on and on and on that I could do not one damned thing about.This is not a story about me. It is a story about that boy.And Jason Mott figured out how to tell it.

It’s sweet and sad and harsh and nostalgic. It hurt, yet I enjoyed it.Borden Deal’s daughter, Ashley Deal Moss, who declares flat-out that her father is Boy Sword, the twelve-year-old narrator in this book, also says to readers: “Perhaps an understanding of your family or parents and heritage will ring true as this novel rang true for me.”A particularly timely comment for me, reading the book in the wake of my dog’s death, and synchronistic with a distant relative sending me a digitized video of home movies of my father’s family from 1926 to 1936. The lives of the Robinsons and the Deals could not be more different, but what they have in common is rich, intense physical family relationships and complicated community dependencies.There is not a lot of philosophizing in The Least One, but when it comes it's good: One day a swarm of bees descends on the sharecroppers' homes in Bugscuffle Bottoms and everybody goes nuts trying to get them to land and form a honey-producing hive. Observing this, Boy says: We whirled in and around ourselves, too, our own little world. If we’d had a queen bee, Bugscuffle Bottoms would have been exactly like that swarm of wild bees, trying to get closer and closer and dying off and not paying any attention to the dying because living was more important. (271)In my present quiet mood—morose at times—this statement says it all. I do not understand this life process at all: what we’re doing, why we try so hard, and what the point is. But I know this mood will pass and eventually, once again, I’ll look at someone and see pure life force and, as forgetful as the bees, I’ll fall as in love as Deal was and my father’s massive family were when they had no idea of the disasters and mindless dying-off that were to come.I apologize if this  brought you down.

And Heller answered, true, but he had something the rich guy would never have. “What?” asked the rich guy. “Enough,” answered Heller.That was enough to stir my hunger and this book fed me well. Everyone who is interested in a psychological approach to behavior with money will find something valuable here. I read mercenarily for my specific questions and life and skipped or skimmed chapters and large sections that had nothing to do with me.All my life I’ve felt insecure and often stupid about money, and this book shifted those feelings dramatically. I went from feeling precarious to stunned and grateful to some stubborn inner self for the rightness (for me) of my actions: my tortoise-like steadfastness around saving, my intuitive understanding of compounding both in money matters and in that which I value and therefore focus my time, a lifelong habit of “leaving room for error” and accepting the reality of surprises, and most importantly my dedication to knowing myself and making decisions based on how I really feel (i.e., I have a very low tolerance for risk, so I have not risked much financially, and this has worked for me. It would not work for somebody with different tolerance and goals). In other words I was surprised to learn that I’m financially competent.But, beyond myself, this book taught me to see the sense in other people’s decisions—how, depending on your experiences, something that sounds nuts to one person can be reasonable to another. And rather than feeling guilty about the luck I sometimes have had, I learned that this is another truism about money—having it or not having it has an enormous amount to do with luck; that’s just how it is. And it’s so interesting how luck and tiny things—one person having unique experiences or one major movement in history (“tail” events)—can have outsized influence not only on one’s own wealth but on the wealth of nations. Poof go your notions about blame or credit. Uneducated, unsophisticated people can make a lot of money. Economists with PhDs and tycoons at the top of their game can lose it all. Talent and worth do not correlate with money success at all!This is a sane, logical book about money. I highly recommend it to anybody who is confused about this subject.That said, I would be as remiss as the book not to mention that this is a myopically White book for this day and age. The point of view is firmly lodged in segregated White America, with almost no mention of the larger economic world. Even in the discussion of luck, there is no mention of race, racism, redlining, legacy wealth or lack thereof. (This is particularly bizarre because in the first video I punched up for Housel, he is instantly talking about wealth inequality. I don’t get it.) But people are people, so I’m sure the psychological principles are applicable across races. However, after reading Elizabeth Warren’s Persist, a virtual college course in economic inequity baked into our system, it is impossible not to know what’s missing in The Psychology of Money....more",Notes are private!,2,16,1,"Dec 25, 2021","Dec 27, 2021","Oct 20, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/41881472-the-psychology-of-money

I’m guessing most people will receive it with a glib, “Of course, what you read matters; it influences what you believe.”But I mean this sentence much more expansively: What I read, the physical form of it, really matters. As does reading it (as opposed to listening to somebody else read a text). I care who may have owned or touched the book before me, and any history I may know attached to the book affects my reading experience.I spent this week reading a 75-cent, paperback of The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters, Robert Lewis Taylor’s Pulitzer Prize-winning 1959 novel about a 14-year-old relentlessly smart-alecky (and sometimes very funny) boy’s picaresque adventures during 1849, following his pipe-dreaming gambling doctor father across the country to find gold in California.If I were reading Jaimie McPheeters as an ebook, I might have abandoned it at the first mention of “darkies” because I just don’t have the stomach for this in 2021. If I were reading a shiny new edition paperback, same thing. Yes, the writing is good, I might have reasoned, but why subject myself to casual racism and so many words? The book is of a bygone era and style. But I’m reading the cracked brown pages turned and read by my father on his suburban commute to and from his job in New York City in 1960. I know this because I found his train ticket stub, used as a book mark, on the last page, and I know he loved this book because he once told me he did. Probably that’s why I grabbed it from my mother’s last house several years after my father’s own pipe dreams and addictions imploded and he stuck a gun in his mouth. And it’s why the book has stayed on the top shelf in my apartment since 1973.I’d been eying it for months while I did my aerobic workouts. The spine drew me. I even got up on a ladder a few months ago to see what it was and when I saw, I remembered Dad’s smile and joy when he said it was a really good book. I’ll read that, I thought.And it took until this week, months after the first beckoning, for me to pull it down and wipe off the dust bunnies.When I lie on my couch and read this book, I know I’m touching something my father thought was good. I know that when he read this he was the sane, loving man who loved to read and loved the fact that I loved reading too, even though we had almost nothing else in common. As I carefully turn the cracked pages, I feel stretched across time, from this moment in 2021 to 1960 to 1849, and I feel all of the eras viscerally which expands me into an ocean-size tolerant witness—more curious than judging. And the transformations over time are astonishing. And just that gives me hope for a future I cannot see. My nausea at casual racism doesn’t clear, but a glimmer of light penetrates it, whispering, “Don’t give up. Things can change.” And gradually I see that the violence and racism in this book were not at all casual. Rather they were brutal and intentional. Taylor was showing the sadism and cruelty in all its horror by so glibly conveying it as a fact of life. And a fact of life that has not changed is that as powerful as is our will to survive, we humans have an equal capacity for violence, superior judgements, and self-destruction either directly or indirectly (by destroying whomever we categorize as “other”). I’m not a terribly tolerant person. I avoid people who complain incessantly and usually am more interested in solutions than listening to spiraling tales of misery. But reading the packed small type in this 500+-page Giant Cardinal Pocket Book edition that “includes every word contained in the original, higher-priced edition” that is “printed from brand-new plates made from completely reset, clear easy-to-read type,” rather than being annoyed, I find myself marveling that my 42-year-old father read this without glasses and so did lots of other people in 1960. I admire his vision! Isn’t that silly? But it’s what I feel.As I read Jaimie’s father, Dr. Sardius McPheeters, M.D., exaggerate his possibilities of good fortune, accounting assiduously for how he squanders money in letters to his wife back in Louisville, and eventually be done in by his flaws, I realize my father, who did virtually the same things in 1968, must on some level have known himself and even had a sense of humor about it at one time. And I’m amazed at how fast and dramatic was his fall from self-knowledge into paranoia, financial desperation, and who knows what else. And knowing he loved this story, I cannot unknow that he had goodness and humor in him. And I feel glad. And sad. And so, 53 years after his death, I know him a little better. And that makes me glad and sad too.Matlock stripped, and we led the way up the knoll, the children running behind, screaming, “Fight! Fight!” dogs barking, the women taking a stand at a distance where they could not be accused of unseemly curiosity, but able to see a little, too, and over all the air of serious, hurried portentousness that such physical encounters always breed. It’s infectious; it stirs up the blood; one finds oneself on the point of bristling out of sympathy, and even looking around for somebody giving offense. (203-204)After the fight is over, the losers—the people who had initiated the fight—were gradually idealized:Before the ruckus, there wasn’t hardly a soul could stand those clodhoppers, or their womenfolks either, but now you would have thought they were a collection of missionaries. It was disgusting.My father said it wasn’t worth worrying about; it was just part of the general cussedness of humans. He said they’d go baaa-ing off in another direction as soon as something occurred to them.“I’ve seen this sort of perverseness in elections. A man will be in office, doing fine, honest, upright, hardworking, even noble, as far as you can find that quality in a politician, and the opposition will put up a known scoundrel that hasn’t a thing to recommend him except noise. But if he brays long enough and loud enough he’ll bray himself right in. People are prepared to believe anything about a person as long as it’s bad.” (207)Some things may never change, but if we can see them, perhaps we can choose to mitigate them. I’d not have seen what’s really in Robert Lewis Taylor’s book if I hadn’t given myself time to move out of my knee-jerk reaction to words. And it is only because my father liked this book that I gave myself time to see this.And all this insight from a cracking 61-year-old 75-cent paperback.“. . . A man ort to hold judgment till he’s sure.”That seemed to be the sentiment all around. There wasn’t any harm in these people; they were only average. Most of their bad thoughts came out of fear, and to tell the truth, that’s what causes most of the troubles in the world.

So when I heard Almond’s first novel was being published, I rushed to get an advanced reading copy. My experience of Almond’s work led me to expect hilarity, edginess, and first-rate compassion-based philosophy and politics, so I was really surprised when the first hundred or so pages of All the Secrets of the World read like a YA novel about an immigrant Hispanic 13-year-old girl. Simply because I’m not that interested in YA, I might have abandoned this book if it were written by anyone but Steve Almond. Even though I prefer going into books blind, about 100 pages in I checked the publisher’s description for reassurance that the writer I want to read was doing something of adult substance. Yes, the copy assured me, something exciting was coming.And boy, I’m glad I kept reading.This is not only a book of substance, but a tour de force of technique—divided into five Book sections that intentionally and organically build from YA simplicity to no-nonsense police detective-story genre to full-on poetic literary sophistication with a gloriously transcendent ending. (If you’re a Stoner aficionado, you may recognize the narrative and character influences—I swear it’s impossible not to have them if Stoner is part of your foundation.) It’s perfectly paced, eventually weaving the genres together with a lot of journalistic narrative. There is some beautiful writing about a terrain and self-destructive human flaws reminiscent of my favorite TV drama, Vince Gilligan’s Breaking Bad (which I consider on a par with Shakespeare for its themes, characters, and poetry; I suspect this is another work that Almond and I revere). And eventually there’s some badly needed, delightfully entertaining humor in the banter of Hispanic cops (cousins) going rogue and the aforementioned Young Adult immigrant heroine.There is nothing wrong with appropriating from great artists as long as you have fully digested the magic so that the influence morphs into your own work, from your own muse and soul. And Steve Almond has done that.I like the contradictions in the young heroine, Lorena. She is shy, innocent, a science geek, and given to great passion and contradictory actions when her commitment to justice is tweaked. That rang true and I don’t know that I’ve read it before. (And it would be a choice role for an actress.*)All the Secrets of the World goes to such unexpected places. Sometimes it’s like an escalating fever dream; other times it’s an exercise in exhaustion—in a good way; you feel the same wearing down that the characters are enduring. There is a detective mystery, philosophical quandaries, and perversion in many forms (personal, religious, hyperbolic frenzy resulting in “Bad Stories”). In other words, it is a gripping story of our cultural mess in the form of a big commercial multi-genre crime and unjust punishment novel. I love the particularly Steve-Almond theme—how distorted our reality is by exaggerations, part-truths, and a lack of nuance because blanket good and bad stories fuel our lust for drama and sense of superiority. And how transformation only comes from exploring the dark matter within us (yet another obsession I share with Almond; I’m starting to wonder if we’re related).I also loved the exposed innocence (meaning “vulnerability”) of some of the characters—people who are condemned by our American culture to stereotypes. This can break your heart if you let it.As the tension of false truth rises, Almond sometimes gives the reader a release. Just when you want to scream or punch someone, you get to see a true truth that happens in the future and is either seeded into the narrative or is revealed by the chronology of the storytelling. Or, in the case of the scene that fueled my comment about exhaustion, you get a clinical explanation of what the character and you are feeling. These seeds of clarity not only give the reader some necessary hope amidst the frustration and pain, but act as teasers, pushing the plot forward. He didn’t borrow this from anyone I recognize; perhaps one day I’ll borrow it from him.All in all, a really good book. And did I mention the ending is transcendent?Thanks to Zando for the ARC.___________*2/16/22 UpdateIt was just announced that the book is being adapted into a television series.

Still this book was wonderfully funny. But it would have been so much funnierOh if only I had a better education, if only I were a religious scholar. Still this book was wonderfully funny. But it would have been so much funnier if the scholarship were not over my head. I envy the laughs of people more educated than I and especially people who work in academia.The 1960 college campus novel is based on a true incident when Ben-Zion Netanyahu, father of the embattled Bibi of current history, auditioned to teach at a small American college (the nonfiction is detailed in an afterword). Meeting the senior Netanyahu in this zany story, I sense a new understanding of the attraction between the Fabulist Orange Guy and the son of the ridiculously pompous and demanding Bogus Historian from Israel. And particularly brilliant—no matter your education—is the scene when Netanyahu and his miserable wife and three sons invade and decimate the home of the protagonist narrator, Ruben Blum, a beleaguered Jewish historian (take note, as the book does: the guy is Jewish, but not an expert in Jewish history) who is doing what he must to get tenure and therefore accepts his assignment to serve on a hiring committee and host Netanyahu simply because he (Ruben) is the only Jew on campus. This is comedy writing at its best.That said, my biggest laugh came early on page 25 when Rubin’s department head, Dr. Morse, introduces this ridiculous assignment: The rest of our conversation was logistics, followed by Dr. Morse attempting to pronounce the candidate’s name and me failing to understand him—I was getting Bento Nehru, Benzedrine Nakamoto, Benzene Natty Yahoo . . .In ConclusionI loved the laughs, but my biggest frustration reading this sometimes esoteric comedy is that, because I cannot swim (will not? am not up to the task?) in academic discourses that use as many words as the author can think like the myriad matrices of rapid streams coalescing into a roiling ocean (this is me pretending to be an academic), I could not decipher the no-doubt brilliant meaning about the nature of revisionist history vis-a-vis Jewish anything and the notion of objective history, which appeared to be an important theme under all the hilarity. I got lost and feel cheated because I missed something I would actually like to know.(Please don’t be daunted by this last paragraph. This book is not a slog. I finished it in two days and there is plenty of nonesoteric human nonsense that will appeal to nonacademics like moi.)...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Sep 10, 2021","Sep 12, 2021","Sep 10, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/55817233-the-netanyahus

Much easier just to say it’s fun. There’s time travel and a super natural being and lots of good food. It’s funny, full of bright color, and the warmth is very much what author Kevin Ansbro’s GR friends experience reading his s and interacting with him. It’s gentlemanly, charming, sometimes even goose-bump-inducing, and—well, I already said it—it’s fun.

I haven’t read one of his books in more than a year and this one made me want to start a new binge. As always, I revere his narrative movement, but this book, a story about a writer trying to come to terms with the existence of the ethereal versus a reality that is wholly tangible, has an altogether different kind of movement from his other books, and it creates sometimes painful dramatic tension. With my hand stretched out in front of my face, I walked across the hall. Everywhere was a sweet smell I associated with June [his dead mother-in-law]. It came from the lavender soap she had bought in bulk. We were not even halfway through her supply. I groped my way across the living room and opened the door to the kitchen. The smell here was of metal and, faintly, butane gas. The fuse box and switch were in a cupboard on the wall on the far side of the room. Even in this darkness it showed as a blacker patch ahead of me. As I edged around the kitchen table, the sensation that I was being watched intensified. The surface of my skin had become an organ of perception, sensitized to darkness and to every molecule of air. My bare arms were registering a threat. Something was up; the kitchen did not feel the same. (92)In this novel you see the normal movement he regularly creates by having a person move in space, but here there is also an almost palpable ephemeral vibration. It comes in memories, still places (like the kitchen in the quote), most interestingly in a trip to a concentration camp; in this case, the dead place is alive, but as a Jew I experienced it entirely differently than the protagonist did—McEwan’s writing allows this. It comes in the movement of history, in the visceral experience of mass grief, and, central to this book, to the movement of the heart versus its shadow: pure evil. It’s a terrific story that is both cerebral and heart-pumping.And I particularly liked the ending, which could not be more applicable to today, although the book is copyrighted 1992. I don't think it is a spoiler to end with its message, cleverly delivered by someone other than the searching protagonist, that without each of us doing the personal work to live from our hearts, it doesn't much matter what goes on politically. If we don't do the work, we will be hopelessly caught in darkness....more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,"Aug 29, 2021",Sep 2021,"Aug 29, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6871.Black_Dogs

Almost immediately I thought I knew what was coming because I’d read American Desert, and the ending to one of my favorite Everett books, the aforementioned God’s Country, has echoes of this new book and almost seems to demand that it happen eventually. And now it’s here.To compare Everett’s work to anybody else’s is pointless. So instead, here’s a scene that conveys what I love here and in his earlier funny novels (no setup necessary): The Doctor Reverend Cad Fondle was sitting in his living room with his wife, Fancel. Fancel was a big woman, big enough that she hardly ever moved from her corduroy recliner, which was stuck in recline. There was a half a meat lover’s pizza and two beers on the foldout tray between her recliner and her husband’s. They were watching television, switching back and forth between Fox News and professional wrestling.“They’s right,” Fancel said. “That Obamacare don’t work worth a hill of puppy shit. We done bought in, causin’ we had to, and I ain’t lost nary a pound.”Fondle took long pull on his beer. “Well, the country’s done with that experiment. Smart-ass uppity sumbitch. You know he thinks he’s better’n us.”“That Hannity is cute,” Fancel said. “If I could get my hand anywhere near my vajayjay, I’d rub me one out just watchin’ him.”“You can’t reach it, so shut up.”“How did the cross burning go the other night?” Fancel asked.“It’s called a lightin’, a cross lightin’. It ain’t right to burn a symbol of our Lawd Jesus H. Christ. I would think you knowed that by now.”Fancel sighed. “What’s the H for?”“What?”“The H in Jesus H. Christ, what’s it for?” She picked up some pepperoni from a crease in her house dress.Fondle paused to regard her with his head cocked. “Why, it stands for, um, heaven, that’s right.”“Jesus Heaven Christ? That don’t make good sense.”“What would make sense to you?” Fondle asked.“I don’t know,” she said. “Herschel, maybe.”“Why?”“It’s a nice name and it’s a name. Heaven ain’t no name.”“It’s the name of a place, so it’s a name. In fact, the place is named after our Lord,” Fondle said, his eyes narrowed.“Why ain’t the place just called Jesus or Jesusburg?”“Shut up and eat.” (126-127)This is a hilarious and devastating book that in some sense has been 400+ years in the making, and finally, finally it is here, courtesy of Mr. Everett. In The Trees Percival Everett chooses to rotate all his comedy and tragedy cylinders at the same time. And he’s so good, using all or part of what he’s got can be a choice. And in 2021, he has chosen to give us everything he’s got. The United States needs this book. The world needs this book.* * *What Percival Everett has written about, an inevitable rising up and destruction by those who have suffered without justice, is and has been in the air for years. And writers pick these things up. I’ve written an as-yet unpublished novel which is my take. And recently I’ve read others:  The Mermaid of Black Conch by Monique Roffey, and nonfiction  The Reckoning: Our Nation’s Trauma and Finding a Way to Heal by Mary Trump.

Not because he required my interpretation, not even because I was an amusing distraction, but because he wished for someone to be present during those long hours, someone who would not insist on examining the actions of his past, from which there could no longer be any escape. And I realized that for him I was pure instrument, someone without will or judgment, a consciousness-free zone into which he could escape, the only company he could bear—that, that was the reason why he had requested my presence, that was the reason I was there. . . . .(121)The reason this story grabbed my insides and wouldn't let go was that this role is familiar. So many times I've had jobs or been in a family position where I was an intermediary, trying to carry out instructions (which were my job) and in between parties that couldn't understand each other, who sometimes judged me—the mere lacky—as the villain, assuming that what I was doing or conveying was my choice. And usually this thankless, yet intimate, job also required that I not divulge information that was not offered from one side to the other—making me a blank canvas for everybody's projections.But this doesn't mean I didn't have feelings about what was happening.The unnamed interpreter in this story does too. But right up until the end of the novel she is stuck, alone, forced into being a ""pure instrument"" in the most intimate of roles. (There is even a scene where she is introduced by a friend to another woman, and Kitamura skillfully writes it, never having the friend mention the protagonist's name.) I found myself wondering if Kitamura was in some way forcing readers to be equally unnamed, unconsidered, and robbed of agency with her punctuation choice, oh my god, the tension! (what I'm doing here is a spliced sentence).The punctuation, or lack of it, is clearly a choice in such controlled, tooled prose. But I don't see what readers would lose if dialogue were delineated—if not with quotation marks, then by paragraph breaks or some other invention.That said, the book is worth the struggle....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,"Feb 15, 2022","Feb 17, 2022","Aug 26, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/55918474-intimacies

I’ve read and loved all of her previous books, so I had no doubt I’d feel the same about her new memoir, In Love. Fall in love with In Love. It’s effortless. What sounds like a grim topic—the “accompanied suicide” of Amy’s Alzheimer’s-stricken husband, Brian—is anything but. That’s because Amy tells the whole truth. There is no shying away from her own sometimes demonic rage or grief, including a hysterically funny passage about what she imagined her fakakta Jewish family saying as the gatekeeper at Dignitas, the suicide place in Zurich, was speaking pleasantries. There is full disclosure of her sometimes sociopathic sense of right and wrong, her crying fits, and the inability of either her or Brian to find their way out of a parking lot even before he had dementia. There is a journalist’s recounting of the difficulty of finding any help with compassionate suicide (even in states that allow euthanasia). So this book is moving, entertaining, and extremely educational, and you do not have to be interested in the subject to be swept up in the story. And, oh yes, per the title, there is love, deep love. And, oh oh yes, you feel every single thing because Amy Bloom feels it.Amy Bloom writes like a bedeviled angel. She is a self-described Rottweiler—one of my favorite breeds, powerful dogs who display their enormity in both love and protection. She is one of our greatest living American writers.***Thanks to Random House for the ARC....more",Notes are private!,1,53,1,"Nov 14, 2021","Nov 17, 2021","Aug 24, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58065372-in-love

In the hope that there might be others who agree, or disagree, I offer this:The title, What Strange Paradise, is the clue that this is the story of what an Islamic boy encounters at death--this paradise is not what one would expect. In chapter 28, he dies. He goes to the bottom of the ocean and then further down to encounter everybody he's ever known and everything that forms the birth of life: a dry womb of a place in which were kept safe and unchanging everyone he has ever known, outward forever to encompass the whole of the living and lived. And each of these the boy met, in their old lives and their new lives waiting, and from each drew confession and each he felt into as though there were no barrier between them, no silo of self to keep a soul waiting. What a beautiful rebellion, to feel into another, to feel anything at all.-And then he surfaced. I posit he is dead, but in this strange paradise, he joins Vanna who has also just died, and they play out the story, which ends as they finish and are awaiting Home.And the final chapter, ""Now,"" is the real now when his dead body is found. So the whole story after the ship sinks is his trip through a strange paradise and the ""Before"" and ""After"" chapter titles are before and after death.

The order of books and the experiences I have had reading and editing must have been orchestrated by some All-Knowing Reader’s God Conductor with impeccable plot-making skill.The mermaid is a real character in the myth that we are all living in—a 400-year story where we think we can own or control one another, where power is currency, and where this delusion is driving us to a kind of Armageddon, that may be a requirement of rebirth.The writing, imagination, and story are just wonderful.

Protagonist M, who writes this book from the perspective of a woman, telling the story of her childhood, does this by forming order out of chaos and nearly always fooling herself into believing she's in charge.I realized I've written two novels that take very different approaches to this problem (Plan Z by Leslie Kove and The Last Will & Testament of Zelda McFigg). And so perhaps that's why I relate so intensely to this story.

When the room hiAs I type, the air conditioner is humming and my 15 ½-year-old dog Maya with chronic kidney disease is dozing in the chair behind me. When the room hits 75 degrees, the AC will turn itself off and it will be completely quiet—even though I live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan which is currently preparing for a blockbuster “Welcome Home NY” concert this evening in Central Park. This morning, as every morning, when I gave Maya her IV drip, both of us went into a peaceful trance; we became one with the saline as it coursed down the line into Maya and I imagined it gently spreading, bathing all her organs with love, leaving happy kidneys before exiting out and back into the earth. When the drip was done, I carried her to the park, put her down, and not even the amplified bass rehearsing on the Great Lawn for tonight’s concert could jar our peace. As we walked at Maya’s now slow-mo speed through the woods, the sound felt like waves in some distant part of an great ocean, gently rocking us as we smelled the trees, listened to the birds, and witnessed a family of raccoons doing their morning ablutions.This is the peace evoked by Ronan Hession’s voice. It’s his voice even more than his story of two single men in their thirties who live their lives as well as they can. This voice comes in at moments when the stillness—of death, of rejection, of nothing at all—takes over. This is the stillness I feel giving Maya her drip. I know she is slowly dying, and I’ve cried. But there is also this almost inexpressible sweetness to this time. There’s the matter-of-factness in the moment when you accept and just live it for as long as it lasts. Hession captured it and makes you feel it in this slow,* wise story.____________*The story is so slow because people relentlessly speak in whole sentences and, toward the end, they seem to recite the kind of stuff you learn after years of psychotherapy or awareness work and meditation.

Taking place mostly in Mississippi, this is really a sequence of stand-alone stories that are connected by a possibly psychotic taxi dispatcher and the narrator, angry, frustrated, demon-infested Lou . . . and Lou's hopeless attempts to be a good Buddhist . . . and all the hopeless passengers he carts to rehab and cheap motels . . . and come to think of it, this really is a novel, not separate stories. Don't listen to anything I say.Except maybe don't listen to that either. I and many writers firmly believe in the motto ""Recycle, recycle, recycle""—meaning, if a short piece we wrote hoping to make some money but never sold fits in a bigger work, slip it in and fill out the space; waste not any worthy literary labors. I suspected this was the case with a chapter called ""Never Blink Your Headlights at a UFO and Other Driving Tips for Mississippians""* which I skimmed because I was so sure I knew what Durkee was doing, wasn't that interested in it, and I wanted to get to the next chapter which I hoped would bring me back into the story. It did. And it was so funny and Durkee so wonderfully built humor and frenzy from that point on that I instantly forgave any recycling.This is a tour de force of man's-man writing. There are drunks and meth heads and skanks, hovel living and animal killing, and all levels of human degradation. I enjoyed the book (but not the animal killing). It's really well written and because many of the chapters do stand alone, I read it slowly, never having to backtrack after a day of missed reading to refresh my memory.This is fine fiction.

That's the adjective that comes to mind for everything about this book: the story, the relationships, the characters, the dialogue, the descriptions, the writing. This alive being of a book is scrumptious.I love the two women who go off on a wild journey together in the 1950s. I love the surprises, the vivid landscapes, the growth of the women and their relationship. I loved the substance—meanings and spiritual messages if you are so inclined to receive them; they're so subtle you can miss them, but there is depth to this incredibly zippy and commercial writing. It's no surprise to me that this book is being made into a movie, but most likely I won't see it. I have no interest in interfering with my mind's experience of this wonderful story and these wonderful women.It's also no surprise that Rachel Joyce is a former actor and playwright. Character and dialogue are pitch perfect and all the rest is solid writer's technique used artfully in service of wild imagination grounded in breathtaking research that never showed but rather felt like firsthand experience. This was so vibrant and so much fun to read, I didn't want it to end.P.S. Don't read any of the glorious back-of-book extras until you've finished the book.

The protagonist was a wholly wonderful and original character and voice. I was spellbound and gobsmacked. Then almost exactly at the halfway mark (in a mosh scene, during which I stopped believing what was going on, followed by a growing unreality in other things—for instance, the character of a 13-year-old), the writing changed to something I can only qualify as MFA student work. It wasn't bad. It was just a little forced and self-consciously literary—the kind of thing that I associate with workshop students being praised by a teacher and one another for finding their original voice, for crafting esoteric observations, for being imaginative. But this group reinforcement results in a kind of groupspeak of self-conscious vocabulary and ""insights"" as well as endless stream-of-consciousness literary-sounding lists that I hear in my mind's ear in the droning monotone affected by certain writers giving readings of their work. It's the kind of thing that makes me wish writers would never attend MFA programs, but just work and grow up and hone what comes naturally through individual feedback rather than workshops.*Debbie Annan wrote the most clever, kind, accurate  I can imagine writing.

When I read Amy Bloom's novel White Houses about Eleanor Roosevelt's deeply romantic and sexual relationship with journalist Lorena Hickok, the why seemed obvious: to correct a sanitized history. But when I read Georgia, despite a front-of-book author's note spelling out the motivation for writing the novel ("". . . not just to explore O'Keeffe's life and art, but also the challenges faced by women on the forefront of any discipline"") the question of why never left my head. I never viscerally felt the why. And I just wasn't that interested in the author's descriptions of a person who she had never met: her private unknowable thoughts, motivations, and sexual experiences. Maybe this is my failing. I find tedious the constant deconstruction and explanation of any art through narrative, and there is a lot of that here. And I found myself wondering if O'Keeffe was exploited here for a writer's reasons that I never experienced.I like flawed, unlikable characters, but in this book about two of them, O'Keeffe and her lover Alfred Stieglitz, I found myself, on one hand, bored with the repetitive infidelities and jealousies and declarations of love turned to wistfulness and plain old navel-gazing glumness between people I didn't care about, and on the other hand, feeling defensive for O'Keeffe. Here was this woman whose work was judged in gender terms she never agreed with (that's the ""challenge"" addressed by author Dawn Tripp) again being smacked with somebody else's take on her personality. And I wondered if the self-centeredness and constant analysis of art was less true to the characters than it was to the author. And I found myself wanting to abandon the book in defense of people who are not here to defend themselves.

How is it possible to explain the tax code, tax deductions, and how business is constantly subsidized by all of us (aka socialized wealth distribution; what people are so afraid of is already going on, but the recipients are large corporations and billionaires!*) so clearly that the reader has an aha about the movement of money in the economy resulting in a feeling that she can articulate life itself: all life is movement and change, and Warren ties that to the economy so simply and coherently that you will never not understand this again, and hence, never not understand inequity of investment that is built into our system and an imbalance that will eventually topple us all if not corrected.Simply put, Elizabeth Warren is a great teacher. I understand why Rep. Katie Porter changed her life while taking Warren's class (a wonderful anecdote). As I type this, I'm now in the middle of an explanation of a two-cent wealth tax and what that would mean and how it would work, and again, it's so exciting, I'm chewing my carrot extra carefully in order to stay at the computer.One of my other favorite teachers, Bertice Berry, recently did a video about how being your authentic self brings light to all situations and people, so if another person who is not being authentic is illuminated in that light, it can expose them and make them really angry. I thought of this when Warren first talked about former Mayor Mike Bloomberg. I remembered her stunning exposure of his arrogance during the presidential debates (deliciously reported later in the book in a chapter called A Fighter). In that moment she exposed her authentic brilliance in a way that constantly flows through this well-made book.** Yes, Elizabeth Warren is a plucky, feisty, people-loving homebody, but there is a relentless laser-like light that comes from her authentic commitment to service over personal gain, to truth over convenience, and to fearless defense of those values. Add to that, she is a good writer, eternally optimistic, and has created a book full of power that made me bawl with hope at the end.[image]I never got an in-person selfie, but this'll do. ___________* Lest anyone believe that any business becomes successful all on its own and that government could be eliminated and we'd all do just fine if we just have the gumption, I share this wonderful quotation about Amazon's trajectory. It follows a quote from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos crediting his success to the ""heavy-lifting infrastructure"" of telecommunications, credit card payment systems, and the US Postal Service, Royal Mail, and Deutsche Post: That ""heavy-lifting infrastructure"" that Bezos relied on to build his business and his fortune made Amazon possible. And it wasn't only the communications network, the monetary system, and the postal system—he also relied on public roads and bridges that enabled his trucks to make deliveries, police and firefighter protection that kept his sprawling business safe, and a public education system that made it possible for him to hire employees who could read. Because of the enormous investments made by American tax payers, Bezos was able to take his shot at creating a trillion-dollar company. . . . [He] counted on our government to come up with plans that made it possible to expand opportunity. No matter who we are, we all need these plans. (107-108) And because I can't resist editorializing: now just think about the fact that Amazon doesn't pay taxes to support the same infrastructure that enables its life.** I like everything about the way this book is made—from the stark, serious, yet striking cover with type that sticks up from the paper (3-D? I'm sure there's a name for that in printer's lingo; anyone know?) to the writing to the organization. It is organized in such a way that Warren can easily jump around in time, going back to a time period she mentions earlier and, with a little repetition, using the second mention to tell a full story. In most books, this might come off as redundant, but the organization of this book makes it smooth and logical. Warren credits Alex Blenkinsopp as an organizer and John Sterling as editor. However this structure came about, kudos to the team!* * *Thanks to the publisher for a  copy....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,Jun 2021,"Jun 04, 2021","Jun 01, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56246093-persist

Only read this book on the blasted Kindle if you cannot possibly get your mitts on a hard copy paperback. There are footnotes at the bottom of many pages and large white spaces and an inventive layout of line breaks that are best seen from a tactile paper book held in your mitts.Do not be fooled by the page length of said paperback (313 pages). Because of the aforementioned layout, it reads faster than a 150-pager.Do not ignore the beautiful cover (Katy Homans, designer; George Shaw, art), best held in your mitts while you swoon and breathe on it. (You cannot do this with a Kindle.)Do not be daunted by the fact that as you are reading and laughing, you may not know exactly what is going on or what Bina is talking about. Patience! It will all come clear.RemarkingsThis book is not like any other because it is written by a writer named Anakana Schofield who probably has never considered writing anything by mimicking anybody else. She writes from her own muse and doesn't give a fig about what you might be used to reading. This is a great thing, to be applauded.If I told anything at all about the plot, you would be justified in offing me.

It is an important record of absReading Tulsa 1921 is a little like being in the middle of a mob and hearing all the hundred-year-old voices at once. It is an important record of absolutely everything leading up to, during, and after the mass killing of Black people in and the destruction of the Greenwood district, the Black Wall Street section, of Tulsa, Oklahoma on May 31–June 1, 1921—a history that was never recorded in Oklahoma school books and certainly did not make its way into my white high school history classes in suburban New York in the 1960s. But unless you are digging for facts, it is a difficult book to follow as it is really more like investigative notes, leaving nothing out. Often the reporting is recounting what is essentially a game of “Telephone” where facts are skewed or made up out of whole cloth or maybe not, and every single one of them is relayed for examination. According to author journalist Randy Krehbiel, some truths will never be known, especially about the incident that led to this abomination.I was willing and eager to dig through this book because my mother was born in Tulsa in 1921, and although she never spoke about it, or is it possible she didn’t know?—I’ll never know—I suspect that whatever happened exploded into our family with such force that, unbeknownst to me, I’ve suffered the reverberations in my own history, due to my mother’s trauma ... due to her parents’ trauma … due to her Jewish merchant father’s decision to inexplicably flee (my word, not hers—she never explained it and I don’t know exactly when he fled, if he did indeed flee) Tulsa after she was born, four months after the massacre. The family subsequently moved so often that my mother suffered a lifelong phobia about being lost.I’m glad this record exists. It made the people and the place real for me and I did pick up bits of history that may add to my personal understanding: the fact that the riot and destruction began in the white business district (where my grandfather’s jewelry store probably was), although this pales in comparison to what followed; and the fact that at least two businesses mentioned in Greenwood (a movie theater and a grocery) had white owners, so perhaps there were others. But all this is tangential to what we need to know to understand what happened.The reverberations of the Tulsa massacre in our present culture are painfully obvious. A Black man was accused of an assault (that may or may not have happened) by a white teenager and then all hell broke loose. Even without television and internet, rumors spread like a virus, morphing into hysterical rage founded in hysterical fear. Because white people had regularly killed Black people with impunity, they (whites) assumed they would be attacked back. And because Black people had been killed with impunity by white people, Black people assumed it was about to happen again to the jailed Black man. The only clear thing is that racism fueled one of the ugliest events of mass killing and destruction—complete with machine gunfire and an aerial attack—in our American history. And how quickly this was erased from taught history is an illumination of systemic (educational) racism that cannot be denied.History has been repeating itself and the only mitigating circumstance in 2021 is cell phone video. It caught a white woman who made herself hysterical out of her denied racism as she accused a Black bird watcher of something he didn’t do and had no intention of doing. And it caught a white police officer slowly murdering a disabled Black man as he pled for his life.Sensational lies and the resultant fear morphed into violence then in Tulsa and now in Washington, D.C. One report about the Tulsa massacre accuses a newspaper of a lie: the commander of the Oklahoma National Guard, General Charles Barrett, is quoted as saying, “The bloody clash between the races had its beginning in a little spat and scuffle between a young negro janitor and white girl elevator operator and the fantastic write-up of the incident in a sensation-seeking newspaper. (90)” But then again there were so many different stories about who was to blame, the truth never had a chance. And we all know about the Big Lie that erupted in violence on January 6, 2021.One parallel (between the events of 1921 and 2021) that I sense but cannot quite parse is the participation of military, ex-military, and law enforcement officers in both imbroglios: One reason that Greenwood was so extraordinary was that many of the Black business owners were ex-military. They came home from fighting in Europe with a new sense of dignity, capability, and possibility. Greenwood was such a draw for Black people from all over because of its community of cooperation that nurtured everybody and resulted in financial success. Many of the white men who attacked Greenwood were also ex-military and police. There are reports in this book about resentment from white soldiers that Blacks were allowed into the military and further contempt for them when they returned as veterans with rights and benefits.And the January 6, 2021 attack on our Capitol building—carried out by so many ex-military? I cannot articulate the connections but I sense them: something about a military conviction of rightness and commitment to complete a mission going haywire in both events due to the fact that both missions were based on lies?First Nations people talk about making decisions based on consequences seven generations into the future. Why do white men fear this wise culture so much that they systematically tried to wipe it out way beyond seven generations? Perhaps because if they fully felt the ramifications of their actions, white people would have to make different decisions and acknowledge the criminality of the choices they make. If what I believe happened in my family—that, as the world around her exploded, my five-month-pregnant grandmother flooded with stress hormone that, of course, went to my mother in utero*; that my grandfather lost his business and, in a traumatic fury, fled Tulsa, unable to settle thereafter, the consequence of which was a legacy of trauma to my mother, who was almost unable to have an adventure because she literally trembled from head to toe in terror of being as lost as she'd been as a child, with no sense of home or how to get there—if this was the consequence to a white Jewish family, resulting in craziness and anger and hypervigilant stress that had repercussions to her and future generations, with no knowledge of its roots, then I can testify to the fact that choices and decisions and lies have an impact that travels like the concentric circles of a boulder thrown into water. Let us stop this madness and commit to truth.postscript: The case that had evoked the Tulsa massacre—a 16-year-old white girl’s accusation of a Black janitor—was eventually dismissed when the white girl requested he not be prosecuted._____________*I interviewed a researcher of the transgenerational transmission of trauma to offspring in this article: https://www.rewireme.com/insight/expe....

There are passages in Jones's book that made me gasp, but still there was a matter-of-factness to it that was both disarming and literarily seductive. I would put Andrea Levy's historical novel Small Island in its vicinity because, although the books have little in common as far as historical era or general flavor, they both are inhabited by West Indian characters—particularly, strong women—who have a lot in common and make me feel as if I'm living in that culture, and not as a visitor. As a resident. I like that intimacy.And I absolutely would add to this group Oyinkan Braithwaite's unclassifiable Nigerian tour de force My Sister, the Serial Killer because it similarly conveys violence as just a part of life, floats in a deep ocean of psychological understanding for everyone's plight and all that is not expressed, and does it with similar taut writing and excellent technique.Like the sibling books I've mentioned, How the One-Armed Sister Sweeps Her House has a fearless bawdiness about human functions—physical and psychological—that reeks of a truer truth than less complex writing. And by ""complex"" I do not mean anything remotely self-conscious, complicated, or literary. I mean that complex human stuff is what it's made of—the plot, the characters, the author's understanding of what she's writing.The title reminds me of the Black saying about ""making a way where there is no way.""

Also, it's well researched with a ""Historical Notes"" section at the end that's informative and the research is never heavy-handed within the text. So all in all, it's really well done: a great escape, completely enjoyable, and if you are an animal lover who cares about animal rights and avoiding the final sixth extinction, you'll be especially satisfied....more",Notes are private!,0,22,1,"May 26, 2021","May 31, 2021","Mar 19, 2021",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/53453400-west-with-giraffes

And as I did last time, and now that I know what's coming I'm more confident about this, I'm ing the experience a mere 50 pages into my second reading. What I realize this time is that Kathleen Dean Moore makes you fall in love--with Earth and all its creatures and plants. That is why this book is so magnificent. Also, it holds up for a second reading. Each essay is complete and demands a pause--to reflect, to associate to your own experiences, to savor and digest it. So this is a perfect book to read in little bits, maybe even while reading another book (which I almost never do).5/10/20 updateI'm pretty much equally right- and left-brained and I can switch types of thinking consciously. That makes me a good editor, good at literary structure, basically a really good mechanic. I also have a good ear for voice and dialogue, having started as a playwright and actor. But after all these decades of writing, narrative still does not come easily. So when I read this paragraph (actually reread it as the writing is so good I'm reading the book for a second time), I thought: this is a master class in narrative. Not a limp adjective or verb. No showing off whatsoever, but just describing what is and what happens in the most vivid and visceral way possible.Although they are probably the very same whales that sing in Hawaii, the humpbacks of Southeast Alaska add a different call to their repertoire when they migrate back to northern feeding grounds. They are all violin music in the Hawaiian bays, but on the feeding grounds in Alaska, whales trumpet. The cacophony is part of their raucous feeding ritual, unique to Southeast Alaska. An assigned member of a pod circles deep, blowing bubbles the size of beachballs. The bubbles form a sort of cylinder, encircling a school of herring. Other whales swim below, herding the herring into a tight ball. A whale sounds the signal, that magnificent screech, and all the whales drive powerfully upward through the panicked fish, jaws agape. They go so fast, they breach the surface, sailing half a body's length into the sky. Water streams from the baleen curtains that hold the herring in their maws. Gulls scream as whales fall back onto the water with all the weight and grace of a school bus falling off a cliff.April 4, 2021 At only 42 pages into this exquisite book, I find myself unable to contain my joy, enthusiasm, and pure ecstasy. This level of awe and excitement require action, so I just ordered a hard copy of the book from Bookshop.org (https://bookshop.org/books/earth-s-wi...) because:1. I must own this. I want to mark it up and eat it! I'm reading a library copy, and I can't molest it in any way, so I'd rather slow down my reading and wait for a book that I'm free to consume. (No I won't eat it, but you get my emotion.)2. I bought it because the actions I want to take are to roar ""Thank you!"" -- to Kathleen Dean Moore, who will get a royalty, and to indie bookshops that want to do service for readers, so buying from them through Bookshop allows me to enact an exchange in the direction of my beliefs.3. If I were to begin marking quotes I want to remember in just the pages I've read, I'd mark up the whole book, so this way I can pick it up and reread as many times and as slowly as I choose any passage I open to.I want to recommend this book to everybody! The writing is sublime, charming, funny, serious, artistic but without guile, smart, all the adjectives.I don't want this book to end, and I'm worrying about that just 42 pages in, so ordering my own copy will make me stop and wait. This is not a literary meal you want to wolf down, and I will do my best to pause.I do not know if I will write a real  once I've finished this book. Maybe this is enough and I'll keep my other thoughts to myself.Thank you a million times, Will Byrnes, for ing this book.P.S. Just finished. Couldn't wait for my copy to come so just kept reading.

Although he's just been excoriated and demeaned by his Nazi business partner, he managed to get some of his money back. However he's stuck: Mulling over his situation, he wondered what am I supposed to do now? Because they're still going after Jews. I can't stay a single night in my apartment—not with forty-one thousand marks!We have to leave Germany, but no place will let us in I have enough money to start a new life, but how to get it out of the country? I don't have the nerve to try to smuggle it across. Should I stay or go? What to do?Should I risk ten years in prison for a currency offense? But what other choice is there? Without money I'd starve out there. Every road leads to ruin, every single one. How am I supposed to fight against the state?. . . Other people were smarter. Other people are always smarter! If I'd realized in time what was going on, I could have saved my money. But everyone was constantly reassuring me. Becker [business partner] more than anybody. And fool that I am, I let myself be reassured. . . .Maybe things aren't half so bad, and the whole business is one big psychosis. But no, I should finally acknowledge the reality of the situation: things are going to get worse—much, much worse! (80-81)It's 1938 and Otto Silbermann, a persnickety neurotic, could not be less suited to running for his life. Author Ulrich Alexander Boschwitz (1915-1942) wrote and published an earlier version of The Passenger when he was only 23, and he died before he could get a revised edition to his publisher. At first the writing seemed to me to have some of the clumsiness of a young writer—overwriting, heavy-handed dialogue, redundancy—but as my anxiety grew (more on that in a second) so did the writing grow on me and I stopped judging. The substance, largely Silbermann's inner ever-changing monologue, bone-chillingly puts the reader into the frenzied flight of a German Jew running for his/her life. (And there are so many similarities between Nazi tactics of blaming their victims and today's politics that essentially claim black is white, that you don't have to be Jewish to shudder.)The book includes a Foreword and an Afterword that enhance this tale with true history—of the author, the book, and the times—and contributed to the nervous stomach I felt every time I began to read. I could not separate myself from Otto Silbermann and my fear was so visceral that I could only stand reading in short spurts. By the second to last chapter, I was so identified with him and his frantic indecision that I lurched to the computer to write this sentence, then noticed that my ceiling-high dracaena's support stick was leaning precariously to the right, so I uprighted it, thought I should wash the plant and water all the plants, but I was so hungry I was feeling light-headed so maybe I should eat first, but really I wanted to type this sentence, so that's what I'm doing and maybe once I've hit the period, I'll eat—yes, that's it, I'll eat. But I really need to pee, and who is that I hear talking outside my window? I can't find him. He must be on a lower floor terrace. I must pee and eat and water the plants. Damn that man, why can't he keep his voice down? — This is how Silbermann negotiates this entire story.Like Boschwitz, I was not raised in the religion or culture, but my face screams ""Jew,"" hence I shuddered in my bone marrow for the entire length of this book and, after each reading session, had to consciously decompress and tap into my gratitude that I live in the most diverse city in the world surrounded by people who look like me. . . .

This kind of courage and steadfast intelligence take my breath away. This history is important and I will not try to truncate any of it into a brief  of this colorful book. Read it if you want to understand where we live today in the U.S. of A.Although this history of civil rights activist Ida B. Wells is credited to her great-grand-daughter, Michelle Duster, per the acknowledgments, the book is a team effort of publisher Julia Cheiffetz, writer Hannah Giorgis, photo editor Nicholas Ciani, and amazing illustrator Monica Ahanonu.It is a terrific compendium of not only Wells’s story but of so many people who have worked their butts off for equality. This is a wonderful text to add to any reader’s Black history education.My only complaint is that a huge part of the joy of this book is the striking illustrations of Black activists—colorful but stark portraits of so many luminaries in the civil rights movement—by artist Monica Ahanonu, whose name does not appear anywhere except in a line of the author’s acknowledgements. There is nothing about Ahanonu on the title page or in the front matter (that lists the interior designer), nor is there a credit on the Image Credits back-of-book page. I can only guess that this was a work-for-hire illustration job, but still . . . when artwork contributes as much of the feeling of a book as Ahanonu’s does, the reader shouldn’t have to search as hard as I did to find out who did it. Per her website: “Monica Ahanonu is a freelance illustrator working and living in Los Angeles. Many consider her an expert in color theory, vector illustration, and motion design.” So to stand up for what’s right in a very small way, I’m devoting my last paragraph to her....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Mar 10, 2021","Mar 11, 2021","Mar 01, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/53409287-ida-b-the-queen

(71)Since I want to hear all the stories, this was the perfect book for me. If I were Black, I'd probably have laughed a lot more than I did in recognition. But I'm white, so although there were an alarming amount of outrages that I did relate to as an ""ethnic"" (show biz's diagnosis of my ""type"" when I was an actor) traveling Europe and the Midwest in the 1970s and '80s, mostly I just gasped and incorporated this into my education. Even if you've had people change seats to avoid your ethnic self, even if you've shared a bunkhouse with a bunch of college girls who loved to talk about ""the dirty Jews"" and then when you revealed that this was your family, even if the mother of one of these dirty-Jew-hating girls visited to examine you for horns, you will not come close to the everyday experiences of Lacey and Amber. Even if you've heard racist things incomprehensibly come out of white mouths of people who worked in spiritual places where diversity is the norm, you will be shocked by the sheer magnitude of these stories. This is not to say this book is depressing. Not at all. And I did laugh—sometimes hard. But I was humbled by most of the stories in this book and that's why I read it.Amber Ruffin is a comedy writer and improviser, and her sister Lacey Lamar is an apparent magnet for outrageous behavior by white people. The experiences are mostly Lacey's, but Amber has a comedian's timing and they are perfectly paced with plain funny stuff and photos—one of a palate-cleansing duckling to give the reader a rest with a cute pause.

Funny, she thought. Usually it was locked, but it had given way with a touch. She'd never opened this door, let alone passed through its threshold. On the other side, she'd expected all manner of monsters: fire-breathing dragons, devils with red laser eyes, drunk writers with sour whiskey breath. There were no monsters. Nor was there a great white light where her rotten relatives—now dead and therefore enlightened—reached out to grasp her to their bosoms and chests, apologizing for all their corporeal sins against her and welcoming her to join them and also become good, sweet, and enlightened. Nor were there gates, pearly or otherwise—which made her smile, as she'd always known those were fairy stories and she'd never bought into them. Nor were there parallel universes where she could peek at her body doubles doing all the things she had thought about but failed to even attempt in her pathetic little life spent reading stacks and stacks of terrible slush-pile books as the only sixty-five-year-old editorial assistant in the history of book publishing.She'd always known she would die there. She'd known it was a matter of time until she read a book so horrendous that it killed her, and when she was finished, she would merely drop it on the floor, knowing that she had reached the end.""Hello!"" she called into the fog. ""I'm dead. Is anybody here?""In response, a new door materialized just in front of her and, as it creaked open, she was hit by a puff of familiar smell: books, new books that had become bestsellers after she'd rescued them from the slush pile, pushed them on her bosses, and been so annoying that they'd finally read them—only to take full credit for discovering them.""I'm very angry,"" she said to the smell. ""There is nobody here to greet me, and I'm so sick of books. Do you think you could take your smell somewhere else? No offense,"" she added because she'd always been a very polite editorial assistant, which is perhaps why she'd managed to hang on even through the Great Recession and blood bath of early 2009 when most of her department had been laid off, but old habits don't disappear just because you croak.In response, the smell turned left. She stepped through the new door and turned right, although there really was no such thing in this new world. For twelve hours she walked, although there really was no time and her cheap Timex (a gift from her boss) was frozen at the moment she'd closed the book.""Hello?"" she called, thinking she'd spied a figure through the murky fog. ""Hello, can you help me? I think I'm dead and I don't know what to do.""""Yes, you are. And you don't have to do anything,"" said a disembodied voice. ""You were very polite. You did a good job. But you might have explored a bit more—taken some chances—if you don't mind some feedback.""""Anything,"" she answered. ""I've always believed in revision. Please help me! I'm lost.""And with that, another door, exactly like the one she'd entered twelve hours ago, opened out of the murk. ""This way,"" said the voice. And she entered. It was a library of sorts. No people. Just millions and billions of unbound manuscripts.""Find a better story,"" said the voice, and with a hollow metal clang the door swung shut.©2005, 2020 Betsy Robinson, published in Girl Stories & Game Plays: An Anthology of Stories and Plays, 2nd ed._____________*More on Allen Ginsberg's poem ""Howl"" in this morning's (3/26/21) Book News by Ron Charles (some editor really should have told Matt Haig to find another title):A newly discovered original draft of “Howl,” by Allen GinsbergSixty-four years ago this week, customs officials seized 520 copies of an “obscene” poem published in England. Allen Ginsberg’s “Howl” couldn’t have asked for a better marketing campaign. With the help of the ACLU, Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti fought back. The rest is literary history. But that history and that poem have suddenly returned in a most unexpected way. Rare book dealer and Beats specialist Brian Cassidy has found a previously unknown original draft of “Howl.” This uncorrected carbon typescript is believed to be the very one Ginsberg used when he read the poem at Reed College in early 1956 — at least a year before “Howl” became the anthem of the counterculture revolution. Coincidentally, a long-lost recording of that Reed College reading — the earliest audio version of “Howl” — will be released next week (listen to a sample).Originally titled “Howl for Carl Solomon,” Ginsberg’s masterpiece went through considerable revision before it was published in 1956 by Ferlinghetti in “Howl and Other Poems” (story). That complex publishing history and the poem’s prominence make this 11-page unrevised version particularly valuable to scholars of 20th-century poetry. “To say that finding an original previously unknown draft of a major American work of literature is unusual is certainly an understatement,” Cassidy said in a statement. “And given that 'Howl' was famous pretty much from its inception, that an original typescript for it could have been unknown for this long . . . I was just blown away.""For anyone “burning their money in wastebaskets,” Cassidy is offering to sell this copy of “Howl” for $425,000 (add to cart)....more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,"Feb 18, 2021","Feb 20, 2021","Feb 18, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/52578297-the-midnight-library

And The New InheritorI understand from the book’s blurb that this is one of a quartet of books about a family and American history of the Gulf Coast. And The New Inheritors feels like a part of a larger work because it’s sprawling, with large sections that don’t at first obviously connect in the way of novels with one main story. For instance, the first character, Isaac, whose history starts the book—with a mother who brings him into a cult and a harrowing escape with another woman which leads to his life in an adoptive family almost feels like a false start to a novel which is not about Isaac at all, because it goes from there to another family’s saga. I waited to see if the book would circle back to Isaac, a man who was “born full of animals,” and the whole intriguing opening, and the walk was so long through other characters’ lives that I began to worry it never would. But I should have trusted author Kent Wascom.Toward the end I realized that the “long walks” were true to the way it really is with estranged family members, and I began to appreciate what I was reading on another level: this is a history of life itself that is told through specific people, during a specific long segment of time (early 1900s to 1961), in a specific region of the Americas.The writing is so good and musical that the story holds you if you trust the serpentine wandering. This is less a novel than a history that probably takes the whole quartet of books to tell. I’m not sure I’ll read the other books, but I admire Wascom’s writing and applaud his enormous undertaking....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Feb 14, 2021","Feb 18, 2021","Feb 12, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/36739752-the-new-inheritors

I never would have expected this slow-moving memoir-like novel after reading Homegoing. The nostalgic, languid style reminds me of Harper Lee looking back at childhood, but here it’s a Ghanaian immigrant story about addiction with a protagonist who is now a neuroscientist, which was exciting. I loved the science scenes and sometimes got impatient with the backtracking into memory. Particularly in the first half of the book because I often lost where I was—the scene that the memory interrupted. Perhaps this could have been clarified by more double-spacing and/or graphic dividers between current and memory sections, or perhaps my confusion was due to the fact that the backtracking was to several different time periods, so there was a sense of juggling. There were many graphic (double-spacing and ellipses) divisions, but not enough for me to always maintain clarity. However this definitely improved in the second half of the book when the shifting was mainly between only two time periods. The structure of the first half of the book seems critical to the second half, but it wasn’t until the second half that I got emotionally involved, but still it was inconsistent: a heady involvement rather than heart. This is a technical problem that I haven’t a clue how to smooth—maybe a more linear structure that builds to a more organic ending . . . but now I’m blabbing like an editor which is fruitless because maybe there is no way fix this to my satisfaction and/or maybe the problem is mine alone.In any case, Gyasi has writing chops and range and I look forward to her future work....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Jun 28, 2021","Jul 05, 2021","Jan 10, 2021",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/48570454-transcendent-kingdom

I'd been happy when my book club picked it because I'd never read Iris Murdoch and the word was this book was funny.He felt irritated and confused and upset. Yesterday he had felt shocked and a sort of horror, and then that feverish need to talk to Michael. But at least yesterday he had felt detached, yesterday he had been a spectator. Today he felt involved. He had suffered violence and then somehow been made privy to it; he was no longer a victim but an accomplice. He realized that in a way he was being unfair to Michael. (157)It is completely unfair of me to be so influenced in my opinion of this book because of my enjoyment of the sheer life, imagination, movement, and humor of the last one I read (The Nix by Nathan Hill), a contemporary book of a different ilk. But I was. Following Hill's book, I found Murdoch's narration of every thought people think and description of ""how they feel"" even more tedious than I normally would. Full disclosure: This is one of my personal issues. A good friend has a habit of telling me anything by describing every detail, every action she took, every thought she had at every interchange, and every possible imagined thought of whomever she was dealing with before getting to the point—generally something like ""I moved my money into a mutual fund."" She also has no memory for information she's already told me, and since I have a memory for conversations equivalent to the eidetic one for visual stimuli, I often have to stifle the impulse to clamp my mitts over my ears and scream for mercy. All this is to say I have a low tolerance for Murdoch's storytelling style.This is a good book for readers who do not have my intolerance. I was not able to overcome my loathing of this kind of storytelling or shift gears from the previous book I read to enjoy Murdoch's style and appreciate on its own terms this analytical and over-analytical melodrama about the life and death of a spiritual community....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Dec 26, 2020",Jan 2021,"Dec 26, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11230.The_Bell

Since I was reading an anthology of essays about friends, Friends: Voices on the Gift of Companionship, I thought I'd alternate with reading a collection of Van Booy's short stories. This worked well—a lot of variation.I have a new favorite writer. Van Booy breaks all the so-called rules of short stories: he shifts focus, essentially creating multiple protagonists and splitting action in a short form story that will not usually hold up under that kind of jostling, but he makes it work. Sometimes he ends on a kind of transcendent exhalation that, in other hands, might feel incomplete. He doesn't spell everything out, but trusts the reader. The last story is a tour de force of imagination, research, and (as delineated in wonderful back-of-book extras on several of the stories) collaboration. Not only does Simon Van Booy make all this rule-breaking work, he makes it sing and by the end, I sometimes gasped with the pleasure of surprise as he looped back and zapped a story into a coherent form or laughed out loud with delight.

The reason is that in a front-oFirst and most important, if you want to read this book, read a hard copy—not an ebook and certainly not an audiobook. The reason is that in a front-of-book note, there are optional chapter orders to read. Front to back is one way. I chose the other suggested way (and there are even more alternatives, but they are not delineated by “go to page” instructions). I cannot imagine doing this via any other form of the book. I chose the way that promised to make this into a cogent novel—the way that an editor might come up with to create a structure that enhances understanding of complex connections. So I have no idea what the experience of reading it front to back might be. Certainly different from mine. Front to back is linear stories, so if you forget a detail as you are jumping around time and characters, you have merely to backtrack a bit until you find, in whatever chapter you are in, a defining reference. (Many blurbs describe this novel as a jigsaw puzzle; this is accurate and fun. If you want ease of reading more than complex understanding of the whole, read back to front.)Second, although Crossings (St. Martin’s, July 2020) is a completely different and way bigger book, the plot and certain details were so much like another new recent book, Enter the Aardvark by Jessica Anthony (Little Brown, March 2020), that sometimes I had déjà vu and wondered if one muse was two-timing both authors.A Buddhist psychology book I once edited had a long section on “mergence”—specifically the joy a couple of women took in staring into each other’s eyes and feeling themselves become one entity. If you’ve ever experienced this, purposefully or spontaneously with a stranger, you are in for a treat with this book. What if in the course of merging you actually crossed? That’s what Crossings refers to. And if you are open to the deeper messages of mythology and intrigued by reincarnation, get this book.Even though I chose the reading method of jumping about (you never know how much of the book you’ve read, which may actually add to the experience of being in this morphing pool of existence), I found it fairly easy to follow the plot about a once-merged being who splits and then spends many lives trying to get back together.One tip for anyone who reads the book out of order: After the last page of the book (technically page 360), there is a “Cast of Characters.” Until I was well through the book, it didn’t occur to me to consult this cast and to suddenly realize that it is a timeline or an ancestry chart from the first character into his/her subsequent crossings into a sequence of characters. So the fact that the cast list is in two columns is a guide—in case you lose track of who is who, which I had been doing for quite some time before I realized a guide was available.And one last tip: After you finish, reread the Preface. As with Enter the Aardvard, I found myself amazed that Landragin wrote this book. How did he come up with this? And as a first novel, it’s astounding.I don’t know that I’d read Crossings a second time, but in the back of mind I’m filing the thought that if I do, I’ll read it front to back just to see it another way....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jan 04, 2021","Jan 08, 2021","Dec 12, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51170065-crossings

Mary Trump writes with the heat of a wildfire and truncates American history in a way that makes its carefully crafted hypocrisy even more shocking.

Trauma comes not simply from the brutality and torture of slavery and genocide done with impunity that form the foundation of the U.S.A., but it comes from many “good” people looking the other way because the inconvenience of addressing and redressing the wrong was/is just too damned hard. It comes from denial and lies to justify the unjustifiable. It comes because people are reluctant to give up anything—money, power, complacency, peaceful co-existence with people who would be offended if they rocked the boat, “willful blindness. (115)” And all this was there long before it manifested Donald J. Trump.The introduction to The Reckoning is one of the best book intros I’ve read. In it Mary Trump recounts her own history of PTSD and going into a full crisis that led to a stint in a rehab treatment facility after the election of her uncle. All that along with her grounded knowledge of psychology bring something unique to the book—well served by the fact that she is such a good writer.This is not a “Trump book.” It is an us/U.S. book. It is a fearless demand that we Americans look at who we are, who we have been, how we birthed the current divisions and violence, and acknowledging the wrongs, atone and repair.* * *Years ago I wrote a proposal and chapters for a book that I never sold. It is a nonfiction, researched book about trauma, healing trauma, and learning to thrive. I realize that a lot of traumatized peoples’ problem is an inability to recognize that they are indeed traumatized—in the throes of a physiological response. In fact I would not be at all surprised if many people read Mary Trump’s book and don’t connect their upset to what she painstakingly describes as our national trauma.Mary Trump’s book does not address any of this, but I’m so inspired by what she did write that I’ve made the beginning of my book that never sold into a 9,000-word Kindle ebook to help people recognize what may have been going on undiagnosed for their entire lives and, with the current cultural upset, may have been triggered into what seems like perpetual upset. You can get it here: Learning to Thrive: Begin by Recognizing Your Trauma, a Primer for 99 cents, the lowest sale price amazon allows. [image]Godspeed to all of us. Let us heal!9/25/21 Update—Connecting the DotsI’ve long since returned Mary Trump’s book to the library, but I’m still contemplating it, and it occurs to me that there is a missing piece between her book and the little ebook I offer to recognize trauma.So I’d like to spell it out:If you grow up in a family where abuse, violence, and/or denying the truth are normal, there is some point, early on, when you feel pain and confusion. Some people respond to this discomfort by joining the charade and they perpetuate it, actually convinced that it is normal. And if challenged, their illusion of superiority or entitlement to behave as they do is challenged, and since this is their whole self-image, they will fight like hell to protect their right to be who they are.Some people are devastated by the abuse, violence, and/or denial. Throughout their lives, when something happens to remind them of it, they have traumatic, dramatic responses that they may believe the circumstances merit, or if they sense there is something wrong, they don’t know what to do about it. They may go to talking therapy where they tell and retell their stories, but all this does is reinforce their belief in the truth of what happened and therefore the justification and inevitability of their responses. Nothing changes.As a country, we have a well-documented history of abuse, violence, and denying the truth. Whether you have chosen to carry on this behavior, convinced that it is normal and justified, or whether you are frequently disabled by your dramatic responses to it, you are traumatized. Both perpetrators and victims of abuse, violence, and denial are traumatized because they have been disconnected from their deepest truth that we are loving beings who all want to be respected and loved and valued.Current culture has brought the whole history of abuse, violence, and denial into everyday life.We are all traumatized.[For an article about inherited trauma and healing and resilience--an actual positive use of trauma--see my interview with researcher psychiatrist Rachel Yehuda, PhD.]...more",Notes are private!,0,51,1,"Sep 14, 2021","Sep 17, 2021","Dec 11, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/56124858-the-reckoning

I used to come home numb, sit in my big chair in my big room and fantasize about a time when I would never have to go into an office again. So boy, could I relate to the protagonist of this tale. And the fact that he’s set up to be someone most everyone who’s worked in offices might relate to in one way or another makes this book one of the most subversive I’ve ever read.Add to this that I read The Room at a time when 99 percent of American Democrats believe that we just had a free and fair election, and up to 80 percent of Republicans believe the opposite, and even believe there is evidence to back up their doubt or fury, despite the fact that many vote audits and 60 courts found there to be no election-changing fraud.I believe in objective reality, but I also believe in forces nobody can see—love, for instance. Many people believe in God as a specific being and will condemn anyone who disagrees. Others believe in God as a spiritual metaphor or think the whole thing is a crutch for people who cannot accept that life is hard. Some people have a lifelong experience of personal and systemic bias and others who have never had a problem simply don’t believe it exists. If you’re one of the friends or family of the 400,000 Americans who have died of COVID or if you’ve had a bad case yourself, you damn well believe it’s real; if you’re lucky enough to not be one of those people . . . Ugh.I’m aborting my trip down this heated, upsetting road of dichotomies. I simply brought it up to illustrate the strong beliefs that might inform one’s reactions to The Room, and to suggest that if you are open to examining your beliefs—so much so that you can inhabit even the side of a person you believe is delusional, you may find this book as subversively wonderful as I did....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Jan 09, 2021","Jan 17, 2021","Nov 26, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/17830958-the-room

The plot leaps in this story may seem extreme . . . unless you know some real history of extreme political actions.

Which leads me to this correction: the plot leap, which I cannot divulge without spoiing it, is not based on historical truth, as far as I can tell. That said, for the past 25 or so years, I've been learning the history I was never taught in my white suburban New York schools.

If you survive,Imagine it’s you: You are kidnapped from your family, stripped naked, shipped like cargo, body stacked on body, in the hold of a ship. If you survive, this transport is followed by being “owned” and worked by other people. Some of the “owners” claim you’re not human; others say, “Gee, I’d like to let you go, but I’m too poor and my dead husband left me only you.” Or “When you get old enough, you can be free.” Or “You can buy yourself for $500.” So on some level they know you’re a person just like them. But it simply doesn’t matter to them.Imagine you are beaten, raped, have your children ripped away from you and sold like a bag of potatoes. Maybe you escape, only to have to leave babies behind. Or your wife or husband. Or one of them fights tooth and nail, escapes and then comes back to try to rescue you. And then is killed.All the time, you are a feeling, thinking, intelligent, maybe brilliant, talented, agonized person, and this treatment is condoned and supported by a whole culture that lives fairly well off of your enslavement.This book of firsthand accounts of escapes on the Underground Railroad, first published in 1872, makes you feel it—as if it’s you. And the rage I feel is beyond expression. I got so angry I shook.Since 1872 these vivid true stories of both the people who suffered and abolitionists and antislavery white activists who tried and died trying to fight for justice have been available. These stories are available to the people who today own properties and businesses that were built with the free labor of enslaved individuals a mere 160 years ago, yet on a recent 60 Minutes segment about the last slave ship, Clotilda, and the descendants of its “cargo” of enslaved human beings, it was reported that a family of rich business owners have absolutely refused to meet with the descendants: Pat Frazier: They don't want to acknowledge that that's how part of their wealth was derived.Darron Patterson: Big part—Pat Frazier: And that, on the backs of those people.Anderson Cooper: What would you want to say to them? I mean, if— if they were willing to sit down and have, you know, have a coffee with you? Jeremy Ellis: We would first need to acknowledge what was done in the past. And then there's an accountability piece, that your family, for this many years, five years, owned my ancestors. And then the third piece would be, how do we partner together with, in Africatown? Pat Frazier: I don't want to receive anything personally. However, there's a need for a lot of development in that community. Anderson Cooper: We reached out to four members of the Meaher family, all either declined or didn't respond to our request for an interview.The book contains not only author William Still’s clear narrative and the first-person dignified accounts and letters of people who had risked everything, committed to freedom or death, but it has a foundation of journalism and legal documents, including the entire Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, codifying slavecatchers’ “right” to re-enslave anybody they suspected might have escaped an “owner.” The combination of materials makes this a foundational text that has been a resource for many other writers, including Ta Nehisi Coates who wrote the introduction and Dr. Bertice Berry (her memoir The Ties that Bind: A Memoir of Race, Memory, and Redemption is where I learned about this remarkable book). This is a history that should be read by anybody who wants a fuller picture of this abominable legacy with such strong tentacles that they invade and inform today’s current events. Both systemic racism and white antislavery activism have deep roots in our country that are given full exposure. I believe that without understanding what’s in this book, there is a tendency—certainly in complacent white people—to miss our complicity in systemic racism by remaining conveniently ignorant of what informs the experience of Black people.To support that last statement, I would like to end this  by quoting from a section of the book called “The Law of Treason, as Laid Down by Judge Kane,” from his “charge to the Grand Jury of the United States District Court, in reference to the Slave-hunting affray in Lancaster county,” a case of the State against slaves and their cohorts who fought back against people trying to re-enslave them as “fugitives from labor,” accusing them of treason:* It is not necessary to prove that the individual accused was a direct, personal actor in the violence. If he was present, directing, aiding, abetting, counselling, or countenancing it, he is in law guilty of the forcible act. Nor is even his personal presence indispensable. Though he be absent at the time of its actual perpetration, yet, if he directed the act, devised, or knowingly furnished the means for carrying it into effect, instigated others to perform it, he shares their guilt.” (269)The name of the slave owner farmer who was killed in the Lancaster event was Edward Gorsuch. Curious as to whether Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch is related to him, I googled and found this interesting article: All Law Enforcement Officers are “Heroes”—Including Slave-Catchers. The author of this article for The Libertarian Institute is deceased, so I wrote to the editor to correct what I believed was a bad mistake—nowhere in Still's book is Gorsuch identified as a police officer. Among all the legal documents, he is called a slave owner and a farmer; the only officer identified was named Kline and he was not killed. I copied my email to the Department of Justice regarding their ""roll call of heroes,"" which includes Gorsuch. The Libertarian Institute's editor replied by quoting the article on his site. The Department of Justice historian replied with a full explanation** which I will paste below with just a smattering of this personal opinion:Listing a man who was briefly deputized and called a Marshal in order to attack and re-enslave people at Lancaster with no explanation about what he did or why he was even a marshal, with no context, and qualifying him as heroic is a kind of exaggeration and distortion that should be corrected at its source. It is not the truth—the whole truth. To heal, we need truth. William Still tells the truth.__________*The defendant freedom fighters in the Lancaster case were found not guilty of treason and this case did an enormous amount to advance the abolitionist movement.**DOJ Historian's Reply to my queryMs. Robinson, Thank you for your inquiry, which was forwarded to me for response. The agency’s storied past included a few duties that would be considered morally unthinkable in America today, but also had a hand in correcting these same injustices during the Civil Rights and Reconstruction Eras. The U.S. Marshals Service Roll Call of Honor highlights those personnel who died in the line-of-duty. The criteria for this list and any related memorials, despite the official name, does not differentiate by any other standard than duty at the time of death. There is no political or moral consideration when considering inclusion.  To answer your specific inquiries on Edward Gorsuch—the submission was some time ago, long before Justice Gorsuch was being considered for the Supreme Court. We normally do not conduct any extensive genealogical work, so our agency does not know of any connection. As a clarification, Edward Gorsuch was a special deputy U.S. marshal at the time of his death. As part of the Fugitive Slave Act, which was a condition of the Compromise of 1850, deputies were required to assist slave-owners (who had to be specially-deputized in order to participate in law enforcement activity). Another deputy U.S. marshal, James Batchelder, also died while under similar federal orders while the Fugitive Slave Act was in effect. To ensure historical accuracy and transparency, it is necessary to include both names despite the moral conditions. In addition to our Roll Call, he would be mentioned by name at the Hall of Honor at the U.S. Marshals Museum (Fort Smith, Arkansas) and the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial (Washington, D.C.). While we understand the sensitivity, there is no substitute for historical accuracy. There was no attempt to conceal Mr. Gorsuch’s background or that our personnel were utilized to carry out this duty. This does not mean our agency would ever glorify the Fugitive Slave Act, but to omit those names who died during this time would not be historically accurate.  I hope this answers your inquiry.

From the get-go, to recount doctor/patient conversations when the doctor is Akhtar’s father and the patient is Donald Trump would make this a landmine of legal actions and ethics breaches. There is so much content, I can’t begin to  or even process what I learned and what I believe is true and where personality grated on me to a point where I turned off and stopped listening.What turned me off is that for a man as brilliant, introspective, and articulate as Ayad Akhtar, a man who spends great periods of time analyzing the seduction and flaunting of wealth and the screwiness of our system of economics, privilege, and bias, for such a person to never turn this same eye toward his own attitude toward sex and women—which he describes in lurid, sometimes subversively self-aggrandizing detail bordering on pornographic in a hefty section of the middle of the book—for such a writer to then glibly, and to my ear, disingenuously explain that he is not proud of his actions (and he hopes the reader will still like him), when the sheer amount of graphic description conveys the opposite, for him to overlook his sexual activity in a context of all the other consumerism he talks about . . . to me it feels like a thick layer of writer’s denial. If he was going to hold no punches, I wanted no less from him in regard to his profusely displayed sex life. I want him to admit his attempt to hide pride in the detail, and find out why on earth he is proud. In short, I want full personal truth. Without it, I sometimes felt like I’d been unwittingly forced to watch somebody masturbate.*Suffice it to say, this is a complicated memoir by a very complicated writer about being a Muslim Pakistani-American man, about being an American and our perspective that has become distorted by narcissism, entitlement, denial, and consumerism, about how we are “a nation in thrall to our own stupidity. (288)” It also is an education in Pakistani and Indian history, finance, and so many other things. There is way more valuable content than the annoying veiled sex mess, and the ending is particularly poignant, evoking all the pain of the contradictions in this American life. I’m glad I read this and now will take a shower to wash off the silt and digest what’s worth retaining.____________*Ironically, at the end of the book, Akhtar confronts a young Muslim student pornographer and incredulously chastises him for the very thing he, Akhtar, has done in this book.

But I could have sworn I was in Northern Ontario having the experience of the people she writes so truthfully that they become me, or I them. I really can’t articulate it except to say I’m blubbery with admiration.A Town Called Solace, like her other books, is about family relationships. And even though it doesn’t delve into themes I’d call “Shakespearean” because of their complexity and universal truths—themes of her earlier books, Crow Lake, Road Ends, and The Other Side of the Bridge—it is no less affecting.Her dialog is so good it could easily translate to theater (this play could effortlessly be staged—part reader’s theater and part regular theater). Her transitions from first-person chapters to third are natural and effortless. Mary Lawson, a quietly brilliant creator, is one of my favorite writers.

But Sarah was practically an American, and Nadine had Omar wrapped around her finger. Isra had to pretend nothing was wrong. (185) This is a riveting story about generations of Palestinian American women. A page turner. The writing is sturdy (not lyrical, as one of the cover blurbs says), and that is not a criticism. It’s delivers plot, and that’s what kept me reading obsessively.And the plot got inside me. Because I’m a writer and an editor, I usually find myself aware of the mechanics of a book. Here, I noticed them, but I found myself thinking the kind of thoughts—personal ones of identification and comparisons with my own life and choices—that I hear “civilian” readers voice. That almost never happens to me, and I’m so grateful to Etaf Rum for giving me a “real reader” experience. It’s been a while.”Where I come from, we keep these stories to ourselves. To tell them to the outside world is unheard of, dangerous, the ultimate shame.” This quotation, also on the blurb page, was pieced together from the opening to the book (p. 1). And it made me think of a conversation I just had with a friend who is Black. After knowing each other for more than 30 years, we found ourselves sharing intimate details of our histories. Toward the end of the conversation, she said, “You know, they always say that violence is passed down in Black families and that’s why our families are the way they are.” Almost without a thought, I answered, “That’s bullshit. It’s everywhere.”These stories of abusive families are everywhere—by my calculations, at least half the population.* And shame simply makes people who grow up the way Rum’s characters do believe they are alone. Freaks. Isolated with no recourse. These stories and denied history need to be told. Brava to Etaf Rum for busting through her shame and telling the “untellable” tale, some version of which affects so many of our world’s people, no matter where we come from!_________* Several years ago, feeling alienated by all the social media declarations of perfect families’ Christmas celebrations, I decided to do some research. I find that facts often jar my delusions of being “less than” or abnormal. The results of my completely unscientific survey are here: The Myth of the Happy American Family._________AfterthoughtIn an Op Ed entitled “Who Can Win America’s Politics of Humiliation” author Thomas Friedman writes:  Humiliation, in my view, is the most underestimated force in politics and international relations. The poverty of dignity explains so much more behavior than the poverty of money.People will absorb hardship, hunger and pain. They will be grateful for jobs, cars and benefits. But if you make people feel humiliated, they will respond with a ferocity unlike any other emotion, or just refuse to lift a finger for you. As Nelson Mandela once observed, “There is nobody more dangerous than one who has been humiliated.” Riffing on this, I would say that the kind of cultural family violence epitomized by Etaf Rum’s novel and so many other books—be they about Black, Native, Jewish, White, Christian, Chinese, Japanese . . . every culture and group you can name—is borne of a man’s humiliation in a patriarchy. Men who have been made to feel helpless, and they simply cannot bear it. And this humiliation screws with everybody to the point where some people believe, as do the women in Rum’s book, “this is just the way it is.”This will only stop being the way it is when the lies are exposed, the humiliation laid bare, and women become equal partners. We need more and more and more women like Etaf Rum to tell their “secret” stories....more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,"Sep 13, 2020","Sep 18, 2020","Sep 13, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/34313931-a-woman-is-no-man

Every so often, a wood cabin broke the clearing, raw and thrown-together, built uneasily on a footprint of land that was a fraction of what was devoted to the field. (132)This is inspired nonfiction written with such comprehensiveness and elegance that it took my breath away. The people are alive now and achingly authentic. You are inside their lives feeling their fears, and later in life, their haunting regrets, their hurts from the past, their mourning of lost opportunities as they watch young Black people do what they never could because the civil rights movement came too late for them. This is writing where every word has been carefully chosen and sentences have been honed.The tension builds like a novel. You feel the terror as people run out of options and have to flee for their lives and freedom. You vibrate in your heart and bones.Isabel Wilkerson has written a symphony. I was born in 1951 and I found myself thinking how old I was when one of the characters (she weaves together the stories of three families in different eras between 1915 and 1970, the dates of the Great Migration) was fighting Jim Crow and running for his life. In 1968 I was in high school, negotiating the personal tsunami of surviving with crazy drugged parents when Martin Luther King was assassinated. My mother, who was mostly drunk during that period, wouldn’t let me go to my part-time job in Ossining, which was the Black town adjacent to our white one. So of course I knew the history, but I knew it like a traumatized refugee hearing solo stringed instruments playing a refrain behind a scrim; Isabel Wilkerson turned that into a present-day full-bodied symphony orchestra, and the effect had me roiling with newfound horror and even more horror at my ignorance about the world around me at that time.If you’re white and want to be emotionally educated about the Great Migration—a gigantic part of history that is common knowledge to Black people because it is their family lore—this is the book to read; this is everything that was carefully and methodically wiped out of white education in my public school in the 1960s. If you are Black, you probably know all about this already. But still, this book will be a tremendous emotional ride and you will have the chance to experience as close as is possible through reading what your forebears went through.No matter what your race or background, this book is an astounding chronicle of just how much intelligence, ingenuity, endurance, drive, and resilience it takes to migrate, to run for your life, to leave the known and leap into the unknown, hoping for a better future.Sadly, the northern backlash to the migration was just as virulent and violent, just as chaotic and volatile as what we are experiencing now in regard to immigration. There were riots, fighting, killing, and all manner of human abominations. So you gain an understanding of the precursor to today’s events, even though today’s involve noncitizens and an absolutely broken immigration system that our government refuses to fix.However, just as a matter of fact, you can see that the current lies being perpetrated about the majority of migrants and immigrants are belied by the strength, motivation, and resilience required to do what they do. (And I cannot believe there was not method and intent to keeping this out of white-run public school history classes when I was growing up in the 1960s.)I just had an article about LIFE magazine photographer and Renaissance man Gordon Parks published in Next Avenue. Parks grew up in Kansas. Wilkerson’s book tracks the migrations according to which railroads traveled which routes, so I’m guessing Parks’s people were from Mississippi before the Great Migration. One of the most important things I learned from Parks was his way of approaching all people with curiosity rather than preconceived judgments. He had to do this as a journalist, but I think, because of his background, this was also his inclination.After reading The Warmth of Other Suns, I hope I will be better able to emulate Parks. How could one possibly know at first meeting who these intrepid migrants were? The gifts in their souls, gifts passed down to their descendants? The only sane way to approach people is with open curiosity, as we all are treasure chests, waiting to be explored.PostscriptThe majority of readers will never approach this nearly 800-page book. So I am thrilled to read that this Pulitzer-winning story is in development for a TV miniseries, which I trust will do for the Great Migration what Roots did for our history of enslaving people.

For that reason, I found myself identifying to a point that was nearly unbearable with much that was in this book. Mary Trump is a shrink and a teacher, and although this book could have used one more editing pass, her psychological light illuminating this level of ""crazy"" is something everybody from a dysfunctional family might benefit from reading.If you are only interested in understanding the president, you are missing what's here. This is ""Dysfunctional Family Deconstructed 101."" If you have experienced being humiliated by abusive authority figures who were aroused by their ability to inflict pain, read it. If you come from drunkenness and/or addiction, read it. If you have family members with compulsive debting problems and limitless sense of entitlement, who lie the way others breathe, read it. If you have sat in the middle of absolute insanity with everybody around you acting as if it was normal, read it. And if you've ever been essentially erased after you confronted the insanity and abuse with truth, for goodness sake, read this book.Oh, I could go on and on.When I was about 10 and my sister was 13, we stood at our front door as extended family were about to swarm us. My sister and I were not close, but in that moment when I looked up at her and whispered, ""Good luck,"" and she repeated it back, we were as close as we would ever get—both of us knowing the trauma we were about to experience without any place to run. If this resonates for you, read this book.I've been very proud that I've worked on my own ""stuff,"" live a responsible life, and have no more day-to-day contact with the kind of insanity that I grew up with. Many of the major players are dead, and those who remain alive are estranged. Disconnection really is the only way to deal with people who are that crazy. Anything else is enabling them and/or willfully playing the role of victim. I've felt good that I've known when to call it quits. However the election of Donald Trump has not only brought back all of the old pathologies, but it has turned my country into the family I'm happy to have lived through and left behind.Mary Trump is a good shrink. She knows there is no way to change her uncle and she gives no advice for how to deal with him. The answer is you can't. What you can do is vote him and his enablers out. I am grateful to her for her effort in that direction.8/5/20 Update ContemplationMany people are floored by Trump's ""It is what it is"" response to the 1,000 Covid deaths a day comment in the currently viral Axios interview. His disconnect from people's loss and pain is apparent. Someone else could come to the same conclusion that life and death ""are what they are,"" but most empathic people would do so after experiencing inexorable loss and understanding that there are some things which you simply must go through.One of the things Mary Trump does so clarifyingly well in the beginning of her book is to empathically convey the loss Trump himself went through when he was a very young child and how, never having recovered from that, he locked into a defense of never feeling anything. That is what we are now witnessing. It is horrific when you have a relative dying alone in an ICU or you've lost most of your family and everyone around you is sick or dying because of the lack of a well-executed national policy about something so simple as mask-wearing, social distancing, and hand washing. But it is to be expected with somebody this damaged at the head of the government. He was trained at his father's knee....more",Notes are private!,0,100,1,"Jul 27, 2020","Jul 29, 2020","Jul 27, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/54081499-too-much-and-never-enough

All of this is to say, I'm not a neutral reader. Lucky me, because that means I can read and hear her voice in my head and my heart. I can deeply appreciate her wisdom, clarity, and commitment to tell the truth, correcting herself when she is proven wrong—which she does in one whole chapter of this memoir when she gives a detailed history of a man she believed was a slave owner, only to find out that, on the contrary, he was a heroic abolitionist.The Ties That Bind is a perfect mix of personal story and researched history, including a wonderfully useful and enhancing back-of-book Notes section. The memoir is entertaining, gentle, but for anybody who is open to using it to learn more about themselves—what they have believed that might be wrong, what they are willing to sacrifice or risk to do the right thing, what they might have been missing by living a segregated life, and so much more—for them, it is a generous teacher, offering a glimpse into a full-spectrum life.Bertice Berry is my teacher.

It's a sweet and warm teaching device mostly for Black people, but really for anybody who has a spiritual sense and a longing for peace. The main narrative is unpretentious and first-novel young and analytical—written in 1995, published in 2000—but simultaneously wise, deep, and spiritually ancient. However there is a book within a book here (a first-person slave story), and there is nothing first-novelly about this inner book; it is fully mature and positively magical and moving. And the funny thing is that after reading a section of that, sometimes the analytical stuff is welcome—sort of like a teacher stepping in with compassionate understanding and clarity delivered lecture style with a Socratic dialogue.I recently ""met"" Dr. Bertice Berry via her Facebook videos and I felt as if I'd connected to a teacher I didn't know I'd been longing for my whole life. And a friend. Every morning I click on to her videos and settle in to be inspired and moved and educated. Each begins, ""I'm Dr. Bertice Berry and I want to tell you a story."" And then with the most beautiful radiant smile, in a voice that can heal, she relates love- and sometimes pain-filled anecdotes from her life—stories that can be heard on whatever level the listener lives. And all of them are packed with meaning, metaphor, and messages—like this first novel.Bertice Berry is a sociologist, a writer, a singer, a sewer (she makes all her own clothes and has been supplying facemasks to organizations since the pandemic began), and so much more. Her being floods my whole being with love and her wisdom is like a shot of pure oxygen to my psyche.When you do something for more than 20 years, you get better at it. So I can't wait to read her 2009 memoir The Ties That Bind: A Memoir of Race, Memory, and Redemption and then the novel she is currently working on.

(The book was republished in paperback by University of Georgia Press.)Why isn't author Jeff Fields as known as John Steinbeck, Wallace Stegner, and Harper Lee? Why didn't this 1974 release about life in a boarding house in the Georgia sticks in 1953 win a Pulitzer? Fields's bio at the Georgia Center for the Book states: Jeff Fields has written for print and television as well as for the stage, but he is best known for his 1974 book, ""A Cry of Angels,"" an acclaimed novel that critics called a ""masterpiece"" and a book ""even better than ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" A coming-of-age story set in small town Georgia, it is populated by memorable characters and fuses the comedy of youth with dramatic incidents, soaring on what Georgia author and friend Terry Kay calls ""wings of poetic language."" In 2010, the novel was chosen for inclusion on the Georgia Center for the Book's list of ""25 Books All Georgians Should Read."" I would go one step further and say that anybody who loves literature should read this book.Thank you, Diane Barnes, for waking me up to a book that is indeed a masterpiece.Jeff Fields is now 82 years old and living in Georgia. Somebody optioned this book for a movie in 1975, but he took it back, not trusting what Hollywood would do to it. I'm glad a movie was never made, but somebody should make a movie, and I won't go to it because the book is all I want in my head. Somebody should pay serious attention to this man. I wish I knew how to do that better.He donated his papers to the University of North Carolina. Here's his page: https://finding-aids.lib.unc.edu/04950/. He is said to be working on another novel.

I read it much slower this time, and I was surprised to discover that, for me, it did not have the same impact as the first time. This is because there really are no new levels or writer’s technique to discover. You get it all on the first reading—not a bad thing, but now I understand how somebody could own this book and then donate it after reading it. Gorgeous writing. A slow, meandering wonderful story.

By page 300, I was gobsmacked by her range and wanted to ask her how she did it. And by the end, I just wanted to say thank you.I knew nothing about West Indian people in England during World War II. Nothing about British and American GI’s treatment of Black people then. I knew nothing about the British Empire’s specific movements and battles. But everything and everyone felt true because Andrea Levy has perfect pitch for voice and full character. I roared with laughter at fantastically arrogant Hortense at her first sight of her naked husband. And any writer who loves bowel and birthing humor has my heart. Whether Levy was writing Jamaicans, American GIs, white women, war, or anything and anybody, the dialogue was effortless and true, and I know this because when characters are true, the reader can identify, no matter how unfamiliar she is with a culture or time.Not only is this a wonderful historical novel—written in multiple characters’ perfect voices and spanning pre-war Jamaica, both Great Wars, and 1948 England—but this book educates and should be on the list of anybody who is filling in their never-taught-by-white-school knowledge of Black history.I knew nothing about this story until I read Goodreader Margitte’s .

The cover represents the book, but it does not give a 3-second glancer (they've actually timed how long browsers look at prospective covers in bookstores) an inkling about the depth and standout writing contained within. I've been gnashing my teeth about what would accurately represent this book, and I've got zero ideas. This is a stunningly written literary novel about friendship, written with deep understanding of humanity and curiosity about how we came to be this way. Although the characters are young for most of the book, it is certainly not YA fiction or chick lit, which might be a 3-second assumption from this cover.So ... read this book of you love good writing, if you long for understanding of our human condition, if you revel in honest expression of it....more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,"Sep 26, 2020","Sep 30, 2020","Jun 21, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/50852136-the-knockout-queen

The only remedy for me, other than shutting down completely, is vacuuming. Suffice it to say that the experience reading Betty left me with the cleanest carpet and wood floor I've ever had.The book was at times so excruciating that I had to stop reading and not only clean but lie on the couch and pant in pain. Nevertheless, this is a very good novel—a story based on the author's mother's childhood. A story of the abuse white culture heaps on Native people. That men heap on women and children. That crazy people heap on every living thing. It is well written, very different from Tiffany McDaniel's first published novel, The Summer that Melted Everything, but birthed way earlier (and its ending makes it seem like a prequel to the first novel). Betty starts out as a child's story, and had it stayed that way, I might have lost interest. But the writer's mature skill moved it into the adult fiction category, with one of the lovingest father characters I've ever read.*ARC provided by publisher....more",Notes are private!,0,74,1,"Jun 27, 2020","Jul 06, 2020","Jun 15, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/49201494-betty

Kendi's personal history is interesting to me after I mistakenly read the YA adaptation of his National Book Award-winning Stamped from the Beginning: Racism, Antiracism and You  (600 pages). I read and ed the 300-page adaptation done by Jason Reynolds with the shorter title Stamped: Racism, Antiracism and You.Stamped delivered a clear history, with definitions that are repeated in this book, but How to Be an Antiracist is not the how-to book I was anticipating; the history is so mixed up with memoir that it's harder to follow and just get the information.If you're reading to understand:How did racism happen?and What can I do to help fix it?I recommend Stamped—and especially the YA edition for its efficiency in communicating clear information rather than a treatise on every point.That said, there are some chapters where the memoir and the information are really well melded, offering insights that are missing in Stamped. Particularly good is the chapter that deals with cultural racism. The explanation is so clear that if one is of a mind to understand one's world beyond the topic of this book, one can riff on all cultural biases and see everything differently.The parsing out of racist and antiracist assumptions was excellent, but I got so tired of the treatise nature of this book that I often ended up skimming. I'm in a hurry, I guess, and I would rather feel than absorb this level of academic detail. Hence, I found myself longing to go back to Percival Everett's fiction, which gives one a firsthand experience of the agony of racist culture. Any book really, but particularly I Am Not Sidney Poitier and Erasure.Because I'm sequestered in my COVID-free apartment, my recent reading is not only an attempt to educate myself, but by writing about it, I'm hoping to serve the greater good. So I want to add some of my contemplation after reading this book, White Fragility and YA Stamped:My grand aha of the last 4-6 years (mentioned in my  of White Fragility) is that humans are herd animals and no amount of imagining that we can avoid that is going to change that fact. Both White Fragility and How to Be an Antiracist grapple with this truth in slightly different ways, but it seems to me that their points converge in one message: in order to change the movement of the herd, a significant number of individual members of it have to wake up to the nature of the herd (aka system). And that nature involves a system that is designed to keep everybody in their places—White people in superior positions of power and influence to an inferior position of Black people. And concurrently, and in some ways paradoxically, we have to begin to see each other as individual members of this common herd, rather than as stereotyped groups. Although accepting our herd nature seems antithetical to seeing our individuality, I do not believe it is. I believe it merely requires a higher level of discernment.A higher level of discernment requires knowledge—which all these books offer. It also requires practice (referred to as ""stamina"" for White people to talk about racism in White Fragility and often characterized as antiracist ""action"" in How to Be an Antiracist) and a willingness to change our direction per what may be new information for many of us.Let so many of us become moral rebels that the term ""rebel"" will no longer apply to acting humanely and in the common good....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Jun 19, 2020","Jun 22, 2020","Jun 07, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/40265832-how-to-be-an-antiracist

Senator Ted Cruz in yesterday's hearing for Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson, held up Jason Reynolds's YA adaptation of this book and declared that it saying that people see one another's color--acknowledging that we do--is a far cry from MLK's aspiration that we judge one another on our character rather than color. Here is a bit of nuanced wisdom from Kendi's intro to this version of his book:""The first step to building an antiracist America is acknowledging America's racist past. By acknowledging America's racist past, we can acknowledge America's racist present. In acknowledging America's racist present, we can work toward building an antiracist America. An antiracist America where no racial group has more or less, or is thought of as more or less. An antiracist America where people no longer hate on racial groups or try to change racial groups.

This is unapologetically a book by a white womanEducator and sociologist Robin DiAngelo is brilliantly thorough, and I am grateful beyond expression. This is unapologetically a book by a white woman written for white people who dispute our part in our historically racist system. It's for people who find the discomfort of the discussion intolerable. And it's also for white people like me who have accepted culpability and have committed themselves to being as uncomfortable as it takes in an effort to become an antiracist—and it gets pretty damned uncomfortable; my last read, Stamped: Racism, Antiracism, and You, gave a new-to-me history that I was never taught in white school and a vivid new awareness of systemic racism and how black people have coped with it that's changed my vision. White Fragility is clarifying, supportive, and further strengthens my commitment, even as the clear articulation of everything made me sometimes squirm. DiAngelo's genius is the ability to break things down and deliver them as digestible facts. And with that, I'll turn it over to Professor DiAngelo:What is white fragility?Given how seldom we [white people] experience racial discomfort in a society we dominate, we haven't had to build our racial stamina. Socialized into a deeply internalized sense of superiority that we either are unaware of or can never admit to ourselves, we become highly fragile in conversations about race. We consider a challenge to our racial worldviews as a challenge to our very identities as good, moral people. Thus, we perceive any attempt to connect us to the system of racism as an unsettling and unfair moral offense. The smallest amount of racial stress is intolerable—the mere suggestion that being white has meaning often triggers a range of defensive responses. These include emotions such as anger, fear, and guilt and behaviors such as argumentation, silence, and withdrawal from the stress-inducing situation. These responses work to reinstate white equilibrium as they repel the challenge, return our racial comfort, and maintain our dominance within the racial hierarchy. I conceptualize this process as white fragility. (1-2)(I was going to do a Q&A of quotes, but I've highlighted so many that it's easier to say: Read the book if you want to know what you might be hiding from yourself.)For the last few years, pre- and post-Trump, I wrote and then have been trying to sell a novel about being a member of the human herd. In the United States in particular we value our individuality to a point where sometimes we imagine it exempts us from herd directions or even unconscious herd assumptions and beliefs. There is a psychiatric term for this imagined disconnect: anosognosia—a lack of insight or ability to perceive one's own condition. When my protagonist in the new novel proclaims that she always thinks for herself, she is demonstrating a form of anosognosia (and in the process of writing the book, I thereby discovered my own). All of us who fail to understand that we are members of a system whether we like it or not, and therefore we have been conditioned by it, I believe are suffering from anosognosia. And what's worse is that because of white people's position in this system, we are blind to the nature of the system itself and most often refuse to talk about that. White Fragility is like going from blindness to 20/20 vision about who and where we are.DiAngelo advocates that we listen to feedback without defending and talk about our racism. If we could just do that—""graciously receive [feedback], reflect, and work to change the behavior"" (113), ""It would be revolutionary,"" responds a black man in one of DiAngelo's workshops. Revolutionary!""An antidote to white fragility is to build up our stamina to bear witness to the pain of racism that we cause,"" (128) writes DiAngelo.But to do this—this is me speaking, not DiAngelo—we must simultaneously be willing to see and dismantle our reactions and the underlying unconscious beliefs and the political systems they subsequently enable, which requires an awareness of mirror racist systems within our white psyches. And that is hard. The only way I've dismantled a fraction of the gazillion distortions that have directed me throughout my life has been through mindfulness—I have to first become aware that the distortions exist and are distortions. Then with gentleness, I can make a little space between the essential me and my distorted thoughts and thereby see them. (You can't control thoughts. If you think you can, you'll just end up hating yourself, or even worse, denying that you think what you think.) When you see thoughts for what they are—conditioned ""things""—you can begin to acknowledge them and let them flit through your conscious mind without attaching to them by believing they're true or false. If you practice this enough, you can really change. At least that's my experience. But first you must be willing acknowledge that you might not be right about everything. And that illumination is the gift Robin DiAngelo offers in this mighty book.* * * Notes—As I was nearing the end of this book I saw a news report about a black flight attendant who spotted a middle-aged white man reading White Fragility and asked him about it. To understand the healing this book can introduce, watch this CBS News video.--There's an excellent interview with Robin DiAngelo on PBS.—I read a Kindle copy of this book. As I type, libraries now have long waiting lists and the book is on back order at stores. However, I do not recommend getting the audio version; a friend whom I trust said it's like listening to an automaton speak and this made it hard to stay with the book. The information is too important to dilute that way. If you are able to read text, read it.

The first paragraph landed so hard I have to stop reading and do errands to let this process through my body. Here's what did it—from Columbus's log when he was met with an extraordinary welcome by Arawak people who inhabited the Bahamas: ""They ... brought us parrots and balls of cotton and spears and many other things, which they exchanged for the glass beads and hawks' bells. They willingly traded everything they owned ... They were well-built, with good bodies and handsome features ... They do not bear arms, and do not know them, for I showed them a sword, they took it by the edge and cut themselves out of ignorance. They have no iron. Their spears are made of cane. ... They would make fine servants. ... With fifty men we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we want.""The legacy of this mindset is nauseating. The misinterpretation of love, altruism, and gifts to honor visitors, from a Western perspective of power and possessions and the arrogant belief that any culture that is different from theirs is necessarily ignorant or stupid rather than perhaps more evolved and connected to oneness? ... I do not know where to begin. I have been reading and editing Native material the last few months, and seeing and feeling the roots of the pain leaves me moaning in my own agony. I will absorb this book as fast I'm capable.Later that same day, I post:Only 2 chapters in and I've learned that in 1619 settlers in Virginia were so desperate for food they resorted to cannibalism. A man killed his wife who was sleeping on his chest and then cut her up and ate her. Whites were enraged at the Indians' superior ability to farm and live off the land, and therefore they vilified them even more. Because they could not enslave Natives, they got people from Africa, ripped them away from family, culture, and language, thereby trying to ensure their helplessness. Black slaves were the solution to white cannibals' inability to farm. So these ignorant white cannibals enslaved people, called everyone else savages to justify what they were doing, and then to keep indentured white servants and black slaves from ganging up on them, they initiated systemic racism, giving white servants privileges to divide and conquer. And so it began.A friend comments: I wrote a paper in college about the arrogance behind Jamestown. One detail that sticks in my mind: thinking that because Virginia was at a similar latitude to the Mediterranean, they would be able to grow palm trees and pineapples. No research, just the assumption that if they willed it so... And another friend messages me that Zinn was a hero of the left but practiced bad scholarship and made things up. She referenced an article titled ""Lies the Debunkers Told Me: How Bad History Books Win Us Over"", with the dek: ""Politicians quote them. Movie stars revere them. But these authors are so busy spinning good yarns that they don't have time to research the facts."" I read the article and notice that it fails to cite any specific historical inaccuracies and debunks nothing. It only says that the book is simplistic and ""inspire[s] a degree of passion that verges on the pugnacious."" Thereby doing the very thing it is accusing Zinn of—offering facile arguments that make people feel as if they've been hoodwinked and are now in the know.Ridiculous. People do these things all on their own. We hear anything and, according to our beliefs, we go to extremes of rejection or acceptance, in our need to paint things black or white, good or bad, and therefore ourselves virtuous for being on whatever side we deem ""good.""At the start of People's History, Zinn fully discusses the impossibility of anybody writing a history that is objective. A historian chooses what to dwell on. Most histories dwell on the stories told by whomever is victorious. Zinn is choosing to tell the other side. I read on, making up my own mind. 7/8/20 Second Day of ReadingAbout 60 pages in, I decided to look at some other Goodreads s. ""Don't read this book!"" screams a er with 165 likes. ""Eye-opening,"" say others. Some people idolize Zinn; others declare he is an effete arrogant a-hole and if you like this book, you dislike America. At the beginning of the book, there is a bit about how historians with biases cherry-pick facts, and the way they insert the ones they disagree with into a basket-load of facts they agree with skews history. ReviewYes, Zinn does this too. He is a lefty; he believes in the power of the people; he dislikes bullies and murderers and usurpers and a few rich men controlling the masses. All true (and openly acknowledged in chapter 23). But what I value in this book is the story of ""the other side."" I've heard plenty of the ""good pilgrim,"" noble founders, and broad-stroke tales of how we fought for independence and spent ""blood and treasure"" (a loathsome euphemism for ""murder and land theft"") to settle America. What I've never heard is about the in-fighting and factions I see in today's culture, about the strategizing behind suppression and uprising. Can we be so different from the past? No, this book lets us know, it's always been this way. I needed to hear the everyday struggles of regular people who in truth are the engine of any revolution or evolution, and this book takes you into the shoes of people struggling to survive—the conquered and the bullies. It takes you beyond names of battles and dates I was supposed to learn in high school history into the brutality and pure evilness of people like Andrew Jackson and so many others. It gives you the firsthand voices from documents where legions of articulate Indian leaders pled for their treaties to be upheld and you feel their betrayal and the death of First Nations people. Honestly, I don't give a hoot about bias or Zinn lovers and haters. Everyone is biased. I refuse to idealize or condemn. I'm simply grateful for a book that makes history as real as my fingers and toes.A ContemplationI read this book as part of my late-in-life attempt to educate myself, debunking a lot of what I was taught in school and picked up by osmosis in this segregated American culture. I was perfectly primed for Zinn by previously reading several books about race and racism as well as Erik Larson's London Blitz history, The Splendid and the Vile, and Jess Walter's excellent upcoming novel, The Cold Millions, about the beginning of the labor union movement, much of whose history is reprised in some brutal chapters in Zinn's book.But the more I read about the overblown entitlement (which belief really derives from one in Manifest Destiny*) of everyone from the original European invaders to today's pocketful of billionaire capitalists, the more two other novels came to mind: The Dinner by Herman Koch and Not Forgetting the Whale by John Ironmonger. Both novels deal with how people respond to crises. Koch's book determines that our culture is directed by a group of elite people, who run the legal system and are devoid of ethics and empathy, who believe they can and must do whatever it takes to prevail individually, with no sense of value in any lives but their own and their kin's. Koch likens this mindset to a disease that is inherited by offspring who perpetuate it. Ironmonger's novel shows us as a species infused with a deep inborn altruism. In response to a worldwide pandemic, we/they survive by helping one another.Although many people choose to put their heads in the sand and stick with whatever beliefs they've always had, there is the opportunity right now to change—to see all the usually hidden motivations just under the surface of most large human movements. Both human drives (individual power grabbing versus actions for the wellbeing of all of us) are currently fully exposed. A People's History shows the roots of a sense of entitlement that has grown like an inherited cancer in our American culture and is now threatening to take over and kill the body. Lying did not begin with the current administration of the United States. We are merely seeing ourselves in such an exaggerated fun-house mirror that if we look, we cannot avoid knowing who we are. We Americans are a population who has been brought up on lies: ""We are the good guys,"" is one of the biggest (although partially true; chapter 16 ""A People's War?"" is an outstanding deconstruction of a truth that's been exaggerated into an idealized myth. And please do not condemn as ""biased"" anybody who asks questions that expose hypocrisy; this is the very knee-jerk exaggeration that births the historical lies this book debunks!). Our written history presented ""genocide"" as hard-won settlements through true grit and expenditure of ""blood and treasure."" When we could only survive via free labor, we invented racism and kidnapped countless people, yet the Confederacy erected statues of traitors as if they were heroes and many people still claim that loving them has nothing to do with supporting racism. Three hundred seventy treaties made with Native peoples are regularly broken with impunity and bogus rationales. (The history is so distorted that in a recent incident, a woman who was headed to a Trump rally that was illegally taking place on lands the Supreme Court ruled belonged to the Sioux Nation, yelled to Native American protestors ""Go back to where you came from."") Historically we have invaded other countries when it benefitted us economically, although the popular reasons given may have been twisted to sound benign (there's a whole excrutiating chapter on the Vietnam war). Now is not the first time science has been distorted to support a political agenda: Shortly after Bush took office in 1990, a government scientist prepared a report for a Congressional committee on the dangerous global warming results of fossil fuels, and ""the White House changed the testimony, over the scientist's objections, to minimize the danger (Boston Globe, October 29, 1990)."" (576) Debilitating tax breaks for the rich began with Democrats—""the Kennedy-Johnson administrations—who, under the guise of 'tax reform,' first lowered the World War II-era rate of 91 percent on incomes over $400,000 a year to 70 percent. During the Carter Administration (though over his objections) Democrats and Republicans in Congress joined to give even more tax breaks to the rich."" (580, citing America: Who Really Pays the Taxes? by Donald Barlett and James Steele) A People's History documents it all.However, we humans are simultaneously inherently altruistic. (Can we expand our psyches enough to contain this nuanced paradox?) We are herd animals who will stop to care for the hurt, help our neighbors, practice radical acts of compassion, and applaud self-sacrificing heroes. I am not married, but I've listened to many couples fight, and my least favorite mode is when people deflect responsibility by counter-blaming in response to a true naming of a mistake; both statements may or may not be true, but it's irrelevant because they have nothing to do with each other and succeed in creating two strains of speech that never connect. I see this going on constantly:Liberals: The separation of immigrant children from their parents is unconscionable. Conservatives: Yeah, but Obama built the jails.Liberals: People who have lived in systemic racism, along with their allies, should demonstrate and we should finally rectify the errors.Conservatives: Yeah, but violence to property and law enforcement is bad.Liberals: White people need to recognize their bias and become anti-racists.Conservatives: There's a world history of white slavery also.Liberal: That news article you just posted is bogus. Just check Snopes.Liberal: It's got a lot of comments. (Hence, it is not removed.)Conservatives: Liberals are thought police who insist that everybody agree with them.Liberals: Conservatives are stupid idiots.Conservatives: Liberals are arrogant a-holes.Liberals, Conservatives, and 80% of the population that will not vote or think about politics: All politicians are crooks, so why even bother to . . . [fill in the blank]Can we please stop this?It has been well documented since the 2016 election that up to 80 percent of eligible Americans did not vote. That 80 percent also is well represented in the current fun-house mirror image of who we are: people who will not do the work to be informed and make the best decisions we are capable of for the good of all of us. Right this moment, we are all hurting, we have all made mistakes, and we're all in need of help, compassion, and self-sacrifice. So I pray that we will follow our better instincts and use the very tiny window of time that remains to consciously choose a return to empathy. November 3, 2020, is not merely an election; it is a referendum on our moral nature.__________*Manifest Destiny is the belief or, more likely, the bogus rationale to convince others that some people are directly descended from God (kings, etc.) and therefore more entitled to power, riches, and national expansionism....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Jul 06, 2020","Jul 22, 2020","May 28, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2767.A_People_s_History_of_the_United_States

When I first encounThis “experiment in literary criticism” may not be everybody’s cup of tea, but the humor grew on me until I was laughing out loud. When I first encountered academic, aka “scholarly,” literary writing, I was aghast at the practice of using as many words as possible to say next to nothing while espousing over-analysis that becomes a kind of intellectual masturbation signifying nothing. Now imagine a story by a literary analyst about a person who thinks, analyzes his own thoughts, and expresses them as convolutedly as possible in endless mind streams. When this is done unintentionally, my private editor’s definition of it is “word vomit.” But here it is done with comedic intent and it works. Sometimes well-known and respected literary word vomiters practice their trade by writing analytical introductions to books. This fictional account by such an analyst/critic/vomiter of how a Panamanian clerk came to write a “masterwork of modern Central American poetry” is inventive and, per the book’s blurb, “unclassifiable.” The only thing that would have made it better: since it is essentially a long joke about how a critic can derive true life events of a writer from a poem, I would have loved to have read the poem at the end of the literary treatise; I imagine it to be a page of gibberish with bits of stuff that the literary critic then wildly extrapolated from to form the story he’s just told.Thanks to Goodreader Phyllis for ing this book.

If you love the inner journeyThere is a quiet, contemplative mystery to this book—a journey to remember and fully process the past, and then move on. If you love the inner journey and are happy to live with metaphor, you may really enjoy this beautifully written novel. I certainly did.11/12/20 ThoughtsI finished this book the day before yesterday and I found it coming up in my morning contemplation. That’s a sign of a good book. Morning contemplations are something I’ve always spontaneously done, mostly without even labeling them. They are a time when I sit quietly, usually predawn, and suddenly I realize what I’m thinking about as my thoughts wander, and this leads me to asking myself a question. This morning my question had to do with what I and my life would be like if I shed my worry and sometimes sense of overwhelm. And this led to thinking about the protagonist in Aimee Bender’s The Butterfly Lampshade, Francie.Francie has a tumultuous upbringing with a crazy mother. But this morning I realized there is something heroic about the way she deals with all the residual mess of that. Rather than foist it on other people, she acknowledges her dark thoughts and dangerous impulses, and does what she can to protect others from them. Juxtaposed with the violence inside her, her actions of taking on an honest inner journey are heroic. Perhaps only people who have grappled with impulses they may be ashamed or frightened of may recognize this heroism. Francie’s naked admission about all her worst impulses give this book an authenticity that I value and would hold up as a model to any author who writes slickly. There is nothing slick here. No false truths, no manipulated transitions. And how Francie comes to a quiet ending of the mysteries of herself is also heroic. No trumpets blare, nobody but Francie even understands where she has been and therefore where she has journeyed to.On contemplating this book, I find myself admiring it even more. Hence, I’m changing my rating to 5 stars.

The first part, dwelling on writer and relationship problems, made me feel like the jaded old writer/editor that I am who's very tired when a writer in her thirties describes herself as ""old""—which this protagonist does: ""Our waitstaff isn't young. We're mostly in our late twenties and thirties . . ."" (which strikes me as weird since the author is 57; although people in their thirties do hallucinate that they're old, so obviously this is my problem). The material in the first third of this book is so familiar and, in a way, everything I've avoided by choosing the idiosyncratic route of a writer who never talks about work in progress, did not attend grad school, has eschewed writers' workshops and their veiled brutality, and is bored to tears by the rivalries between post-grads who are dying to publish. (Honestly, I prefer the company of readers.) And I'm w-a-a-y past frustrated romantic passions for womanizing, confused bad boys; they, too, make me tired.However this is a really good book—my favorite scenes, and the ones that made this a pleasurable 4-stars, were the waitressing ones in the restaurant where Casey works, and everything that follows an absolutely fantastic birthday scene in the second half of the book. This shift brings it out of the post-grad-school morass. Even the writer stuff (revisions, agent queries) is grownup and therefore not groan inspiring. The very end is unbelievable—everything from somebody who has walked a dog for months not knowing the animal's gender, to going from panic attacks and unemployment to sudden over-the-moon success in both a day job and publishing.

But whatever the I don’t remember whose  made me put this crime novel on my to-read list or what prompted me to then reserve it at the library. But whatever the impetus, I probably chose it because I’ve been wanting good books with compelling stories that will sweep me out of the present political tumult. This did. But it also was upsetting in a way that I guess crime novel aficionados love. The problem for me is that I really dislike being afraid and at a certain point feel sick from being around psychopaths and sociopaths. What made this tale about a search for a serial killer more bearable is the structure (which I will not divulge, as that would be a spoiler) and that parts of the book are written in the style of true crime journalism, with a journalist’s perspective. Those sections gave me the distance and endurance to handle the deeply disturbing parts. And the fact that I found a twist near the end hokey and unbelievable was actually a relief from the previous upset I’d felt, allowing me to read the few pages to the end in relative comfort, just to see what happened.There was a time in my life when I read two books about Ted Bundy because I got it into my head that if I could understand such a person, I could make sense of all the insane men I’d dealt with in my past. What I learned is that some people are just without conscience and driven only by the perverse arousal they get from hurting others. Or, as explained in a quote I decades ago clipped from a newspaper interview with Mia Farrow: “There is a way in which I have come to see evil. A person relinquishes parts of himself, retains one fragment of his total humanity. The cleverest can represent that fragment as the whole person. The people around him don’t realize he is not accountable in the same way others are, that he doesn’t experience himself in the same way. There is an emptiness that can give place to anything, that permits behavior unacceptable and unthinkable to others.”Since I’ve already learned this, I doubt I’ll read another book about such people. Just too upsetting for my taste, but this is definitely a gripping story.One complaint from my editor’s head: There are grammatical mistakes that are so obvious it’s hard to understand how they made it through an editor and a proofer’s hands and into print—several instances of “her” used as a subject—as in “Her and the man went . . .” Huh?...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Feb 11, 2021","Feb 14, 2021","May 08, 2020",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/51045314-the-nothing-man

I was immediately tA year or so ago, I commented on a friend's Facebook post that the political event she had written about had felt to me like 9/11. I was immediately taken to task by one of the other commenters (a guy in California), chastising me for saying that a political event could possibly have the gravitas of 3,000 people being killed. In an explosion of self-righteous moral outrage, I railed at the guy not to assume he knew my experiences—declaring that I had lived 9/11 up close: I was here. It was my life. On the one-year anniversary, I was working in an office that looked directly over Ground Zero, and I, along with everybody I worked with, was in a constant state of overreaction and fear at the sound of a car backfiring. I could go on, but you get the point: for me, 9/11 was personal history and I claim the right to say something else felt the same.I love that Erik Larson begins this book by recognizing the difference between firsthand experience of 9/11 and the feelings of people who saw it from a distance. This acknowledgement not only feels good in its recognition of truth, but it is the perfect way to set up what follows: a narrative about Churchill at the beginning of World War II that does as good a job as any of us historical voyeurs could want to understand what it felt like, and, in getting an almost visceral experience, becoming wiser. It was so good in conveying the personal experience of living through blackouts and bombings—via every source available, including a government program of ""Mass-Observation diarists""—that I found myself living an even bigger picture than this book. For me it evoked recollections of scenes and feelings from many books about events of that time—far too many to recall or even credit, but just a few were: the experiences of the French underground resistance in Jacques Lusseyran’s And There Was Light, Sarah Blake's The Postmistress, several essays in E. B. White's One Man's Meat, and Jessica Francis Kane's The Report.I don't know if Larson intended this, but of particular interest—and emotional impact on me—is America's initial isolationist resistance to supporting Britain's effort to stop Hitler. It reprises Larson's prologue acknowledgment of our limited ability to understand the gravity of something without firsthand experience. And because it isn't as real to us as it is to people who are living it, we also can deny its eventual impact on us. However, denial of reality and consequences is more comprehensible for a continent an ocean away than what is detailed in a chapter called ""Snakehips"" (the name of an entertainer): the bizarre behavior of young Londoners partying as one of the worst nights of bombing and killing took place. ""Oh it was so gay our party . . . and suddenly it all seemed wrong & a mockery, (387)"" wrote Churchill's daughter Mary in her diary. People were sliced into bits in the nightclub where they'd intended to gather after their debutante dance, and, after realizing what had happened, the gang of party folk simply headed elsewhere to dance, laugh, and joke until 6:30 a.m. the next day. Refusal to change or alter behavior via denial and delusion is apparently one of our species' most potent driving forces. Or else it is something else: ""If one could really completely imagine the full horror of the struggle all the time—,"" writes Mary after devastating news in the Balkins, ""I suppose life would be unsupportable. As it is, moments of realization are bad enough.

It’s just that so few writers have written full women who dealt with their inner yearnings during that time in this country.

This book, originally published in Hungarian in 1933, exposes people's ids and egos in the most ingenious way. Although it takes place in vignettes throughout the 1890s and beyond, one might easily plug in today's selfie-obsessed people's Facebook furies and there were so many stories that personally resonated for me, making me laugh, groan, and finally sigh with pleasure.The satire is sharp (ranging from material that requires historical knowledge of Hungarian and German literati that I lack, to targets that are freakishly appropriate for our current politics) and the writing is gorgeous. Also, the self-contained vignette chapters (some much better than others) lend themselves to the kind of interrupted reading sessions I did; once you know who (or what) Kornél Esti is, you will be informed enough to pick up reading anywhere in the book. Since I was negotiating a sick dog and learning to use an iPad, which made my hair follicles hurt, I abandoned the book for days at a time, so I particularly enjoyed its style.One complaint: I always prefer paper books to e-books, but you may do better with an e-book.

And usually my answer is some version of ""To be useful, being who I am.""I am not Melinda Gates, but being who I am—a person who reads and gives her opinions about books—my most useful function here would be to say that Melinda Gates has found out who she is and is using every cell of that self to help lift up others—women and men. And to that end, she has written a wonderful book. Yes, it's about working for women's equality all over the world, but the nature of women's equality is that it is synonymous with everyone's equality. And peace. Now, being who I am, I know enough to hand the microphone over to Ms. Gates who says:""I think male dominance is harmful to society because any dominance is harmful: It means society is governed by a false hierarchy where power and opportunity are awarded according to gender, age, wealth, and privilege—not according to skill, effort, talent, or accomplishments. When a culture of dominance is broken, it activates power in all of us. So the goal for me is not the rise of women and the fall of man. It is the rise of both women and men from a struggle for dominance to a state of partnership. (149)"""". . . sometimes all that's needed to lift women up is to stop pulling them down. (2)"""". . . when women get information, tools, funding, and a sense of our power, women lift off and take the group where they want it to go. (25)""""Countries that are dominated by men suffer not only because they don't use the talent of their women but because they are run by men who have a need to exclude. (26)""""The challenge of delivery [of help] reveals the causes of poverty. You learn why people are poor. You don't have to guess what the barriers are. As soon as you try to deliver help, you run into them. (49)"" [Contemplate then the correlation and effect of making all kinds of services—i.e., family planning healthcare—unavailable by moving it out of a community where people lack the funds to travel to where it is.]""Overcoming the need to create outsiders is our greatest challenge as human beings. It is the key to ending deep inequality. We stigmatize and send to the margins people who trigger in us the feelings we want to avoid. (52)""""I've come to learn that stigma is always an effort to suppress someone's voice. It forces people to hide in shame. The best way to fight back is to speak up—to say openly the very thing that others stigmatize. It's a direct attack on the self-censorship that stigma needs to survive. (79)""""An abusive culture, to me, is any culture that needs to single out and exclude a group. It's always a less productive culture because the organization's energy is diverted from lifting people up to keeping people down. It's like an autoimmune disease, where the body sees its own organs as threats and begins attacking them. (221)""""When people see the effects of poor nurture and call it nature, they discourage the training of women for key positions, and that strengthens the view that the disparity is due to biology. What makes the biology assertion so insidious is that it sabotages the development of women, and it relieves men of any responsibility for examining their motives and practices. That's how gender bias 'plants the evidence' that leads some people to see the effects of their own bias and call it biology. And that perpetuates a culture that women don't want to join. (222)""""Gender and racial diversity is essential for a healthy society. When one group marginalizes others and decides on its own what will be pursued and prioritized, its decisions will reflect its values, its mindsets, and its blind spots. (225)"" [This is followed by absolutely harrowing facts about computer code that is written by predominantly white people, thereby codifying bias because it programs all AI to not recognize faces of people who look different—this has ramifications in every area of life and, if it weren't true, it would make a great dystopian horror film.][In talking about how a violence prevention program to protect sex workers in India worked,] ""Ashok Alexander, then head of our India office, put it bluntly, 'Every man who's a bully is scared of a group of women.'""""Many successful social movements are driven by the same combination—strong activism and the ability to take pain without passing it on.

Some very imaginative and unlikely things happen, but I suspended my disbelief and was happy to do so. But at around page 200, she lost me: Years of plot are truncated into quick narrative, and emotionally it felt as if she fudged a huge transition. For me, no matter how many jobs are recounted in the truncated narrative, Wash's voice change felt abrupt and unreal. Suddenly he goes from a frightened escaped slave child (age eleven to thirteen) to an intellectual sixteen- to eighteen-year-old, who sounds like an older English gentleman who embodies the benefits of a full science education, knowledge of zoological nomenclature, and the wherewithal to describe a man lying on a blanket ""like a Roman senator"" and claim he has ""always longed"" to learn glassblowing—even though he could not read the library books whose illustrations he's studied from age thirteen to eighteen and he's had nobody to fill in the facts (everything from a famous author's name to the most esoteric scientific terms). No set-up, no explanation for this leap of voice. Had Edugyan woven it in, in any form, I might well have accepted it and maintained my suspension of disbelief because I so admire her imagination, which up until this point had stayed grounded. But she didn't and I couldn't. And the implausibility took the wind out of the book's sails.Nevertheless, I did finish. To do this, I had to accept the voice change, also a weird sense of time (Wash's voice turns so mature that by the end of the book, one senses decades have gone by, although only seven years have passed), mourn the loss of a transition as well as many apparent glitches in the timeline of this second half, and admire the writing that was there.This was a book club read and I'll be curious to hear comments from the other members.3/1/20--Day-after finishing updateMy day-after annoyance is a testament to how good and, in so many ways, intelligent the writing of this book is. It's so good that I am stuck in my editor's head. And that annoys me even more because nobody is paying me!I am pondering editorial fixes that will go nowhere, so for my own relief, I'm putting them here: The whole last part of this book could so easily have been justified if Wash had been a full-prodigy as an eleven-year-old slave. As written, he is a drawing prodigy who is also good with calculations. But he can't read and doesn't even deal with that until he is eighteen and fully educated. Why keep him illiterate? Simply make him a sponge, who at eleven, not only draws but instantly learns to read and then takes that and runs--reading all of his teacher's texts and every book he can get his hands on thereafter. Such people exist. I taught my brother to read when I was six and he was three, and he learned in an afternoon and promptly read every volume of the Encyclopedia Americana in the following months.There is no rationale for keeping this kid illiterate in the early part of the book!Phew.

After reading, in fairly quick succession, three of Carol Shields's books (The Stone Diaries, The Box Garden, and this book), I wonder if her story is about a search for genuine internal kindness and compassion—as opposed to the stuff we feign or aspire to, knowing that we secretly have the opposite feelings. But to reduce Shields's work to that one theme seems unfair. She writes with such muscle, weaving a concern for philosophical and sociological issues into her stories. In Unless, a writer named Reta Winters grapples with a woman's place in literature and in life as she agonizes over her eldest daughter's retreat from family and participation in life by becoming a mute beggar wearing a cardboard sign on her chest, ""a single word printed in black marker—GOODNESS,"" as she sits on a street corner in Toronto. How does Shields manage coherence? Somehow she intertwines palpable warmth in her descriptions of family, marriage, and home; along with long passages about women's invisibility or miniaturization in literature; along with her protagonist Reta Winters's notes about the light fiction she is writing (talk about images within images: writer Carol Shields writes a writer who is writing a writer who is writing!); along with a mother's understanding of her daughter's pain and her own desperation for the well-being of all three of her children.

She is, to my taste, sublime.I only recently discovered Shields when a Goodreads friend ed her Pulitzer-winning The Stone Diaries which I read with incredulity that I had never heard of this writer. Maybe I’m just narrowly informed, but perhaps a lot of people are because a huge prize for a book by a female writer was just established under her name. Per the New York Times announcement:  Canadian novelist Susan Swan looked into the research about how female writers compared with male ones when it came to literary prizes and coverage. She was shocked by what she found.“I thought it was going to be a happy progress report,” she said in an interview. “Instead it was a bad news day.”Books written by women were less likely to be ed or win the most prominent book awards, Swan said. Some of those numbers have shifted in recent years. VIDA: Women in Literary Arts, a group that tracks the gender imbalance in major publications, reported gains for female writers at several of them in 2018, and writers such as Bernardine Evaristo, Margaret Atwood, Susan Choi and Sarah M. Broom took home several of the highest-profile book awards last year.But Swan teamed up with a friend who works in book publishing, Janice Zawerbny, in an effort to continue to level the playing field. The result is a new annual prize, the Carol Shields Prize for Fiction, which starting in 2022 will award 150,000 Canadian dollars, about $113,000, for a work of fiction published in the previous year by a woman or nonbinary person.I hope Carol Shields is smiling in spirit.

Yellow Earth's ""pool"" is oil-digging (specifically fracking) country on a state-sized Three Nations Indian reservation in North Dakota, and you quickly realize one swan dive will not suffice because locales jump from place to place, all full of crowds of people with names and backgrounds and friends and acquaintances who all seem to know one another, along with long histories about which the reader knows nothing.I've known John Sayles since college, and reading this book reminds me of the parties that he and his partner, Maggie, used to host in ""the early days"" in Hoboken, NJ. I was a somewhat tangential part of their crowd because I'd been in John's first two movies and hung out with him a lot, but I knew hardly anybody when I dove into these parties. And for a shy person, I had a terrific time. I liked John and it turned out I liked people he liked. And reading this book reminded me that that's all that's required to enjoy one of his books. You can get overwhelmed thinking you have to learn everybody's name (and, forget it, you won't). And if you decide to feel like an outsider because you don't know all the background history of people who seem to know each other so well, you can do that. But it's much more interesting to dive for the experience—dive/read as a curious explorer. Just meet everyone. See who you like. And after a while, like hanging out with people who speak their own language, you pick it up.It took me about a hundred pages to hear the music. Or maybe the writing changed for a bit in the second section, titled ""Stimulation,"" which is just that. The opening history of beaver murders had me almost screaming with anguish, and this was followed by a description of oil drilling, a cascade of words whose meaning didn't matter so much as their symphonic effect and I found myself swept away by the rhythms, internal rhyming, and alliteration, none of which was self-conscious, just natural poetry that could sweep an audience away (if you are an audiobook listener, this stuff is for you). Subsequently, I sometimes got lost in the ever-jumping scenes, each so fully fleshed out that they become their own little worlds with their own language, forming a jigsaw puzzle that gradually reveals an epic picture (rather than linear story with a protagonist, etc.) about greed, exploitation, and white men's out-of-control relentless hunting—be it for animals or oil or a skewed male notion of power.The book grows on you, and I think it will appeal to people who like big pictures full of substance. And it may be a kind of catnip for experience junkies, since every scene has its own deeply researched action—from fracking to pole dancing to card and video gaming to field biology observation and extreme fighting. I am neither of those people. However, John Sayles immerses himself in every single world he visits and is interested in everything and everyone. And if you just go where he takes you, his unexpected love at the end of this book makes you tingle all over.

And I believed that, constitutionally, I am not the audience for this because I get impatient with this level of privileged, civilized, nonviolent game playing and want to yell, ""Why are you wasting your precious time here? You've got education, money, health, and an ability to at least try to find out why you're stuck in this level of nonsense. Do something about it, get out, or quit your belly-aching."" And then came the story ""Plumber."" Everything that the previous stories lacked—soul, wise perspective, and sadness—permeated that story. So I attempted to shut off my inner judge and read on.I did get bored again during some of the game-playing stories that followed, so I broke my practice of reading only one book at a time and switched off to several other books and then came back. This seemed to expand my tolerance for Updike's chosen people—people with no real-life survival problems or need for jobs they must show up at, people who can move about and live wherever they please, people who have no problem finding sex partners and constantly do, or get depressed, convinced that their problems are their partner or lack of partner, rather than face loneliness and, in that, whatever deep, dark, nasty stuff they are secreting from themselves about themselves. For me, this feels shallow and pointlessly relentless. But I similarly get burned out listening to friends who are perpetually convinced that the answer to their problems is something outside themselves and shun all suggestions that they might look in a different direction, and if they can't, perhaps they are addicted to their misery.

I'm not young or hip or Black; I don't know any of the current young, Black, hip lingo; and I've never been a yuppie or a young white mother with young mother friends and interests, but none of that inhibited me from enjoying this wonderful book about people from these groups and identifying with everyone—especially the person who happened to be a 25-year-old Black babysitter, a fact which I am not going to explain and which made for an intense reading experience. All you need for this experience is to speak the language of human nuance, to value observation, and to understand misunderstandings and how things escalate to a point where there is no way to repair them and, and, and … We all screw up, we all hurt each other, everybody's wrong and right, and mix that into a culture of racism, and oh, it's ""Such a Fun Age"" (perfect title) we live in.I loved babysitter Emira's love for her young charge, 3-year-old Briar; it was so real I felt as if I were in the room with them.

Putnam's Sons), and I now have a serious writer's crush on this editor. I doubt she would ever be interested in my work because it doesn't have the popular fiction je ne sais quoi that she specializes in. But I will read anything she puts her magic touch to, because from the three books I've now read (including John Kenney's Truth in Advertising and Steven Rowley's The Editor), I recognize her touch: all these books are made like a finely crafted beautiful wood box held together not with hardware, but by perfectly shaped pieces that fit flush in such a way that the box is locked in its shape with no need for even glue. What I'm trying to say is that Kim's books all exhibit craftsmanship that makes my writer's mouth water. And, from Kiley Reid's acknowledgements, I suspect she appreciates how lucky she is to have been accepted: ""You're the one!"" she writes to Kim. ""It was you all along!

Whether Jess Walter is writing an aging Indian, a stripper, a mining magnate, a hit man, or a feminist activist suffragist who suffers from ""first-degree aggravated empathy,"" character is pitch perfect. The novel is a rollicking ride through the kind of demonstration and uprising that characterize every event when people reach their limit, fed up with being ""scurrying . . . ants at the feet of a few rich men"" and can no longer tolerate the hypocrisy in the American promise of equality and liberty for all. The story takes us into the bull's eye moment when ""the cold millions""—those who can barely make do—demand to be allowed to benefit from the fruits of their labor.The structure of this unpredictable epic is completely different from Walter's other works: first-person chapters that sparkle with character and sometimes laugh-out-loud humor or oofs of shock punctuate the third-person plot.

I push the deformed into my dreams, which are in Chinese, the language of impossible stories. Before we can leave our parents, they stuff our heads like the suitcases which they jam-pack with homemade underwear. (87)I understand why this book is listed as both fiction and a memoir. Maxine Hong Kingston weaves a personal memoir with shamanic/indigenous stories—the kind of tales you read in creation myths and ancestral indigenous stories transferred orally from generation to generation. It took me a little while to shift my Western mind to one that is open to the language of dreams, but once I did, I found this brutally compelling. Through it I think I have more understanding of Chinese and Chinese American women I have known . . . as well as a conviction that I'm lucky not to have been born into their culture—in any era—as I would have been a complete failure and probably suffered an early death. I had to put this book down a lot because it was so painful.

I am simply not a glutton for this kind of pain. The book is divided into five stories, and the fourth, ""At the Western Palace,"" was so relentlessly harsh and realistic, conveying the strain and clash of Chinese vs. American and Chinese American conditioning that finishing was an act of will.

(288) No explanation necessary. If this quotation strikes a note for you, you might be interested in this book.I don't usually like science fiction. The minute 20-somethings discover aliens, I generally turn off and judge the material as adolescent. So if a few trusted Goodreads friends hadn't enjoyed this book, I probably would have left it alone. I'm glad I read it.The writing here is good, the story is a little slick but also sweet, and the more it progresses, the more you realize it's really about something—something timely with a wise and analytical perspective. But the reason I initially stuck with the book and was truly interested had to do with tangential things: I am a person who is constantly trying to understand our ever-evolving human herd—why we do what we do, how we can evolve, how it all works. And author Hank Green appears to be a star at working the system. He is a social media celebrity who drives the culture like a sports car. He's written characters who charmingly learn to negotiate the culture to get what they want. And in the process, he's provided a course to anyone who wants it about how today's culture works. And I'm interested in that. He understands ""branding,"" fame, how to drive the herd—all the things I'm really bad at. So I decided to read this book like a student.In every generation there are people who seem at one with the zeitgeist of their time, who understand the system they are in and are really good at learning how to work it. So what's important here is not the age of the characters, but that the writer is one of these insightful people in his generation in the current age of online everything and he's willing to share the mechanics. For those reasons, this story about a few college friends who discover an alien, get famous, and, well, deal with it was instructive and entertaining to me—a person whose herd position in any generation would be on the outer edge, always marveling....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Aug 13, 2020","Aug 17, 2020","Jan 10, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/24233708-an-absolutely-remarkable-thing

Despite its subject, it was news and research-based at its core. Readers liked this, but often we would get pitches from New Age writers who couldn't understand the importance of science, verification, and credentials. It was my job to gently explain that although I understood that people had powerful personal experiences, for us to publish a ""fact"" story, the writer and/or material had to have had some kind of vetting.I cannot imagine a better writer than Dawn Baumann Brunke for material that might otherwise fall into the ""woo-woo"" category for many readers. She is not only a deep dreamer with apparently 20/20 vision for details that she remembers, but she is a skeptical analyst of all things and a researcher who understands that history matters—that everything, including dream images, has history that informs meaning. And it helps that she is also an elegant writer who knows how to tell a story.Who better to write about one of the most potent and controversial animals—snake? Snake is worshipped and loathed. It is embedded in our stories and architecture and reflected in our DNA. There is even a named phobia (ophidiophobia) because fear of snakes is common among our species.This generously illustrated book is so full—from history, art, myth, and science, to personal stories of owning and feeding snakes, to understanding why our feelings about the iconic snake (in body and in image) are indicative of the sharp divides in today's culture, how these divides came to be, and what we might do to accept the synthesis of opposites offered by one of the most ancient symbols of healing, protection, and oneness.This is a book for anybody who practices yoga and wants to know more about the power at the base of their spine, or anyone who is simply curious about the inherent wisdom we all hide that may allow us the means to survive our present divide.This is nonfiction that can serve as a source for writers who work in magical realism or myth, Jungian therapists, and anybody who is excited by metaphor and introspective contemplation.Although I don't suffer from ophidiophobia, I once almost had a heart attack upon repotting a (fittingly) snake plant to give it as a gift, only to witness a long, wriggling animal on my New York City apartment floor—a garter snake-size earthworm who'd probably been transferred from the plant store's composter. After participating in (I'll explain that in a moment) and reading Dawn's book and becoming comfortably familiar with her snakes, Chloe and Carl, I can now imagine holding them. And although I don't want a snake in my apartment, by the end of the book, I felt not only respect but love for them. So perhaps this is a book for anyone who has serious fear that they want to get over.Full disclosure: Dawn Baumann Brunke is my friend. Although she lives in Alaska and I live in New York City, with only one in-person visit and almost daily emails, we have become close friends, so I was virtually ""with"" her as she wrote this book, and we had many discussions about the topic. Some of the personal stories I shared with her are in this book. I had a lot of questions about the ethics of one animal (us) feeding another live animal (mice) to a snake, and on reading our discussion in the now-published book, I went through understanding, acceptance, and a deep sadness all over again. Snakes swallow whole animals, which seems almost impossible. But in her contemplation, Dawn sees a metaphor: by taking in something much larger than we are, we grow, we transform. Reading the printed words, even though I originally said some of them, was a profound and helpful experience. So, like Snake, I'm going to digest this whole large book over the course of many days.For more information, see the terrific book trailer and see the book's page on Dawn's website.[Thanks to Inner Traditions Bear & Company for the advanced reading copy.]...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Jan 13, 2020","Jan 17, 2020","Jan 07, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/44321376-awakening-the-ancient-power-of-snake

However because I've read and gloried in her amazing skill in her later much more literary works, and because my introduction was her phenomenal memoir I Am, I Am, I Am which provided me knowledge about her real life that made me guess some of the plot for this earlier book, I think from now on I will go forward reading her new works only. (She has a historical fiction novel coming out in March, Hamnet, and I can't wait.)The Distance Between Us is episodic commercial romantic drama. Whereas her later books are tightly constructed as organic, seamless tour de force literary jigsaw puzzle scenes, jumping time and characters, the same technique used in this less mature book feels frustrating. Scenes build steam and then we cut to another time and place, requiring reader readjustment. I dealt with this by stopping between scenes—much the way you would watch an episodic television series over the course of a season. The characters and plot are compelling enough to remember from scene to later scene, but the facility with amazing transitions that marks her later books is not there yet.Don't get me wrong.

So for 2019 I've decided to mark the year's end of book reading by listing the books I read this year for second or fourth times—books that expand with each reading, books that hit me anew, books that change as I do through the natural evolution of understanding.Because my book club chose several books I'd already read, I had the opportunity to read several more books second times, but I didn't; rather, I went on my memory of what I'd read for our discussions, and that seemed to suffice.But the three books I reread seemed to choose me, beckoning to dive deeper into them, below the surfaces, and discover new insights in them and myself.Waiting for Bojangles by Olivier Bourdeaut, which I bought after reading a library copy.

The first time, I was blown away, even as I was actively studying the writing—the narrative movement. The second time, I found myself struggling to understand the architecture of the protagonist's house because this had been a problem I'd assumed was my reading deficiency the first time. After the fact, I learned from a Goodreader that English houses' floors are differently distinguished than American, which cleared all my confusion. So I would like to read this once more while seeing the house properly, leaving me open to more discovery about the writing.

In Lowell Lake, author L. J. Davis has created the quintessential nebbish protagonist. Lowell Lake is a person who seems to have dropped into life in a human body with no idea what to do with it or how to navigate the terrain. The reading experience is equally hilarious and horrible, and ultimately depressing. Lowell's work and marriage are hilarious, and his decision to buy and gentrify a slumlord's rooming house in 1960s Brooklyn, removing the present tenants—""the Negroes""—was horrifying and finally stultifying. Reading this section was like enduring a low-grade electrical shock. Davis's genius is that he managed to write a white nebbish's perceptions of stereotypical black people without stereotyping anybody. And therefore he pokes at the systemic racism that is the norm for white people in our society. And it is uncomfortable—uncomfortable for this white person to have it exposed and be forced to acknowledge that it is there, despite all my desire that it not be. Lowell is a WASP from Boise, Idaho, who marries a ""nice Jewish girl"" from Flatbush, Brooklyn, so there is similar poking about anti-Semitic attitudes. But since I am a member of the Semite tribe, I did not experience any poking. I just laughed. (I'd wondered how black readers would relate to the gentrification content, and my hope is that they would nod and find it as funny as I did the anti-Semitic material.)I loved reading about my hometown, New York City, in the 1960s. This is a quintessential New York book, a writer's book, and a book for anyone who can laugh at being poked and exposed. But its hopeless ending felt heavy and tired.A note about typos:There are a lot of them in the Kindle edition--straight typos as well as formatting glitches where sentences are interrupted by paragraph breaks.

Reading Percival Everett, and this new novel in particular, is like entering the territory where all life comes from. I had such a hit of this when I first began the book that I literally passed out. In yoga there are names for this. Suffice it to say that it’s when your consciousness is overwhelmed, stretched beyond its normal capacity.

Per this New York Times  article, there are three different versions of this book. Before reading this one, like other diehard fans, I was ready to go on a quest, campaigning a bookstore to campaign its distributor to search for the three different covers, ensuring I get a copy of the other two. But having read this one (the difference is detectable in the direction of the compass on the top right of the cover; I have the one that points northeast), I cannot imagine a more perfect book, and I don't think I want to read another version.Three years ago, I first met Percival Everett through his last published, So Much Blue, and my brief  equally applies to Telephone. In the interim between So Much Blue and this new book, I have read 18 of his 30 books, so I feel as if I know the man. And I love him.Creative Capital supported this 3-book project and just published a wonderful interview with Everett. I love and, as a writer, share his respect for readers. And because of the enormity of my experience reading this book, my sense is that the book I received is very personally the one I was meant to read.However, I would love to read s of the other versions and maybe have a group talk about them.

That is an odd thing to say about a detailed, convoluted, complicated, deeply sourced tale of the reporting and publishing of a story about now-convicted rapist Harvey Weinstein, one of the most powerful people in the entertainment industry. What makes this book so readable is Ronan Farrow's voice, which expresses the personality of somebody who could be my friend, or anybody's friend. It is a voice that is transparent and direct about who he is—his privilege, ego drives, fear, and conscious choices to risk sacrifice—always aware that it was nothing close to what the victims of Weinstein risked, sacrificed, and continue to suffer for coming forward.The fact that Weinstein, as of yesterday, is convicted, will not end these sacrifices. There are women who will forever be defined by what happened to them, women who lost careers they loved, women who will never be without the scars of trauma.Farrow, on the other hand, risked a job he loved, exposing people at NBC whose favor he wanted, and his physical safety. But his risks and public exposure once again of his family problems are cushioned with a famous name that opens doors, money, friends who care for him and supply him with a place to live when he's in danger and plenty of love and support. He is never not aware of these things. I'm saying this because it's what I observed. He doesn't heavy-handedly profess all this with the kind of pseudo-liberal ""woke"" male guilt that I loathe. He simply puts the facts in the book. Boy, is that refreshing.Our culture is veined with sexism and well-supported predation. This book exposes the intricacy of the defenses, but I hope other readers will take this for what it is—one story that is the tip of the nose of a mammoth-size all-pervasive monster. It is easy to self-righteously be angry on social media on issues with clearly marked sides. It is a whole lot more complicated to battle where nobody has fought before. For instance, to proclaim the dishonesty of a person who is beloved by many, to slay a hero or a disguised villain, where signing onto the battle will require others to put their livelihoods at risk, feel betrayed by people they have respected, admit they were wrong. Yes, perhaps it is easier for somebody with Ronan Farrow's connections to take on this truth-telling. But he is a great gate-opener for anybody who wants to contemplate what they would do, what they would risk, what they would sacrifice for the greater good. Ronan Farrow was the perfect person for this job, and he passed all his tests with flying colors!P.S. I had hoped for the public evisceration of the whole monster once Jeffrey Epstein was arrested. It seems now that that will not happen.

A very different book than Rules for Visiting, yet it shares a motif: both books are essentially reports. The events play out, they are reported, the facts accrue into a story. And the art of this writing makes them into an experience that is hard to explain. But let me try.The cover of The Report (designed by Kyle G. Hunter) gives a metaphor for what happened to me as a reader, but for the longest time I didn’t even notice it: The picture is a dark AP photo. Whether it is of the actual incident of people in an underground bomb shelter in the East End of London (Bethnal Green) during WWII doesn’t matter. It is what I envisioned. But so subtle that you don’t even see it unless the cover happens to be tilted up so the light hits it in just the right way is typeface superimposed onto the photo—the report of this incident. That is a perfect depiction of Kane’s style. There is nothing flashy, no sentences you can quote to illustrate poetic beauty, no obvious “writer’s technique.” Nevertheless, the writing enters your psyche, commanding that you slow down and see and feel every detail; I swear my heartbeat synced with something larger that I surmise directs Kane’s writing. Likewise the elegance—a meticulous elegance to every word and sentence—is so understated you might miss it.I am obsessed with the responsibility of people in crowds and crowd movements, so I love the content of this book. And I love this writing!...more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Oct 25, 2019","Oct 30, 2019","Oct 20, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7897402-the-report

It started as the story of poor Dr. Toby Fleishman in a crummy marriage that he wishes were normal. And then changes into something else entirely. But I’ll get to that after my one beef:Halfway through, I got thrown into editor-head by the structural problems of reiterating history in Parts One and Two. The writing has so much energy that I could see how an editor might let this slide: it’s not dull, there’s humor, and a revision to put basic background all in one place and then leak/weave out subsequent events without repeating facts—to improve the dramatic arc—would be a tedious undertaking, but I wish Brodesser-Akner had done it. The funny stuff would have been funnier and the whole book would have had an added dramatic tension. Now to what I liked:Part Three was a surprise shift of protagonists, and it was then that I realized this is a story about marriage. I’ve never ever wanted to be married. It is simply not in my DNA and maybe part of the reason I get so bored with Women’s Fiction. Which brings me to what I really got a kick out of (in addition to the story, the humor, all the well-written characters and Brodesser-Akner’s depth of understanding about money/class issues and the legacies of family dysfunction):As a writer I find that most Women’s Fiction has a tendency to be emotionally excessive, naming every thought and worry, none of which moves a plot forward and, in my opinion, illustrates but robs the reader of feeling. It tells rather than shows.But in this clever book that starts with a male protagonist, Taffy Brodesser-Akner delights the reader by naming the Women’s Fiction problem and simultaneously her “game” to fix it.The narrator is not the first protagonist, Toby, but Toby’s friend Libby (the third protagonist, as it turns out), a former writer at a men’s magazine. In a brief section that starts on p. 234, she bemoans the fact that female interviewees all tell the same story of struggling with outside forces that want to label and diminish them. “ . . . which is not to say it wasn’t important,” she writes. “But it’s boring. The first time I interviewed a man, I understood we were talking about something more like the soul.” This is because the men hadn’t faced the kind of outside troubles the women had in their careers or lives. But the benefit of that was that “they had found the true stuff of their souls—all of our souls—the wound lying beneath all the survivalism and circumstance.” So they voice their gripes in an unabashed way that reveals their souls—saying things Libby doesn’t feel allowed to say because she’d sound conceited or narcissistic (or in publisher’s parlance, they/she would display the fatal “unlikeable” quality that is unacceptable in Women’s Fiction). And Libby comes to the wonderful conclusion that “ . . . the only way to get someone to listen to a woman [is] to tell her story through a man; Trojan horse yourself into a man, and people will give a shit about you.” Which is exactly what Brodesser-Akner has done in this book! She’s done it brilliantly and managed to write a female narrator who, as a supporting character for Parts One and Two, conveys a man and a woman in their full darkness and light, as both likable and unlikable, and, as in Women’s Fiction, they voice a whole lot of thoughts and worries, but they are never boring!I love it. But I sincerely hope Brodesser-Akner is wrong about having to take the Trojan horse route even briefly. I’m counting on it as a writer of real flawed women who blatantly star in their own stories, making big mistakes, being sometimes unlikable, and fighting for their souls....more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,"Oct 18, 2019","Oct 25, 2019","Sep 17, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41880602-fleishman-is-in-trouble

To have that make any sense, I have to tell you how I eat—which is really to explain what I don't eat, which revelation may elicit mockery. I don't eat sugar, animals, bread, or anything with white flour in it. In addition, I don't love cooking, but oddly I find cooking shows, and particularly Martha Stewart's, with her consonant-popping pronunciation and soothing voice, hypnotic. I've watched Martha dump sugar and fat into everything, waxing poetic about ingredients I would never put into my body; I've listened to her gush about slices of dead animals who I'd rather name than eat. I ignore the content of her cooking and instead enjoy her voice. Occasionally this requires turning off parts of myself.Niall Williams's voice is my perfect meal and requires and invites my whole self. His voice, his writing, his individual words are as rich as something baked in fat and veined with sugar with none of the verboten ingredients. It is so filling that a chapter satiates me instantly and I have to put it aside and savor all the aftertastes—none of which make me sleepy, dull, or drugged, as processed carbs do. Instead, I'm fully awake, reliving the sensation of the words on my tongue and down my gastrointestinal tract. One brogued sentence, winding and twisting and coming full circle back to its subject can start this process for me; it is so compelling that even though once, while reading, I sneezed a carrot into my sinuses, I never paused from the poetry but simply hacked and blew till the offending piece exited a nostril. I'm not a poetry reader, but this kind of poetry fills me, maybe because there's nothing self-conscious about it: Williams is not ""trying to be poetic."" It's just his voice. And plot is almost incidental—as incidental as book ing is to an essay that starts with my eating habits and Martha Stewart's popping ""P""s and takes a tangent into carrot bits in my nose. Perhaps this is best explained by Niall Williams:Once he got going, my grandfather's way of telling a story was to go pell-mell, throwing Aristotle's unities of action, place and time into the air and in a tumult let the details tumble down the stairs of his brain and out his mouth. (210) And, although I admit to often feeling like an impatient six-year-old screaming, ""Just tell me what happens next!"", like a contrite child, I recognize that when the tossing of words and the meandering of tangents is done by a writer as magnificent as Niall Williams, it works. Because. . . Irish music was a language of its own, accommodating expression of ecstasy and rapture and lightness and fun as well as sadness and darkness and loss, and that in its rhythms and repetitions was the trace of history and humanity thereabouts, going round and round.

Her mother goes silent, stunned, then confused, then in tears, responds, You’re right, Iris. . . It’s not yours. (105) And then later in life when Iris is thinking about her baby’s grandmother, CathyMarie (the father’s mother) who once told her to do something with her life, that she had no excuse not to because Nothing’s haunting you., Iris regrets that she hadn’t asked CathyMarie, What haunts you?. However, “By the time she was out of her own head [not thinking of only herself] and old enough to know this is what she wanted to know, CathyMarie had been dead for years.” (114-115)These moments stopped me cold because they illustrated the story of my white life: me and multiple generations willfully rejecting and disowning our own history when we were young, not understanding that it was part of our own DNA—the very redness in our bones. I’ve spent the last decade or so trying to reconstruct my own story, and I found myself jealous that Iris had hers all around her, with people who were more than willing to share it with her. And I felt such admiration for Jacqueline Woodson’s understanding of the importance of the red at our bones and I’m grateful for her ability to tell it, share it, and make it live in all of its complexity and contradictions.My mother was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1921, the year of an attempted genocide of wealthy black people there—a central event of this novel. And I know nothing about my extended family’s place in this history. Did it have anything to do with my mother’s almost visceral rejection of Oklahoma? Oh how I wish I could ask all the questions this novel stirred up. But I can’t.

Only once did a person who’d actually been a source tell me her horror at seeing her private business on stage. O’Farrell surprised me in this book, and I love being surprised. I also loved that she wrote about a writer in such an honest way and that ultimately his artistic use of reality lifted the person who was first so horrified.

The writing was wonderful, but rather than enjoy it, I found myself wanting to ""have read it"" more than I wanted to be reading it. And about three-quarters of the way through, the 1970s writer bemoans the same agony I was feeling:About this time I need some Mister Bones to say to me, ""Doesn't this story have anything in it but hard luck and waiting? Isn't the man ever going to get that ditch dug?"" Then I can reply in summary fashion, and get by this dead time. For it bothers me to wait it out with them. (475)I was more interested in the 1970s writer than the people of the past (who took of up the majority of the story), but the interweaving and transitions between the two stories was so masterful and the writing was so authentic that I couldn't stop reading. And then came the last two chapters. Like the ending to All the Little Live Things, which had conditioned me to trust that Stegner was taking me somewhere, the last two chapters were superb, Shakespearean, worth waiting for. I could barely breathe. They were the reason for this book.PostscriptDo not read the Jackson J. Benson introduction (to the 2000 edition) before reading this novel. I usually don't read introductions because I expect there will be spoilers, but halfway through, when I read a reference to accusations of plagiarism in regard to this book, I made the mistake of reading it. As far as plagiarism is concerned, I'm satisfied with Benson's detailed history of how Wallace Stegner was given permission (in writing) by an heir of illustrator Mary Hallock Foote to use her letters however he wanted, but on condition that he keep the name of the source a secret. He double-checked this before publishing, offered the heir a copy of the fictionalized manuscript for  and the heir declined to read it and again assured him he had carte blanche but must not name sources. After the book was published and won the Pulitzer, and after other family members had formally published Foote's letters, there was a brouhaha about ownership. In my opinion, Stegner kept his promise, used Foote's letters (which were the least interesting thing in this book), fictionalized the plot, and named the source only as initials in a dedication/attribution. And in finding all this out, I ran right smack into a massive spoiler. I hate that!I also hate that there is a controversy still when the man was given explicit permission. This is personal for me, as my mother Edna Robinson, who was my writing partner for two film scripts, left her writing to me. Before I published her novel, The Trouble with the Truth, my agent asked me to produce proof of ownership, which I did. Edna and I had discussed this, and she left it in writing that I own all her work—to use it however I choose. I have since used a revised excerpt of one of her unfinished, unpublished articles in a section of a new novel in which I have also used her protagonist from The Trouble with the Truth in an adult form, created by me. I credit Edna with the birth of this material in an acknowledgement, and if I ever manage to sell this novel, I would hate to have it sullied by people with some kind of political beef I cannot even imagine.Wallace Stegner is a magnificent writer and he wrote this book, using source material that was given to him for that purpose.End of diatribe....more",Notes are private!,0,43,1,"Aug 31, 2019","Sep 09, 2019","Aug 31, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/6571853-angle-of-repose

She self-published it through our local Upper West Side Shakespeare & Co. bookstore’s Print-on-Demand program. It is a book Elle intended for her family and friends, and I only heard about it because we are “neighborhood friends” (I’ll explain that in a moment) with similar theater backgrounds, sensitivities, and dogs we adore.When I got the sweet email from Elle announcing the launch of this book, to be honest, I was happy for her and I congratulated her, but I privately groaned: Oh god, another obligatory book to buy and read and there are so many already on my list that I can’t wait to dive into. Then I dreamed . . . and woke up with one mandate: buy the book! So at 6:30 a.m. on the day after receiving the email, I clicked buy at Shakespeare & Co., the only place to obtain a copy of this exquisite, moving, and very well-written memoir.How to describe this little gem? It is full of love for family and neighborhood friends and experiences that I suspect are quintessentially New Yorkish. I first met Elle on the street, then many times in Central Park with our dogs, and then gradually over years, we talked, shared names, and our mutual writing activities. And like a lot of New Yorkers, Elle has formed such friendships during her whole life here. So there are people in this book from the neighborhood, both identified and unidentified, who I recognize. But even if you don’t live in our neighborhood, you will recognize the love through seemingly random connections. You may recognize the passages of self-reinvention (Elle has a habit of changing her name—yes, the book is sometimes funny), aging, of letting go of parents, or getting to know parents as they exit. You may recognize your own fears and moments of breakthrough, and the whole life journey from rebellious free spirit to something else in later life.What a gorgeous little book....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Aug 08, 2019","Aug 08, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/51049971-lifelines-and-passages

When I lived there it was a tiny village and many of my graduating class of about 70 had known each other since first grade. A guy I’ve stayed in touch with, Doug, picked me up at the train station and proceeded to give me a tour, with such detailed understanding of the architecture, layout, relationships between families, and therefore the history of change that I felt as if I was meeting where I’d lived for the first time. “When did you learn all this?” I asked, astounded. It turned out he’d always seen this way and just kept learning from the time he was a small boy, until now when he is an architect turned city planner. He goes through life with a grid in his head about the relationship between people and landscape that I cannot begin to approach.

It's ""an ability to see the whole ice, to anticipate vectors and angles of incidence and angles of reflection, to know who is where and moving at what speed relative to [you]. (302)"" Weingarten goes on to refer to former basketball player and senator Bill Bradley's book A Sense of Where You Are to explain this particular sensitivity: ""Bradley was never the best pure shooter or the fastest runner or the most tentacled defender, but he rose above most others because he knew who he was and where he was.

I knew this because one of Mr. Jacobi's favorite things to say after he sat down at the piano and leaned on the first chord was, ""We accept here."" That meant that no matter what sound I made, it was fine with both of us.""We accept here."" That could be the philosophy expressed by this wonderful page-turner of a book.

You start understanding what the world is about and how to translate it into photographs. You may become more efficient, more proficient, more educated, more intelligent, more loving. If you’re not moved by what you’re looking at, your pictures will not contain the human response.—Cornell Capa, p. 251I think it was in 1996 or 1997 that I was working as a freelance transcriptionist when I got a series of tapes that changed me. Sitting alone in my room, I was hearing the voices of people who talked about events that I'd learned about in school, and many nobody could ever learn about because they were private knowledge from firsthand experience. These photographers had not only been on the frontlines of WWII, but behind the lines, in the rooms where Roosevelt and Stalin and Churchill sat; in a cave with Tito; on the sidelines as Hitler passed; on board the ship Vincennes when it was sunk in Guadalcanal (photographer Ralph Morse described, in the most matter-of-fact way, how men died right next to him and how “You’re in that other thousand that didn’t get scratched. Why? I don’t know. Your number wasn’t up.”*); with John Steinbeck supplying the back story that turned into The Grapes of Wrath; they had been with movie stars and poor black families that nobody ever heard of. And these were only the batch of audiotapes I transcribed. What about all the other interviews?At the time, the entire collection comprised about half of the still-living original Life magazine** photographers—the first so-called photojournalists. At the time of their interviews, they were in their 80s and 90s and still humble and arrogant and regular people who had found themselves, mostly with no preparation, in extraordinary situations where they not only coped, but thrived. It was not just what they had witnessed that moved me; it was their ordinariness (and, in the case of a couple—Cornell Capa and Gordon Parks—their compassion). I'd listen and type for a while, then find myself lying on my floor sobbing, so overcome with the sound of their voices telling little me, an anonymous NYC transcriptionist, their history through my headphones. Nobody but John Loengard (the interviewer who was also a Life photographer who was tasked with videotaping these picture-taking historians) and his associates had heard this extraordinary material. When I returned my transcripts to my boss at the transcription agency, I was gasping. ""This stuff is unbelievable,"" I told her. ""I can't stop crying."" To which she responded that all the transcriptionists were reporting this reaction.I was so moved that after the assignment was over, I wrote Loengard a fan letter. I just wanted him to know my reaction and that of the others my boss had told me about. He wrote back saying he hoped this reaction would build a case for getting the material out. In 1998, this book of the edited transcripts was published. By then, thirteen of the photographers had died. The videotapes have never been released.Over the years, I've told many people about these interviews and the existing tapes—once imploring a well-known radio producer friend to try to get them broadcast—but nothing has ever happened.This past Memorial Day, a friend posted a history gleaned from a documentary about the storming of Omaha Beach on D-Day—how it was known beforehand that it was a suicide mission. And I recalled hearing something similar in one of the interviews I’d transcribed so many years ago: how the generals knew that for the photographers, the mission was getting onto the beach to photograph the slaughter of our brave men, engendering public support for the war. Did I make that up? Or was it actually in the interviews? It was then that I bought a used first edition of this wonderful book, containing the full set of 44 interviews.***This is firsthand source material that should be of interest to historians and history buffs who want to know what really happened in the 1930s to the 1980s. It is also a book for people who are interested in the nitty-gritty of photojournalism and photography. And it will appeal to anyone who is excited by biographies of people who live big, daring lives.I still wish the videotapes were broadcast. There is nothing like hearing the voices and seeing the people behind them, and I’m sure my love of this book is influenced by the experience of transcribing the voices. I'm so glad this record exists and that I finally got around to reading it.________________*The audiotapes that we transcriptionists worked on were up to three hours long. I may be misremembering, but think a deleted part of the Ralph Morse’s published interview described how just prior to working at Life he was pounding the pavement looking for a job, how in those days you could just drop in at an office, and this is what he did. He got a delivery boy-type job at Life which led to photographing. So, when he described the sinking of the Vincennes, there was the sense that almost the day before he’d been walking the streets of Manhattan looking for a job as a 19-year-old kid. For this reason, I hope historians will one day be able to hear and see the unedited material. **For anyone who is too young to know, Life magazine was a weekly staple of many Americans in the 1950s and 1960s. As a kid, I couldn’t wait to grab our copy and pore over the photo essays—many of which have stayed with me like experiential memories. I confiscated and kept the John F. Kennedy issue—even though I was a shell-shocked thirteen-year-old, I knew this was history that should be preserved.[image]***I was unable to find this story in the edited transcripts, so perhaps I heard or read it somewhere else.

To begin to understand the problems with our health care system (and this is global), you need to understand that doctors have historically been trained by bullying, humiliation, and tactics that are used to torture people (sleep deprivation, water and food deprivation, forced drugging, etc.). And all this is done in an agreed-upon environment of systemic corruption—required lying about work hours is just the tip of the iceberg. This aberrance is considered the norm and even praised as a toughening technique. But, in fact, most of the abuse that is the norm in medical training is against the law, according to our Constitution, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United States Civil Rights Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act. And it is outrageous that there has been, until now, an undocumented suicide epidemic among traumatized, disillusioned doctors. (In 2012 author Pamela Wible, M.D., began documenting it and hosting a free suicide help line for doctors and medical students in crisis.) Large numbers of people taking their own lives has been euphemized as a “burnout” problem, if it is discussed at all.In a profession where one is taught to recognize physical trauma, ironically new doctors and experienced ones who supervise and perpetuate the abuse have never been taught to recognize and compassionately deal with trauma among their own. A key symptom of trauma is “lack of agency”—the inability to do anything to affect one’s situation. Lack of agency leads to suicide as the only resort. Pamela Wible has created a path to agency in this guide full of concrete actions to combat human rights violations in medical training. If you are a doctor, an intern, or a medical student, get this book. If you are a hospital attending who has turned yourself into a zombie or a sadist in order to fulfill your duties, get this book. If you have any such people in your life, you will change their life by a gift of this book. And while you’re at it, glance through it yourself. You may be so floored at what is considered “normal” that you will demand change or at least know what you are dealing with when you visit a hospital. Only when medical professionals are trained in a manner that comports with the care and compassion we demand from them will we begin to heal the world’s health care systems.Why Non-Doctors Should CareThis book is not for lay people like me,* but I care deeply about how doctors are trained. I’ve lost count of the times I’ve realized only after the fact that some expensive procedure I’ve undergone or a recommendation of such a procedure has been unnecessary (once I was even warned off something by an ethical doctor who was appalled by what her boss was suggesting). I’ve lost count of the times I’ve felt like a doctor was on a stopwatch, had no interest in me, and in fact resented whatever time I required. I’ve lost count of the times I’ve dealt with outright gouging of insurance companies as well as insurance companies acting equally unethical. When I was briefly on Medicaid, I went to a dentist whose office was so sloppy and filthy that he had a sign in his waiting room assuring patients that he sterilized his instruments, and even after reading the sign, I sincerely doubted it. There are plenty of people who live in areas where they have no doctor because debt-ridden practitioners are going elsewhere to make money. No government intervention is going to heal what’s happened as a result of institutionalized abuse of medical practitioners, who simultaneously get stuck in a cycle of debt and therefore need to stay the course in a profession that is killing or deadening them in order to pay off education loans. Of course there are good doctors, but finding them is like rolling the dice (and my brief stint on Medicaid taught me that it helps if you can pay top dollar because a lot of them will not take insurance). This is why I care that the problem of human rights violations in medical training is exposed and addressed. If people are not okay, how on earth can they take care of somebody else? And when you are helpless and depending on doctors who cannot care for themselves . . .*The only direct tip for patients is, if you are hospitalized, ask (or have your advocate ask) all doctors who attend to you how long they have been awake. This is a reasonable question, as ""being awake for at least 24 hours is like having a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 percent (beyond the legal limit in the United States).

If you've ever been close with somebody who was or later became famous, but you know how he is in real life, you will be interested in this book. If you've worked with comedians, you will find much to resonate with. And if you've suffered from being a professional wait-er—as in: one who waits for other people to do something so that you can do something—this book is for you.Twenty-nine-year-old world-weary June Bloom loses her TV writers' assistant job when the comedy show, Stay Up with Hugo Best, fires Hugo Best, and she accepts a weekend invitation to his house in tony Greenwich, Connecticut. What makes the story rich is the self-awareness of June and Hugo, and the overall wisdom of author Erin Somers.This is a well-written literary novel about a slick subject, but the author's wisdom makes it anything but slick. I really enjoyed it right up until the preamble to the ending, (view spoiler)[which although realistic—transactional sex with a famous person (and I've known plenty of women who have acted like June Bloom did), made me kind of sick. I could also see a character with June's level of self-awareness, along with a pretty easy childhood (no trauma to twist her up), coming to her senses during a conversation with a fellow unemployed writer from the show about his (the writer's) assumption that she was going to have sex with 68-year-old Hugo for payback. It could have shocked her out of her ""amorphous and existential"" problems, leading to a completely different preamble, where instead of giving the famous Hugo Best a blow job, she ends up comforting him like a mother—marking the beginning of a new level of maturity for her with a man who will never grow up. All the rest could have followed as written, and the protagonist would have experienced a change/growth.

It's familial. The best way I can express it is to say that if The Dutch House and my first novel (Plan Z by Leslie Kove) and my mother's first novel (The Trouble with the Truth) were sisters, The Dutch House would be our middle sibling. This book makes me miss my long-dead mother because I feel as if she should know about it. And I should be able to talk with her about the fact that I read it just after learning that the new new-owners demolished the house my mother built, which always seemed to me like a live being with roots deep in my psyche, even long after we gave it up in 1968. Even though I and my siblings had terrible memories of our life there, during the 48 years that the people we sold it to lived there, we each individually made pilgrimages to visit or just look at the house. And it just seems unfair that now my mother and I cannot mourn the demise of her creation while reading and admiring The Dutch House—while as writers, we marvel at everything from the gorgeous cover art by painter Noah Saterstrom (what a daring artist) to the story about a family and a house, which is so reminiscent yet completely different from both of our work that I have a very hard time believing we are not all related.

And then I'd have some serious questions for him:In the last few decades, I've been being schooled on our real American history of genocide of the Natives, stealing their land, etc. I've read one book after another detailing the legacy of suffering that today's Native peoples are still negotiating. When I read Doris Kearns Goodwin's Team of Rivals, my frustration piqued at yet another big omission vis a vis Natives in American history. Lincoln eschewed the Mexican American war, clearly stating that it was wrong to take land from Mexico and that the war was a land grab. Yet there was nothing about what people had done to create this country and continued to do as the West was taken over by Europeans. In this book, too, there is of course his important stance on slavery. There are pictures of black people and white people next to text about ""the sparkling call for equality and dignity for each person emblazoned in the Declaration of Independence . . ."" yet still no recognition of the ongoing genocide of Natives.

PDF at https://www.justice.gov/storage/repor...][5/31/19 UPDATE: I thought it might be good to add my Facebook post following Mueller's address to the public.When a writer or speaker opens with a very strong message, and then closes with the same, one can be fairly certain that is the point: We were and are being attacked by a foreign power.Isn't it astounding that somebody can write 448 pages detailing that, get up in front of national TV cameras and reiterate it, but what gets discussed is whether or not we should impeach an obstructionist.If we took this attack seriously, what would we do differently? We might never post anything that is most likely sourced to a troll to divide us. We might cease calling one another names, blaming, fueling the national divide. Yes, we can ask our representatives to follow Mueller's directive to investigate further and likely indict once the perp is out of office, but nobody is listening to what Mueller is really warning of because we are all so brainwashed into ""our side of right."" Oh, how I wish people would read his damned report.]Now, my original :Like a good book, this report has a solid structure: each section builds on the previous one, if you contemplate the stated facts.We may think we already know most of the information in this report via the media, but reading the first section account of Russian interference in our elections by affecting our culture is a personal experience unlike hearing news. It is chilling to read about specific Russians masquerading as Americans, setting up organizations and rallies, and sowing lies that bloom and grow exponentially as they are repeated by the likes of Trump et al. as well as millions of ordinary citizens. If you read this blow by blow, you will experience the truth of the words “We were attacked.”Mueller reports facts, but I believe metaphor is the best way to convey the impact of those facts to anyone who doubts we were attacked or to anyone, like me, who accepts that we were attacked (and that it is ongoing), but who hasn’t viscerally connected with what this means:Imagine that alien beings infiltrated all of our communications grids. They became part of our phone conversations, the media we consume, and our culture. Imagine these aliens have studied our American culture and can mimic it, blending in so seamlessly that they can participate in our communities as any local does. They get to know people, learn their vulnerabilities, and craft just the right things to say to trigger their deepest fears and angers, thereby making these Americans unwitting alien surrogates, carrying the carefully crafted messages further into our culture to create maximum conflict (and—my opinion—eventually war, thereby changing the world stage because people will no longer wish for democracy if this is the result). Imagine these aliens infiltrate our voting mechanisms, knowing better than we do how they work and all kinds of statistics about the layout of our electoral college and what kind of pressure and persuasion will work best where.Imagine that these aliens, who have been preparing for this time for many years, are essentially more psychologically sophisticated beings highly focused on a well-researched mission. They have observed us like cells in petri dishes. And after long preparation, they have now visibly manipulated us for motives that have nothing to do with our well-being and everything to do with destroying our standing in the world and thereby all alliances between countries, allowing them to do what they want unchallenged.This is what has been going on and The Mueller Report makes you know and feel it!Following the specifics of the attack is a section on Trump campaign contacts with Russia and Russians. I have no idea how much foreign contact is customary for potential candidates for office, but the enormity and sometimes secrecy of contacts between Trump surrogates, including people like Jared Kushner who had no idea or preparation for what he was doing, and Russian representatives is considerable. I can only assume that the sheer volume of them is yet another manifestation of the stealthy effort to infiltrate, building on the first section of this report—even if Trump did not conspire (offer a quid pro quo for help). Trump’s avarice (for business in Russia as a real estate developer) plus his amorality made him the perfect target, and his media megaphone simply turned the disruptive messages into a high-decibel weapon of mass disruption.Any leader—even one who benefitted from these infiltration actions—should be alarmed for our democracy and our sovereignty. But this is not the case with Trump. I believe Mueller’s conclusion that Trump’s campaign’s actions did not meet the legal definition of conspiracy, although they gratefully received a lot of help that was offered from Russia via WikiLeaks and they even invited it. I accept that indictments against Trump Jr. et al. were precluded because they didn’t know that accepting foreign contributions of stolen documents was unlawful, and ultimately they failed to obtain them. But since the facts of this clear and ongoing attack have come to light, there has been an essential lack of a natural life-preserving patriotic response due to Trump’s need to see himself as a “winner.” Despite the fact that he won the election and holds the office of president, he apparently believes his “win” is so tenuous that he must do anything to kill any reality that makes him appear, in his own eyes, illegitimate. Hence, vol. II of this report—a blow-by-blow record of his obstruction of justice, provable chronic lies, attempted manipulations, attempts to coerce witnesses by promise or intimidation, and attempts to order other people to lie, along with a roadmap for further action left to congress. (I read this section first, then on the entire document read-through, skipped or skimmed most of it because it repeated information I’d read in the media and in Comey’s book. And I did not read the last section, pp. 371-394, which is an analysis of law, obviously directed to lawyers who Mueller is assuming will take further action. I skipped most of the Appendices, except C which are Trump’s answers to questions, which can be summarized as: “I don’t recall.”) This is a riveting read, and not that lengthy because of all the redactions. Also, you can skim those sections in the Russia connection section (e.g., Paul Manafort, although his level of quid pro quo and general amorality is jaw-dropping and sure sounds like conspiracy) and skip or read only headlines and analyses for the matters you’re familiar with from other reading. For me, the real impact came from the details of the attack in the first section.To anybody who criticizes this report without reading it, I say: Please, please, please keep quiet until you’ve read it. And to anybody—right wingers or left—who dismisses it without reading it because it does not find Trump guilty of conspiracy, I say: You are missing the point! This report was done because our country was attacked by a foreign power, and if you take the time to learn the facts, it might prevent you from falling victim to ongoing infiltration and attack.Arguably, America’s most potent export is our culture—via our movies, music, and television. It has made the USA a place that people want to visit or live. It gives hope to people whose freedoms are crushed, and hope used to give the USA a certain standing in the world, no matter our considerable arrogance and flaws. So it doesn’t take brilliance for an adversary to take advantage of our arrogance by supplying zero-sum issues for us to be certain we’re right about and erupt in battle over. Marketing companies are filled with psychology experts who target us with similar tactics to sell product. This is not genius; it is simple psychology and marketing being used, after deep research into the mechanics of our system, to disrupt and destroy our culture, dividing people to conquer them. Thus far, Putin has probably been victorious beyond his wildest dreams. (In one of the most intriguing largely redacted exchanges on page 149, an unnamed probably Russian person emails a Russian oligarch just after Trump has won the election: “Putin has won.”) And it will get worse for us if we don’t understand what’s going on. Mueller spells it out. I hope more people will read this report....more",Notes are private!,0,68,1,"Apr 26, 2019",May 2019,"Apr 22, 2019",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/44587098-report-on-the-investigation-into-russian-interference-in-the-2016-presid

But Diane directly addressed my assumptions: that it was fluffy—a light read. She said it was a better book than she’d assumed it was.The cover, cover blurb, and title seem to misrepresent it, conveying light fluffiness and fun, inevitably disappointing readers who want that and turning off those who want something substantive. But now that I’ve read and enjoyed this book, I understand the marketing conundrum. (More on that in a second.)This is an easily readable, straight-forward account of a man, Professor Chandra, forced to admit his real feelings and soften his judgments in order to preserve the relationships with his beloved children. This is not inspired literary writing. It is occasionally laugh-out-loud funny, but as Jaline said in her , “The story has humor but it definitely isn’t comic,” (so ignore the “searingly funny” cover blurb). The writing is almost simplistic in tone with dialogue that plays like the slow volley of a badminton game. For the longest time I thought it was a self-help book disguised as a novel—as Chandra negotiates a self-acceptance workshop at Esalen, gags at the psychobabble of his ex-wife’s shrink husband, and is aghast at the fantastically false teachings of his ambitious son—who calls himself doctor but has never earned the credential (Don’t get me started on lies of self-proclaimed gurus). The territory of self-actualization workshops and the pervasiveness of group-think and group-talk among New Agers are familiar to me. But Chandra persists despite it because he is ready to change and rescue his family. Add to that the fact that he is so easy to identify with that I found myself working on myself as he worked on himself, and I finally concluded that the book is a secretly sophisticated “poke”—a nudge, a push, an invitation to think deeply and get underneath your own conditioning.So back to the cover and the title: The title is accurate and right out of the text, representing the book’s tone. So too is the fluffy cover art. The problem is that although the book is conveyed simplistically, it is not at all simple. A dark literary cover would completely misrepresent it, as would a more poetic title, but you can only understand the cover art as a metaphor (joining the ocean of consciousness) after you’ve read the book. So how do you convey that this really simple-sounding story conveys an invitation to work on yourself and possibly contemplate things you’ve not dealt with? I have no idea, which leaves me reiterating Diane Barnes’s message: this book is much better than one might assume from its cosmetics....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Apr 23, 2019","Apr 26, 2019","Mar 31, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/39808463-professor-chandra-follows-his-bliss

Communication happens without words—through a father and son’s chess game, through music, through a gesture. And, for me, it is more real than mundane words or reality, so I hesitate to call it mystical. This point of view sees and describes everything in utterly original and beautiful language. What’s ugly is stunning. Williams’s voice whispers a matrix of connecting energy between all people and conveys the movements of events as the result of this energy.

That I’m a writer who makes a living mostly by editing, and to my longtime Goodreads friends it’s probably obvious that I don’t read like a civilian. That said, I’m going one step further in my response to  Land of the Blind, my seventh Jess Walter book, by gushing and delighting in a way that is generally shared only in writers’ private conversations.Lots of novelists aspire to make money and very few succeed. Some of the few who make a living garner success with formulaic works, which are really the only thing they’re good at. And even fewer get so successful that they actually hire other writers to replicate their formulas and create their books. In the publishing world, moneymakers are sought because they support the majority of books published that make no money at all.Sometimes, in private, writers look at some of the blockbuster books that support their literary novels and can’t believe that stuff sells; we call the creators hacks, secretly wishing that we too could grind out something that would pay the rent.Jess Walter seems to be the rare animal with the agility and ability to do it all, and this delights other writers who watch with glee, understanding exactly what he’s accomplishing. Literary novelists jump up and down at his masterful technique as he applies it to a book that conveys his deep need to express something (Citizen Vince, We All Live in Water, The Zero) or switches to a crowd-pleaser (Beautiful Ruins) or something in between (The Financial Lives of Poets). With Land of the Blind, I can imagine the conversations—with his wife, his agent, his publisher—about writing for the market: “I’ve got to make some money,” he moans. “We’ve got to reroof the house and now the goddam boiler broke.”“And don’t forget the kids,” prompts Mrs. Walter. “Unless you want them growing old in the basement, we have got to start a college fund.”“How about a series?” suggests his agent. “Yeah,” chimes his publisher. “There’s all the subrights—TV, movies. Strong women roles are selling off the charts what with all these high-powered actresses with production companies. Maybe a strong woman cop. Whadeya think, Jess?”“We could probably sell subrights preprint,” surmises the agent.And so a cop series, starring lovely loner homicide detective Caroline Mabry is born. In this volume, there is an ingeniously inserted literary memoir (the meat of the book), including a boyhood story akin to Stephen King’s nostalgic but warped young boy stories. There is a mysterious case and a confession that opens up the notion of crime and confession to philosophic examination. There is sex, attraction, deception and rejection, revenge and regrets—all done with Jess Walter’s facile literary technique, introspection, love of architecture and humanity, humor, understanding, and palpable joy at telling stories. Jess Walter is no hack, and what a delight it is to watch him work his chops! ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Mar 19, 2019","Mar 22, 2019","Mar 18, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/61205.Land_of_the_Blind

Not only to readers, but to author John Ironmonger, who recently blogged his thoughts. It's worth reading.Original ReviewI was swept away by this book in the beginning, resented anything that got in the way of my reading, and later, as the story slowed, settled in for an interesting debate about human nature and what we’ll do to survive.Dependencies, supply chains, connections between everything, and how things happen according to streams of supply and need, as well as the possible end of civilization as we know it due to our human self-interest vs. an optimistically imagined natural impulse for generosity and sacrifice—all this forms the matrix of this story about a naked man and a beached whale, both of whom wash up on the shore of the off-the-grid village of St. Piran in the southwest corner of England.The writing and storytelling are wonderful. The profound issues start artfully and become more heavy-handed as the book progresses. But I am interested in these subjects so I was consistently intrigued, sometimes pausing to contemplate the big issues of what causes everything to happen and how to redirect the train of actions leading to catastrophic events. There is a mythical quality to the tale, and the sometimes-sentimentality or intellectual debates about our nature worked! I was completely engaged and couldn’t put the book down. I believe in meaning through synchronicities, and, the fact that I read this book immediately after reading Moby Dick, a story of man at war with Nature, feels important. I'd put Moby Dick on my to-read list four years ago and it was only because somebody left a new copy for adoption outside my building that I scooped it up and, on another impulse, read it right away. As I was finishing, two things happened: (1) The PBS documentary When Whales Walked grabbed me as I was channel surfing, mesmerizing me with facts (did you know whales can live to be 200 years old?); and (2) Not Forgetting the Whale (which I came to through Antoinette's rave ) arrived in my library reserves. Through inter-library loan, it traveled from Cornell University to jog me with a parable about the end of life on earth as we know it and introduce a different perspective on our assumed nature of self-interest. Then a couple of days into my reading, this article appeared in the New York Times: What's Killing Pacific Whales[image]All these things have had the cumulative result of making me both contemplative and very alert. Without giving anything away, at the end of Not Forgetting the Whale, we are reminded of the power of sacrifice and generosity and shown that historically, we are capable of these things. What if sacrifice and generosity are the true wisdom of the crowd, rather than self-interested anarchy—no matter what Nature-killing policies our leaders seem to choose? What if each of us dedicated ourselves to actions for the greater good? What if we saw the warning signs from the dying leviathans, and what if we each tried to heed the call by idiosyncratic acts of generosity, understanding that as goes the crowd, so do each of us? What a thought. Thank you, John Ironmonger.

But that doesn’t begin to describe the bigger truths this book conveys about our reactions to 9/11—a kind of communal PTSD boiled in a liquid of delusion where value is gauged by the congealed chunks of celebrity-based nobility or villainy that float to the surface.In Jess Walter’s story, protagonist Brian Remy suffers “gaps” in his consciousness. For the entire book, he suddenly comes to and recounts where he is, with no memory of how he got there. But what starts to jell is the sanity of this insanity in a culture where grief becomes a competitive sport with celebrities of selflessness and such a craving to vilify elusive demons that we actually create them. Things get so crazy that true grief and PTSD become ancillary; those who suffer in isolation become even crazier from a kind of cultural solitary confinement—what they suffer is not as sexy as the delusional fight between good and evil, so their pain really goes unaddressed.This book blew my mind.*******Some thoughts the day after reading and ing--spoiler material, so if you have not read the book, you may want to skip this:I cannot stop thinking about this book. It expressed things I've long wanted to but never could have articulated, let alone dramatized, the way Jess Walter did.I've read a lot of s where people are confused about what happened, so I just wanted to add some explanation:A common symptom of trauma is memory loss--the circuits are blown and there are big blank spots. (There are lots of people who have virtually no childhood memories; they were kids, then they were adults.) This is what happens to Brian Remy and it is consistent with medical knowledge about trauma. The root of his trauma is made very clear on pages 317-318: (view spoiler)[the text that is written in italics is a PTSD flashback where Brian runs into the first tower before it collapses, rushing upstairs as people push past him running down to escape. He then retreats back down, ""(emerging into the empty plaza ... white paper and smoking pieces of steel and bodies ... and for the briefest moment he was alone, paper falling ... he'd never heard the city so quiet ... and then: a deep, low moan ... ) [Parentheses, ellipses, and italics are in the text.] And the flashback ends before the collapse, but it is clear that Brian was there for the worst.

In the foreword, White describes the collection as one of ""farewells,"" and the final essay, ""Death of a Pig"" absolutely slayed me.So even though I skipped many pieces in this book, I cherish my mother's first edition.

I particularly liked how Grandmother constantly took Sophia's guilt away by taking imaginary responsibility for things that nobody is responsible for. All of their communication was in an agreed language of imagination. The story was timeless—summers that seemed to all be one—but again, I was confused by Sophia's constant age; she never got any older, and I know that aging was a constant worry for Grandmother. I almost thought she had some disability, except an author's lovely illustration near the end of the book, showed her as a small child. If this was supposed to be one long summer, that was unclear as there were several transitions away and back to the island . . . finally ending in a dark Autumn. After I finished the book, I went back to the introduction by Katherine Davis. She clarifies that it is one summer about a six-year-old and a very old grandmother. She also says that the possible imaginary friend is a real child. If this is true, I didn't understand this book at all. ...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"May 29, 2019","May 31, 2019","Feb 26, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2263969.The_Summer_Book

And the reason they are so deeply funny is that Gilman is self-aware enough to know and show their flaws better than they know them. I knew this after reading her last novel, The Ice Cream Queen of Orchard Street, but when I realized how contemporary and domestic this new story was (about a wife and mother and crackling with cultural references to rock bands I’ve never listened to), I geared myself up for easy sarcasm. But no! Like Lillian Dunkle, the Russian Jewish star of Ice Cream Queen, titular protagonist Donna Koczynski may inhabit a particular era (in this case, one when trendiness reigns), but she is rooted in her own crazy psychology, which includes equal parts compassion, open-minded curiosity, lunatic-level denial, and crazed she-wolf rage.My most successful published work to date is a monologue from a play called Darleen Dances. It is so widely performed that it has been blacklisted by various auditioning institutions. It is popular with young actresses because it is funny and they get to dance for the duration of the monologue. After watching a few young actors mutilate the piece, I finally wrote “Notes to Actors” in the copy of the play that I sell online. In these notes, I tell them “not to try to be funny or cute.” Instead, play the truth—which happens to be agonizing—of what the character is facing and doing. I promise them it will make the piece funnier.If I could, I would give this note to all the writers who create slick, sarcastic, self-congratulatory (to the writers, who identify with them) women characters. And for an example of what I mean by “writing the truth,” I would send them to Susan Jane Gilman’s books.Donna Koczynski is a wife, mother, former punk rocker, present seller of kitchen ware, who, self-admittedly “exhilarated by [her] own audacity,” suffers from perpetual insatiability, and finds herself on an unknown pilgrimage after blindly running away from home.The first few chapters are fantastically funny. But this big (400-page) commercial novel is so much more than laughs. With the skill of the best literary writers, the rage of the Greeks and contemporary feminists, combined with Lucille Ball-like pratfalls and plot twists, all in a twenty-first century tableau, Gilman’s Donna organically spirals down a very dark rabbit hole and out the other side of the earth, bobbing in a sea of love. I was constantly surprised, never knowing where the story was going. Screwy as many of the relationships are, they feel real. In an era where, as one of her characters observes, “Soon people won’t be able to tell what’s real or fake at all anymore,” Susan Jane Gilman is the real deal: a writer functioning on all cylinders. And so is Donna Koczynski. ***I received an Advanced Reading Copy from the publisher, Grand Central Publishing. The book launches in June 2019.***A NoteI'm not interested in recounting plots in my s, but I think it may be important to mention that, despite its protagonist being a fairly comfortable white woman, this book does the great service of bringing the desperate immigrant experience home for people who are not running for their lives: what it's like to flee, with no idea where you're going or how you are going to survive. And the way Gilman conveys this--managing to make you feel the experience as a person who is probably not in these straits and also managing to relate the true current experience of so many people who are--is rather genius.***6/18/19 UpdateI went to hear Susan Jane Gilman read at B&N last night, and wow!

For some it was hair, for others teeth; one concentrated on eyes, another on paint; one mixed the wax, another prepared the plaster. No one could see beyond his own individual station. Only together did we make the anatomy of a city in change; only together did we render things legible to all. (336)I was wondering what kept author Edward Carey dedicated for the fifteen years it took to birth this remarkable and compulsively readable historical novel about the child who lost her mother during the eighteenth century, which loss set her on a bizarre trajectory to train to make wax models of human anatomy, become a servant to the young sister of the King of France, and ultimately, to become Madame Tussaud of wax museum fame. But the above paragraph toward the end of the book answered my question.Anne Marie Grosholtz, renamed Little because of her diminutive size, is the embodiment of resilience. Lacking company, she senses the life in objects and rooms; she begins to understand that these living pieces form a kind of body. Given a cupboard to live in, she finds its life and benefits in the tight space. And so she survives abuse after abuse and finally the French Revolution.And when the Revolution comes, the severed heads of the royals and their minions are cast in wax for posterity. And when a terrified philosopher pleads to cover up the reproductions, claiming they will cause more violence, Marie’s master Curtius refuses, explaining, “They are only what has happened outside in the city. . . We observe it. . . That is truth. Wax never lies—not like those oil portraits in gilt frames I have seen all about the palace. Wax was ever the most honest of substances.” “Cover it up,” begs the philosopher. “But that would be lying,” counters Curtius. (342)” And that is the raison d’etre of this can’t-put-down novel with wonderful illustrations by the author—done as if they are Marie’s own. It is an observation and chronical of a brutal history that belongs to human beings. Except defying Curtius’s insistence that he and the others in the wax business at the Monkey House (the name of their popular museum) do their work as unemotional observers—the so-called journalists of their day—this book represents the full emotional story of Marie, who sees both the goodness and horror in everyone—allowing the reader to as well....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Mar 04, 2019","Mar 08, 2019","Feb 11, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38649806-little

Many humans have issues around this, but even if they don't, finding the place to relieve oneself is a primal need.But apparently not for Ann Patchett's intrepid forty-two-year-old research scientist who travels from Minnesota to a hotel in Brazil where she then insists on being an unwelcome passenger on a pontoon into the wilds of the Amazon jungle—a place with no electricity or plumbing where she arrives in a night so dark she cannot see her hand in front of her face; a place where her hostess immediately abandons her to a boy who may be twelve years old, who leads her to a bed in his hut. And never does Patchett mention the most important need: Where does she pee? Where does she poop in the morning? Does she do it in front of the kid? How does she know where to do it? There must be some agreement among the tribe not to do it where the community communes. Tell me! I simply must know.I understand that most writers leave out going to the bathroom (not me—fair warning if you read my novels), and in most cases it is fine.

WhiteThis house, this house now held in Sunday’s fearful grip, is a hundred and twenty years old. I am wondering what Sabbaths it has known. Here where I sit, grandfather H. used to sit, they tell me—always right here. He would be surprised were he here this morning to note that the seams in the floor have opened wide from the dry heat of the furnace, revealing the accumulation of a century of dust and crumbs and trouble and giving quite a good view of the cellar. (46)For the last six days, I have been inhaling my mother’s 1944 edition of E. B. White’s volume of heavenly essays, written between 1938 and 1943 when White was both farming in Maine and doing his duty as a watchman to support the War effort. My edition lacks a dust cover but has an inscription dated 10/27/45 from a long-dead friend to my now-dead mother, Edna, on the occasion of her twenty-fourth birthday. This browning tome has been on my shelf for decades. And when I finally took it down and began to read, I almost drowned in the accrued feelings: This book, this book is seventy-five years old. And I am wondering about all the hands that held it—from the printer’s to warehouse workers’ to bookstore clerks’ to my mother’s dear friend Tommy, to young, optimistic Edna, a budding writer, who—once we were both finally grown up enough to be friends—often mentioned E. B. White and kept this book through marriage, popped fantasy bubbles, and numerous dwellings. We never talked much about books, and although I remember her expressing reverence for White’s writing, in my arrogance, ignorance, and youth, I never thought to explore his work beyond Stuart Little, which was enough to make him my hero for life. (I didn’t see the need to read Charlotte’s Web until a few years ago when it beckoned from my top shelf and ended up being a driving force in my own novel, The Last Will & Testament of Zelda McFigg—so it was research. I blush at my oblivion.) Edna died in 1990 at age sixty-eight, the age I will turn in two days, and I want her back so we can talk: “I get it! I get it!” I cry. “If only I had known more when you were alive so we could share our love for Andy White.”E. B. White was all of forty-four, or thereabouts, when he wrote these anthologized essays for Harper’s Magazine and The New Yorker. A “personal record,” he calls it in the Foreword. “It is a collection of essays which I wrote from a salt water farm in Maine while engaged in trivial, peaceable pursuits” as an “over-age male” who was restless during the war. He was only a few years older than I was when my mother died, and yet he knew so much more than I ever will. He is a writer’s god and his voice is so vital that one senses him, as if both of you are hanging out in the 1940s, talking about farm animals in spring, barn building, and Hitler as a contemporary person of interest, and, although you may blanch at occasional casual linguistic racism, there is nothing at all awkward about this time jumping. In fact, White articulates the very sensation of normal time-jumping in a stunning essay, ""Once More to the Lake,"" about feeling as if he were inhabiting his own father when he took his son to his own boyhood fishing haunt: ""There had been no years between the ducking of this dragonfly and the other one—the one that was part of memory. I looked at the boy, who was silently watching his fly, and it was my hands that held his rod, my eyes watching. I felt dizzy and didn't know which rod I was at the end of."" (248) E. B. White is some writer!Some quotes:[Regarding a writer who has sworn off writing anything that is not good and significant:] Having resolved to be nothing but significant, he is in a fair way to lose his effectiveness. A writer must believe in something, obviously, but he shouldn’t join a club. Letters flourish not when writers amalgamate, but when they are contemptuous of one another. (Poets are the most contemptuous of all the writing breeds, and in the long run the most exalted and influential.) Even in evil times, a writer should cultivate only what naturally absorbs his fancy, whether it be freedom or cinch bugs, and should write in the way that comes easy. (43)In a free country it is the duty of writers to pay no attention to duty. Only under a dictatorship is literature expected to exhibit an harmonious design or an inspirational tone. A despot doesn’t fear eloquent writers preaching freedom—he fears a drunken poet who may crack a joke that will take hold. (43)Above two quotes written in January 1939Monday. The cat, David, is lying beside me, a most unsatisfactory arrangement, as he gives me hay fever.My sensitivity to cats defeats the whole purpose of a cat, which is to introduce a note of peace in a room. (60)April 1939The cells of the body co-operate to make the man; the men co-operate to make the society. But there is a contradiction baffling to biologist and layman alike. On the same day last spring that I saw a flight of geese passing over on their way to the lonely lakes of the north (a co-operative formation suggesting a tactical advantage imitated by our air corps)—on that same day cannibalism broke out among my baby chicks and I observed the brutality with which the group will turn upon an individual, literally picking his guts out. This is the antithesis of co-operation—a contrariness not unobserved in our own circles. (I recently read of a member of an actors’ union biting another actor quite hard. I believe it was over some difference in the means of co-operation.) (89)July 1939I just want to tell before I am slowed down, that I am in love with freedom and that it is an affair of long standing and that it is a fine state to be in, and that I am deeply suspicious of people who are beginning to adjust to fascism and dictators merely because they are succeeding in war. From such adaptable natures a smell rises. I pinch my nose. (168)July 1940In this spring of 1941 a man tends his [brooder—to keep chicks warm] fire in a trance that is all the deeper because of its dreamlike unreality, things being as they are in the world. I sometimes think I am crazy—everybody else fighting and dying or working for a cause or writing to his senator, and me looking after some Barred Rock chickens. But the land, and the creatures that go with it, are what is left that is good, and they are the authors of the book that I find worth reading; and anyway a man has to live according to his lights even if his lights are the red coals in the base of a firepot. (236)April 1941[Right after the bombing of Pearl Harbor] To hold America in one's thoughts is like holding a love letter in one's hand—it has so special a meaning. Since I started writing this column snow has begun falling again; I sit in my room watching the re-enactment of this stagy old phenomenon outside the window. For this picture, for this privilege, this cameo of New England with snow falling, I would give everything. Yet all the time I know that this very loyalty, this feeling of being part of a special place, this respect for one's native scene—I know that such emotions have had a big part in the world's wars. Who is there big enough to love the whole planet? We must find such people for the next society. (276)December 1941Thursday In time, ownership of property will probably carry with it certain obligations, over and above the obligation to pay the tax and keep the mortgage going. . . . [P]eople are beginning to suspect that the greatest freedom is not achieved by sheer irresponsibility. The earth is common ground and we are overlords, whether we hold title or not; gradually the idea is taking form that the land must be held in safekeeping, that one generation is to some extent responsible to the next, and that it is contrary to the public good to allow an individual merely because of his whims or his ambitions, to destroy almost beyond repair any part of the soil or the water or even the view. (333-334)The trend toward the ownership of land by fewer and fewer individuals is, it seems to me, a disastrous thing. For when too large a proportion of the populace is supporting itself by the indirections of trade and business and commerce and art and the million schemes of men in cities, then the complexity of society is likely to become so great as to destroy its equilibrium, and it will always be out of balance in some way. But if a considerable portion of the people are occupied wholly or partially in labors which directly supply them with many things which they want, or think they want, whether it be a sweet pea or a sour pickle, then the public poise will be a good deal harder to upset. (334)The trouble with the profit system has always been that it was highly unprofitable to most people. The profits went to the few, the work went to the many. I think our phrase “common man” came to mean the man who never managed to get his hands on anything but a pay envelope, and sometimes not that. You became uncommon when you had capital to invest or an idea to develop. Usually you had neither, and were common as dirt.

There was not one second of inauthenticity—in character, thought, or in the paradoxical steps of healing. Kathy Page not only dramatized this journey, but she broke it down into real steps that anybody who has done deep work on herself or who has studied healing therapies will find familiar: reacting, keeping enough space around your reaction to really see it and take responsibility for it; therefore you then see a reality that is different from the one you reacted to; and therefore you can dissemble your reaction and consciously choose to do something else.For me—a person who has investigated many healing modalities, as a client, a trainee, and as a journalist—this was as good as it gets because character, thoughts, emotions, actions, and ambivalence, fear, and paradoxes were so organic.

He peruses the guests: “. . . a fairly uniform group: white, middle-aged, attractive, fit, well-dressed, smiling, sexually devious, deeply wealthy, unusually successful. They were members of an elite club, a club to which they were desperate to belong and yet, here, now, to which each felt like an outsider.” (102)That’s the gang, and Kenney’s social satire of our twenty-first century love of public shaming is biting and delicious. But what makes this book really wonderful is that the sharp satire is woven into a story about people who are stripped of their facades; they are real and we feel their pain: nobody is good enough; everybody is frustrated; you can love but you can’t control anyone or anything you love; and inevitably we all hurt others and make terrible mistakes. The title Talk to Me becomes a plea, a prayer through humor and pain in a time of social tyranny when whatever is blasted through the media’s microphones is perceived as true. Daughter turns against father, wife against husband, and John Kenney tells the truth of all sides in the war between social perceptions and a man’s real life.

The dJuly 1, 2019 UpdateI've just reread this book for my book club and am stunned by what a different experience this is from my first time through. The difference is I know the whole story, so I understand everything (including the use of prose verse, which does not start immediately, but only after the first use of the father's first-person narrative), and rather than madcap, I'm finding this devastating. This is a story about love and madness: one person is mad by default; another chooses to descend into madness for love; and a child is left in the void. Oh my god, this is a great novel.My earlier This book is perfect—from the cover illustration that instantly conveys the bon-vivant “toujours gai” (to borrow from Don Marquis’s Archy & Mehitabel) bubbliness of this eccentric family of a boy and his two madcap parents, to the interior design, to the inspired translation from the French by Regan Kramer: the whole book is written as prose verse with the most complicated internal rhyming and music—imagine doing such a conversion from one language to another!I don’t want to give anything away about the story because to do so would rob readers of delight, constant surprise, and perhaps uncontrollable sobbing. But while reading like Don Marquis’s verse, it manages to be a real novel—a story about a family that is funny, sad, and charming. And there are complex levels communicated inventively by alternating the boy’s narrative with one written by his father in a private novel where the devastating truth of the situation becomes apparent—all the more devastating because it is delivered in the light-verse prose style that has been established.

Add to that, with only a couple of lives left, he is also trying desperately to reunite with the love of his life, Suzie, aka Death. This is a very complicated (see spoiler material in my last paragraph) spiritual quest book that will appeal to Buddhists, yogis, people who meditate, people to try unsuccessfully to meditate, and anybody who is working their butt off to become enlightened, knowing it’s most likely a lost cause.Author Michael Poore has a free, fertile, and funny imagination and sounds like Kurt Vonnegut if he had been born into the Millennial generation and educated in Eastern spiritual traditions . . . as well as slaughterhouse protocol, juggling, and a gazillion obscure specialties.I mostly enjoyed this book, but I had trouble during the last four chapters. (view spoiler)[Chapter 24 is pure futuristic, bombastic science fiction that read like a primal scream—exhausting and not my thing . . . until it got to a lovely parable teaching at the end. And from here the book seems to aim for a conclusion where Milo and Suzie reach Perfection and merge into the light of the Sun Door (where people like Buddha go). For the whole book we have been led to believe that Suzie is a “Universal”—a nonhuman creature—but in chapter 24 she succeeds in being a human to be with Milo and live his last life together. But no. There’s more. In chapter 26, we get a spiritual lesson—literal teaching—about the nature of life (illusion). And this is followed by a final chapter of the history of Milo and Suzie’s many human lives together—seeming to contradict the setup of the entire book. I was so confused I reread chapter 26, “The Oversoul,” and blam—I got it: there is no end to this dream we call life, this “maya” (illusion). Even after Perfection, even after a Universal becomes a human and then reaches Universal Perfection again, the thing (reincarnation) goes on and on and on.  (hide spoiler)] This is not a book for the novice seeker, but if you’re willing to work to understand, it’s fun.

The omniscient narrator’s voice is courtly, sometimes florid (with an abundance of adjectives, adverbs*, similes, and verbs to describe talking that have nothing to do with making sound). It’s an almost jovial tone, treating all of the characters—good guys and bad—exactly the same as it relates the most violent action, tragedy, and human degradation as if it is unspooling a fable. I cannot overstress how hard this is to pull off. If a writer has even a drop of disdain or, worse, contempt, for a character, the whole story will fall apart and become hateful. And likewise, if the narrator is removed enough to narrate from this kind of distance, a reader will likely disconnect and not care about any of the characters. None of that happens. I cared about the characters; I accepted the violence but without feeling it, which was a blessing; and I was always eager to find out what happened next. I can only think it was because the writing had captivated me into a transcendent omniscient perspective where although you care, you do not feel pain. There was a time in junior high school when I read a friend’s entire collection of comic books, and the “slam-bam” frames of action suck you in; maybe that’s the key to this working: each chapter has a title which works like a caption on a comic frame, and somehow no matter how over-the-top violent or crazy the action gets, you just accept it within this style and frame.Writing with this kind of voice can be a high-wire act with no net, but apparently Kevin Ansbro is so confident that there is no sense of danger for a reader (moi) who sees the mechanics of this. Wow.This is a mythical, magical, spiritual tale full of good guys, bad guys, and supernatural wanderers told with a comic-book flair**, but it is also a contemporary story told with charm and sometimes laugh-out-loud, rip-roaring humor. Again, that marriage of things that don’t easily merge—like the notion of a fish climbing a tree! In lesser hands, this would be a mess. This is not a mess! This is a truly original book—a story that works.___________*I cannot resist sharing a quotation from the book that made me laugh out loud from the cleverness of the inside joke/poke at the writing itself. A young writer hero has shown his novel to an agent who responds: “It’s a veritable mélange of all that is great in a story. It’s allegorical and it’s pulse-pounding. The characters are chock-a-block with hidden depths and it’s free of the scourge of unnecessary adverbs.” (150)If you read the book, seeing the mechanics, this is like a comic book character suddenly stepping out of a frame and becoming a three-dimensional being who winks at you, before resuming his two-dimensional framed role. I loved it!**The cover art, also by Kevin Ansbro, is a better representation of the style and feeling of this book than any  could convey....more",Notes are private!,0,36,1,"Feb 22, 2021","Feb 26, 2021","Jan 01, 2019",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/43169446-the-fish-that-climbed-a-tree

If you come from a functional family, I somehow think you’ll love this as well. If you are Jewish (religious or don’t even know the holidays), don’t think, don’t question, just buy this and wallow in it. If you are a Palestinian, same thing. If you want to understand the metaphor of Israel, my god, here it is explained in full. And if you ever imagined, no matter what your circumstances, that you could run away from whatever is or was your family, read this quote: I wanted to be free of you, Dad, and Annabelle. I suppose that’s impossible. You are my prisoners and I am yours. We are a family. A family that writes each other, that doesn’t touch, that doesn’t breathe in aromas from the kitchen, but a family nonetheless.

Whether they were Native Americans or African shamans or People of the South American Forests or Aboriginal Australians, the thing they had in common was an inclusive view of all life: everything is alive; there is no division between all that is life or between incarnate and spirit. In white people's terms: there is no difference between metaphor and common reality, dreamland or awake time, imagination and history; they are one, in one flow, and interchangeable.Although The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven is an uneven collection of short stories (some immaturely written, others mature), what I appreciate is that Sherman Alexie wrote ""straight,"" sharing life on the reservation and his people and their point of view without explaining or in any way trying to package it for white culture. Some stories are pure expressions of despair; some are funny; some are like free-verse poetry, and all of them express what it is to live in white culture but to be made in and of a culture that has been assaulted for centuries, a culture that sees things differently so that one's experiences are different. This alone makes this book worth reading and learning from—even if you can't follow things like a man becoming a pony in the 1800s and then floating around in time. The reservation doesn't sing anymore but the songs still hang in the air. Every molecule waits for a drumbeat; every element dreams lyrics. Today I am walking between water, two parts hydrogen, one part oxygen, and the energy expelled is named Forgiveness.

A great big book in a small beautifully designed taut 200 pages. And I have no idea what to say to convey why it is great or even how.I had so many associations while reading: from our human longing to be seen, to our inability to see and how distorted anything becomes by being seen through the projections and expectations of the seers, to how more often than not we get stuck in a box and are unable to move on, to the longing to fly and experience the numinous that we so cruelly only glimpse, to the magic of a clunk on the head . . . They're all—these associations—like myriad buttons pushed in such a random poking that expressing it makes me feel ajumble, and even if I could be articulate, it would not convey the brilliance offered by this book.I could compare its ability to move through time to John Williams's equally powerful Stoner. I could praise the crystalline writing and evocation of a seaside London suburb by comparing it to Maggie O'Farrell's work, but that wouldn't be accurate. Harriet Paige is Harriet Paige, and her 39-year-old visage in an author's photo must hide many ancient souls who have poured through her to birth this book.

It is not only gorgeous language, but it makes one's heart pound.Fear: Trump in the White House (Bob Woodward) is as much about writer's voice as it is about the topic.

The power is in the language, descriptions, the deep characterizations of the battered inhabitants and land, and an authenticity of feeling that was both exhausting and breathtaking. The sometimes scramble comes from the increasingly out-of-order chronology that slowly illuminates the complicated relationships between kin. There is a timeline at the start of each chapter, which I suspect is a wonderfully creative design attempt to solve the scramble, but even with that visual aid, the time jumps got confusing and it was hard to remember who was related to whom—which one might say is fitting, because the war and who is fighting or allied with whom is insanely confusing; nevertheless for me, the scramble became a reading problem.

It consumed me, made meA page and a half into the preface of this book, I found my heart pounding, as if syncing up with an all-consuming life force. It consumed me, made me tear up, and I had to stop reading to type the previous sentence. Every writer has an energy. Some write from a shallow pool, and I really don't care about those books. Others, not that many, write from an ocean — a place much bigger than their everyday self — and it's called Love. Becoming has an almost palpable pulse as strong as the ocean tide.There is something for everyone through this pulse: --If you are an inveterate skeptic, or an order devotee, or someone who has been torn apart by seemingly opposite obligations and doubts about being good enough, Michelle Obama speaks for you. --If you're black or brown, you'll probably nod a lot with recognition. --If you're white, same thing, even as you relate to unfairness you've never faced; Obama's openness, vulnerability, and warmth make her experience feel as if it is your own — no small trick. --If you have ever felt in over your head, with more responsibility than you can handle, yet simultaneously in awe of the situation, your experience will both resonate with and be dwarfed by this story. --If you come from a wonderful family, you'll mumble, ""Yes, yes.""--If you are in a relationship with someone who is your opposite, you may find self- and other-acceptance through understanding. --If you come from a dysfunctional family or if you travel through life solo, or if you are simply a human being, you may find in these pages a main line to all the love, self-approval, and nurturance you never had.The narrative of this memoir flows flawlessly between personal story and a deep understanding of cultural history. And Obama never tries to make herself look good. Her self-criticism, humility, and appreciation of the people around her, as well as her authentic awe at her life are radiant and contagious. As is her love for children. All children. (And we are all children in some hidden place.)The pulse of this story becomes, as the book progresses, a resounding drumbeat every bit as powerful as the one she often refers to driving her husband's trajectory, but my guess is that she would be surprised to hear this. This pounding is her heart. By the time she describes Hurricane Katrina, ""when the drumbeat [to do more] truly got loud,"" (221), my whole chest was reverberating.Michelle Obama shares herself and her family with such generosity and honesty that it creates a connection for everyone. In fact, I don't think I've ever read an author with more ""open sockets"" for readers to plug into. She is so relatable that it makes you love her and her remarkable parents and brother and husband … and maybe even yourself a little, too. So perhaps her real gift is the one offered by all great healers: to beckon and welcome our whole selves to awaken — to awaken to the becoming of who we really are....more",Notes are private!,0,44,1,"Dec 22, 2018","Dec 26, 2018","Nov 10, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/38746485-becoming

(68)That quote describes both the plot and structure of this stunning book.Claudia Hampton is 76 and dying, and as she dies, she tells the story of her world—all its failures, successes, loves (forbidden and lost), peoples, times, and points of view. She jumps from first person to third to different first persons, and it is not the least bit confusing.I suspect that many of us with decades behind us can relate to this way of recollecting. A color, a sound, anything can set off a memory as real now as it was in the time that it happened. And likewise, within the memory, we may jump to still other associations. I imagine this is the normal way we  our lives: as a kind of jumble of jigsaw pieces that only we understand as a whole picture. And Penelope Lively wrote it, and it is not only comprehensible but moving.What is particularly moving to me is our impermanence: we’re here, then we’re not; events that feel so compelling, all-consuming, and even historic happen, and then they’re gone and only remain in memory until everybody who holds the memory is gone; places are here, then replaced by others or transformed into unrecognizable new ones.

B. White calls the “second New York”—there are three New Yorks (pp. 25-26)—a commuter. In 1972, I moved back permanently, becoming a member of what E. B. (Andy) White calls the “third New York,” made up of people from somewhere else in a quest for something. I came to be an actor and evolved, out of frustration and exhaustion, into a writer and a member of White’s “first New York”: “the man or woman who was born here, who takes the city for granted and accepts its size and its turbulence as natural and inevitable.”“By rights New York should have destroyed itself long ago,” he writes. And, toward the end of this essay, in a stroke of prescience that gives me goose bumps:The city, for the first time in its long history, is destructible. A single flight of planes no bigger than a wedge of geese can quickly end this island fantasy, burn the towers, crumble the bridges, turn the underground passages into lethal chambers, cremate the millions. The intimation of mortality is part of New York now: in the sound of jets overhead, in the black headline of the latest edition. (54)How did he see this in 1948? (But I guess I shouldn’t be surprised. His collection of essays One Man’s Meat is full of such foresight.) But since 9/11 didn’t end us, my guess is nothing can.Although Here is New York was written seventy-one years ago, White still describes my beloved hometown perfectly. You can be alone here if you choose, and everything possible is available for your enjoyment or ire. New York is a massive global city, yet there are tiny neighborhoods every bit as distinct as in small towns (daily, when I am coming home from my early-morning Central Park dog walks, I wave to one of my neighbors through his second-floor window where he sits and draws). Perhaps landmarks have changed since 1948, but the essence of New York could not be better expressed or more beautifully written than it is in this little masterpiece of an essay.A postscript: In the 1999 edition of this book, there is an introduction by White’s stepson, renowned writer Roger Angell. Remarking on some of the changes White would have seen had he visited the city then, he says, “Fifth Avenue, he would find, has been Trumped . . .” This sounds so innocent to my ear now in 2019 when the country and, indeed, the whole world has been Trumped. New York City is a place for everyone—even con artists like Trump; he belonged here. Everyone who did business with him knew he lied and cheated. Banks refused to make him loans. Contractors worked at their peril because he was famous for refusing to pay people. But he belongs to New York City because everybody belongs here. And even in 1948, E. B. White communicated that—we are a kind of wild Noah’s Arc of humanity: The collision and the intermingling of these millions of foreign-born people representing so many races and creeds make New York a permanent exhibit of the phenomenon of one world. (47) That our diversity can be so rich and delicious, yet it foisted upon the nation a man who would now call that diversity dangerous . . . I just don’t understand. I wonder what Andy White would write now.

Lou is a woman who, we are told, only feels purposeful and grounded by having instructions, but she ends up having sex with the bear, and through that, having unnamed guilt healed by having her back clawed, thereby experiencing a rebirth.(I'll give you a short pause to digest that . . . Ready or not, here's the :)This is a short book (122 pages), and for the first 84 I was all in. I knew who this woman was—a loner like me who was out to have a personal epiphany or at least achieve self-knowledge. And I liked the bear a lot. He was slow, docile, and trapped. For the first 84 pages, I was rooting for the bear and I applauded when he had the first sensual relationship with the woman. But then something awkward happened. (Don't laugh. The first part really wasn't awkward.) With the first use of the word “cunt” to describe the female anatomy, the book lost all sensuality. And it was not just because of the crass language. There was absolutely no heat, no smell, no organic motivation for this woman who thrives on cataloging to suddenly identify herself as a person who always goes too far, to have completely unsensual sex with the man who helps her out, to start yelling to the bear to tear her head off.The first thing I associate with a bear is heat—body, breath. And it’s not there. Occasionally there is a mention of a smell, but you never experience it. So, for me, this story suddenly became the author’s personal exercise to write a kind of Jungian dream, and I felt nothing; it was Engel’s personal project that had nothing to do with the reader. So ultimately my only strong feeling was sadness for the bear. He had been used by a self-involved character and I wanted better for him.

Although it was published in 20I liked this book about a family and their secrets during the British heatwave of 1976, but I found it heavy and slow. Although it was published in 2013—just three years before the last O’Farrell novel I read, This Must Be the Place, and five years before the magnificent I Am, I Am, I Am which introduced me to O’Farrell—this felt like early work whose style is not yet refined. For my taste, there was just too much of it: too many words; too many serial lists of nouns, adjectives, references; too much flashing back; too many tangents; and too much redundancy. It needs cutting and tightening. Also, oddly there was not a lot of reference to the heat. It was as if the story was plunked down into a historical period, but there was no sense of how that heat felt and how people would have constantly been sweating and moving differently because of it, and therefore when the terrain changes in the last section of the book when the disgruntled and irascible family goes back to Ireland to a cottage on the sea, there is no huge dramatic shift from sticky, heavy overheated, secret-burdened weight to the freedom of the sea.That said, the language is gorgeous, the storytelling wonderfully complex, the characters are so real their pain affects the reader viscerally, and as with the other books I’ve read, it all comes together in the end.

Nothing is our own. We begin in the world as anagrams of our antecedents. (118)And then the next paragraph ends with:She would like to feel the ceaseless drag of the currents flexing beneath her. But she fears it may frighten the girl. Esme is frightening—this much she has learnt.Esme Lennox, institutionalized for sixty years and finally rescued by her similarly free-spirited great niece (the girl referred to in the last quote), is a character I might have been in another life, and I find it a little distressing that the cover copy calls this a “gothic” story. The only thing about it that resonates with that word is horror. But there is nothing supernatural about that horror. To the contrary: it is an authentically horrifying story about a real woman who embodies what Joseph Campbell described as our reason for being alive: “People say that what we’re all seeking is a meaning for life. . . I think that what we’re seeking is an experience of being alive, so that our life experiences on the purely physical plane will have resonances with our innermost being and reality, so that we actually feel the rapture of being alive.” Esme is a normal person who is judged dangerous for not being repressed, emotionally deadened, and in denial. And labeling that as “gothic,” gives it a weirdness that mischaracterizes the book and, in some way, reflects the very bias of those who judged Esme. So, in short, I loved this brilliant, original, exciting, horrifying book and I disliked the cover copy.

He also said, “It is easy in the world to live after the world’s opinion; it is easy in solitude to live after your own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.” I can’t do this!This is not a perfect book: it rambles unapologetically, is overwritten, and father and son have virtually the same voice, but for me all that was eclipsed by the imagination and wild humor. Also, the style and substance felt familial—a lot of similarities to my own work—so I sensed I was with good writing family.Obviously I have a taste for this kind of book and I wish there were more of them. And when I say “them,” that’s an oxymoron because what I love is the unique voice and irreverence.

It didn’t; in fact there were only a few giggles, but I did enjoy it. It’s a strong, well-written, well-plotted and paced story about a success slut—a guy who will do anything to succeed. Since I’ve worked in both the theater and publishing, I’ve known many such people—people who turn every event into a zero-sum competition, people who will lie with impunity to make themselves seem impressive or steal or take credit for work they didn’t do, people who feign friendship to get something and calculate the merits of every potential connection like an investment. In short, success sluts are familiar—so familiar that some of the behavior of the protagonist in this book that one might be tempted to label far-fetched, I know to be true (and have used in my own work). After years of experience with such people, I have little interest in them and usually find them tiresome. Nevertheless this story kept my interest and that says everything about Boyne’s skill. He is a terrific storyteller, and the book got more compelling as it went on. In fact, halfway through, I couldn’t put it down, all the way to its deliciously melodramatic end. And there is something delightful about Boyne’s “using” exploiters, monstrously exaggerating their evilness for his own literary success.

So I won't be joining conversation in the comments. If you disliked this book, you may enjoy having some company in your opinion. --Betsy RobinsonThe Review (November 18, 2018)Normally I would not finish let alone  a book I disliked as much as I did this one, but since I bought the book and am reading it for my book club, I’ve decided to say what I think:I found the writing of this romance/murder mystery to be painfully split—almost as if there were two different authors: an experienced one for the vivid narrative and an amateur for dialogue and character development (which in fact may be the case, since the author’s an experienced nature writer and this is her first novel).The story is told in two time periods: Young Kya, left alone in the marsh to fend for herself, starts the story in 1952; and police investigate a murder in 1969. The opening lyrical descriptions of the swampland and inner thoughts of the swamp kids had soul—I loved, felt, and smelled the land, sea, air, and dense plants. But when people started talking, the writing became stilted, overwritten, and unbelievable. This happened in the earlier time period with Kya and a boy and the boy and his dad, and same thing with the 1969 police dialogue. The kids’ scenes had an after-school TV special sound and the police scenes sounded canned, like a marshlands-of-North Carolina version of Law and Order, where exposition is awkwardly inserted to move the story forward or there is overwriting that takes away from what could have sounded more authentic to the region. For example, a deputy says to his sheriff:“I’m hungry. Let’s go by the diner on the way out there.” “Well, get ready for an ambush. Everybody in town’s pretty riled up. Chase Andrew’s murder’s the biggest thing’s happened ’round here, maybe ever. Gossip’s goin’ up like smoke signals.”“Well, keep an ear out. We might pick up a tidbit or two. Most ne’er-do-wells can’t keep their mouths shut.”(61)Why not just, “I’m hungry,” and cut to the wonderful description of the Barkley Cove Diner and the scene of people gossiping about the crime? In real life, people do not say everything they’re thinking or narrate everything that’s happening or is going to happen. In fact, most of us lie about what we really think—if we are even self-aware enough to know our subconscious thoughts. Leaving out thoughts, leaving gaps in truth, and trusting the characters a writer has created allows subtext and real character to drive things forward. There is none of that here.I found the character development absurd: Simply put, there are no authentic, complex characters. Kya starts as a believable swamp rat, which is inconsistent with what we learn about the derivation of her parents. Her voice is unbelievably inconsistent throughout the book. Then there are the two one-dimensional romances, one of which allows her to learn to read at age 14 and grow into an educated, sophisticated, poetry-reciting biologist, knowing lyrics to songs she never would have heard, etc., and the other, a sexual relationship where she doesn’t even think about getting pregnant although she seems to have learned all her biology from the esoteric scientific texts she reads.I finished this book by skimming large sections, starting at page 164 when the entire plot became apparent, sans an end-of-book twist which was intellectually fun, but just as unbelievable as the manipulations of Kya’s character. Sorry, friends who adore this book, I’m an outlier on this one, I guess....more",Notes are private!,13,5461,1,"Nov 11, 2018","Nov 14, 2018","Aug 04, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/37703550-where-the-crawdads-sing

He brings him copious research and data and finally makes it as simple as possible by asking: which would you choose—to go into a mine and get black lung or to make the same salary doing something else? He is attempting to intrude into Trump’s belief that our trade agreements are disgraceful because we’re losing manufacturing jobs—despite the data that more than 80 percent of our jobs are not in manufacturing and that a trade deficit is not a bad thing since it allows people to spend more money on what they’re spending it on anyway—services. Nothing seems to penetrate.Several times Cohn just asked the president, “Why do you have these views?”“I just do,” Trump replied. “I’ve had these views for 30 years.”“That doesn’t mean they’re right,” Cohn said. “I had the view for 15 years I could play professional football. It doesn’t mean I was right.” (138)Multiply this thousands of times and apply it to all government issues (foreign policy, trade, immigration, etc.) and you begin to understand the problem of a person who never tells the truth because he lacks a basic understanding of what truth is and how one discerns it. Nor can he learn. No amount of correction penetrates: he is told repeatedly that Iran is in compliance with its nuclear weapons agreement, yet he insists on his belief about cheating; he’s given the world history that makes South Korea’s partnership crucial to world peace, yet he wants to disrupt the relationship; he’s presented with statistics proving that steel tariffs will weaken our economy, but he wants what he wants, etc. Nor can he understand the intricate symbiotic relationships between national security, foreign policy, and immigration. In other words, we have elected a man who lives in a fantasy and who therefore bollixes the efforts of anybody who operates according to facts, and when those facts are inconvenient, he dismisses them as “fake” and the people who spew them as “stupid.” He places no value in experience and expertise, ignoring advice derived from those things as he inexplicably disseminates information that is Russian-derived propaganda. And naturally this constant whirlwind of ignorance as a management style has created a whirlwind of people spinning out of control while they simultaneously try to control or please him.There is little new news in this book (except for a harrowing account of how close Trump came to declaring war with North Korea, with no understanding of the ramifications of doing so!), but Woodward is every much the historian that Doris Kearns Goodwin is writing about past presidents, and this book is an alive blow-by-blow meticulous record that will be studied by students who have not yet been born—if we live to see that future. (I am not usually a history buff, so sometimes the details become overwhelming; but I made the choice to be a student when I read both Doris Kearns Goodwin and this book, and that choice has me applauding the value of the detail for posterity.)There is nothing mean-spirited about this book. Everybody is presented at times sympathetically—even Trump in his albeit fleeting upset about the chemical-weapons-killed babies in Syria; Jared and Ivanka (who have a miniscule role in this book) come across on the side of DACA kids and the Paris Climate Accord; advisor Rob Porter is heroic in slow-walking terrible orders from Trump; Lindsay Graham is a great deal-maker willing to find ways to make sane things happen; General McMaster tries so hard to do a good job. And this even-handedness highlights the horror of the chaos—everybody is working against each other, undercutting somebody else, running around secretly to “save the world” or “fight for the president.” The horror of this book is that our president has no understanding of truth and has evoked absolute pandemonium in the White House and subsequently all over the world, creating problems where none existed—in trade, in immigration, etc.For me the value of this book is to better see the whole story, which for some reason makes it both more and less horrifying. It is an alarming story that will result in either the destruction of the world (via WWIII) by a child president who is incapable of learning or understanding the consequences of his hyperbole, or the activation of all of us who love the planet and want peace.However, in my opinion, Trump and his minions are not the threat to our lives. It is the great apathetic public who refuse to vote let alone know the story that is so well written here. Those who most threaten our security are the people with fixed beliefs like Trump, who shrug and are bored by talk about the relationship between their ability to walk down the street and troops stationed in South Korea, and although I think this is a wonderful and necessary book, I know that it will never be read by those who most need to recognize their peril. 4/20/19 Addendum The publication of the redacted Mueller Report has validated much of this book: the out-of-control ignorance of our president, his disinterest in and blatant flaunting of the law, as well as how he seems to slip away from so much legal culpability because his staff simply refused to carry out criminal orders. And as the news breaks, so too is my dismay validated by the complete disinterest of those with fixed beliefs and no interest in facts who dismiss the report without even reading it. ***Postscript:Because it has come up in my  thread comments that probably will not be read by many people, I would like to reiterate and elaborate on my sense of the tone of this book: It is not only even-handed and steady, but there is a compassionate undertone. Woodward is not out to get anybody. In the acknowledgements and the front-of-book personal note, he shares about his researcher and collaborator, Evelyn M. Duffy, and his wife, Elsa Walsh, ""known widely as the Kindness Lady."" He attributes to Evelyn a noble work ethic and a reverence for authenticated fact-based journalism, which is palpable in this book. And to Elsa he acknowledges ""not just an unselfish appreciation for each person but a reverence for each."" This best describes the compassion I sense in Woodward's writing and his approach to even those people with whom he disagrees. All this adds to the reader's sense that he is telling truth....more",Notes are private!,0,896,1,"Sep 11, 2018","Sep 13, 2018","Aug 02, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/40901227-fear

There are people who are born resilient, and Donal is a child role model for anybody who thinks scary or tragic circumstances cannot be dealt with positively. Yes, he’s scared and makes mistakes, but his curiosity leads him to talk to people, demand autographs for his collection, and see life—however difficult—as an adventure to be relished. And this resilience funded by curiosity is not self-conscious or even noticed by the author in any particular way. But to this reader, it was like starshine.Last Bus to Wisdom is a sweet, slowly unwinding story about another time in America. Sometimes it drags or is manipulated, but it’s mostly entertaining to read about a little boy who always bobs to the surface of fearful events that could drown a lot of people . . . and it certainly helped me through this week of the Senate putting a liar with a drinking problem and a train of sexual assault accusations on the Supreme Court.

Dear Committee Members was inspired; The Shakespeare Requirement, although humorous, is not. Also it has so many details of comic academia in common with two other novels that I’ve read recently (primarily Straight Man by Richard Russo but also Blue Angel by Francine Prose)—everything from the specificity of a broken tooth to battles with machinery and architecture—that sometimes I forgot which novel I was reading. However five chapters in, it briefly came alive and new when the beleaguered Professor Jason T. Fitger (star of the two books), “local literary SOB and unexceptional novelist—and, of course, English Department chair” (109), a man in a never-ending fight to exist, deals with his ex-wife Janet Matthias. Janet works in the law school and was tangential in the first book. With her we suddenly get to see a real woman in all her disdainful glory—far better written than the wife in Russo’s book. She is original and funny and I wish Schumacher had chosen to write her life as a sequel. The first book was so strong and complete, I don’t think there’s more needed about Fitger. But Janet’s epistolary novel would be one I would have savored. In her acknowledgements, Schumacher mentions that her editor turned down the first version of this sequel, and since I loved Dear Committee Members, I’m experiencing editor’s envy. Had I been her editor, I would have urged her to do more epistolary novels from the points of view of other characters mentioned in the first book. What was so enticing about Dear Committee Members was how Schumacher communicated through Fitger’s ever-more frustrated letters to his colleagues his deep love and care for his students; in other words, soul shone through his crusty façade such that the reader fell in love. Imagine doing that for a whole community of impossible people. Now that would be a series worth reading.It’s unfair to compare this book to the earlier one or to Straight Man, but it’s hard not to. If you haven’t read Dear Committee Members, you’ll probably be able to see this new book more objectively than those of us who have.

It is a great book because O’Farrell is a wonderful storyteller, which means that she sees the connections between events in her life and has a journalist’s gift for weaving them together through exquisite literary writing.This book is a primer on how to write a personal essay, and for writers who learn best by osmosis, this is one of the best collections of examples I can imagine. Almost from the first sentence, I found myself osmosing as a writer: toting up craft techniques (the kind of events and information that can pad out a fairly meagre or at least quick current story—“moments,” per O’Farrell’s description of the book’s plot), watching for transitions, letting out ahas at the vocabulary and scintillating description of background events that connected through time to the present moment (the first two essays’ main events are written in present tense which gives them urgency—a great way to open a book), and how she seamlessly jumps time and tenses (present to past tense and back again) to a conclusion in the future. And none of this interfered with my regular reader enjoyment. In fact it enhanced it.Suffice it to say that with masterful craft, O’Farrell conveys her own heart through words that make the reader’s pound in resonance. This writing is delicious.

Bring them to something outside themselves. (130)After having read The Overstory by Richard Powers, as well as a bunch of his interviews, I would say this is the writer’s desire voiced through his character. In the mighty The Overstory, he certainly succeeds, giving Nature (trees) a microphone and readers an immersive experience of being both Nature and its champion—bringing us to something much larger than what we normally are.The story of Peter Els in Orfeo is more uneven, alternating between present seventy-year-old Els in a tale of intrigue and musical mayhem, and the development of his younger self, as well as a big story chunk in a concentration camp during WWII when a pivotal piece of music called Quartet for the End of Time was written by French composer Olivier Messiaen.The present story is strong and compelling but past stories are sometimes so awash in musical descriptions and technical lingo that, although the writing excites me, I got tired. I love music and have been known to listen repeatedly to the same pieces, but I’m an ignorant appreciator and do not have a musical education. I listened to recordings of some of the music in Orfeo, but that didn’t help the narrative come alive. For musicians, the lingo may work. For me, it spirals out of conversation with the reader in a way that I’ve experienced several geniuses spiral: it’s as if they have a brain spasm of brilliance that takes them out of relationship in the middle of a conversation and suddenly you are being talked at rather than with. Despite all the science lingo in The Overstory, this never happened because Nature was such a strong character. Between the science and musicology in Orfeo, I began to feel like a witness to genius but without a relationship to it. Nevertheless the brilliance is so bright and exciting, I kept reading, and eventually relationships did return between the characters: young Els and his wife and daughter became wrenchingly real, and I realized that the very spiraling out of relationship that I experienced as a reader is what drives young Els to destroy his marriage. How do you write that without also alienating the reader? That’s a real question I don’t know the answer to. Of one of young Els’s musical compositions, a critic writes “evasive, anachronistic, and at times oddly bracing. But this er admits to leaving after an hour and fifty-three minutes. (216)” That perfectly describes the problem and wonder of this book.

It is the life story of Kossola, the last living slave abducted from Africa after other Africans plundered his village, brutally beheading people, to catch human beings to sell to the thriving but illegal slave trade. “Barracoon” is the word for the barracks the captives were locked in pending their trip as “black cargo” to the United States.This is the story of American slaves and their descendants, but it is also a study of how we humans destroy ourselves—all of us: Africans kill and enslave Africans; White people work and brutalize Africans; American-born Black people disparage African-born “savages” once they are free men; White men kill unarmed free Black men with impunity; it goes on and on and on. When greed and ego and power become seductive enough, when we feel insecure and need a scapegoat, we dehumanize others and turn them into objects—a commodity deemed stupid, inferior, and without dignity—to justify our heinous actions against them. Slaves, Jews, immigrants, pick your example; they’re everywhere unfortunately. And the irony is that Kossola, and probably others like him who actually survived their living deaths, are probably so much stronger and more resilient than the majority of people.

It was supposed to get both hemispheres working equally, and when it did, there was a moment where your head felt like it had been electrocuted as it kind of fizzed back and forth and then exploded. I don’t know how else to describe it, but believe me when I say this was pleasurable. At the end, your head felt massive and fluid.

In 2017, an OxfaFormer Secretary of Labor Robert Reich states that since 2009, 95 percent of economic gains have gone to the top 1 percent net worth. In 2017, an Oxfam study found that eight rich people, six of them Americans, own as much combined wealth as half the human race.Cotton Tenants is a report on tenant farmers in the 1930s in Moundville, Alabama—with photos. I skimmed the detailed economic explanation of tenant farming, but picked up enough to realize that this is a look at wealth inequality in a microcosm—the precursor to what is still going on. In Our Revolution, Bernie Sanders writes, “A job is more than a ‘job.’ It is more than just making an income. A job is, in an important sense, how we relate to the world in which we live.” And he has many suggestions about how to create meaningful, sustaining work (one of which is to make workers into owners), none of which apply to tenant farmers. Until reading Cotton Tenants, it never occurred to me that in large part the economy is rigged because workers are responsible for creating products that don’t sustain them, but only sustain the owners of their businesses. Tenant farmers growing primarily cotton on the landowner’s property, instead of food, can’t eat properly! So Agee’s report has some current relevance.Robert Reich is a better source of the current statistics and explanations about how it’s all working in 2018 (especially his videos), but this book is worth reading for Agee’s descriptions of people. For writers who want to expand their notions about observing and reporting on people, this is a master class. And Walker Evans’s photos are superb.Note: This book really is a hybrid report and brilliantly articulate response to the report, written on assignment but never published by Fortune magazine. It’s called a “masterpiece,” but I think Fortune was right to kill it. It’s not a magazine story. Imagine lists of notes written with lots of beautifully crafted descriptions. The literary writing is inspired, the jaundiced analysis is funny, and conclusions are so vivid you can feel Agee grunting (“. . . it is quite as fair to observe that ignorance and slovenliness and the tradition itself are the inevitable products of just one thing: poverty. The music can go all sorts of places, but it comes out here.”). But I suggest skimming whenever you feel like it and savoring Walker Evans’s photographs.For a comprehensive  of this book, see Howard’s ....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Jun 23, 2018","Jun 26, 2018","Jun 22, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16085534-cotton-tenants

But it is young, overly earnest, self-conscious, and sometimes even melodramatic—as are many young writers’ first novels; this is not a criticism, just a fact of immaturity.

If you identify with the people who are looking, you may feel uneasy, uncomfortable with what “you” are doing; you may even feel repelled by the story and prefer distance from the family you are watching; or you may imagine you understand more than you possibly could. If you identify with the family being looked at, you may experience a wonderful new perspective as a voyeur of voyeurs. The setting of The Virgin Suicides is a suburban Michigan town in the 1970s. The story, in the form of a report from an investigation, is told in first-person plural by a now-adult male representative of the small-town residents who are being voyeurs, marveling at the past childhood suicides of the girls in the Lisbon family and unraveling their own complicated feelings, projections, and hurt as unwitting bystanders.I grew up in a New York suburb in the 1950s and ’60s, but the small-town feeling was very much the same—kids went about their business independently, everybody knew who everybody was, there was an assumption of a certain safety . . . except in my family. And probably other families as well, but it was never seen, never talked about. So on July 20, 1968, when my father shot himself, our mess became shockingly public; it was in the local newspaper, so I’m sure there was a stir among the town folk. But I never knew its nature because nobody ever talked to me about it and, unlike the Lisbons, we had no funeral or ceremony.For years I fancied that we weren’t even noticed. But if we were, what did my odd dysfunctional family look like from the point of view of the voyeurs? Who were these onlookers? Why did they gawk but never speak?When my father did his deed, he was living alone in our house—my mother and we kids having fled for safety. After his suicide and before the now-empty house was sold, it was broken into by a bunch of kids who ransacked it—looking for what? Apparently there was interest. But again, I don’t know who was interested because nobody ever told me who they were.A couple of months after the death, when I was in a benign car accident, I got off with a warning for driving barefoot and without my license just by telling the officer my name. It turned out the police were well aware of my family. As was the local hospital. But this fact—that we were known—never landed with a thud in my consciousness until reading this novel.So I admit I started reading with a deliciously vindictive joy—what fun to gawk at the people looking in, breaking into the house, examining the family details. But as I read, I realized this was in fact the point: this story is a lyrical, leisurely look through the façades of suburbia and deep into the first-person narrators—as virgin boys looking at girls (both virgins and sexually active) who are in terrible pain, boys with no idea what to say or how to respond, no capacity to understand the stink of the rot that they describe so well filling and emanating from the Lisbons’ house and the girls’ bodies. The story is very different from my own: the Lisbon girls reach out for help, yet they succumb to rage and their imprisonment, whereas I and my siblings, who simply accepted that there was no help, individually broke out and ran for life. Nevertheless this book was cathartic in ways that surprised me and are far too complicated to articulate. More a reminiscence than a story, The Virgin Suicides winds, slides around time, and lacks urgency. But ultimately the unnamed writers’ effort to reconstruct what had happened in order to understand was moving, satisfying, and beautifully written. It was so real I find myself wishing I could talk to the boys-now-men. And here’s what I would say: “No matter how hard you might have tried, there was no changing the situation. And don’t imagine for one second that you can ever understand the reasons if you haven’t lived firsthand as the stink of living death.” Perhaps this is easier to know for people who have been on the other end of the voyeur’s telescope.Outstanding book....more",Notes are private!,0,47,1,"Jun 19, 2018","Jun 21, 2018","Jun 06, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5188591-the-virgin-suicides

This is a dark, horrifying trip in the unraveling but questioning mind of a man driven mad by the pain of losing a child to a monstrous killer. As in Everett’s very funny book Glyph, there is such a strong story functioning as a spine for the esoteric spins and the chaos of a disintegrating personality and mind that I stayed with it. In fact I was riveted despite the fact that I didn’t understand most of the streaming questions about who we are and if we’re all one thing and the relationship between things and names and people, etc. (Well, maybe I did understand some of it.)So this is not a book for Everyreader. By the way, this story is grounded in rage and seems to be a primal scream in reaction to the despicable actions of the George W. Bush administration—torture, amorality, and disregard for laws of decency. Here’s a fragment that stopped me dead, demanded contemplation and rereading:Deceptions are telling not only about the deceiver, but also about the deceived, the values and perceptions of the deceived, and about the necessary relationship between the deceiver and the deceived. But all of this is obvious; you cannot be deceived unless there is something you really want to believe. You really want to believe that the old vase is valuable, that you are smarter than others, that the child is yours, that there is actually a deity. The great deceiver understands that the deceived actually does all the work. If a deceiver wishes to calcify a person’s acceptance of the deception, he need only suggest that what he has been selling is false. And of course the most devastating deception might be one where we become convinced that we have been deceived, that what we have thought was true really isn’t true, and so we finally reject what is truth. Once deception has been exposed, then we must distrust the new revelation of deception because we know we can be deceived, and since we now know that we can doubt the truth, that particular truth will never be as true again.Heraclitus and his river.

I should either throw in my lot with them, live among them, my friends and colleagues, or take my respectful leave and find out where I do belong. Other people make their peace with who they are, what they’ve become. Why can’t I? Why live the life of a contortionist, scrunched in among the rafters? So that I can maintain the costly illusion that I am not what my father is? Is this pretense worth the effort? To this reasonable argument I offer my father’s own words. You bet your ass. (281)That is the essence of Hank and since this is a character close to my heart, I enjoyed his story, even as it often meandered and got a little hijacked by the details of academic infighting.It should be put on a shelf beside the equally funny or possibly even funnier book, shorter and more tightly written, Dear Committee Members by Julie Schumacher.

Although Circe is the full bloom of Ms. Miller’s talent, the same magnetic human quality infuses the more nascent talent displayed in her first novel, The Song of Achilles, a love story between Patroclus, the first-person narrator, and Achilles. From the first sentence, I was so transported into her mythical land that it was real for me. Imagine reading about a centaur and sensing it as a half-horse/half-man creature standing in your New York City apartment. I experienced that. I saw him. I felt his breath and body heat as if he was here in front of me. Madeline Miller just tells her tales, conveying her pure love of story and deep understanding of human character based on a lifetime of scholarly study which infuses every word she writes. She fell in love with Greek myths when her mother told them to her as bedtime stories.

Then throughout the book, I re-erupted with it, sometimes to Richard Powers, sometimes to whatever force allowed me to understand what came through Powers, through the page, through the people he was writing through, and through the ancient tree memory that pervaded this orgasmic and sweeping novel about all of Nature’s life.This book, the writing, the subject of trees and Life with a capital ""L"" throbs. It's so beautiful and exciting that sometimes it hurts and you have to put the book down and digest. From the opening words, Richard Powers casts a spell, and for me it felt like thick and expansive energy—an altered state. Love. Love of and for trees as the complicated communal beings that they are, and when you feel that, it changes everything—from your relationship to the book you're holding that once was a tree, to your connection to Life, to the incontrovertible knowing that there is nothing that is not alive and remembering and praying, and even if we humans destroy ourselves, Life will always go on.This is not our world with trees in it. It’s a world of trees, where humans have just arrived. [. . .] Trees know when we’re close by. The chemistry of their roots and the perfumes their leaves pump out change when we’re near. . . . When you feel good after a walk in the woods, it may be that certain species are bribing you. So many wonder drugs have come from trees, and we haven’t yet scratched the surface of the offerings. Trees have long been trying to reach us. But they speak on frequencies too low for people to hear.

He is a student and practitioner of ethical leadership—which is really the topic of this book. He is a deeply reflective person. Yes, he tries to make himself look good by talking about his noble motives, but, unless he practiced introspection, he could not relay his introspective self-interrogations about his motives and whether something is ego-driven or directed for the higher good. If he were not compelled to know what’s honest, he would not have told the story of the time he was the very thing he loathes—a horrible bully. I relate to this introspective inquiry because I do it myself—constantly, relentlessly—and I’m amazed so many other people don’t. But I shouldn’t be surprised. As Comey writes, “It is painful to stare openly at ourselves, but it is the only way to change the future. (137)” One can only know this pain by experiencing it, so I believe he is committed to this. Also like me, Comey has had a lifelong struggle with his tendency to think he’s right—overconfidence—and he has had to learn to check his opinions with others, let in belief-disputing information, and monitor his tendency to be impulsive and arrogant. He freely admits all this, and he sees and admires Obama’s enlightened ability to believe in himself yet remain humble enough to learn from others “which doesn’t often exist alongside overconfidence. (155)”I like this guy. I really, really like him. We are made from a lot of the same stuff.I enjoyed hearing about his formative experiences (from a terrifying house break-in when he was a boy to his prosecution of Mafia bosses as a young attorney), and I loved being his student, learning about the working of the Justice Department from such an educated, experienced source. Even if this book weren’t a response to Trump’s firing of him and possible obstruction of justice, it is valuable for the education it offers. Once Comey reached the pinnacle of his career, standing in the Oval Office with the leader of the free world, I could relate to his humility and shock at realizing, “It’s just us”—that’s how I would feel if I were suddenly still just me and had such responsibility. In other words, the protagonist of this memoir, for me, is highly “relatable.”All of this makes it personally painful to read his rationalization—with the agreement of Attorney General Loretta Lynch, who in my opinion shares equal blame—to ever talk publicly about an ongoing investigation, no matter what the precedents, no matter how many people already knew that Hillary Clinton’s email use was being examined. When he publicly confirmed the investigation—referring to it as a “matter” at the direction of Lynch—he set in motion absolutely everything that was to come, ensuring that the FBI would play an untenable role as a political actor, and I’m amazed that a man of his introspective bent would not look at this critical decision and action and at least question it. He screwed up way before the election-changing announcement. His public disclosure in 2015 mandated the later decisions, because it established a “duty to inform.” And his lone-wolf announcement about the investigation's conclusions in July 2016, without checking with the Justice Department because he believed it would politicize things (read the book for the details for that conclusion) belied his own belief in checking what he was certain was true with people of contrasting opinions—and trusting them to be just as fair and responsible as he.I read and liked Hillary Clinton’s What Happened. She admitted that using a private email server was a mistake, and I appreciate that. But I believe it was a mistake of arrogance: it was just too hard to carry two phones and learn the blasted cumbersome and antiquated systems and she didn't want to be bothered. But that's my theory, not founded in provable fact. However her flippant dismissal of the DNC's rigging of the primary (see linked  for more on that) is in her book and, in my opinion, just as mind-blowing as Comey's rationalization of the original disclosure of the email investigation. And I believe that Clinton and Comey suffer from the same blinding arrogance at times, and blaming one more than the other is a distortion of what happened. In some ways, they mirror each other.I like Clinton. As I said, I like Comey a lot—so much that, trusting he would learn from this debacle, I'd consider voting for him if he were running for office. I am not wild about the Democratic Party, but I've always voted for Democrats. Like Comey and Clinton, I've suffered from blinding arrogance, and after reading this and other ""aftermath"" books, I can only conclude that this Blinding Arrogance is the disease that has allowed and perhaps invited the current ""forest fire that is the Trump presidency (275)""—well documented in the last three chapters of this fourteen-chapter book (and I had no problem with any of that, which is largely stuff already in the public record).Now what are we going to do about the disease that led to all this?I defer to the book about those things: Steve Almond's wonderful Bad Stories: What the Hell Just Happened to Our Country.

Not only did he survive, but in later life he made a career out of having survived, exaggerating and feeding off the drama, engendering politically correct reverence from society. But he treats people horribly, is arrogant, self-involved, and manipulative. And privately you watch and think: That’s who he really is. That’s who he would be no matter what had happened to him. He’s a liar. And he’s better than I am because I wouldn’t have survived.Guided Tours of Hell, the first novella in this seething collection of two, is the story of such people. Fittingly, the First International Kafka Congress gathers for a fieldtrip to a concentration camp in Prague, where rivaling writers have it out with each other and thrash around in the hell soup that is the human race’s constant competition for nobility and importance. The writing is hot and rich. And the truth is told.In the second novella, Three Pigs in Five Days, Nina, a young American writer for a magazine about France, follows her American boss boyfriend, Leo, down into the Paris Catacombs—narrow, dark spiraling stairs and hallways deep into the ground where bones are piled high. The story is a bit like that scene in that it is the long, detailed account of Nina’s obsession—she calls it love—with Leo, a man who alternately seduces and rejects her. This is an iconic story, but one I have gotten bored with, and it is a testament to Francine Prose’s writing that I stuck with it. Even though it went on too long for my taste with repeated obsessive thoughts exhaustively recounted, the narrative is good and the fact that Nina has enough self-awareness to “watch her thoughts,” in yogic/Buddhist terms, and hold onto a modicum of healthy skepticism about her own distorted beliefs kept me with it to the end....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Mar 17, 2018","Mar 19, 2018","Mar 16, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/188422.Guided_Tours_of_Hell

(If this book stays in print, they will eventually become meaningless and dated.) Similarly, there were times when I felt style got in the way of communication: “Thanksgiving is about turkey and Christmas is about presents. Grown up, you learn that all holidays are about family, and few can win there. (112)” I read that last sentence over and over and still am not sure what the last clause means. Or “ . . we twisted to look through the back windshield, watching Roy Senior John Henry his wife’s grave. (152)” I know John Henry was a “steel-driving man” and I understand the use of the name as a verb for somebody muscling through, but rather than enhance the meaning, it completely stopped it by making me analyze. And there were a lot of sentences like that. I’m guessing other readers love this kind of inventive use, but to me it felt self-conscious.I loved a section that was entirely epistolary: the letters between a man in prison and his wife. The transitions and reactions constantly surprised me and they conveyed the depth and the complexity of people in a marriage and how they can misunderstand each other. That part of the book was inspired and this motif was repeated so effectively in the epilogue.

Sign up here: https://fable.co/events/author-david-...Almost from the first word, the writing pulls you into a vortex, swirling you through this story, told by a single-voiced chorus of dead gay men. Absolutely mesmerizing. I owe Goodreaders Debbie Annan and Esil a great debt for their s. Never in a million years would I have gravitated to a Y.A. book with this cover and this title. But now that I have read the book, I understand the publisher's reasoning: to get this book to young gay boys and girls who need it. They did the right thing to reach them. But unfortunately it risks turning off a huge adult audience for such glorious literary writing. Please don't be turned off!The chorus of ancestors who intone this story feels like an archetypal entity that we humans are born to recognize. The Greeks used them, and when it is done honestly, it resonates in our bone marrow. I have this Sakti Burman lithograph hanging over my bed:[image]It speaks to my marrow this way.But Two Boys Kissing is a specific story about being gay that anybody who lost friends during the government-ignored AIDS epidemic would appreciate in the most personal way. It threw me back in time to losing my friend and colleague Ron; I relived conferring with my remarkable work friend Bill Johnson who was on the front lines of the crisis providing information to people with AIDS (this book prompted me to google him and find that link); I viscerally remembered seeing a performance of the New York Gay Men's Chorus whose positive energy exploded in the face of the epidemic; and then there was my experience with the valiant rebels of the Gay Men's Health Center who broke rules to take my donation of my dead mother's prescription drugs and assured me, yes, the Interferon would go free to anybody who needed it. All these AIDS warriors are represented in the riveting voice of the omniscient dead spirits who tell this story, and the sound vibrates through your heart.This is mature, deep, transcendent storytelling. The words seem to invade your very cells as they spin off the page.I wish they had published two different covers and done two separate runs to reach the two different audiences: gay kids and literary readers of all ages.Update Just discovered there is another cover:[image]...more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Mar 04, 2018","Mar 05, 2018","Feb 28, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17237214-two-boys-kissing

This collection of fifteen stories and sketches illustrates class differences and tensions in 1910s–'20s Europe, and Mansfield manages to straddle the shallowness culturally required of women in the time and what lies underneath it. (Don't read the preface until after you read the whole book—it reveals stories' endings.) I enjoyed the free-flying nature of the writing. The title story is the real tour de force, but the whole book is worth reading—particularly if you are interested in the early twentieth century upper-crust sound and customs.Here are briefs, written as I finished each story.At the Bay is a cinematic yet microscopic trip from early morning to night in the lives of several families living in a small beach town (probably in New Zealand, unlike the other stories' European locales) The writing is free in the best sense. Unbounded, it flows from reality to fantasies, ripping off facades and showing a more real reality. Although this was written in the early 1920s, the writing is experimentally bold and the people are familiar in any century—because both writing and people are honest.The Garden Party moves like a locomotive, not even pausing as pretensions collide with truth and shatter. Young Laura stands at the apex between the willfully shallow concerns of her upper class garden-party-hosting family and her own awareness of the unfairness of class divides. This is a stunning story. It urgently expresses all the well-honed shallowness endemic to denial of other people's pain, the seductiveness of privilege even as it requires you to deny what you know is true and fair, the self-congratulatory nature of this realization and concurrent superiority complex, the crash of that superior pretension when it encounters authentic devastation, and finally the chaos of being aware of the whole messy drama. This is a story of the 1920s but it has something to say about any era. In the space of a few pages, Mansfield writes an epic. And this is because of her daring leaps—in time, thoughts, and action—trusting the reader to stay with her, and we do. This is the opposite of Women's Fiction: just the essentials, allowing what's not said to scream.I'm really enjoying Mansfield's style in The Daughters of the Late Colonel. Two flibbertigibbet sisters cope after the death of their father, and the way profound concerns about life and meaning surface is wonderful.Mr. and Mrs. Dove is a mating ritual of manners.The Young Girl is kind of a character study of an angry seventeen-year-old upper-class British girl on a holiday in France in the 1920s. I don't know if I'm reading this into the story, but it seems to me to express the frustration women secretly felt in the customs and expressions that feel like being trapped in a corset.Life of Ma Parker, the hopeless story of cleaning woman with a very hard life, could be hard to follow, but by the time I got to this place in the book, I'd become accustomed to the style and transitions.Marriage a la Mode broke my heart. This is a John Cheever type commuter/marriage story set in the 1920s. The Voyage evokes all the feelings of leaving home for somewhere new and unknown, from a child's eye view.Miss Brill is a story that people watchers will relate to. Since I am one, I think it's brilliant.Her First Ball is a time travel trip for the reader and the protagonist. If I ever wanted a firsthand nitty gritty experience of a ball in the early twentieth century, this was it. But not only did it transport me to a new experience, but within the story, the protagonist is further transported to her own old age. Wonderful story.The Singing Lesson is an emotional roller coaster ride that a lot of co-dependent women will relate to. But the genius of it is how Mansfield exposes the fickleness of it. That it should end on a positive note for the protagonist indicates her complete disconnection from true emotional reality. The Stranger again shows the collision of obsession and manners with real feeling. Brilliantly done.Bank Holiday is a word painting, not a story. Like a camera, Mansfield pans around crowds enjoying a holiday (in England somewhere) and zooms in and vividly describes each scene. The writing is so good you can taste it.An Ideal Family, the story of old Mr. Neave in his ""perfect family,"" evokes the work of Mansfield's successors, John Cheever and Shirley Jackson. It's a description of family life that exposes what's hidden. The Lady's Maid is a character sketch of a servant in the form of a monologue. Once again, the truth surfaces through the façade. This is good enough to work as an actor's monologue. It begs to be performed....more",Notes are private!,0,27,1,"Mar 07, 2018","Mar 11, 2018","Feb 13, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1140436.The_Garden_Party_and_Other_Stories

I was familiar with Steve Almond from his short stories, but this is straight journalism at its best (which he teachesThis book is staggeringly good. I was familiar with Steve Almond from his short stories, but this is straight journalism at its best (which he teaches at Harvard). (It is clear from Almond’s thought processes and messages to students, presented in this volume, that he is a great teacher and seasoned journalist.)In ing, there is a tendency to break down books about politics into bullet-point messages, and I hesitate to do that because it would misrepresent Bad Stories as something much smaller than it is.So what is it? Because of Almond’s conversational writing style, it is easily readable and offers up documented mind-blowing insights like hors d’oeuvres. Hence, Bad Stories is a huge, readable 237-page revelation of profound insights gleaned from connecting dots that we-the-people largely prefer not to see. At its root is the premise that if we tell ourselves, and believe, bad stories, we will inevitably live them—belief creates reality, or more accurately, those beliefs we don’t fully acknowledge, examine, and understand create unconscious actions that create reality. This is not a new idea, but Almond makes it new by spotlighting our shadow (our denied self, per Jung) through the bad stories that we believe so fervently that they have resulted in our current predictable situation—starting with our belief that we are a country founded on the notion that all people are created equal. (That took me-the-reader instantly into the eye of the upset and my body went into such an extreme reaction, I had to put the book down and go for a walk in nature to recover.)In each chapter, Almond relates stories—from Moby-Dick, to tales of the reasons for the Electoral College, to a magical liberal belief that court jesters like Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert can rescue us (even as they erode our urgency to react seriously). The stories vibrate—and sometimes electrocute the unsuspecting reader—with upsetting truth because they are not relegated to Republican or Democratic or Independent or anarchistic belief. They are we-the-people’s stories (and although it seems obvious, I’ll add that the Fourth Estate, which is fiercely examined, is a component of we-the-people). We own these stories and we created our present environment out of them. They are stories written by all of us, but the foundational one is the creation of white American society—the story of people who founded a country via genocide, enslaved people, knew we were doing the wrong thing but justified it, and now function with a legacy of subconscious fear of retribution from “dark people,” resulting in the present paranoia and nationalism. (For a look at the repercussions of this bad story--enduring trauma--from the side of those who were victimized, see Monnica Williams's article.) We are a country who enjoys not knowing; clings to our “unserious” right not to know or care or even vote; deeply enjoys fear, loathing, and anger at “other;” unknowingly cherishes the negative pleasure of being helpless and will twist it into a pretzel-shaped projection if confronted by contradiction; and will defend our beliefs, condemning those who do not agree as “the enemy,” because we believe our life depends on it. This is a brilliant and deeply upsetting book; the antidote for a denied shadow is illumination, and the shock at seeing a denied part of ourselves can be an identity crisis. But out of that crisis can arise the possibility of “dream[ing] up stories that offer a vision of the American spirit as one of kindness and decency . . . ”For the brave and curious, here is the book’s website: Bad Stories. It launches April 1, 2018, from Red Hen Press, which was kind enough to send me a  copy.* * *A contemplation, several days after finishing this book:I wish everybody would read Bad Stories, but that is a fantasy. My wish stems from the book's ""slow-bomb clarity"" exploding in my head, concurrent with learning that the Parkland students, survivors of the mass shooting at their high school, essentially trained rigorously for their present activism by researching, amassing a database of facts, and debating both sides of gun control as part of a Broward County debate program, one of the largest in the country, ""that teaches extemporaneous speaking from an early age."" What's happening is not magic. It is the product of methodical work colliding with horrible trauma.The revelations of Bad Stories are our secret addictions to feeling angry, scared, helpless, or removed from the current mess. Our addiction to the ENTERTAINMENT of it all. The easiest way to evolve out of that is (1) to acknowledge it, then (2) train, as these students did, and therefore be able to (3) act. I am a writer who is uncomfortable confronting people about their beliefs, so I would hate knocking on doors to try to persuade people to vote for a certain candidate. But I can write. So I am writing this little contemplation. And I'll look for other venues where writing can be helpful. (Can you guess what my addiction has been? Helplessness.)If you are out-of-your-mind angry, maybe use that energy to organize people.If you are crazy scared, maybe join some organization (there are certainly enough of them) being organized by more energetic, confrontational folks, and follow.Yelling on Facebook or Twitter is no more an action than thoughts and prayers are.

This book belongs in the “stories of intrigue” group that includes Amsterdam and Sweet Tooth. In some ways, I suppose these books are more commercial than the ones that ride on even more nuanced undercurrents of denied, sublimated, and repressed human feeling (although, to be honest, all of his books contain these), but I actually prefer the subtler books (Saturday, The Children Act, On Chesil Beach). Atonement straddles both categories, and Nutshell (hilarious) and The Cement Garden (first novel) occupy their own categories. But honestly, why quibble and categorize? I will read anything this man writes. Why? I think of the famous obvious answer, “It’s the economy, stupid.” With McEwan, “It’s the writing.”I can pick any page and find wonderful writing.

All this is packed into Madeline Miller’s fantastic (and I mean that literally) prose, using mythical gods and goddesses. You do not have to be a fan of the classics and Greek mythology to love this book! I was not a fan of mythology. In high school I stumbled over the Greek names and I now blush to admit that when I was in theater school, I was bored to death with The Odyssey when our director decided we would create a play based on our feelings about it. Mine were: If I read about the “rosy fingers of dawn” creeping anywhere one more time, I’m going to puke. Ignorant young me. Odysseus is a fully formed man in this novel about how our human foibles play out and it’s all seen through the eyes of Circe, a woman in exile, a single mother, a powerful witch whose bravery has nothing to do with magic.Author Madeline Miller is thirty-nine years old and could pass for a simple “pretty girl” in her twenties if she chose. But in this epic, she leads with her ancient heart and her hefty classical education steeped in what feels like a love affair of many lifetimes with her subject: the human mess writ large through ancient characters that she brings to life anew with a wild imagination and impeccable technique. Her descriptions are out of this world and the ending makes you feel the inexpressible joy and gratitude of being mortal in this crazy world we live in....more",Notes are private!,0,72,2,"Apr 12, 2018not set","Apr 14, 2018not set","Feb 01, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/35959740-circe

Tell me straight. How do you know what it feels like to be a woman? How do you know the sensations, the thoughts women rarely say about being with men? Don’t lie. I promise I’ll keep it a secret.”I think all good writers become their characters and hence, they are writing from an authentic place that is much bigger than who they are in day-to-day life. Plus, there is always research—asking a good friend for details. I’ve done both of these things. When I was writing mostly plays, I felt wonderful when I saw how easily male actors fit into the parts I wrote—how organic the feelings were, how the dialogue came easily. I think I write real men, and I know McEwan inhabits the Big Place and employs research to write real women—for goodness sake, he says as much in this book. But still …This meandering but ultimately astonishing spy story is my seventh Ian McEwan book, the fifth with a fully complex protagonist or major character who is a woman, and his gut-level understanding is better than that in a slew of books by women. I guess the answer is simply that he is a much better writer than anybody who writes shallow or stereotypical people. But still …This book invites writerly concerns, so I’ll note some more: With this story, more than the other McEwans I’ve read, I was fixated by how he not only moved time and plot forward via narrative alone, but in the process, he fleshed out relationships through time; relationships that were merely first meetings in a scene were then pushed into intimacy using narrative alone, and you feel and care about them as if you’ve read slow development through scenes. (I think the only other instance I’ve read this much narrative and had it do the work of scenes is John Williams’s amazing Stoner.) To my mind, through his body of work, McEwan offers a master class in a difficult, often impossible, use of narrative. And in this book, his repeating themes of lying, plus the delightfully subversive playing with the reader/writer relationship (balance of power—another theme) along with the art of turning life into fiction, plus subtle teasing of the very reader of this book were like musical movements within a cohesive symphony. For instance, talking about books and writing, the protagonist, a spy, talks to her asset, a writer who does not know he is an asset:I said I didn’t like tricks, I liked life as I knew it re-created on the page. He said it wasn’t possible to re-create life on the page without tricks. (218)(To get the full joke of this, you must read the book.) Well anyway, you are so much fun, Ian. Truly a “writer’s writer.” And since I’m a writer, I really do think I understand what you’re doing and how you’re doing it.

(All the others have been library cThis eighth book in my current Ian McEwan binge is the one I have now purchased just after reading a digital copy. (All the others have been library copies.) The reason being that not only is this story of one day in the life of a neurosurgeon so brilliant and moving that it reduced me to a sweaty puddle, but reading a single line of McEwan's narrative lights a fire in my writer brain. He reminds me about full-sensory life and how to express it—color, heat/cold, smell, etc.—evoking the words of his thirteen-year-old Atonement protagonist, Briony Tallis, who claims that she can describe anything; McEwan can, in such original language that it’s mesmerizing. Also, in my ongoing study of his narrative—and I’m definitely reading as a student—with this book I began to see the minute parts: how he uses literal movement (journeys, panoramic views, even travel from room to room of a house) to convey what would otherwise be stagnant inner thoughts and dialogue. I’d been wondering why what drives me to abandon books (excessive inner dialogue) has the opposite effect on me with McEwan’s work, and I think the secret is movement. He has figured out how to create so much of it that what would otherwise feel inert vibrates on the ride. And the rhythm of the literal movement in journey, punctuated by background or informative narrative is impeccable; it never drags; it's as if a metronome is marking the edges between the different uses of narratives and he never goes beyond a reader's organic attention span, and slowly, fearlessly he builds the book, escalating from narrative to heart-pounding pure action.There are only a few writers’ books that inspire me this way. If I read one piece in The Stories of John Cheever, I’m fired up for whatever I’m working on. Same with a chapter of my thrice-read copy of John Williams’s Stoner. Percival Everett has recently joined this club, especially with his books I Am Not Sidney Poitier and Erasure. And, prior to finishing this book, my only question with McEwan was which of his literary symphonies to buy. Atonement, On Chesil Beach, and The Children Act are probably better plots, and Nutshell is a hilarious animal unlike any of his other literary offspring, but I've purchased Saturday for the inspiration impact of a single sentence or paragraph and its palpable pulsating humanity.11/26/19 Update on reading a second timeIt's still wonderful. However . . . Because I knew what was coming later in the book, I made a special effort to visualize the minutely described house the neurosurgeon lives in; this is important information (and there is a reason for the detailed, almost transcendent fascination with life details, which you may or may not realize after you finish the book). During my first reading I was confused by the house layout.Why? Because I live in a brownstone apartment building in New York City. It is a walk-up and I live on the top floor. When you walk into my building, you are on the first floor, and you then must hike up four flights of stairs that everybody who has ever visited me has complained about, claiming I live in the stratosphere, and, after eying my dog and querying how many times a day I do this, responding ""How on earth do you do this?"" and ""This must be the reason for your phenomenally good health but I could never in a million years live this way because the climb just about killed me."" But I am losing my point. My point is that there are five floors starting with the ground floor, which is also the first floor. Mr. McEwan calls the ground floor ""the ground floor"" where the front door to the neurosurgeon's house is, and subsequently there is a set of down stairs to a kitchen and maybe a library although I may have misplaced that (I really should draw this) and perhaps I'm wrong and the library is upstairs . . . which brings me to the first flight up (which, if the kitchen is downstairs, is actually the second flight) to what all sane people would call the second floor. But in this book it is sometimes is called the first floor. Followed by a floor, which by Mr. McE's logic would be the second floor, but is in fact the third floor where the master bedroom is. Or maybe the master is on the second floor, wherever that is, and the son's bedroom is on the real third floor. As you can see, I am still confused about the architecture of the damned house. Suffice it to say the house has three floors . . . or maybe more, including the kitchen, which is finally identified on page 153 as the ""basement kitchen!"" In short, I really think there should be an architectural rendering included.But now to the really important stuff: On a second reading, I'm even more moved by the perfection of having a neurosurgeon—who throughout the book makes seemingly random yet transcendent observations about why we humans do what we do and believe what we choose—live a whole-life human drama, complete with numinous glimpses of a Bigger Reality, in one day. (The post-9/11 pre-Iraq war tumultuous political environment makes this a timely book for the chaos and upset of right now.) And finally, I was truly devastated this time around, deeply understanding McEwan's point—that our only purpose is love as we struggle ""here as on a darkling plain / Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight, / Where ignorant armies clash by night."" (""Dover Beach"" by Matthew Arnold, which is so well used in this magnificent book.)Spoiler question to others who have read this book: (view spoiler)[Does Henry Perowne die at the end? The first time I read this book, I believed the final lines meant that he did: ""There's always this, is one of his remaining thoughts. And then: there's only this. And at last, faintly, falling: this day is over."" I believed that the bruise on Perowne's chest was a sign of something awful that kills him.

The mistake New Yorkers made was thinking that of course everybody could see the act .I certainly saw it, but I was also so clobbered by the Recession that I saw the rage, desperation, and racism that was throbbing in our culture, and I was terrified that, with his P.T. Barnum instincts, Trump would trump his own plan (to lose) by having the con succeed. Wolff delineates the shock of the turnaround, obliterating the game plan to “win by losing” and become the most famous person in the world, making more money.All of it is chronicled in Wolff’s free-wheeling book, and really there is nothing new about Trump here. But it is somewhat pleasurable to read confirmation of what we knew and saw, reported by somebody who was a self-described “fly on the wall” of the West Wing and has actual tapes of Trump machine insiders speaking the truth. And on further reflection (this revision added 1/27/18), the validation of many people's belief that Trump never intended to win the election may be the one bit of real news in this book. It explains so many things that have happened and continue to happen: the complete lack of preparation of Trump and his entire staff to assume responsibilities (because it would have been wasted energy, since losing was the plan) and the fact that Trump seems to have no interest in learning history, protocol, or what is or is not legal. It never interested him and continues to bore him. (The future ramifications of this are laid out in a wonderful Bloomberg article by Tim O'Brien, author of TrumpNation: The Art of Being The Donald, who was sued by Trump for libel.)Almost as much as Trump, Steve Bannon is a star of this book. He is an angry man, with zero political experience, eager to wage a battle, in search of his power to do so. When he finds it by being the only person who has read books and can speak literately about history in the Trump White House, he sets to work “doing things”: Just doing things became a Bannon principle, the sweeping antidote to bureaucratic and establishment ennui and resistance. It was the chaos of just doing things that actually got things done. Except, even if you assumed that not knowing how to do things didn’t much matter if you just did them, it was still not clear who was going to do what you wanted to do. Or, a corollary, because nobody in the Trump administration really knew how to do anything, it was therefore not clear what anyone did.Sean Spicer, whose job was literally to explain what people did and why, often simply could not—because nobody really had a job, because nobody could do a job. (pp. 63-64)After reading the chapter called “Jarvanka,” I was amazed and disgusted at the fact that nowhere in any of the people involved with Trump is a thought about service—that the job is to serve the millions of people who elected them, let alone all those who didn't. According to this book, Ivanka and Jared saw this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity (the chance to work in the White House) and decided to seize it, with the understanding that if the next step was running for office themselves, Ivanka would go first and be the first woman president! Not only is there no thought of WHY and that it has something to do with working for the people, but the sense of entitlement obliterates even the possibility of respect for people who know what they're doing because they've spent their entire adult lives learning through service, and by the time they get to the White House, they know the rules of law and governance! In the chapter on Russia, Wolff writes that Trump could understand politicians, but he was finding it hard to get a handle on these bureaucrat government lifer types. He couldn't grasp what they wanted. Why would they, or anyone, be a permanent government employee? “‘They max out at what? Two hundred grand? Tops,’ he said, expressing something of wonder.” Trump has never felt an impulse to serve anybody so he has no comprehension of people who commit their lives to the greater good. This point later illuminates the foundation for Trump’s inability to comprehend other people: Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s lawfully correct decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. In Sessions’s worldview, the greater good, and his “life’s work” was “to curb, circumscribe, and undo the interpretation of federal law that had for three generations undermined American culture and offended his own place in it. (155)” Nor does Trump really grok his former pal Steve Bannon, who was driven by a conviction that we are in the midst of civil war and restoration of white American values circa 1950-1965 is paramount. Trump has no convictions other than an incontrovertible belief in his unassailable grandeur.I’ve never been able to make sense out of Trump’s feelings about Jews. His father was a well-known anti-Semite; Trump believes there are Nazis who are good people; his son-in-law and by-conversion-daughter and their children are Jewish. In a chapter titled “Goldman,” I finally got some help: For Trump, giving Israel to Kushner was not only a test, it was a Jewish test: the president was singling him out for being Jewish, rewarding him for being Jewish, saddling him with the impossible hurdle for being Jewish—and, too, defaulting to the stereotyping belief in the negotiating powers of Jews. “Henry Kissinger says Jared is going to be the new Henry Kissinger,” Trump said more than once, rather a combined compliment and slur. (142)Fire and Fury profiles a White House in chaos and a president with serious mental problems who has no attention span or capacity to listen, read, and learn—a man who made four-year-old-bored-boy faces when briefed about the specifics of the Constitution or health care reform or any policy matter, a man who landed the most important job in the world without meaning to, a man whose main concerns are being liked, getting richer, and playing golf.I read the Kindle version of this book, which like the hardback, was launched early in response to Trump’s attempt to block publication. It is in severe need of proofreading. (My favorite typo: “Bannon, with mounting ferocity and pubic (sic) venom . . .”) As an editor, I am annoyed, however the sloppiness does match its subjects, who have zero respect for care and the painstaking effort it takes to do something well. So there is a certain karmic justice and artistic symmetry to the current picture: (1) This blustery self-promoter with no scruples rides the free publicity of the media’s fascination with his insanity, and he uses the coverage to stoke self-righteous rage and promises to use the loopholes and outright illegal tactics that made him wealthy to benefit the little guys, so they vote for him.(2) Once in office, his lack of knowledge of, let alone care about, the law as well as his self-involved rage and inability to understand anything other than winning/losing or praise/criticism throw the White House and the world into chaos.(3) A well-known “slasher” writer uses the open access granted him by an administration who loves attention and has no understanding of who the writer is (because vetting is not their style), not to mention the difference between on and off the record, and he hangs out, amiably observing and making nice, then succeeds in weaving his observations into an addictive story—an almost impossible-to-accomplish narrative given the a level of insanity, chaos, and its myriad participants—and it all goes into a sloppily made book, rushed to publication to cash in on the free publicity of its subject trying to quash it . . . and hopefully it eventually does the job the Trump voters wanted: blowing up the swamp.1/9/18 PostscriptBecause I truly believe that compassion is a much more powerful force for change than ire, I want to add a recommendation. Read Jennifer Weiner's 1/8/18 NY Times editorial, What the President Doesn't Get About Dogs. It infused me with horrified compassion for just how lonely, isolated, and without the capacity to know, find, or receive unconditional love this man is. I actually hurt for him. But he still needs to have a fitness evaluation and be held accountable for what he has done.* 10/10/18 UpdateUnemployed former employees of Carrier and Honeywell are now demonstrating at a Trump Rally in Erie, PA (see Facebook).

In short, I loved it!First-person storyteller Paul Milliron, in 1957, a school administrator, looks back on his childhood with his widowed father, two younger brothers, and the amazing housekeeper/teacher Rose Llewellyn /Morrie Morgan duo who positively sparkle with iconoclastic character. Paul is a prodigy who loves Latin, remembers all of his dreams, and has ""blindsight""—which, even if Doig didn't intend it, allows me my theory about hearing a whispering older version of himself.

The story seems loosely woven at first, but trust the weave—it is really well paced. Along with the escalating tension of the crazy killer, H. H. Holmes, the historical details sustain a reader with an interest in landscape designer Frederick Law Olmstead, Daniel Burnham and well-known architects, and unexpected bits like how the G.E. vs. Westinghouse bid to light the fair informed the history of electricity, the fact that Walt Disney’s father worked on construction, visceral details of architecture, landscape and gory mutilations in the 1890s, and the birth of the Ferris Wheel and the Pledge of Allegiance (it was written for schoolchildren to honor the dedication of the Chicago World’s Fair in 1892!), as well as all the commonplace products that debuted for the first time at the fair. Of particular interest was the peculiar cultural phallic obsession (my description, not Larson’s) with “out-Eifeling” the Eifel Tower that had become in 1889 the tallest structure in the world. I had no phallus envy or pre-existing longing to school myself in these areas, but I found myself intrigued with my unexpected education and admiring of how this specific story illuminated the much larger human condition: ashes to ashes; dust to dust.

This is my primal, private language, so even though our writing styles are almost opposite—McEwan writes effortless narrative descriptions and inner dialogues that go on for pages, and I prefer the fewest words possible—I feel as if I’ve found a kindred artist. And that alone makes me love his work.Amsterdam is about the wiggly nature of our judgments about what is or is not moral and justified behavior, about how “spin” makes our human herd so certain that one thing is good and another is evil, about how our self-delusions (particularly those founded in elite personal perfectionism and devoid of a connection to other people) can so easily pass as self-truths when it is convenient, and finally about how, when we devolve completely into this insane ego battle, we destroy ourselves. This is the kind of material I’ve spent my life thinking about and it brings to mind both that old Mad Magazine cartoon “Spy vs. Spy” and the conclusion to McEwan’s magnificent Nutshell about the roiling human soup we are born into—“one huge unhappy family with domestic problems that were of their nature insoluble. (p. 166, Amsterdam)”Despite my enjoyment of the theme, I do have some criticisms: the ending, telescoped way in advance, struck me as unbelievable and comparable to the wackiness of “Spy vs. Spy” rather than in keeping with a novel that, in all other ways, felt realistic....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,"Dec 23, 2017","Dec 26, 2017","Dec 14, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6862.Amsterdam

I know they are said to be “new wI am a Murakami fan (I’ve loved his novels), so I was surprised that I didn’t love this collection of short stories. I know they are said to be “new work,” but some of them seemed immature, and I wondered if they were earlier pieces that had been pulled out of a bottom drawer. Here are briefs written right after I finished each story—a very uneven mix:“Drive My Car” is really a story about how we are all actors, briefly playing roles, then resuming something else which is different each time we resume it. “All the world’s a stage . . .” a la Haruki Murakami. An actor hires a female driver, tells her the story of his marriage and loss of his wife. And then sleeps. As a former actor, I love this stuff. As a writer, I sigh a great “ah” at the “Once upon a time” cleanliness of the storytelling and unpredictable outcome.I’m either not the right audience for a nostalgic story about twenty-year-olds, “Yesterday,” or this story doesn’t work. It felt like an homage to a bunch of different writers (Salinger, Woody Allen, Paul McCartney) and frankly, had it not been in this book, I wouldn’t have finished reading it. It felt like really young work that Murakami attempted to revise into something more than it is.“An Independent Organ” is a more mature story than the previous one, but I’m ambivalent about it. Didn’t love or dislike it. Just felt a certain interest but remove about this story of a man discovering his heart, and the notion that women are born with a special ability to lie without feeling guilty. Huh? The next story, “Scheherazade,” was quite intriguing, partly because certain aspects of it were almost identical to a portion of my last novel. Although this story was clean and tightly written, which is one of the attributes of Murakami's novels that I love, the ending just petered out.“Kino” is the story of a guy who’s separated from his heart. The structure is slightly awkward and the theme feels like the kind of thing you might write in college, certain that you are onto profound insights about pain—a precursor to Murakami’s wonderfully mythological and mature novels of quest. This one felt adolescent and therefore I was unmoved by the experience of a character who is unmoved by most normal life connections.[Inner quandary: I’m at the point after “Kino” where I would normally abandon a book. Actually I’ve gone way past that point. I normally would have given up after the second story. But it’s Murakami! I’m mystified by the structural problems (unsolved by an editor), and the adolescent feeling contradicts credits saying that this is new work; some of the stories were published in magazines only a few years ago. Were they old in chronological time at first publication? Did The New Yorker publish “Yesterday” merely because it was Murakami and the writer homage fit their specs? Is Murakami capitalizing on his old work and not worrying about its maturity? I really want to stop reading this, never say anything about it to anyone, and move on. But there are only two stories left. Maybe I’ll like them.]I wonder how many of us writers have a lifelong love affair with Kafka’s The Metamorphosis such that we’ve written homages or parodies. “Samsa in Love” is Murakami’s turn at it, and as a person who adores the Kafka story, I really enjoyed this. Murakami reverses the waking metamorphosis: although he never specifies that Gregor Samsa was formerly a dung beetle who wakes to find himself a man, I assume that is the case. Murakami follows Kafka’s style for this story, and it is lovely. (Maybe someday a publisher will put together a whole book of stories that are an homage to Kafka’s Metamorphosis. If that happens, this one should be included.)And finally, the title story “Men without Women.” This isn’t a story; it’s a rambling, stream-of-conscious inner dialogue about losing one’s first love.

What tension, what detail, what a wonderful portrait of a child writer awash in the drama of her fantastic certainty and imagination. I wager anybody who writes will remember themselves through the character of young Briony, whose self-aggrandizing fantasies and need to be the hero of her own drama lead to tragedy. She embodies a time of life that some of us grow out of and then hate ourselves for … until we mature enough to realize that everybody does this stuff and we forgive ourselves for being human. But in this astonishing masterpiece, McEwan, whom I would call a “writer’s writer” because of his ability to reveal that very private process that is usually unspoken, takes us well past that … to atonement.Usually I’m bored by a lot of inner dialogue. I’ve come to associate it with Women’s Fiction where mostly I find it to be overwriting. I had no problems with whole chapters of inner dialogue in this book—perhaps because so much of it was the kind of psychological searching for who and how we really are that I’ve always done. Plus, the writing is spectacular.This is my second Ian McEwan book. The first was his hysterically funny Nutshell. Atonement is nothing like Nutshell.

This story of a destitute writer is my worst writer's nightmare, and probably the worst nightmare of many people who work in the arts. I've known so many unsuccessful, desperate, bitter artiste-victims and Hamsun's depiction of the first-person protagonist is flawless. He vacillates from arrogance and grandiosity to self-loathing and worthlessness. The portrayal of hunger—how it erodes the mind so we quickly slide into a paranoiac or euphoric fog of fantasy—made reading this agony.

I write it solo and I’ve also written with two partners. I understand how mobile identity is and, like identity, how story comes from nothing and whirls around in the void you necessarily drop into in order to “receive” fiction, and, if one is lucky, skilled, and very persistent, eventually the impulses become something cohesive. Writing story is an act of faith—as is the act of being somebody. And this book writes the raw experience of both those things (identity and story writing) via a dying father in a nursing home writing a story that his son is assigned to complete. And the two writers merge, and it’s like colors of paint whirling in a paint mixer.That said, this story stays in the mixer, never congealing into something cohesive. The bits that are story are as good as anything Everett writes and a reason to keep reading, but, in addition to being impenetrable, the Kindle version is riddled with typos and things that may or may not have been typos (numerals in the middle of sentences with no meaning—remnants of manual page numbers in a Word document that got dumped into the Kindle format?) and no quotation marks around dialogue. Despite that, Percival Everett fans—and I now count myself as one—may appreciate it because it’s part of the canon and is a wild experiment. In a chapter near the end called “Ontology and Anguish” there is this passage which comprises its own section: There are those who understand and those who do not. The way you tell the difference is easy. The ones who do not understand have not yet killed themselves.My interpretation of this is that until you have, in a sense, died by falling into the void where all creation comes from (story, identity), you can’t understand what this book is about. I do think I understand as well as a person can, but that doesn’t mean this experiment works. I wish it did, but in my opinion, the best way to write about the void is to create real story, which Percival Everett does brilliantly in other books. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,"Nov 23, 2017","Nov 25, 2017","Nov 23, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15792900-percival-everett-by-virgil-russell

When I read the first short story, “Cerulean,” I was left puzzled. And then something interesting happened. And a different something happened after the second story—both were physical reactions to material that passes from the page into you, almost bypassing the intellect. And because of this, I’ve decided to  each story by largely keeping the content’s secret and instead saying what happened immediately on finishing it.__________“Cerulean” left me mystified. The writing of what appeared to be a slightly spooky domestic drama was clear but I had no idea what this story was trying to say. I closed the book, suddenly overcome with a kind of peaceful exhaustion. I closed my eyes and this peace took over—as if I were the blue sky. Cerulean blue. I think this was the point—merging with blue of “All That Is,” and because of that, having to fake being anything else.“Turned Out” is a very short, layered rodeo story packed with such subtle tension that it’s hard to breathe. But it ends with a release. Power is used to control oneself in a trapped situation, and when freedom comes, it makes you go oooofff and resume easiness. “Wolf at the Door” had more intellectual resonance for me than physical: We are all wolves-at-the-door beings; our animal nature is always there. And when we kill an animal, we kill ourselves. Some of us know this and are devastated by knowing. Others ignore it.“Dicotyles Tajacu”[image] This dicotyles tajacu pig plays a part in this story which is a continuation of “Cerulean,” only this time there is no release. There's just a sad feeling of being trapped, helplessly stuck in our heads as we kill off animals who are at the mercy of our screwed up heads. Sad story.“Pissing on Snakes” made me laugh. Not a big “ha-ha” funny laugh, but a resigned one about the trials of negotiating life.“Wash” left me feeling kind of empty and awash—washed out—so maybe that’s its point. Not satisfying, but it is what it is: sometimes you just “don’t know nothing” and are incapable of hearing anything.“Throwing Earth” is a magnificent slice of life with a pithy rancher whose actions come from a place the mind can never touch. It’s a sad story, but an honest one. So I feel kind of like the rancher—accepting and nonverbal about it.“Squeeze” is a Western race story. Race is never not there. It’s exhausting and it’s a squeeze on life. I feel squeezed. And not in a good way.“Big Picture” is the big picture and it left me heaving and moaning, “Oh man.” It is so hard to be human. Even harder to be true and honest. And even harder to be a black man who is true and honest, let alone trusting. This story was the final (third) act of the character in the stories “Cerulean” and “Dicotyles Tajacu.” It gives the whole book structure.____________This book of short stories will frustrate readers who want clear stories, but for those who have read other Percival Everett books and are comfortable with indefinable resonance and visceral reactions, enjoy!A Note from the Morning After ReadingThe book was next to my keys, awaiting return to the library, when it hit me: In this tiny (154 pages) book of stories, Percival Everett really writes everything there is to say about the struggle to both be true to yourself—discerning what is true, and at the same time interact with and connect to others who may not see or understand your truth or even care about truth.

So I holed up in my New York City apartment and started having fun.Jump Cut to Alaska: Dawn Baumann Brunke, who edited a spiritual magazine, got a forwarded email from one of the many people I'd sent my resume to.

So I zipped over and up to Wasilla (no, she can't see Sarah Palin's house from there) and we had a blast—laughing and making videos where we each played the character we had written.

Damned if I Do, a short story anthology, is my fourth Everett book and it is just as unique as the three novels I've recently read, and within it, the stories are each unique animals. I wrote the following briefs immediately after reading each story:In the first short story, ""The Fix,"" which could have been written by Shirley Jackson, I felt the full weight of our neediness. It was strange to feel such a crushing weight and, at the same time, relief at having it dramatized and exposed.There is no way to describe ""House"" without spoiling it. Different people will understand or not understand it differently. But for me it is a dark expression of our helplessness to control or stop this dream we call life. Enough said.""Alluvial Deposits"" is a slice-of-life Western story about the separation between people. ""True Romance"" was a true romance, but it has nothing to do with lovey-dovey stuff. It was a loner ranch guy's story. To say more would ruin it, and I love it so much it is requiring all my self-control to shut up. If you are a writer, I predict you will be in love with this story. If you are a reader only, maybe you too, but I could be wrong. For me, it embodies all my writer's longing for purity, and the fantastic ending is the fantasy victory over all that corrupts. I had to stop reading after this one; I needed savoring time before imbibing more.I read the title ""Age Would Be That Does"" repeatedly. I tried it backwards and still can't make sense out of it. If somebody else reads this story and understands the title, please enlighten me. Despite my bafflement, I had no problems with the story about two aging men who keep each other going. Lovely.""The Appropriation of Cultures"" settles it for me: Percival Everett is a genius. By the end I realized I'd been mouth-breathing, practically panting, for the entire story. This is positively brilliant. I nominate Percival Everett for President of the United States!In ""Warm and Nicely Buried,"" a body disappears, cops look for it, and resolve the mystery. But this is really a slice-of-life mood story more than a whodunit. It works well coming after ""The Appropriation of Cultures"" which has such a solid plot. Right pace, right feel. Boy, this collection is well done.Three cowboy types and a horse occupy ""Afraid of the Dark."" It's another slice of life, but the title gives you a metaphor to think about. ""Epigenesis."" I had epigenesis mixed up with epigenetics. After looking it up, I understand the story better. According to Wikipedia, it is the ""process by which plants, animals and fungi develop from a seed, spore or egg through a sequence of steps in which cells differentiate and organs form."" There is also a character named Alan Turing who is not the guy who developed computers and coding. ""Epigenesis"" is a fish tale about a guy in a midlife crisis. Yes, there's a talking fish for part of it. And there is development of character equivalent to epigenesis. I like this story, and I suspect if I let it silently grow inside me without talking about it, it will develop into a love organ.I can't understand a word of the very short graphic (yes, there are pictures) short story ""The Devolution of Nuclear Associability,"" except to say that it has something to do with our complete inability to express what we mean. And it made me laugh. ""The Last Heat of the Summer"" starts like a nostalgic tale of boys' youth—the kind of thing Stephen King writes without horror. You have no idea what's coming. Is this a story out of sequence? Is this real? It feels like an ancient folktale, retold for now. One must be attuned to metaphor for this writing. I am. I was. And therefore I recognize myself here. I'm glad I'm willing to admit that.Mostly in my life I've done the right thing. This is not only because I have a moral code that directs me, but it is also a sense that doing the wrong thing can be a slippery slope with no return. Doing the right thing is pleasurable to me, but I gave vent to the consequently repressed inner wrongdoer in my last novel, and it was euphoric. In the last story of this anthology, ""Randall Randall,"" Percival Everett writes the worst nightmare of this bad choice slide for an ordinary pissed-off person—just like most of us.

This second time through, I read slower, receiving medicine that cannot be gulped. And on page 114, I thought to pause and look up a line, so casually dropped that if you didn’t know the reference (I didn’t), you might miss it: “I celebrate myself, and sing myself.” A search unearthed what may be the soul of this book: Walt Whitman’s “Song of Myself"" from Leaves of Grass. Whitman, who appears in a cameo, wrote an epic poem that says pretty much all there is to say about existence. And, although Everett’s book is nothing at all like Whitman’s poem, now I understand this book a lot better; everything from the title to the extraordinary ending took on new vibrations—although I could never and would never want to parse or analyze this amazing book.Earlier Postings about this Book6/19/20 As I read book after book on antiracism and support Black Lives Matter from the safety of my COVID-free apartment, as I see all the lists of ""Black Writers to Read,"" it absolutely kills me that more people don't know about Percival Everett's work. So I am reposting this  from a couple of years ago. Percival Everett is an iconic, brilliant writer. This hilarious book's ending is prescient. Without seeming political, as only Everett can, he dramatizes living in a racist country and predicts where we are now. This book is wonderful!Original  4/24/2018Hilarious and moving, a western as only Percival Everett could imagine and write it. Curt Marder, a “no-good, free-loadin’, back-slindin’, dog-lipped son-of-a-mud-rat” who owes everybody money, hires Bubba, a Black tracker, and the two of them, along with a kid called Jake, set off to find the White men who masqueraded as Indians and burned down Marder’s homestead, killed his dog, and kidnapped his wife—the worst sin being the dog murder, as far as the White cowboys in this rollicking tale are concerned. This is a wild chase, a quest story, an 1871 western buddy road trip, a social satire with plenty of substance under the laughs.

But that's where the similarity ends.A couple of chapters into this book, I found myself exhausted from constant leaping—couch to computer to look up poststructural philosophy, Latin, German, French, obscure historic bits, etc. I was almost ready to admit I'm not well educated enough to read this satire—about academic thought and expression versus passion, existential despair, and a longing for truth—when the story got good. So finally I simply accepted that I'm not well educated enough (just like so many of the adults who are bollixed by narrator genius baby Ralph in this wild abduction caper) and I read the darned story, allowing facts and meaning to fly over my head with impunity.It turns out that's not a bad way to read this dense but unaccountably fast book. The story was always inventive, sometimes very funny, and sometimes sad—as in the other two Everett books that I've read, there is a longing to find the beginning of truth that I relate to on a heart level. Even though this book feels like an exercise about intellectualism that gets in its own way (unless you are an academic philosopher, philologist, art historian, and mathematician), and even though the references and a lot of the genius wordplay were beyond my scope, it moves me. I read Glyph because I became so enamored with Percival Everett's work after reading So Much Blue and I Am Not Sidney Poitier that I wanted to read everything he has written.

Unlike all of the other books I’ve read so far, these stories are more traditional and literary, not humorous, all occupying the same Western (Wyoming, Colorado) terrain: ranches, rivers, fishing, flowing meadows. Rough-living people with softness inside. There’s a lot of warmth here.“Little Faith” feels like an homage to one of my other favorite authors, Kent Haruf. Complete with no quotation marks on the dialogue. (All the other stories use quotation marks.) It is a quiet Western story. Stillness within a tense drama to find a lost little girl. It left me with a sigh. An interesting aside: in one of Everett’s other books, a protagonist points out that unless a character is identified as black, readers assume he’s white. The first reference to the veterinarian in this story being black doesn’t come until page 10: [Wes, a client, says to Sam, the vet:] You know, being a black vet out here. I have to admit it, I had my doubts.About what exactly?Whether you’d make it.You mean fit in?I guess that’s what I mean, yeah.Wes, I grew up here. Grade school. High school. I’ve never fit in. I probably will never fit in. I accept that. Everett is black and writes black characters, so I now assume his people are black unless otherwise identified as white. He’s reversed my assumptions and I love it! I also love that his stories are not about being one race or another; race is just a fact. And you get to feel what the person living inside feels about the outside and its interpretation or lack thereof by others in a way that I’ve never read before.“Stonefly” is a quiet fish-out-of-water story about dealing with pain. A mood piece.“A High Lake” is a warm end-of-life story about an independent woman.Tension, release, catharsis, gasp. “Exposure” took my breath away. It was a father/daughter story that is at once so obvious that I can’t believe nobody else has written some version of this, and so rare that I’m contemplating buying a copy of this book just to own this story. (I’m reading a library copy.)“Wrong Lead” is a title with many possible meanings. A rancher gives riding lessons to fearful people and they learn a lot more than he acknowledges saying. Even though this is a domestic relationship story, Everett gives it so much more grit than this kind of material usually delivers.“The Day Comes” left me with chills racing up and down my body. It started out like such a dry Western story, and then calmly everything turned. Well done.“Finding Billy Whitefeather” feels like it might be a mystery, but it’s not. I won’t say more and ruin it. I will say that at the end, I threw my head back and said (not laughed): “Ha ha.”“Liquid Glass” is the first Percival Everett story that hasn’t worked for me; it felt like a failed exercise that he couldn’t figure out.

This is a pretty traditional story. The pace is slow and calming. The cowboys' dialogue is cleverly laconic, the romance charmingly quirky, the crime intriguing. People talk a lot and say what they feel a la Women's Fiction, which usually turns me off. But since Percival Everett wrote it, there is something extra. In this book, it is so quiet, you might not pick it up. It comes in an unexpected black man's take on living in white cowboy country. It comes in a love of being in caves and insights about animals.

And perhaps that's why this book hits me so personally that I almost can't see straight.Funny, moving, and—as with the seven other Percival Everett books I've read—unexpected and unpredictable, the paperback of Erasure is printed in a tiny font, and I was glad because I didn't want it to end. I often stopped reading in order to prolong the pleasure.Without ruining your sweet discovery of this story, suffice it to say that Monk is a multifaceted peg who doesn't fit into any known hole. He is a writer whose books are too dense for most humans. And not only does he wish he could be seen and appreciated for who he is, but he needs money. So he writes an astoundingly awful, racist book—a parody of popular ghetto fiction. However, in writing this novella (included in full in the middle of this novel), Everett has done something so subversive that it makes me scream, and I'm not sure it was intentional. Yes, the novella is stereotypical and funnily offensive, but it also is driven by and mirrors the very frustration of the protagonist writer, and I would guess Everett as well, to be accepted for who he is—a black man who does not fit into anybody else's box—and to have his work appreciated on its own merits. So even as the reader is laughing and/or cringing at the exaggerated stereotypes (chapter titles written: Won, Too, Free . . .

He “chose to disappear well within the bounds of society. . . He wasn’t so much removed from humanity as sitting on the sidelines. (53)” He stole what he needed to survive—food, clothes, books, batteries, mattresses, even a TV!—burgling invisibly, leaving little trace except for what was missing . . . until he was caught. His main entertainment was voracious reading, because the life inside a book made no demands, “while the world of actual human interactions was so complex. (102)”According to author, journalist Michael Finkel: One’s desire to be alone, biologists have found, is partially genetic and to some degree measurable. If you have low levels of the pituitary peptide oxytocin—sometimes called the master chemical of sociability—and high quantities of the hormone vasopressin, which may suppress your need for affection, you tend to require fewer interpersonal relationships. (69) Your degree of need for social inclusion is inherited from your parents, says Finkel, and, according to John Cacioppo, director of the Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience at the University of Chicago, “everyone possesses a ‘genetic thermostat for connection.’ Chris Knight’s must be set near absolute zero. (70)”I was drawn to this book for two reasons: first, because although I like people, have compassion, understanding, and empathy for them, I live largely as a hermit (with a dog) in the middle of one of the biggest cities in the world, am almost never lonely or bored, and I wanted to know more about this. And second, because I adore my freedom to choose this unpopular existence, because I love democracy and my country, since 2016 I have chosen to participate with others in the fight to preserve my freedom, and I find myself frustrated with those who withdraw, calling their lack of action peacefulness or noninterest or some other label that masks a refusal to deal with new realities that, if allowed to escalate, will eventually impinge on their freedom to be disinterested.So I began reading this book feeling an empathy for hermits because being one is my natural disposition and an ire for them that I have never before experienced.What a wonderful book—a mesmerizing page-turner about man, nature, and Nature. It is not only a profile of Chris Knight but a comprehensive history and explanation of all people who choose a solitary life and the reasons they do so: to protest, as a pilgrimage, to pursue. (Read the book for full explanations.) Finkel talks about the “emancipation” of being a hermit, of becoming “no one and everyone (144),” which is certainly something I know and love—as have many other hermit writers and artists.But early on in his twenty-seven years of solitude, Chris Knight realizes “something almost every hermit in history has discovered: you can’t actually live by yourself all the time. You need help. (89)” (Hence, his life of crime.)Perhaps this is something I have discovered late in life—hence my new aversion to what I have been.This book was enlightening and I absolutely loved it.Postscript for other bookish hermitsI just learned about a way to participate in our war for democracy while preserving your solitude: Write letters from your own home.

I voted for Bernie Sanders in the presidentialThis book flies in the beginning, slows later on, but despite the vicissitudes, I couldn't put it down. I voted for Bernie Sanders in the presidential primaries, and his book, Our Revolution, was the first I read about the election.The second related book I read more recently, The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, and it was like an infusion of sanity.What Happened feels like the third in a medicinal trilogy. It is healing to read a funny (the specifics of the phone and email stuff are laugh-out-loud funny!), articulate, sane person admit her flaws, take responsibility for most of them, introspectively process what happened, learn, and consider new policies and future actions in a more open way because of it.I am amazed by the s that say she blames everybody else for what happened. It simply isn't true. Yes, she's angry at plenty of people, but she mostly is analytical and takes full responsibility. For instance, for the bad choice to make speeches to big business. Also, she explains her alliances in order to raise funds—she doesn't say she did the right thing; she says it was necessary in today's environment and will go on being necessary until there is campaign finance law change. I get it. (And if anybody thinks the current cabinet billionaire cronies with zero experience in their departments, who are dismantling their offices and taking tax-payer-funded private jets for personal pleasure is a swamp-clearing, I've got a bridge I'd like to sell you.) She reports the many times she was pushed and rather than get as outraged as Bernie Sanders did, she did the female thing: ""I remained polite, albeit exasperated, and I played the political game as it used to be, not as it would become. That was a mistake."" She gets it. However, she does use this book to rehash what happened, offer different analyses, examining them all, and in some cases say what she wishes she would have done (used a government email) or said or not said; perhaps that feels like blaming to some readers. (To that, I would ask: Imagine a man responding as she is now doing in this book. Would you call that blaming? Or strong analysis and post mortem in order to learn? Rhetorical questions. I don't want to debate this . And perhaps I am doing the girl thing by saying that. So be it. I don't like fighting and have a right to choose not to.)Clinton says she wore her composure like a suit of armor. This is verbatim: ""I wear my composure like a suit of armor, for better or worse. In some ways, it felt like I had been training for this latest feat of self-control for decades."" And then she proceeds to explain how all that became her M.O. in what is essentially a first-person account of the historic and ongoing struggle for women's equal rights and humane treatment in the workplace. I was with her every step of the way. And I marvel that any woman who works would not understand the tightrope walking she describes to get the job done while also not triggering judgments and resentments that no man in similar circumstances faces.The material about her daughter brought me to tears. And you don't have to be a mother to feel this—I'm not.The section on emails, government classification of emails, press coverage of those two issues, and James Comey reads like a Kafka story. Both hilarious and scream-worthy: the Salem witch trials seen from a rational point of view. I changed my opinion about several things because I never understood this level of detail before! Who could? It takes a book, and it is so much easier to listen to sound bites or half-baked opinions about partial facts. I admit I was wrong on several counts. I'm sorry.Her researched chronology about the Russia attack on not only our election but our psyches is a much needed call to arms. (The attack is ongoing and it remains shocking to me how blasé so many of us are about this, preferring our righteous anger to facts about what's inflating it.)My one beef with Sanders's book (I bought the hardcover) was a lack of an index. The first part was story but the second part was pure education with no way to find it out of context. Clinton has a complete index at the end of her book (for me, a Kindle, with a careful explanation that the page numbers apply to the hard copy, but if I click them, I'll go to the correct place in the e-book). And there was way more personal story, blow-by-blow of the campaign, and a mind-numbing level of detail in the final analysis of why she lost. However there was far less than Sanders on evergreen issues (trade, health care, education, etc.) to mull over for the future. So together these books really work as a comprehensive source.Identical to Sanders's book, there are endless references to all the people on Clinton's team and in her life who help and support her efforts. It sometimes got tiresome to read so many names, but it is honest crediting and derives from a generosity of spirit. Both Sanders and Clinton innately function with this spirit and therefore their accounts of their own histories and the histories of their campaigns are infused with gratitude. (Oh, how I miss this in our current politics.) And with all the details of people, policy thinking, and the process of politics, both books offer a valuable and complete historical record that one day may contribute to a bird's-eye-view understanding of what is going on.Yes, there is pain and resentment—for instance, when Bernie Sanders moved from his position on national single-payer health insurance to one that accommodates improving ACA, which is what Clinton advocates. She seems to miss that he also moved the conversation to health care as a right (or what I prefer to call ""infrastructure,"" because nobody is a ""consumer"" when they're deathly ill. There is no possibility of cost comparison or making sure that doctors are on your plan or that you happen to have had your heart attack in your own state. In my opinion, asking states to come up with policies is like telling drivers they must pay a toll every single time they change roads. We will all eventually need health care, the same as we need roads and bridges! End of tirade.) But I certainly understand her feelings. She is human, somebody disagreed with her, used it against her, and then came over to her way of thinking. I've gotten pissed when that's happened to me. (And in a later chapter, she does acknowledge the merits of influencing the overall health care conversation.)As with Sanders's book, when I read her deep, personal involvement with people and the way she translated this into creating policy—using facts, research, history, science, whatever was necessary—her ability to expand big enough to hold all this feeling and information put me in a state of awe. But she feels a similar humility and awe in the face of all the people who share their stories with her. So we have a circle of awe and appreciation. (This is reminiscent of what I experienced when she was my senator during 9/11. How nice it was to have a real human being who voiced her admiration of all the welders who were first responders. I vividly recall her simple statement that she didn't know how to cut metal pipes and how grateful she was for their expertise and selfless work. She was one of us and she spoke for all of us. And I met that person again in this book.)So even though I still don't agree with her on everything—I certainly take issue with her flippant denial of the fact that the DNC rigged the primary in her favor (the case was dismissed because it was found that the DNC had no legal obligation not to be biased), and I'm not at all sanguine about the Democratic party which created the Sanders/Clinton rift without need of Russian trolls (who certainly helped it along) and whose refusal to acknowledge responsibility and abdication of ethics (see new Donna Brazile article: ""If the fight had been fair, one campaign would not have control of the party before the voters had decided which one they wanted to lead. This was not a criminal act, but as I saw it, it compromised the party’s integrity."") may be responsible for the fury of people who voted for third-party candidates or didn't vote—despite all this, I really do like and admire Hillary Clinton and I'm glad I voted for her in the election . . . just like 65,844,610 other Americans—a majority of three million. In summary, this is a well-written necessary history, I'm grateful for it, I certainly better understand the woman who wrote it—she elicited in me the ""radical empathy"" she calls for at the end of the book—and I kind of love her.***11/4/17 UPDATE for anybody who is seething after having read the Donna Brazile excerpt (linked in this , above).Yes, the primary was biased. This is old news that was settled in court in August. If you are just learning about it now and are enraged, I have some thoughts for you.For most of my life I functioned like a feral animal, judging everyone on only 2 criteria: safe/unsafe. You miss the truth by doing that. You condemn a complex person or event and reduce it to one thing. I drafted my  of What Happened as I read the book. This is a great exercise in seeing a whole picture: I constantly added thoughts as I read different sections, revising the whole. And I came away with a huge picture and the experience presented. As I say in the , I was angry about her flippant denial of the DNC stuff, but there was much more there. Yes, I'm angry that the primary wasn't a fair fight. However according to the August court papers, the DNC had no legal obligation to be unbiased. This is the truth and it sucks. It is not new news!

I asked.She stared at the television. ""Why is it that after all the bullets have bounced off Superman's chest, he then ducks when the villain throws the empty gun at him?""I looked at the television and wondered, knowing also that my quest for some detail about my history had been again thwarted, albeit with a very good question. I never pressed terribly hard, thinking that someday the story would surface, but then she died. (pp. 84-85)I've quoted this out-of-context gem to give you a taste and because it made me laugh. Even though so many things (for instance the title of this book) are explained fairly quickly, I don't want to destroy anybody's delight at the discovery that I felt on every page of this wild ride about appearing to others as you are not, and eventually finding a difficult answer to that old Buddhist koan, ""Who am I?"" I laughed while I moaned. This is serious and hilarious stuff.This is my second Percival Everett novel, and I'm smitten enough to have put all of his many books on my ""to read"" list. The man has chops. By that I mean that from the first word, my editor's head goes on vacation and my reader's takes over while my writer's head squeals in the background, ""Look what he just did! This is absolutely magnificent. Note to self: 'Steal that.' The guy is a genius.""I want to meet him. But he's very private (no website) so the closest I'll probably get, aside from reading everything he ever writes, may be this  terrific interview.12/15/18 Rereading ResponseWhen I first read this, it was my second Percival Everett book, and I was so surprised by the writing and the humor that that was mostly what I saw.A little over a year later, after reading 14 of Mr. Everett's wildly different books, I've now reread I Am Not Sidney Poitier and my take is different: I hardly laughed at all for the first half (second half is funnier). Instead I was moved by the pain. Like many of Everett's books, this one has an intelligent, introspective black male protagonist who does not fit any of the labels smashed onto him. He is beaten up, sexually used, arrested for being black, hazed for not being black enough, disparaged for being ""so dark,"" called a loser, and finally lauded for being somebody he is not and never will be (and on the profoundest level, this is true for all of us; read the book to understand that). Eighteen-year-old Not Sidney (that's his real name) is not without agency (his abilities are ones I will leave for other readers to discover), but he is surrounded by people who only see his race or his wealth, or conversely by non-sequitur-spouting geniuses who have succeeded despite themselves and, although they see Not Sidney without the cultural labels, are of little help in his quest to find his mission in life because they function like ping-pong balls, flinging about their own lives. I'm almost jealous of my own first experience reading Not Sidney—my discovery of this funny, wild romp with substance whose roiling humor and spontaneously brilliant life energy make the pain both bearable and entertaining. But after reading so many Percival Everett Western stories, as well as his stories about geniuses and artists (hint: If you're interested in reading Not Sidney for the first time, do yourself a favor and first read Erasure for the first time), I understood more and found even more to appreciate in the rereading.***After Book Club Discussion Update 1/16/19I read this book for the second time due to the fact that my book club agreed to read it. Our meeting was yesterday and it was wonderful to finally share discussion with others who had read it—even those who did not like it. It made for great talk. I kept pretty silent for the beginning of the meeting because I was dying to hear what others thought. After sharing their opinions, the other members had questions for me, and I found myself expounding on the meaning of the book and the ending. I kept thinking I was going too far, but the other members told me with enthusiasm: No, that what I said made them like the book more because they understood things they hadn’t understood before. So I thought I’d add a brief analysis here:In my opinion, I Am Not Sidney Poitier is a quest story—a search for identity, or one’s true essence, in a culture where that is largely obscured by other people’s perceptions of race, wealth, and the like. Each event in this quest is a step for Not Sidney to find out who he is. The book opens with him wondering who his father was, then careens into a life where he is a screen for other people’s projections. After getting beaten up, locked up, applauded for his money, locked up again, he finally decides to go back to where he came from . . . only to be met at the L.A. airport by yet another person who mistakes him for the real Sidney Poitier. Exhausted and depleted of any sense of identity, he acquiesces and ends up receiving an award as the Greatest Black Man in the Universe—a role that is a distortion of anybody, including the real Sidney Poitier. His last line, in my opinion, is perfect: Upon accepting the award, he explains that he came back here to try to connect to something that he lost—his whole self. He acknowledges that all these people pelting him with adulation seem to know him better than he knows himself. He feels the weight of these projections in the metaphor of the trophy they’ve handed him. “. . . [A]s I stand like a specimen before these strangely unstrange faces, I know finally what should be written on that stone [his mother’s unmarked gravestone]. It should be what mine will say: I AM NOT MYSELF TODAY.”He has discovered what Buddhists call “emptiness.” When you peel away all the layers of what you may think defines you, you will discover that you are none of those things. So what are you left with? Emptiness. Ultimately, this and death are things we will all have to contend with if we want to know ourselves.I hope that helps anybody who is deeply interested in this wonderful, raucously funny book and confused by what it’s about or the ending....more",Notes are private!,0,62,2,"Dec 13, 2018Nov 04, 2017","Dec 15, 2018Nov 06, 2017","Oct 22, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6080748-i-am-not-sidney-poitier

White Houses’s first-person narrator is real-life journalist Lorena Hickok, aka Hick, who tells her life story and the story of her love affair with Eleanor Roosevelt. When the characters in a novel are real historical persons, it is almost impossible for a reader to not wonder what's true and what's not. So, despite two author's notes, front matter and back matter, assuring us that this ""is a work of fiction, from beginning to end,"" midway through, I found myself checking the above-linked Wikipedia bio, and it actually enhanced my reading experience. The bio gave me a sense of the homophobia that informed historians' reluctance to label the relationship between Hick and Eleanor a love affair. And it made me enjoy Amy Bloom's moxie in laying it all out, sensually and without apology. And I felt more deeply for these women who had to hide what was probably the great love of their lives.I'm not gay, and this book, maybe more than anything else I've read, made me empathize with that particular pain of dwelling in a cultural prison of bias. I hope the spirits of both Ms. Hickok and Ms. Roosevelt are tickled pink.[image]Written after Lorena Hickok left Eleanor, this 1958 book was one of my childhood favorites.

I could relate to the story of a failed writer, afraid of turning fifty, and trying to run away from his problems. But I wanted to unambiguously love it. What stopped that was editor's issues:It jumped around in time (particularly in the first two-thirds), and I often had to reread to locate myself in time/space. I kept thinking there must be a way to make clearer even nonlinear thought jumps. I've read other books where there was no confusion—most recently William Kennedy's Ironweed where, similarly, times and locales change as memories are evoked.Also there was a lot of humor based on understanding German—either untranslated German or understanding German syntax well enough to get the full joke of bad translation. I don't speak German, so I suspect I missed a lot of good stuff.And then there was the general unnecessary confusion—the book is riddled with comprehension-stopping bits. For example: Almost sixty years ago, just after midnight, a few feet from the river where they danced, a wonder of modern engineering occurred: overnight the Berlin Wall arose. It was the night of August 15, 1961. (124)That would make the present story in almost 2021 when who-knows-what will have happened and exist! Why not say ""More than half a century ago"" to evoke a big chunk of time?Or this, which takes place during a reminiscence about being in France when protagonist Arthur Less gets the flu, and, within the reminiscence, Less reminisces still further back in time to Berlin when a lover named Bastian got sick: That time in Berlin, taking care of Bastian—the sick man he recalled was himself. (146) What? When is he reminiscing from and how could he be remembering himself being sick in the future, which is really the past from the time of the book? My head hurts!Or this end of a nearly page-long sentence, where it feels as if writer's acrobatics get in the way of clarity: . . . Mohammed says, ""Look out for beasts,"" and at first there is nothing, until Zohra screams and points to where sits (or déjeuner sur l'herbe), a troop of poker-faced Barbary macaques, or, as she puts it: ""Monkeys!""

In a meticulously written foreword, one of the authors makes the case that ""duty to warn"" people whose well-being is in danger trumps the ""Goldwater Rule"" about silence. (There is an entire section of chapters on the ethics of speaking out—far too much to reduce into a  byte.) We are all in danger from this individual we have installed in the highest office in the land, and I consider the 27 authors of this step-by-step analysis of Trump's severe psychological impairments to be whistle blowers. But what are the political affiliations of the contributors and are they biased? This is immediately addressed: it doesn't matter. The content is pedagogy not politics: the nature of psychological disorders. They are described in all their variations; they are all recognizable as played out by this president—the proofs are provided; and their dire results are delineated, well researched, and broad. And the final chapter regarding recommended immediate action to assess presidential fitness now and in the future—grounded in Section Four of the Twenty-fifth Amendment issues of ""a written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office""—are required to be nonpartisan in nature.Personality DisordersExtreme Present Hedonism—impulsiveness of thought and therefore action with no awareness of consequences; propensity to dehumanize others in order to feel superior.Narcissistic Personality Disorder—superiority, exaggeration of talents, emotional, dramatic, lacking compassion and empathy (inability to recognize other people's feelings), low self-esteem.Bully Personality—physical, verbal, prejudicial, relational, cyber, sexual.Possibility of a neurological disorder—based on delineated observations.In discussions about the spectrum of the foregoing characteristics, as well as ""malignant narcissism,"" delusional ideation, functional impairment, and many other mental health categories, foremost is the topic of danger. And many of the contributors are specialists in the study of violence and danger and professionally assess whether a person is a danger to themselves or others. Over and over they conclude that even if they are not willing to diagnose a mental illness in somebody they have never treated, they can diagnose clear and imminent danger!They repeatedly warn about Trump's instability spiraling into psychosis and resulting in the destruction of democracy and a nuclear war. Says John D. Garner, PhD, in his chapter ""Donald Trump is: a) Bad; b); Mad; c) All of the Above"": Trump ""evinces the most destructive and dangerous collection of psychiatric symptoms possible for a leader. . . . our job is . . . to warn the public that the election of Donald Trump is a true emergency, and that the consequences most likely will be catastrophic.""Says Henry J. Friedman, MD, in the chapter ""On Seeing What You See and Saying What You Know: A Psychiatrist's Responsibility"": ""When as a psychiatrist, I watch commentators and reporters struggling to understand or explain President Trump's latest irrational position . . . I wish that I could help them understand his paranoid character and why there should be no surprise that Trump behaves this way. They should be prepared to witness many more situations in which Trump feels betrayed and turns on those who have previously served him. Paranoids are always finding betrayal in those surrounding them, and react with retaliatory anger—Hitler and Stalin, by murdering their newly minted enemies; and Trump, by firing them. Psychiatric knowledge and terminology will save reporters and the public from remaining confused and attempting to find explanations of behavior that could easily be understood if Trump's paranoid character were always kept in mind. This is the only way to ensure the preservation and viability of our democracy and our national security.""In addition to this kind of material, there is a treasure trove of other psychological stuff: discussion of character traits that we can identify with in moderation and what happens when they become pathological; talk about new areas of therapy opened up by Trump events; repeated discussion of the ""Trump Effect"" and ""Trump anxiety disorder,"" a specific kind of new anxiety and trauma or reactivation of old trauma due to the culture of Trump and what we can do about it, and an incredible chapter about what Trump tells us about our cultural Self—all informative articles that make this book a page-turner; and for many of us, long-awaited good medicine and, in turn, a call to action to speak out with whatever we have to offer.I'd wager that anybody growing up in an abusive and abused family has wished there were somebody big to protect them. And perhaps when they've become adults and looked back at their situation, they've been appalled that it could have been as apparent as it was and nobody stepped in. Where were the authorities? How could a community have ignored something so obvious? We are now that abused family, and I'm grateful that the authorities have finally bucked their own fear of rocking the boat or breaking the rules enough to sound the call, to offer their good medicine. I only hope we will all listen and be as alarmed and therefore as active as they are.***Some thoughts on what to do now:At the same time that it alarms you, reading this book may also calm you down if you are upset about Trump. How? It will validate your feelings and let you know that ""this is a real thing""—the opposite of Trump's habit of ""gaslighting"" (claiming that lies are truth and there is something wrong with anybody who does not see it his way). Once you have calmed a little, you may start to see Trump for what he is—a seriously disturbed individual who does indeed pose a danger to all of us. However, he is only one piece of an orchestrated puzzle designed to destroy our union. If you can see that Trump is a mere player in a much larger societal upset, if you can accept what author Thomas Singer, MD, in his chapter ""Trump and the American Collective Psyche,"" says about what Trump tells us about the state of our collective Self and you can participate "". . . in a deep resurgence of activism to reclaim our most cherished and threatened American values"" and ""resist our tendency to cocoon ourselves in a self-righteous, arrogant bubble of narcissistic ideals, even in the name of being 'progressive,'"" here is a blog that attempts to help with that larger picture, We Are Being Manipulated into Oblivion—See the Big Picture.And here is useful counsel for our deportment, from Deterrent or Defense by Basil Liddell Hart, used by JFK in his considerations about the Cuban Missile Crisis, as quoted in the chapter ""The Loneliness of Fateful Decisions"" by Edwin B. Fisher, PhD: ""Keep strong, if possible. In any case, keep cool. Have unlimited patience. Never corner an opponent and always assist him to save his face. Put yourself in his shoes—so as to see things through his eyes. Avoid self-righteousness like the devil—nothing is so self-blinding.""How to do that?

Read it if you want to understand any kind of historThis is a wonderful nuanced book that resonates mightily with and informs what is going on today. Read it if you want to understand any kind of historical basis for what is now happening in the U.S. Read it if you love the minutia of history—every conversation ever recorded during the Lincoln period, every permutation and convolution of the Civil War, the complex emotional motivations behind the factions (a lot of people fought more for preservation of the union than out of any conviction about slavery)—or if you feel as if you need to learn U.S. history. This book has garnered enormous public attention as well as an award-winning movie based on it, so I am not going to write more commentary on what is in it. Instead, here are some opinions about the very important content that is missing.At more than 900 pages, the book was so heavy, I broke down and bought a wretched Kindle version so that I could read without straining my tendons. But still, it was too short. Why?In all the discussion about the virulent disagreement about the morality of slavery—whether it was constitutional for man to enslave man, whether the ever-expanding U.S. territories should be allowed to have legal slavery, whether people who had spent “blood and treasure” to settle the South and whose economy depended on slavery had any right to this abominable practice even though they had outlawed the slave trade as piracy—in all this, there was a complete absence of concern for, let alone awareness of, the existence of Native Americans who were being systematically killed and herded off their land in order for white people to create settlements, territories, and eventually states that would argue about the morality of person abuse and economy vs. morality and eventually erupt into civil war.As I read through Goodwin’s flowing prose, I longed to go back in time and personally demand of Lincoln: “What about the Natives? Are you concerned about man killing man (women and children)? Are they not people also? What about our Declaration of Independence’s only reference to them as ‘savages'? Is that how you feel? What about George Washington’s famous letter of 1790 stating 'the Government of the United States gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, requires only that they who live under its protection should demean themselves as good citizens, in giving it on all occasions their effectual support.'? You ethically opposed the Mexican American war, insisting that we had attacked peaceful Mexican settlements and thereby stole land. You are a wise and deeply good man who has known firsthand suffering and degradation and who consistently subsumed your substantial ambition and ego impulses, choosing what was just and most likely to result in the greater good. Tell me your thoughts.” Here is a map of the inhabited American continent that is never in the history books:[image] See it full-size here . . . native peoples are central to the nation’s history. As late as 1750—some 150 years after Britain established Jamestown and fully 250 years after Europeans first set foot in the continent—they constituted a majority of the population in North America, a fact not adequately reflected in textbooks. Even a century later, in 1850, they still retained formal possession of much of the western half of the continent.—Claudio Saunt, associate director of the Institute of Native American Studies at the University of Georgia. From his book West of the Revolution (2014) [excerpted in the link]Native Americans participated on both sides of the Civil War and, according to Wikipedia, “Historians claim they were hardest hit of all who participated in the War.”I am ashamed that I didn’t know about this distortion of history until about sixteen years ago when I worked for a magazine that was involved with indigenous communities and issues. Until we are willing to look at the whole truth of our past and ongoing history, until it too is included in tomes about our Civil War, until it is fully acknowledged when somebody writes about spending “blood and treasure” to create new American settlements, we are doomed to repeat it by demonizing, ignoring, and/or erasing “inconvenient populations.”That said, Team of Rivals stunningly makes you appreciate our country and our history, makes the past come alive and feel quite present, makes you cry with joy at the passage of the antislavery Thirteen Amendment and sob at Lincoln’s death. (A million times I’ve looked at this statue of a Union soldier from New York in Central Park, but after reading this book, I see him!)  [image]My wanting more truth is a testament to the healthy hunger for truth aroused by this book. I want truth about our hypocrisies through heartfelt stories that are hard to hear, but whose fullness makes us all feel what Lincoln called “the better angels of our nature” as well as our culpability. If white people can feel both these extremes, perhaps somewhere in the middle we can know we are all the same, that we are sorry, and that we will now commit to acknowledge and therefore be able to correct our present and past wrongs. If we can admit the wrongs of our ancestors, we will do better, slaying delusions of righteous superiority with the light of exposure.Explaining Lincoln’s worldwide legacy and the love he evoked in people, Goodwin quotes Tolstoy’s conclusion that “Lincoln was a humanitarian as broad as the world. He was bigger than his country—bigger than all the presidents together.” So I can’t help thinking he would agree with me and encourage the greatest truths we can tolerate.***10/12/17 Addendum:Russell Brand posted this video, a postcard to America, where he makes the same point I make in this  about the importance of acknowledging our true history--we are a country founded via genocide (to acquire the land) and slavery (to enable our economy). It's not pretty. But if we can acknowledge this for the part it plays in the picture with all the magnificent things we have produced, including Lincoln, maybe we will stop having what we deny erupt from its inborn craving to be seen and reaction to the pressure of being denied....more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,"Aug 26, 2017","Sep 27, 2017","Aug 26, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2199.Team_of_Rivals

Linda/Madeline is unaware of her authenticity and this makes her story all the more powerful. Her conscious reasons for doing things seem shallow, adolescent, or selfish, but she and this book have a diesel engine of buried truth fueling and driving it. The plot leaks out like an oil spill from all directions, exploding into one of the quietest, clearest statements of message on page 213 (of a 275-page book); it took my breath away and made me think new thoughts. The ending reverts to the “coming of age” category, but if you digest it slowly, which I’m doing as I write this, it makes sense.For me, this is a book about the consequences of not taking ownership and responsibility for real circumstances in our lives. And the price of truly taking ownership and responsibility is that we feel the almost intolerable pain of being everyone._______*I have added the author's name to a hed because Goodreads has decided to delete authors' names in their new format for the daily s email--a decision I find mystifying and insulting, since without the authors, there would be no Goodreads.

I don’t know Latin, research psychology, California, every episode of The Little Rascals, and I’m white. So I don’t pretend to understand the tsunami of references that come so fast it takes your breath away in this satire about—A brief and necessary digression: My own writing is sometimes rabidly politically incorrect and has been known to poke people who take offense at that. But I’m a neophyte compared to Paul Beatty. And although I love his kind of daring, freefalling, Macy’s Thanksgiving Day-size sacred holy cow-balloon-popping, and wildfire prose, I am not insane enough to pull anything out of context in order to say what this book is about. And even if I were willing to ponder until I were clever enough to do so—which would require substantial time that nobody is paying me for—to do so might make me a target of some people’s ire, and I only accept that role when it comes to my own work.Now back to the . Sorry, I am not going to say the plot, why it is hysterically funny, or why its truth will be a relief to some readers and offensive secret-telling to others. (If you want to read that stuff, I suggest s from two Goodreader friends who are smarter than I am: Steve and Trish.)Suffice it to say that it’s rib-crackingly funny (although this does wane quite a bit at the end of the book) and the music of the writing transcends the need for educated understanding. The prologue comes at you like a breathless prose poem, and the rest follows suit with jokes, jokes, jokes! They fall out of the stratosphere and land square.If you surrender to the music of this writing, to the surprise, and the truth-telling through satire—I lied. Without revealing much about the story, I am going to say what I think this book is really about (although I may be missing a lot—see first paragraph): Although it’s mostly about the Black experience in White America, on a bigger level I think it’s about how we all participate in our own enslavement and limitation; how we collude with the outside culture to abuse us or define us (negatively or positively); and this collusion requires that we pretend we don’t know that we’re colluding. But anybody who names the limitations, admits that they are familiar, comfortable, and even possibly helpful in some backhanded way (causing some people to feel special and others enraged, denied, and self-righteous)—anyone who plays the collusion play without pretending not to is crazy and/or just not with it—a sellout with a metaphorical attachment disorder. Hell hath no fury like people who feel their secrets exposed.Once in a blue moon, I read something that decimates limiting walls I didn’t even know I had about what is possible. I thought my walls were down after reading A Confederacy of Dunces. But, as a person who writes truth through humor, I felt a whole other layer disintegrate into dust when I read this book. Paul Beatty is simply one of the smartest and fearlessly funny writers I’ve ever read—even if some of it was way over my head.***To give you a quick taste of who this writer is, here’s a NY Times article by Beatty about Black humor.By the way, in the above-referenced comprehensive  by Trish, she gives a lot of other Paul Beatty online references and also mentions that he was lousy at interviews and didn’t seem to want to talk about this book. I can relate: I wouldn’t attempt to convey the plot, and I cannot imagine writing a holy-cow-popping book like this and then talking about it. This is the kind of book you fling from your heart like a possible truth-stink bomb and then run for cover and let people react however they do.9/1/17 Update: NY Times columnist David Brooks just published a very good essay on how we are complicit in our own miniaturization, articulating my point about the transcendent point of this book. ...more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,"Aug 11, 2017","Aug 19, 2017","Aug 11, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25667451-the-sellout

There are boyfriend/girlfriend, college teachers/students, kids at a baseball game scenarios . . . Then came the sixth story, ""Lincoln Arisen,"" which reads like a one-act surreal play (think Pinter or Beckett) with narrative cum stage directions describing action through a series of stream-of-conscious dreamlike scenes mostly between Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. I couldn't decide if I liked it, if it worked, if it was immature playwriting by a writer enamored with Lincoln or something more profound. In any case, it was different and reading it after reading Lincoln in the Bardo made me want to read a Lincoln biography. Not a bad outcome from reading a short story.This was followed by a dated, somewhat sophomoric story about Michael Jackson; then a mature and moving story about the confused understandings between a widowed father and his teenage daughter (""The Problem of Human Consumption""); a gorgeous little story about love lost and then promised by an overworked computer repairman (""Wired for Life""); a nostalgic elegy to immature love (""Summer, as in Love""); then the hilarious and ultimately moving story about friendship and a really awful novel (""Larsen’s Novel""). This is Steve Almond at his funniest best and the reason to read this book. If he hasn't already done it, I wish he'd do a collection of stories that include shrinks, all of whom seem to be named Dr. Oss (I've read three so far); and the last story, fittingly titled ""Skull,"" is a sexy look at real intimacy.This book is a potpourri of well-written stories, some slight and immature, others a full meal, that don't belong together in a book except for the fact that they are written by Almond and portend the talent and skill that explode in the later collection (God Bless America). I understand he is now self-publishing, and maybe his even more recent work similarly throbs with the life and hilarity I cherish.

Obviously I wasn't alive for the Shirtwaist fire that killed three floors of locked-in garment workers, but I did live through 9/11. And, like every longtime (45 years) New Yorker, I still hold vivid visions of it. So when I realized Meissner was writing it as historical fiction, I jumped to the acknowledgements to deduce whether “she had a right to it.” And when I learned that she had pieced 9/11 together from interviewed people's experiences, even though she did a believable job, I felt defensive — as if she'd exploited something she doesn't own. (I'm not justifying this; just admitting it.)Foiled! Why? Because Meissner did such a comprehensive and authentic job that my own defensiveness — this ownership of a traumatic story which many firsthand experiencers feel — is also part of the book. So what was I to do but surrender to the fact that she is a good storyteller who respects the material and read on?However, some substantial complaints that have nothing to do with my psychological issues: I dislike the cover of this book so much that had it not been my book club's selection, I probably would not have picked it up. Gaudy marigolds frame such a faded, blued-out New York City skyline that for the longest time I didn't even realize it was there, and the title font screams “women's fiction.” Although to be fair, it is women’s fiction — not my favorite genre, which is probably a lot of my ambivalence. But my major problem is the writing. Although it is serviceable, it could use tightening — a lot of it. Things like: “she carried it in her hands …” and “I yanked [insert: off] my nurse’s cap off my headand change “Spinning thoughts circled in my brain as to how I could decline the invitation” to “How could I decline the invitation?”Conversations repeat information ad nauseum — the way obsessed people repeat what they are obsessing about. And there is endless redundancy of inner turmoil and basic motivations. (I’m guessing a third of the word count could be cut, sharpening the story and diluting the “women’s fiction” sappiness quotient.) By page 200, it became so tedious that, with an anguished scream spinning thought circles in my cranium, I longed to either whip out my editor’s pencil or abandon the book. But the plot is good; the feeling of time, place, and people are truly authentic; and I loved the details (medical, textiles) which were such an organic part of the story that they felt like firsthand knowledge. So I kept reading to find out what happens. Now back to my psychological issues. Despite the positive qualities of this book, I simply don’t believe the relationships here or in most women’s fiction romances. For my taste, they are contrived and overwritten, and therefore I still feel as if the 9/11 material was exploited for this book. By that I mean it was manipulated for the purposes of telling a contrived story. Lesson Learned: Henceforth, I’ll stay away from this genre. I simply can’t stomach it....more",Notes are private!,0,41,1,"Jul 04, 2017","Jul 07, 2017","Jul 04, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18114142-a-fall-of-marigolds

Even sweeter because I discovered four of the pages uncut and realized I was the first person to read this copy, which somehow feels right.A 1943 precursor to Leave It to Beaver and Ferris Bueller's Day Off, this self-described ""good book for boys""—written at a time when nobody locked their doors, asbestos in baseball gloves was normal (as was ""spanking"" with a belt), and cigarettes didn't cause cancer—still appeals to me.

The book's commercial blurb tells too much for my taste and I would advise against reading it.Suffice it to say this is a quiet, sensitive, and sensual story of a girl with a birth defect. For the longest time, I couldn't properly visualize it. When I finally saw medical pictures via my own research, I was so shocked that I understand why it was intentionally made ambiguous for such a long time.This is a story about love and fear and courage and living in isolation. It is deeply realistic, feminine, and honest—with an ending that made me feel self-accepting about my own differences and idiosyncratic life choices. The writing is mostly elegant (narrative is poetic, ending is positively gorgeous, but there is a strange dip into over-explaining dialogue a la ""women's fiction"" for a couple of chapters). The place and characters are vivid, and the pacing of the revelation and withholding of enough information for a curious reader to google were artistically right decisions.

Like Lilli, they have no rights and nowhere to go where they can be certain they will stay alive. The only real kindness for Lilli comes to her from people who have also experienced pain. When you have no rights and your life is on the line, and your babies have been taken and transported who-knows-where . . . Well, it’s close to unbearable. And all of this was in the first hundred pages and then escalated to the point where the tension became physically painful. So I’d pause, but then be compelled to keep reading.The book is a series of diary entries that feel like a real novel rather than authentic diary entries. This is the author’s art. “I gain a sense of company when I confide my doings here,” writes Lilli about writing in her diary—which leads me to the fifth evocation of tumultuous feeling: Me too. I’ve been writing diaries/journals since I was eight, but mine should be burned when I die. Pure emotional vomit. Those that comprise this book are beautifully written, cogent, well-paced, moving, and so well-researched (without obvious fact-dumping) that you can smell the city stink and hear the clip-clops of the Hansom carriage horses in nineteenth-century Philadelphia.

Often it suffers from too much detail, but I'm giving it five stars for the sections that explain the brain science of why facts don't matter to many voters and they will vote against their own interests, and the last chapter (which is worth the cost of the book), ""How to Respond to Conservatives.""I can't possibly summarize, let alone retain the information from this book, but what I've decided to do is share some of the most salient points, along with my contemplations about how to use this material for myself. I hope many readers will do this. Lakoff says that the job of ""reframing"" the progressive narrative requires experts, but if enough of us learn just a little bit and put it out into public spaces, we will help heal our present cultural divide. [I found italicizing my contemplations to distinguish them from Lakoff's text too messy, so just know that what follows is a mix of my own opinions, riffing on Lakoff's information.]Politics are based on moral values which are set by our upbringing.Conservative paradigm: top-down, strict-father hierarchy, kids are born bad and need to learn to be good through discipline and punishment. Only then will they learn self-responsibility, and then they're on their own.Progressive paradigm: nurturing parents; it is ideal to help everyone; kids are born good and need to be nurtured.We all have frames according to our paradigms and beliefs. Imagine a picture frame that allows what we see. We choose facts that comport with the frames we already have, which is like choosing the art to match the color and size of the picture frame. Anything that clashes or is the wrong size is somehow rejected. Our unconscious sense of the architecture of who we are depends on this. This is common to all people. Hence, keeping this inner scaffolding intact is a matter of life and death.Many people are moderates who hold conservative views in some areas and progressive in others. They are ""biconceptualists."" These are the people that politicians want to speak to most and Republicans currently do a much better job of addressing them according to their frames and values than Dems. Whoever's language is most prevalent will get the other side using it, reinforcing the ideas of the most loquacious side. Case in point: ""tax relief""—based on the conservatively framed value that taxes are bad—is now a term used by progressives, reinforcing the notion that taxes are bad and completely ignoring the fact that ""private depends on public"": To live, we require roads, schools, public services, everything that makes up the system that we live in. In fact there is no private existence without public existence. This can extend to the air we breathe. If it's not clean, we will eventually get sick. Yet through smart P.R. and repetition, the frame of this discourse has become the conservative frame and the common language, and no amount of fact-yelling will make it otherwise. So in short, progressives have to stop mimicking conservative language and say what they mean as it relates to our values. Life and freedom depend on the existence of a public. And the public exists through our common contribution to it.Systemic movements change things in general. Systems have myriad actions, creating myriad chain reactions, creating everything from global warming to electing a pathological liar to the highest office in the land.One chain reaction that screams to me is the result of progressives disparaging and demeaning values and morals that they don't hold, which eventually created a tidal wave of hubris that is now fueling an understandable backlash of conservative revenge. (If you doubt this, remember some time in your life where you were shamed and how awful that felt.) It is not that conservatives believe Trump's lies. They simply don't care, or like Paul Ryan recently, they excuse them as due to inexperience. This is a way to wipe facts out of the frame because the strict-father paradigm of punishment is a strongly held value and Trump promises that it will happen under his leadership.In my opinion, part of the solution—in addition to reframing issues like education, health care, environmental protection, etc. in terms of freedom for all of us because private life depends on public personal protections (not ""benefits"" or ""entitlements""), or using other values we all share such as security, prosperity, and opportunity—is realizing what we progressives have done. I personally feel remorse for all the times I've been intolerant and dismissive of people who, in my estimation, ""don't understand what's so obvious to me."" I regret that my frame has been so narrow as to exclude the importance of values in my reverence for facts—a product of my deep ignorance about systems and how they work. And I will henceforth try to listen better when somebody is hurting to hear what they really are hurting about. And I will try to express my own hurt and desire for healing in terms of values.

It has been posted all over Facebook with progressives disparaging it--completely unaware that they are picking up his message and disseminating it for him. Here is my comment on Facebook to my friends:A lot of friends are posting the praise fest staged by 45 yesterday. While, for me, it echoes of North Korea's ""our dear leader""-mandated rhetoric and is creepy, having just finished George Lakoff's book Don't Think of an Elephant: the essential progressive guide for the issues that define our future, I see a danger in not understanding the brilliance of the strategy. The reason 45 does these things is that they work. He controls what Lakoff calls the critical ""framing"" of issues. And every time he repeats the rhetoric, no matter how staged or exaggerated, he effectively controls what language we all speak. and the more times this happens, the more the nonsense becomes accepted truth.

I apologize. But here it is:Just technically the growth in Towles's writing improved exponentially between Civility and Gentleman. Whereas Gentleman is a sublime symphony, Civility suffers from a glut of sentences starting with prepositional, adverbial, and gerund phrases (Forgive me; I'm an editor). This affects the music and establishes a kind of tedious metronome beat. For example, ""Around four o'clock we walked through a pine glade behind the club. As we came into a clearing …"" Sometimes there will be practically a whole page of this same rhythm which to me sounds like somebody delivering a report or minutes of a meeting. Perhaps it was intentional—the rat-a-tat-tat delivery of 1930s movies—but I don't think it works for a whole novel, and this kind of writing is nowhere to be seen in Gentleman.From Towles's talk, I know how much he adores New York City in the 1930s, so I was charmed by seeing the demonstration of it in this book about young people negotiating life and love—lowly-born girls hobnobbing with old-moneyed W.A.S.P. gentry and high society—in that era. However, I'm not enamored with the period or the lingo or habits. There is a gloss and glamor—we've all seen it in afore-mentioned movies. For me, there is also a shallowness due to the emphasis on style over substance. I stop caring about what people wear, how and why they choose it, and what parties they go to. There was definitely an increase in substance in the latter half of the book, and at 84%, according to my Kindle, I finally realized that maybe penetrating the shallowness (based on George Washington's Rules of Civility) was actually the point. Maybe if there had been an undertow of this direction much earlier, I would have happily been pulled out to the 84% point. But by 84% I was exhausted from treading through the fascination of glitz. Perhaps this is my problem, not Towles's or a flaw in the structure. I don't know, I don't know. I wanted to love this book, but perhaps I'm simply not its audience.What is exciting for me as a novelist myself—from a purely technical perspective—is to see the hints of what matured into master storyteller's technique in the second book. In his talk, Towles mentioned that he is working on a third book that takes place in the 1950s about three eighteen-year-old boys traveling across the USA.

But I was so taken by the story of slave Cora's life and journey via a literal underground railroad that I noticed the glitches but they paled in comparison to what I felt. My identification early on with Cora was organic, and through her I felt and learned things that are inexpressible. This book changed me. That's the biggest compliment I can give.The railroad is probably a metaphor for so many things that I couldn't begin to decipher them, but for me, it felt like a vascular system in a human body. Not just a black body, but an overall human body. It's also the dark passages of our psyches which we follow, if we are daring or desperate enough, with no way of knowing where they'll lead. So metaphorically, linear time and chronology aren't that important. But the one place I couldn't turn off my editor's head was the many confusion-making chronology choices. It would have been so easy to make this a more linear story, and therefore an even more powerful one, if that is possible. But as I said, it changed me.

Available for pre-order now.Original ReviewI learned a7/24/20 Update A new English translation is being launched in September 2020 by Vehicule Press. Available for pre-order now.Original ReviewI learned about this book when it was referenced in the wonderful novel Lullabies for Little Criminals by Heather O'Neill. The protagonist of that book, a street-smart twelve-year-old named Baby, has been carrying the novel around for a couple of weeks: ""I pulled the paperback book out from under my mattress and examined it lovingly. This was how I escaped the prison."" She is reading the original French version, L'avalée des avalés, and describes it as ""the story of a young girl who was at once enraptured and furious with the world."" The person who gave Baby the novel told her that someone else has to give you this book; you can't buy it.I subsequently tried to buy it, but quickly learned that the English translation is out of print and costs more than $600 used. The library didn't have a circulating book, but—o' joy—I finally managed to get a copy through their unpublicized Inter-Library Loan program. By the time I finally laid hands on it, my desire and expectations of greatness scared me. Could it possibly live up to my fantasy?Where to begin? This book is extraordinary but I would never recommend it to anybody. It is dark and complicated, and I think you'd only understand the development of a willfully isolated sociopath if you had grown up with an equivalent level of family dysfunction and were prone to deep introspection (in other words, not a sociopath yourself). At the opening of the book, first-person protagonist Bernice is nine years old, living in an abbey (there are a lot of religious, as well as mythological, references I didn't understand) on a river island in Montreal, Canada, and consciously choosing isolation from the ever-warring parents who have divvied up possession of her and her brother. She is banished to New York City for several years, then finally at age fifteen, to Israel in the middle of the Palestinian war.Written in the voice of a sophisticated, intellectual mad philosopher/poet genius (a writer's conceit that I immediately accepted), Bernice deeply ponders the power of isolation and is committed to not loving, with a rationale that is transcendentally and spiritually sophisticated—an understanding of oneness that is both wrong and mind-blowingly right. She follows the perfect logic of a person who has been destroyed by parents who are also a source of love. Wires crossed, to the child, love becomes something to hate; survival depends on destroying anyone or thing that threatens love. This is complicated stuff and the emotional line is pitch perfect. The writing reels from realism to ever-changing metaphors and euphemisms and dreamlike scenes. It will be impossible to follow or understand for a lot of people, and had I not worked so hard to get my copy of the book, I might have given up. But instead I surrendered the need to understand, and suddenly I was understanding—understanding an experience of multi-generational upset and the twisted logic that makes love dangerous and hate safe in a way that doesn't communicate in words. The book is harsh, painful, confusing, and awful (particularly with animal abuse which almost did me in). But, for the right reader, extraordinary.Here are the opening lines. If they pull you like a gravitational force, maybe this book is for you. Otherwise, leave it alone; it'll just annoy and confuse you: Everything swallows me. When my eyes are shut, it's my inside that swallows me, it's in my inside I stifle. When my eyes are open I'm swallowed because I see, it's in the inside of what I see that I suffocate.And if you can read it in the original French, even better, I'm guessing. (See above link to purchase.) The English translation by Barbara Bray requires the aid of a dictionary. I can only imagine the French vocabulary. (Favorite word learned: ""heimatlos""—stateless, without a country—which describes Bernice's profound exile.)By the way, the Goodreads rating system is completely inappropriate for this book. It is not a book you like or love. My 5-star rating has nothing to do with the fact that I often didn't like it at all. It has to do with my awe quotient. I'm in awe that Ducharme wrote this and got it published.***8/28/17 Update: I am so sad to learn today of the death of author Rejean Ducharme. A giant literary force who lived in near obscurity. I learned more about him from this article than was available when I read this book a few months ago. RIP and thank you, M.

In a strange synchronicity, the editor who received my email replied, mistaking me for an in-house colleague, and through this mistake, I learned that they are currently considering republishing the book in English--in which case, it will be widely available.

She bounces from him to a foster home to other caretakers. And what gives this book an authenticity that will be recognized and applauded by anyone who grew up in an insane family is her dealing with it as if it is normal. Because for her, it is.

The pump contracts: we meet the Joad family and set out with them on a Depression-era pilgrimage from Oklahoma's Dust Bowl to the fantasy of relief in California. The pump expands: from an almost existential point of view, we see the movement of all refugees and all people struggling merely to eat and the imbalances—based on money—that create a starvation culture. Contraction, expansion, contraction, expansion—you can almost hear the whoosh as the book pumps life's blood through alternating chapters . . . ending with a heart-flooding orgasm.Some novels present a perfect arc that builds to a finale, causing me to hug the book and rock and moan. The Grapes of Wrath brought this on after individual chapters.66 is the path of a people in flight, refugees from dust and shrinking land, from the thunder of tractors and shrinking ownership, from the desert's slow northward invasion, from the twisting winds that howl up out of Texas, from the floods that bring no richness to the land and steal what little richness is there. From all of these the people are in flight . . . (118) This is writing that sticks—the visuals, the taste and abrasion of the dusty earth, the people. I never forgot who anybody was because the writing demands such attention that you become part of the population. I could put the book down for a day, come back, and I knew exactly where I was, with whom, and the place in the arduous pilgrimage.The writing, also, is arduous. Arduous, flowing, and mesmerizing—an almost impossible combination. You see every detail of a gesture, every sensual signal between nature and man or between family members. I'm a reader who is often impatient for plot, but there is no overwriting here, so I was happily forced to go slower than is my natural inclination. Steinbeck's reverence made me reverent. His control made me savor each expansion and contraction.This book is necessary in today's environment where refugees are, for powerful people, statistics or threats or a political inconvenience, and our southern neighbors, whose land we stole, have become ""illegal aliens."" Steinbeck says, ""My whole work drive has been aimed at making people understand each other . . ."" We need what he has to say now!On a personal level (and I suspect everybody will have one with this book), my mother didn't talk a lot about her childhood, but I do remember her mention of the Dust Bowl and the fleeing ""Okies"" and how they were reviled. Chapter 19 filled in my understanding of what might have been behind her rush to lose her Oklahoma accent, even though her relatives were not farmers and she'd survived the Depression in pretty good shape. Learning to speak generic American English was the first thing she did upon moving East in the early '40s. As a Jew and a woman, she had two strikes against her as far as getting work as an advertising writer; I guess she didn't need a third. I always loved the accent. One time, talking to her about a guy I had a crush on, I referred to his ""soothing accent"" as one of the attractions. ""And I worked so hard to lose that accent,"" she said, with unexplained revulsion—a kind of reverse bias to separate her from something she'd fled? I think I understand now, Mom. Sorry it took so long.***Postscripts: This edition of the book has a wonderfully informative introduction by Robert Demott, which I only read when I was more than halfway through the book. (I read part then, and the rest after finishing the book; I prefer to have a pure experience and listen to other people's analysis after the fact.) Also, there are footnotes that enhance the text. Penguin Classics created a perfect paperback that delivers the extras in a far more accessible way than any e-book could.For follow-up reading, I suggest Bernie Sanders's Our Revolution....more",Notes are private!,0,38,1,"Apr 03, 2017","Apr 07, 2017","Mar 22, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4397.The_Grapes_of_Wrath

Great literary writing and laugh-out-loud humor growing out of real situations seen from the depths of naked honesty. I was swept away, and to think that I'd left this book on my to-read list for more than three years because of its length (640 pages). Once I dove in, I never wanted it to end.Nathan Hill writes with the perfect balance of spontaneity and control. The thick plot is dense and deeply researched but you can only deduce the extent of this by his youth and the acknowledgments, including sources; everything seems to burst out of him with inborn expertise. The sprawling story never feels messy. It feels organic to switch eras and characters' perspectives, rhythms of chapter length and action—this is the spontaneity aspect of Hill's enormous talent. But the reason this feels tight and perfect is technical mastery—all without one molecule of canned or generic writing or one second of contrived manipulation.Toward the end of the book (page 565), Hill writes: ""Seeing ourselves clearly is the project of a lifetime.""* From the scope of this novel, I believe Nathan Hill could write anything and everything, but that his reason for the effort is to see himself and all of us clearly. And doing that does take a lifetime—maybe one magnificent book at a time. I can't wait for his next one, although I suspect it will be years coming. Even two books about this topic told at this caliber of writing would be a phenomenal output. __________*Writing about plot doesn't interest me, so I rarely do it. That said, the plot of The Nix, which centers around seeing oneself clearly, per this footnoted quote, reminds me of another book—a book of essays by Jacques Lusseyran: Against the Pollution of the I. I edited the first publication of it (it's since been acquired and, I hope, re-edited to correct a horrendous typo in the first edition, by a couple of other publishers) and I remember being blown away by Lusseyran's clear description in the title essay of how our ""I"" (our essential self) gets distorted by all the pollution of culture—which Hill explores via everything from advertising to family lore that get reified in repeating patterns of belief and behavior. If you like The Nix, you might also be interested in Lusseyran's book....more",Notes are private!,0,34,1,"Dec 15, 2020","Dec 25, 2020","Mar 18, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28251002-the-nix

At first, the intercontinental shifts reminded of me of David Mitchell's wonderful Ghostwritten, but I had no idea what was coming with this one. At first, the intercontinental shifts reminded of me of David Mitchell's wonderful Ghostwritten, but the style of this book has a parable quality—personal but objective—and poured out in a cascade of run-on sentences, careening from one country to another, through wormhole time/space connections. And slowly I began to realize how current and real the experience was—a kind of heightened reality. This is a migration story, focusing on the coupling and uncoupling and aging of two lovers fleeing an unnamed war-torn country. (This is the only unnamed place in the book, although it feels like Syria; all the places the couple migrate to are named. I'm not sure of the significance of that.) Anyway, the movement of culture and information and experiences mirrored our current movement through the internet and social media. Although people flee from all different countries, converging in new ones, rarely is there a language problem in this book; it's as if there's an automatic ""google translate"" function working below the surface. And although everybody is a refugee from some broken country, they are referred to as refugees only once (page 132). ""Migrants"" is the noun, and they are doing their best to survive, but by doing so, instigating the movements of ""nativists"" defending their territory. The movement of everything—writing, persons, human herds—can make you dizzy. Here's just part of a page-long sentence that illustrates this: . . . once as Nadia sat on the steps of a building reading the news on her phone across the street from a detachment of troops and a tank she thought she saw online a photograph of herself sitting on the steps of a building reading the news on her phone across the street from a detachment of troops and a tank, and she was startled, and wondered how this could be, how she could both read this news and be this news, and how the newspaper could have published this image of her instantaneously, and she looked about for a photographer, and she had the bizarre feeling of time bending all around her, as though she was from the past reading about the future, or from the future reading about the past, and she almost felt that if she got up and walked home at this moment there would be two Nadias, that she would split into two Nadias, and one would stay on the steps reading and one would walk home, and two different lives would unfold for these two different selves, and she thought she was losing her balance, or possibly her mind, and then she zoomed in on the image and saw that the woman in the black robe reading the news on her phone was actually not her at all. (157-158)Although this book is nothing like The Grapes of Wrath, and Mohsin Hamid is no John Steinbeck, what I liked most about it was a similar bird's-eye view of human migration. It made it seem so natural—both the movement and the subsequent eruptions and subsiding of resistance to the movement. I didn't love the book, but I sure appreciate reading it right now in the midst of so many eruptions....more",Notes are private!,0,40,1,"May 12, 2017","May 14, 2017","Mar 18, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30688435-exit-west

I had a burning book club question and only one person answered, so I thought I'd ask it here: In this book, casual violence is the norm. When you read something like that in a novel, do you accept it, or do you judge from your beliefs about violence? And, extrapolating on that, I also wonder if when you read so-called ""unlikable characters"" if you accept them or if you judge them from your beliefs about good and bad. PLEASE comment. I shall not rest until I know how you feel about this!3/7/17 Although this life and place (near Naples, Italy, ca. 1950) saga begins with an index of characters, I promptly forgot it existed and therefore struggled to remember who everybody was. The book also tells you on the title page that it is Book One: Childhood, Adolescence—of the protagonist who has the same name as the author and her friend, Lila. But I forgot about that as well. So I was disappointed that the ending didn’t dovetail back to explain or enhance the provocative prologue. I guess one has to read the whole series.My Brilliant Friend is my book club’s pick this month, and since I’ve wanted to sample Ferrante, I was happy to read it. I enjoyed it. Sometimes I almost loved it. There is lots to resonate with—for anybody who has been the best friend to the popular girl, for anybody who has grown up with casual violence that is accepted as the cultural norm, for anybody who has been confused about who they are (most of us, especially in adolescence).

A story unspools with the alacrity of thought processes—a thought in present time suddenly catapults the narrator and you into a past time. There is tension, like a pot of water on a low flame on the stove. It heats, maybe simmers a while, and then threatens to boil, but never quite does. And that's okay. I so admire the daring thought and time transitions, and to stay with them, I read slowly and enjoyed the simmer, trusting that if I didn't understand something immediately, I would in a few sentences. The book is only 167 pages, and no boil works. The jacket copy says this will appeal to readers of The Dinner and Dept. of Speculation, which is rather brilliant. There is definitely a flavor of Herman Koch, but not The Dinner; the echoes are of the World War II politics in the background of his magnificent Dear Mr. M. And there is the free-wheeling domestic drama of Dept. of Speculation. I liked both of those books a lot, and I like this one.[There is one bad typo that stopped me: a ""w"" instead of a ""t.""

And what ""this"" is is that subjective ""must-be-written"" aspect that drove Saunders to write this book. If I don't sense that in the writing these days, I just don't want to read it.]What an imaginative, unusual, and nicely bawdy book, but I'm not sure you would be drawn to it if you have no background in Eastern traditions or predilection for, or merely willingness to suspend disbelief about, the notion that life exists beyond what we experience in our bodies or that in more ethereal realms thoughts create reality and that energy can move like great literal ocean waves, causing experiences and communications between the realms.I found myself yelling as I recognized my ego issues in people living in the bardo (a place a spirit goes to after death, according to Buddhist tradition) where Abraham Lincoln's young son, Willie, ends up after he dies. I was so affected by the recognition that I altered my actions to do what I was avoiding because of my ego fears. And I groaned in recognition of our common human mess—everybody is represented here with all their defenses, excuses, and denial! And they're all trapped, married to their suffering.I imagined George Saunders having a blast, wandering through cemeteries and imagining lives and deaths for all the people buried there. The story is about what happens between Willie and his dad (Buddhists and others may recognize him as a bodhisattva or guru-type character, and maybe he was!) as told by all the different characters living in the cemetery, as well as sometimes real and sometimes fictional quotes from references, and my one complaint is that the cited names and sources follow each entry instead of preceding their text, so reading is awkward—especially when they aren't identified until the following page. Nevertheless, I really enjoyed being surprised by this exquisitely written book. Yay, George Saunders, for being so daring and free and exposing all of us in this unique tale about suffering and eventual liberation!***10/18/17 UpdateLincoln in the Bardo just won the Man Booker prize! According to The Guardian, author George Saunders accepted the prize this way: ""If you haven't noticed, we live in a strange time. So the question at the heart of the matter is pretty simple: Do we respond to fear with exclusion and negative projection and violence? Or do we take that ancient great leap of faith and do our best to respond with love? And with faith in the idea that what seems other is actually not other at all, but just us on a different day.""In the U.S. now we're hearing a lot about the need to protect 'culture.' Well this tonight is culture. It's international culture; it's compassionate culture; it's activist culture. It's a room full of believers, through the word, in ambiguity, in beauty and in trying to see the other person's point of view even when that's hard. Believers in working to eliminate hatred and meanness and lazy habitual thinking even when—especially when—we find these in ourselves.""In a blog, I wrote my theory that this book is a Lincoln as Bodhisattva story, sent it to Saunders, who answered with one word: ""Exactly.""

It is not only educative (badly needed in these turbulent times), but it is deeply moving. I'm in awe or the ability of the founders to see so far ahead and produce organized rules that have lasted.That said, I also see how constricted our human vision can be. For instance, in the Declaration's enumeration of all the King of England's crimes against the colonies, there is this amazingly blind statement, completely ignoring the fact that the colonies' population stole already populated lands*: HE [King] has excited domestic Insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the Inhabitants of our Frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known Rule of Warfare, is an undistinguished Destruction, of all Ages, Sexes and Conditions.Unlike the crimes against Native Americans**, which have never been properly redressed, slaves and women eventually get their day in the amendments to the Constitution, known as the Bill of Rights.Opening with a short, clear history written by the nonpartisan think-tank publisher, the Cato Institute***, these documents are not hard to understand and they pulse with life. Those two attributes give me hope that they will evolve in ways to protect us and our cherished democracy.__________________*[image]**1/6/17, for levity's sake--I'm currently reading Sherman Alexie's wonderful The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian, and this quote seems applicable: I always think it's funny when Indians celebrate Thanksgiving.

I just read a chillingly informative article about neoliberalism in The Guardian that mentions the Cato Institute as a place that is funded by this movement for privilege for the few at the expense of the many. When I looked at Cato's site, I saw that it was a think tank interested in limited government, but I also believed it was, as stated, nonpartisan. Apparently not; it was founded by the Koch Brothers.

And answering that question is a good reason to read the main story of thiThe opening line of the Foreword (by Simon McBurney) is ""Why are you here?"" And answering that question is a good reason to read the main story of this book. I read it after having twice seen the book-based Broadway production of The Encounter with Simon McBurney. (If any Goodreaders are in NYC or the vicinity and can make it to see the play before it closes January 8th and moves out of the country, you can probably get half-price tickets at TKTS booths.)The main story of both this play and the book (written by Petru Popescue as if he witnessed things firsthand) is National Geographic photographer and explorer Loren McIntyre's search for and residence with an elusive Amazonian tribe called Mayoruna, or cat people; they have cat-like tattoos and whisker piercings because they believe they are related to jaguars. The main drama of this story is McIntyre's experience of telepathy (or the ""Beaming"" in the title) with headman Barnacle and McIntyre's changing understanding of man's relationship to time—and exactly what time is. Eventually his personal experience of beaming and his later quest for the source of the Amazon River become a quest for true Source.I have no doubts about telepathy, but I was fascinated by the explanation for why some people experience it as a ""first language"" and others do not. (I won't divulge this because it would be a spoiler.) Another thing I found illuminating in the book (as opposed to the play) was learning that all the power-playing ego problems that plague civilizados have parallels in this indigenous tribe where there is female mutilation and abuse, prey animals treated like objects, there are rivalries, brutality, etc. There is no idealism of tribal culture. But the one thing that is different is the tribe's experience of time and also their respect for the headman's abilities and directions—although he has to struggle to maintain his leadership.Whereas the play (based on only the Mayoruna story—the first part of this book) was so experiential that the story sometimes got fuzzy, the book is clear and detailed; however about 50 of the last 150 pages are history and geography that sometimes felt disorganized. It is such a detailed account of the Amazon River's history and exploration that it may appeal to travel, map, and geography aficionados and historians; I read it with a world atlas beside me and often felt like I was drowning in a swamp. (As an editor, I'd have cut most of it, and picked up the final search for the source of the Amazon as it relates to the Mayoruna adventure.)One of the first Mayoruna telepathic messages in the book—also used in the play—is: ""Some of us are friends."" I believe some of us are friends—those of us who feel each other's feelings—and I believe all of us can be friends in this way.The play ended with McBurney's after-curtain chat wherein he told us that when he'd visited the Mayoruna and told them about his project, they responded, ""Good. If you tell them this story, then they will know our story. Tell them that we exist.""Knowing that these people exist, that they know that we are all one and that the Amazon is a Source for all of us, having felt the Oneness that the play evoked and having learned a fuller story through this book—all of this is comforting....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,"Dec 27, 2016","Jan 03, 2017","Dec 18, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/29521849-the-encounter

There is so much to praise in this grand historical novel about aristocrat Count Rostov who was sentenced by the revolutionary Bolshevik government to house arrest in the posh Metropol Hotel in Moscow (think Eloise in the Plaza if she were a 30-year-old gentleman living in 1922 Moscow, as told by a fine literary writer who spews poetry from his taste buds and history from his pores). But suffice it to say, it is a can’t-put-down book, and for writers, there is much to steal here as far as pure storytelling technique. (I’m filing “things to remember” in my secret literary brain compartment that I will never divulge.)Here’s something I can’t steal but would like to:Like the Freemasons, the Confederacy of the Humbled is a close-knit brotherhood whose members travel with no outward markings, but who know each other at a glance. For having fallen suddenly from grace, those in the Confederacy share a certain perspective. Knowing beauty, influence, fame, and privilege to be borrowed rather than bestowed, they are not easily impressed. They are not quick to envy or take offense. They certainly do not scour the papers in search of their own names. They remain committed to living among their peers, but they greet adulation with caution, ambition with sympathy, and condescension with an inward smile. (196)The same could be said of anybody who has learned from life as they’ve aged. Dear Mr. Towles, From your cover photo, you look too young to know this. Damn you and bravo!For a treasure chest of related gems, see Amor Towles’s website.3/19/17 Update: I watched the movie Casablanca last night because it is heavily referenced in this wonderful novel. I found myself scrutinizing it for details, but realized that the details have very little to do with Towles's plot. Yes, the theme is important, but Towles's plot is way more complex and intriguing. So if you aren't a Casablanca aficionado, no problem, but I do sort of wish I'd watched the movie before reading the book.5/24/17 I went to hear Amor Towles speak. Fabulous.

Hence, my fear at the proliferation of swastikas following our election. I don't like feeling this kind of fear, and education helps lower my heart rate as I stay engaged. I read Our Revolution because I needed educating, and if that is your goal, this is the book—whether you are a Bernie true believer, a Clinton supporter, or a Trump voter whose motivation was to take a sledge hammer to a system that is not working and is ignoring millions of people.The first section of this book is a methodical educational walk through recent politics—absolutely excellent, clear-eyed, and optimistic (particularly the Burlington story which comes near the beginning of the book), no matter who you voted for! If you can ignore your particular biases, you will receive an education in oligarchy, which has been the direction of politics for a long, long time—whoever has money gets their way.The political power of the oligarchs goes well beyond their campaign contributions and ability to influence elections. As a result of their ownership of media, think tanks, university chairs, and political front groups, they influence American public opinion and domestic and foreign policy in ways that few realize. (190)The second section of this book is a manifesto about what exists now and how to create something else for all of us who want fairness, the ability to make a living, safety, and acknowledgement. There is a lot of detail, heavy facts—so much knowledge that I wondered how Sanders can contain it without having his head explode as mine kept threatening to do. But education is not easy. And it can be pretty scary to learn the why and how of oligarchy. At times, I felt panicked and overwhelmed. But I would rather feel those things than not know. There are reasons behind Sanders's campaign talking points about the top 2% owning all the wealth being a bad idea, about why raising the minimum wage is a good thing and how it can be done, and the section on reforming Wall Street is an alarming ""Paul Revere""-type equal-opportunity indictment of Democrats and Republicans that left me gasping.I found myself personally stirred up—remembering times when employers had claimed financial reasons for underpaying me or when people who made three times my income balked at my hourly freelance rate; I recalled a senior colleague, a man with a trust fund, telling me in all seriousness that our pay should be determined by what we need and since he had three homes and two kids, he needed more than I did. When I said I would like to own one home rather than rent and have the option to do things like go to the theater and the doctor, he seemed to think my desire for growth did not equate to his need to support his existing lavish lifestyle—and this is the normal mindset in our country! I learned in Our Revolution that the most common human tendency is to not only grab as much of the pie as you can, but actually believe you need it and it's better if you have it. What an illusion! I finally got educated about trade; I'd just thought I was stupid and uninformed, but I learned that this may be because the news media have a vested interest in not covering trade agreements. In short, this book is grad school of substance behind Sanders's familiar talking points. Read in-depth, simple-to-understand discourses on topics you want to know about, or skim and skip some sections once you get the gist—I did this increasingly toward the end of the book, and my one criticism is I wish there were an index and bibliography or endnotes so that I could easily go back to certain topics after writhing on the floor and recovering from the information overload, maybe a year from now.What makes this book so optimistic is that Sanders has experienced beating the odds. He's seen the people who voted on both sides, and I mean really seen them. They filled his rallies. ""At all of these rallies, where we were filling up large arenas, people were not walking out during a long speech, they were not (I think) bored. They were listening. If there is a lesson I learned from this experience, it was that Americans are hungry for an understanding of what is going on in our country and how we can improve it."" (147)  And his section called ""Turning Workers into Owners"" (pp. 259-262) was completely new and exciting to me. Why don't we do these things? Lots of other places have and they work!We have our job set out for us, but Sanders and others believe that if we stop sitting it out, if we take our politics personally and become involved, accepting that NOBODY on top, no elected official is going to ""fix"" our life, we can change, but it must come from the ground up. My opinion: It is critical that we stop blaming and acknowledge that we all want the same things: fairness, a chance to succeed in life, a safe home. Sanders has some very good ideas about how to accomplish those things.

Here's a description of the kiss Ivy, a researcher at a think tank where she researches euphemisms for vagina (the list is hysterical and goes on for pages), has with her boss: It was an awkward kiss, not least because of the significant difference in their heights. Ned was bending from the waist as far as he could, while Ivy craned her neck up and back so that her open mouth was nearly horizontal, her tongue reaching for the stars.

But, lO' t'is is so good as to defy expression by this language-challenged oaf of an incarnate er who oft' has been intimidated by Shakespeare! But, lo, let me try.Narrated by a modern, but terribly highbrow and poetic in-utero Hamlet, whose mother Trudy is having an affair with a banal lover named Claude, the fetus moans, judges, and (sometimes drunkenly—his mother and he are wine connoisseurs!) waxes poetic about everything from the injustice of his lot inside his mother's womb to her slovenly housekeeping and her sexual exploits: Not everyone knows what it is to have your father's rival's penis inches from your nose. By this late stage they should be refraining on my behalf. Courtesy, if not clinical judgement, demands it. I close my eyes, I grit my gums, I brace myself against the uterine walls. This turbulence would shake the wings off a Boeing. My mother goads her lover, whips him on with her fairground shrieks. Wall of Death! On each occasion, on every piston stroke, I dread that he'll break through and shaft my soft-boned skull and seed my thoughts with his essence, with the teeming cream of his banality. Then brain-damaged, I'll think and speak like him. I'll be the son of Claude. (20-21)Not only is this book funny and wildly imaginative, but it conveys the convolutions of relationships (mothers and sons, mothers and children, mothers and fathers) and growth of personality and ego brilliantly and in a visceral way that makes more sense than almost anything I've ever read.An aside: I fantasize that, had he lived, one of my favorite authors, John Kennedy Toole (A Confederacy of Dunces) would have found an odd kinship with this work....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,"Oct 24, 2016","Oct 26, 2016","Oct 24, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30008702-nutshell

I like to read one book at a time, sinking into the writer’s world and surrendering myself to story and character. The nice thing about a short story collection is that you can do this one story at a time, and if you don’t have a lot of time or have interruptions, you can still have a full story meal. I’ve had an onslaught of editing work lately and I can’t read for pleasure when I’m reading for work. So Roxane Gay’s stories provided short, often painful, pleasures. I like to get bigger when I read, and this happens when I identify with people who are very different from me. Gay created a whole book of them—some more full than others. This is moving and exciting work.You can hear Roxane Gay read some of the stories in this book and discuss her work at her 92nd Street Y appearance. (The video went into buffering a few times. Just nudge it forward manually and it continues.) She is funny, articulate, and I suspect a wonderful teacher (she is a tenured professor). At the end she answers questions from the audience, and this is when her kindness comes out. It’s something I felt as a hidden foundation for some of the stories—no matter how defended the women were, they came from an author who feels kindness toward people who hurt. This video adds to the experience of the book. And I love that Gay and I agree on the most moving and romantic story, “North Country,” which ends with the kindness fully exposed....more",Notes are private!,0,13,2,"not setFeb 22, 2017","Feb 28, 2017Feb 28, 2017","Oct 12, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/28818921-difficult-women

It started out sounding a little slick for my taste, but I quickly was seduced by the drama. I love thinking about multiverses and probable reality and all the real-life existence possibilities made likely by quantum mechanics. So I was with this, turning pages fast, eager to see what happened next . . . until the first evildoer murder of a good guy. My disappointment was vocal; I may have bellowed, ""Shit!"" I think my problem was that I started reading this the day after finishing the magnificent David Mitchell's mind-blowing book Ghostwritten, which is so mind-blowing because it forces you to stretch to understand and stay in contact with its story. I like that stretch. I like working hard to learn and stay in communion with a writer's story that feels authentic, even if its plot is fantastical.The moment Dark Matter devolved into a good guys vs. bad guys popcorn movie of a book, and I groaned, I realized the problem was not the book, but my unrealistic expectations: I wanted it to be more than it is. So accepting that it isn't, I relaxed, enjoyed the accessibility of the story, and read on.The good stuff: I was never bored. It was a good book in the genre of thriller with a nice romantic element. It will make a good popcorn movie and maybe a spin-off TV series. The not-so-good stuff: people who are more excited by fiction that addresses transcendent questions through this kind of material (moi) will be disappointed. Every aspect of the book—even those that address the nature of choice and identity—come from the small ego perspective. For instance:(view spoiler)[(1) The protagonist, Jason, enters a fourth dimension where he and his cohort have access to all probable realities, yet his personality and perspective stay firmly rooted in the small ego. The excuse for this is that their physical makeup cannot handle fourth-dimensional reality so their unbounded minds reduce it to an image of a corridor and doors entering into alternate realities that they can handle. I think the truth is that the writer either didn't think of it or didn't want to stretch enough to write a reality neither he nor readers can comprehend. It makes no energetic or physiological sense that a being who has taken a compound that turns off the observing self (and thus the part that would stop superpositioning) would or could stay rooted in the small ego. Listen to the talks by neuroscientist Jill Bolte Taylor who suffered this loss in a stroke. There are enlightened beings in our midst who experience fourth-dimensional reality, and they say that they simply do not identify themselves as the personality they inhabit. Yes, they live there, but they know they are much more—the same way you know you may live in clothes, but you are not the clothes. Why not try to write that? Why not stretch? Haruki Murakami does. So does David Mitchell. Muktananda's Play of Consciousness does its best to actually translate the experience into words normal humans can understand. Why not struggle to write bigger than you are? That would excite me.(2) In this fourth dimension, what Jason and his pal ""think"" determines which probable reality they will enter. Well, this only makes sense if they are in the transcendent One state where they realize they are everybody. Otherwise, what about all the thoughts and beliefs of all the other people occupying these realities? This book would have us believe two little egos can create a whole other reality where other beings simply serve as actors for the protagonists, yet they seem to be full beings also. There are so many flaws in this, I cannot begin to talk about it. I would have no complaints if this book had stretched to an experience of Oneness and then had the characters see themselves in all the other characters as you would see the colors broken by a prism. But alas, it did not. (hide spoiler)]This book is a use and reduction of huge concepts to create a commercial story. The whole thing is a manipulation that, if you care about the big stuff, sounds like an equation that makes no sense: 5 gazillion + 2 = 4.Kudos to the cover artist.

He espouses isolationism, but has made agreements with Hitler’s supporters to stay out of the war and simultaneously relocate and assimilate Jews in America through something called the Office of American Absorption. The program is so well-orchestrated that it is espoused as a wonderful thing by many Jews, but in the “Jewish ghetto” of Newark there are some holdouts. Roth speaks in the first person, using his own family’s real names, in this alternate history, and it is chilling.What’s chilling is how easily lies become truth because enough people derive importance by having their social status raised by coming onboard with those in power. And when famous journalist Walter Winchell, leader among the holdouts, gets dumped from his radio program, in a last ditch effort to speak truth, he writes what turns out to become a much-reviled final newspaper column: “The Lindbergh fascists . . . have openly begun their Nazi assault to freedom of expression. Today Winchell’s the enemy to be silenced . . . Winchell ‘the warmonger,’ ‘the liar,’ ‘the alarmist,’ ‘the Commie,’ ‘the kike.’ Today yours truly, tomorrow every newscaster and reporter who dares to tell the truth about the fascist plot to destroy American democracy. Honorary Aryans like the rabid rabbi Lyin’ Lionel B. and the snooty Park Avenue proprietors of the gutless New York Times aren’t the first ultracivilized Jewish Quislings to grovel before an anti-Semitic master because they’re just too, too refined to fight like Winchell . . . and they won’t be the last. The jerks at Jergens [the radio sponsor that fired Winchell] aren’t the first corporate cowards to play ball with the dictatorial lying machine that is now ruining this country . . . and they won’t be the last. (242)Things deteriorate, Americans are fighting each other, and New York City’s Mayor La Guardia decries the gossip and innuendo that have become truth:  “To have enslaved America with this hocus-pocus! To have captured the mind of the world’s greatest nation without uttering a single word of truth! Oh, the pleasure we must be affording the most malevolent man on earth!” (316)A timely story.

Here are the lines that made me know I was going to read this book all the way through, even though I wasn’t hooked from the start: She [a middle-aged actress] could have been a great Sonya [in Uncle Vanya] if she’d known what she knows now. That the thankless servitude Sonya describes, the life of lowered eyes and expectations, of unrelenting hard work, no love, no romance, no children, no reward, old age, then death—it is a real possibility! That life could happen to anyone! More likely it will. Sonya doesn’t believe it. She can’t. She’s too young. The irony is that you don’t believe it until you’re too old to play Sonya. (24)Mister Monkey careens like a brakeless locomotive from the off-off-off-off Broadway performance of a terrible children’s musical of the same title, through the lives of all of the people connected to it. And the most daring thing about this book is that it is written in “monkey mind”—the Buddhist term for all the chatter our human brains spout 24 hours a day; every stray thought, every association to a stray thought, every memory evoked fills the connecting narrative. This could get exhausting, and during the first chapter, I thought it might. But not in the hands of Francine Prose. It works! Boy, does it work and sometimes it’s laugh-out-loud funny.There is so much I can personally relate to—foremost that I’m a former actor who for a decade navigated the cesspool that is off-off-off-off Broadway—and I delighted in the exposure of its subtext. Also, I’m a fan of the Hindu monkey king Hanuman.[image]And here is Krishna Das singing the Hanuman Chalisa (to the Heart as Wide as the World melody)You may enjoy this book more if you have some background in Eastern Wisdom Traditions, but I don't think it's critical. There is plenty of “outing” of the stuff behind our social performances, and what makes it so compelling is the final exposure of our quiet desperation and blundering attempts to live good lives.

An Object of Beauty recounts the dramatic vicissitudes from the late 1990s to the recession, and does it with such an artistic hand that you might miss the depth of knowledge that weaves this story together. The story is told by an art writer who introduces us to his one-time love and then perpetual platonic friend Lacey Yeager—starting when they’ve both landed in New York City where Lacey joins “the spice rack of girls at Sotheby’s.” Lacey quickly advances from the “dim basement” where she measures and catalogs art to manipulating herself as an “object of beauty” in order to climb the gilded art-world ladder.And now for an interlude about Voice: The fact that this book is written by Steve Martin and that he is so famous that you cannot not know his voice is a liability for readers who value the alchemy of words and brain function, with no intermediary reader interpreting. His fame, I’m sure, contributed to his being able to get a book published and read enough to be on the New York Times bestseller list, but this book is good enough to stand on its own—good enough so that eventually I was able to stop hearing him and hear my inner reader’s voice. Kudos, Mr. Martin.Okay, back to the main event: Lacey Yeager, the star of this art caper. In my opinion, Lacey is a star among psychopathic women in novels that I’ve read recently. Some readers have criticized the characters in this book as flat, but I don’t think so. And I wonder if there is a kind of bias informing the criticism.In two books I’ve read in the past few months, female writers have brilliantly conveyed the male equivalent of the female psychopath: Emma Cline in The Girls, a book I’m not a huge fan of, wrote a brilliant seduction scene between the young female protagonist and the character based on Charles Manson. And in the upcoming Cruel Beautiful World, author Carol Leavitt similarly conveys a psychopathic male school teacher who is irresistible to an underage student.Just as Cline and Leavitt conveyed the male psychopath, I think Herman Koch, in his upcoming masterpiece Dear Mr. M and Steve Martin in An Object of Beauty convey the female psychopath in such a way that I’ve got new understanding of women who consciously give off light, knowing that they are the center of attention and flagrantly using this to manipulate, without deep feelings behind their actions. I think Martin’s and Koch’s renditions are real characters whom I now will recognize and be informed about—whereas, in the past, I’ve been charmed but confused by such people. I’ve written my share of male psychopaths (a cult leader in Plan Z by Leslie Kove, a boy named Donny Sherman in The Last Will & Testament of Zelda McFigg) because I’ve been charmed and intrigued by them. But I’ve never written the kind of character Steve Martin so brilliantly and elegantly understands and conveys in the person of Lacey Yeager—probably because I've never deeply understood such a person. Which brings me to a theory: perhaps it’s easier for opposite sex writers to be enchanted and hurt by these characters and eventually understand them enough to write them so well. And perhaps it’s easier for opposite sex readers to accept as real the opposite-sex psychopath because such a person could not be who they are. It’s just a thought....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,"Aug 28, 2016","Aug 30, 2016","Aug 20, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7907803-an-object-of-beauty

I've stayed away from Stephen King's books because I do not like being scared and I was under the impression that Masterful writing and storytelling. I've stayed away from Stephen King's books because I do not like being scared and I was under the impression that he wrote horror. He does. But in this book of four novellas, the horror is rooted in the normal human being's shadow (to use Jung's nomenclature). And the fact that it is exposed and played out through such exquisite writing makes it all the more horrifying. And the beauty of the writing makes the ugliness more ugly and also tolerable.Sometimes a writer who is writing for a deep personal reason (and not all writers do) will expose his motivation. For me, King's M.O. came in this quote from the novella called Apt Pupil about an all-American sociopathic boy who gets involved with a Nazi, living incognito, in his small town: The things that happened in those camps still have power enough to make the stomach flutter with nausea. . . . maybe there is something about what the Germans did that exercises a deadly fascination over us—something that opens the catacombs of the imagination. Maybe part of our dread and horror comes from a secret knowledge that under the right—or wrong—set of circumstances, we ourselves would be willing to build such places and staff them. Black serendipity. Maybe we know that under the right set of circumstances the things that live in the catacombs would be glad to crawl out. (250)I can relate to this; it is why I write as well—to expose the flaws: things that, if we are deluded enough to believe we don't contain or, if we know they're in our ""catacombs,"" we imagine or hope are well concealed. The delusion that we are, or at least appear, ""all-good"" makes us capable of cruelty rather than compassion. Stephen King exposes it all, and he does it elegantly (although he denies that in his Afterword), eloquently, and sometimes even erotically. I am a journalist and fiction writer, but I make my living primarily as an editor. I've edited a number of memoirs and a few novels by first-time writers, and the most sensitive issue I deal with is nudging them to write flawed (aka ""real"") characters in their first-person protagonists. Most people want to portray themselves or fictional characters they identify with as ""right"" or ""noble"" in an environment where others are ""wrong"" or ""just don't understand."" This makes for flat, unreal stories. No matter what you're writing, as a storyteller you must simultaneously identify with and know more than all of your characters. You must love and believe in them the way they believe in themselves but also expose their hidden parts and their delusions for the reader to see. As readers, we immediately see when characters are flat, but so many writers who are identifying with their own rightness and are unwilling to appear wrong become blind.Stephen King has 20/20 vision. He writes real—whether it is a murderer or a falsely accused prisoner (Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption); a Nazi war criminal, a sociopathic kid, or a concentration camp survivor (Apt Pupil); four boys on a rite-of-passage quest that is revolting and exciting, sad and lonely and a testament to friendship all at the same time (The Body); or a severed-headed superwoman (The Breathing Method).By being willing to love the darkness and the monsters who live there, he forces us to see and identify with them if we dare.

Suffice it to say there are a group of school kids in Holland. There is a teacher. There is a writer. And they all weave together in a kind of murder mystery—but ignore what I just said because this is not a typical mystery. It’s not a typical anything. It is an exposition of the inner workings of humans at their worst and a bleak philosophical treatise about good vs. bad, right vs. wrong, the nobility of action vs. inaction, the vicissitudes of power to create balance, loss of innocence and the nature of existence that is so well done that, even though my own philosophy about the final nature-of-life topic is quite different, having just finished reading, all I can do is bounce from couch to computer, yelling “Yay! Bravo!” The book is riveting, entertaining, and magnificently rendered.In an NPR interview, the internationally bestselling Dutch author was asked about reader reaction to The Dinner, a disturbing story about people doing despicable things and enabling their children to get away with horrifying crimes. In reply, Koch said, “It goes from people saying, well, this seemed a nice man in the beginning, but in the end he is not, to put it mildly. And there is another part of the readers who say, finally, a character in a book who actually does what we are all thinking. This is the other extreme. Sometimes I noticed that in southern countries, they see it more like a social criticism. And in Holland and in northern countries, they see it more as the storyline, or the actual question of: How far would you go to protect the ones you love?” I live in the USA, which I guess qualifies as a southern country, and I certainly fall into the latter category. In Dear Mr. M, an anonymous letter writer says to the author (M) he is stalking that M has a kind of obscene expression: “You’re not looking at the reader, no, you’re challenging him to look at you—to keep looking at you. It’s like one of those contests to see who’ll avert their eyes first; a contest the reader always loses.” I suspect Herman Koch, too, does this. Not once during his virtual gaze that permeates the story does he blink. But neither did I. I was too enthralled, drawn by an ineffable magnetic force into his meticulously honest creation exposing how we really are. I will read with gusto anything this man writes. * * *P.S.

I, who eschew excess words and have no problem wiping them out of my own books and the work I edit? I first read Look Homeward, Angel when I was in junior high school. I retained none of the story, only my reaction to it: awe. For more than forty years, the yellowing hardcover that my father purchased at Macy’s (per the stamp on the back end paper) has been on my top shelf near the ceiling—a shelf of books that I rescued from death by mildew in my mother’s garage in the 1970s. A week ago, on impulse, I pulled it down and started reading. Why did I keep reading until page 318? I think because, fifty-some years after first having read it, I can articulate that Wolfe writes what I feel. His poetry—although a laborious read and sometimes almost adolescent in its verbosity—conveys the essence of what it is to be born “a stranger in a strange land,” to feel stuck between spirit and life in a body, to have memories that defy sentence-making, and rather than drown in all his words, at least for the first half of the book, I mostly inhaled them, trusting my brain-transcending comprehension. And there are a lot of words—endless poetic streams that suddenly and unexpectedly are peppered with raucous, sly humor: the inanity of a conversation between a drunk and his wife and parodies of newspaper society pages and cheesy romantic novels: “He crushed her to him in a fierce embrace; her slender body yielded to his touch as he bent over her; and her round arms stole softly across his broad shoulders, around his neck, drawing his dark head to her as he planted hungry kisses on her closed eyes, the column of her throat, the parted petals of her fresh young lips.” (105) What fun Wolfe must have had writing this.In 626* tightly printed, densely packed pages dripping and leaking and flooding and inundating your puny intake orifices with inky words (I’m demonstrating here, in case you’re taking me seriously. And FYI, Part 2 of the three parts gets so heavy with modifiers that it becomes almost funny. Can you follow this parenthetical bit? Sorry, but it’s nothing compared to the book itself.), Wolfe tells the story of his alter ego, Eugene Gant, born in 1900: He felt, rather than understood, the waste, the confusion, the blind cruelty of their lives—his spirit was stretched out on the rack of despair and bafflement as there came to him more and more the conviction that their lives could not be more hopelessly distorted, wrenched, mutilated, and perverted away from all simple comfort, repose, happiness, if they set themselves deliberately to tangle the skein, twist the pattern. (136-137)Alas, a little less than 200 pages later, I found myself skimming and then drowning, and decided that reading this once in a lifetime, even if I can’t remember it, will suffice.Still there are things I admire here. Despite his excessiveness, Wolfe expresses the nuances of life and, with a sage’s X-ray vision, the many layers of Eugene Gant and all the people who surround him.________*I read the 1929 edition which was trimmed by 60,000 words at the bidding and hands of the immaculate editor Maxwell Perkins (see a wonderful movie about Perkins and Wolfe called Genius) and is still torturously overwritten. In 2000, the original cuts were restored in a new edition; read at your own peril.**Because it is 2016, I feel compelled to note the business-as-usual racism in the book for younger readers. This book would never be published now not only because of the overwriting but because the culture would not accept this expression of a white Christian’s take on Blacks and Jews.

I think the lush descriptions of food and fashion will appeal to foodies and fashionistas. With a story told in alternating first-persons by the adult characters, the narrative is excellent; these voices have a quality similar to voiceovers in a movie. One major beef: there was huge plot transition missing toward the end.Nevertheless, this is good “women’s fiction.” I particularly appreciate the understatement of the writing—unlike so many books in this genre that I have abandoned when the endless expression and explanation of every thought and feeling bogged me down.That said, I went into my editor’s head reading this book. I am not a big fan of split first-person perspectives. It is a lot harder to write a single first person who reveals to the reader more about the other characters and truths about himself than he knows, but for me, this perspective has a focused power that a split perspective dissipates. And I found myself imagining this story written in the voice of the character I found most interesting because he had the most secrets—a feat that would have taken this out of the soap opera realm, increased the tension from page one, and made it more powerful—on a parallel in many ways with Herman Koch’s The Dinner, which I loved. But that would have been a completely different book, so my reaction is ridiculous. Plus, women’s fiction sells better than literary fiction and is a lot easier to market because most readers do not agree with me. Hence, Delia Ephron is one smart cookie to do what she’s done, and I’ll hit myself upside-the-head now and shut up.Thanks to NetGalley for the ARC....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,"Jul 08, 2016",not set,"Jul 04, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/27246115-siracusa

I can relate.This is the perfect novel to hole up with when you feel absolutely overwhelmed by the craziness in the world, want nothing to do with it, and just like Ove, cannot justify your desire to check out.I read Backman's Britt-Marie Was Here first, and have heard from other ers that they preferred Ove and detected a formula to the books. Since I've read the books in reverse order, I tend to think you prefer whichever book you read first, because there is a formula, so the second book doesn't carry the surprise of the style. But I liked the formula . . . for a while. And the crafting of the chronology is very well done. By about page 200, I began getting tired—feeling as if I've read this before. Maybe Backman is like a dessert you just want to try once and then, satisfied that it was good, don't need to eat it anymore. That said, it's still a very sweet book that made me cry.I hibernated with this book over the weekend when just outside my building the NYC Marathon was going on, and between that and the upcoming election, I felt like I was in the wash cycle of an industrial washing machine. Ove was good medicine; the beginning of book especially evoked a quiet that I cherish.

It is that extremely rare debut novel by a young writer with an original voice, the daring to listen to it, and the skill to deliver—sans any of the bad habits taught in MFA programs or navel-gazing showing off. This voice is fully formed and unambiguous. Imagine the best Southern writers of many eras, plus a serving of a script by Shirley Jackson produced in Rod Serling’s The Twilight Zone, with a touch of futuristic Kurt Vonnegut seasoning, all cooked with an imagination that belongs only to Tiffany McDaniel. The setting is the fictional small town of Breathed, Ohio, during the abnormally hot summer of 1984. It is a story told by a man called Fielding Bliss (son of the town’s prosecutor, Autopsy Bliss)—from his point of view in a future none of us have yet lived.At Autopsy’s invitation, because he cannot live with being certain and wrong, he invites the devil to Breathed; surely the devil will be someone he is certain about and right. A boy shows up claiming to be the devil. And all hell breaks loose.This is a poetic parable about how, in fear, driven by our herd instinct, in the high heat of unexamined beliefs, we humans easily and instantly allow common sense to be melted away. It is about our species—beings who have not been accepted as they are, disappointed in themselves, similarly rejecting themselves and then others. Paradise Lost. (Each chapter begins with an epigraph from the Milton poem.) This book has an epic quality. The writing is unusual. Is life an ongoing tragedy?

We reject the gold and silk and finery of this life, preferring to stand as signs of contradiction—witnesses to truth.""According to the author's note at the end of this 1936-era Mark Twain-esque adventure, The Dirty Parts of the Bible is a retelling of the ancient Jewish tale of Tobias and Sarah, found in the Book of Tobit, but as a heathen and aspiring hobo who has never read Bible stories, I could not appreciate this part of the book. Still, I found the beginning, especially, to be mostly entertaining—even if, midway through, pedagogy about Bible stories being metaphorical did get a bit heavy-handed.If the deep truth carried by metaphor is an unknown concept to you, or if it's an issue whether the Bible is a metaphor or literal truth, or if you believe in a punishing or loving God, perhaps you won't find the pedagogy as stultifying as I did.

This book grows with the reader.Original 2017 ReviewI feel such a commonality with this book—Mary Lawson's style, the movements, the issues, the dialogue that is perfect pitch and as natural as breathing—that it almost renders me speechless. It's a story about children raising children. About no grownups. About being propelled into adult responsibility as a child and the delusions of survivor's guilt. There's a short Q&A with Lawson (http://www.marylawson.ca/qa-video/) where she qualifies the story as complete fiction. I believe her. The commonality I feel is not that I've lived this story because I haven't. What I feel is that, were I Canadian and from similar land, I too might have imagined it as she did.Recently Goodreader Larry Hoffer wrote: ""Did you ever get the feeling you and an author would be great friends (or perhaps mortal enemies), simply based on the books they write and the way they tell stories?"" I have that feeling about Mary Lawson. She seems to think the same thoughts and write them the way I would, and it's spooky and I love it and I love this book. It quietly and gently knocked the wind out of me.Thanks to Goodreaders Esil and Zoeytron for recommending Crow Lake in their comments about my  of Road Ends. I've found a new favorite writer.5/25/17 A very personal note after a day of reflection:I hesitate to share this, but since I've published articles half-assedly alluding to it ( Me and My Electra Complex and The Truth about the Making of The Trouble with the Truth), I don't know why I should be embarrassed; but I am.Until I read Crow Lake, I never realized the full extent that survivor's guilt has clouded my vision of my dead mother, whose book I edited and published a couple of years ago. I'd imagined that she suffered terribly in life because she never had my solo writer's life--a life that she might have enjoyed more than marriage and a whole bunch of kids who she didn't really want to take care of. (Don't worry, I worked all that stuff out a long time before she died, and we became best adult girl friends.) In my opinion, Mary Lawson offers the best a fiction writer can offer: the possibility for a reader to suddenly have a dark room lit up and realize the monsters you've installed there don't exist. Never existed.

In the beginning, it felt like a one-movie-camera shot gliding through a railroad apartment: one room led to the next and sometimes that led across the ocean to the radio office of Edward R. Murrow and Frankie Bard (a fictional female correspondent). I found the structure captivating, but remained mindful that I would have to remember a lot as the venue switched back and forth. Then the structure shifted to a more traditional novel's, where transitions happen in the chapter changes. And then about halfway through, it was as if the book's highly emotional engine started and drove the story to a moving ending. A little messy, but I remained kind of captivated by the real-life feeling of both the London Blitz people and the small-town Cape Codders in 1941.I also found myself associating to my New York experience of 9/11. Living on the Upper Westside when the World Trade Center was attacked, I was in a quiet enclave. September 11, 2001, was one of the most beautiful, clear and sunny days we've ever experienced, and that continued for many days after the attacks. Except for the expanding and eventually suffocating stench of death, you could almost imagine the devastation was across an ocean rather than just a few miles south, down the island of Manhattan. I stayed away from my job, which was below 14th Street in the blockaded zone. In shock, I walked my dogs as usual, kept my windows closed and the air purifiers on, and generally didn't know what to do with myself. There was no TV—the antennas on the Towers were gone. There was little phone service. And yet I was not dead. I can imagine that this would be something like the Cape Codders and many Americans felt during the London Blitz. On the one-year anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, I had a new job where my office window looked out on Ground Zero: a construction site—benign if you had no knowledge of what used to live there. I shared space with an entire community of shell-shocked people who had run for their lives a year earlier. We had constant emergency drills, and I was afraid every time a car backfired or the subway stalled. But I was alive and had stayed away from the worst of it. Survivor's guilt? Yes and no. What difference would it have made if I'd been in the thick of it? Or if, like so many others, I'd ventured downtown, past the blockade, to have a firsthand look at the horror?"". . . whatever is coming, comes [says a Cape Cod doctor in Postmistress; he has gone to London to try to help, after feeling the helplessness between life and death]. That's what holds it all together. We are all of us here in the mess. There's no way around it. And all I am in the face of it is a single voice and a pair of hands. Not anyone's son anymore. Not anyone's husband. Anonymous but necessary. Vital. A Lucky Strike.""The Postmistress is a flawed book, but there is something irresistible about it for me. It feels real (also evoking the current desperation of Syrian refugees), and it spans the divide between being in the thick of devastation and feeling it, even as you avoid it....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Apr 20, 2016","Apr 22, 2016","Apr 20, 2016",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/8049584-the-postmistress

The reasons for Britt-Marie's obsessions seep through the howlingly funny writing the way floor water might slowly penetrate a carpet laid on top of it. Fredrik Backman’s writing is original and kind of zippy—in style, use of present tense, everything. Here’s a sample:Hurt by her cheating husband, Britt-Marie has bullied her way into a job in the mythical dying Swedish (the book is translated) town of Borg during the depth of the recession. Here, she sees no reason to restrain her obsessive compulsions. After serving a couple of men coffee in the town pizzeria/grocery store/post office, where she has gone to borrow a drill, she Stands there by their table for a while, in the vague hope that one of them might say that the coffee’s decent. Neither of them do.“Ha. Are you intending to solve the crossword?”The men stare at her as if she has just addressed them without using vowels, then go back to their newspapers. Britt-Marie nods helpfully.“If you don’t have the intention of solving it, may I?”The men look a little as if she has asked whether they’re planning on using their kidneys in the foreseeable future or if she can use them.“Who are you, anyway?” asks one of the men.“I’m Britt-Marie.”“Are you from the city?”“Yes.” She smiles.The men nod, as if this explains everything.“Buy your own bloody newspaper, then,” says one of them. The other grunts in agreement.“Ha,” says Britt-Marie and decides not to offer them a top-up. (110–111)I love Britt-Marie, and I would definitely put her/this book on my next list of “Best Funny Books about Difficult Women” (see Difficult Women article). I also had a pernicious fantasy of Britt-Marie and my own made-up difficult woman, Zelda McFigg, in a crazy battle for control of an irrational, uncontrollable universe.

Then we learn the history that preceded his disappearing. This is a quietly brutal book, and it is honest. Oh how I love Kent Haruf's writing!***A day later's postscript:I read this book in one day, and after a night's sleep I realize what moves me about not only this novel, but all of Haruf's work that I've read. Before reading Where You Once Belonged, I read a magnificent war story (The Girl in Green by Derek Miller) that got to the root of why men fight. Before that I read the Declaration of Independence and Constitution—written by men with men's perspective that referred to Native Americans as ""savages"" and required 76 years to recognize the freedom of African Americans and 133 years for women to be legally represented. Inadvertently I've been choosing my reading to understand what is currently going on in US politics and around the globe, and I've begun to understand that so much of the turmoil may grow out of men's pride and inability to tolerate feeling impotent.Kent Haruf's men not only tolerate it, but they are unashamed—a quality that makes them, for me, transcendently, strong. And attractive. They are full people tolerating their puny human condition. Haruf simply reports it.

Redemption Road is a well-written thriller that screams to also live as a movie with its rolling, rural southern landscapes, shacks and small-town Main Street bustle, trains whistling through the night and iconic characters. Early on there was a whisper of Flannery O’Connor, but a better comparison is Scott Turow. Hart can write plot! And even in this genre of stock good guys vs. really evil bad guys, the characters are mostly truthful.

The reasons for that are beyond my ability or desire to articulate. But I do want to say that, for some people, this book may be a “magic pill.” There is something healing about reading a story—a fantasy of good luck really—that could so easily be hopeless, turned into something else because of a fantastical parade of good people who actually see a child and intervene for his well-being. This is not to negate the problems of this child-turned-man living two almost opposite experiences of non-nurturance and nurturance. These problems are exquisitely nuanced, played out in the second half (or, more accurately, “movement”) of the book, with a third movement that steps into heaven.The word “concerto,” Conroy writes, has a double meaning: “to join together, to work in concert, but also, from the Latin, to fight or to contend.” (389) So this book is a magnificent concerto, in all its complexity.

I was obsessed with that play when I was a young actor, and the dry, strange, deadpan, formal sound of this book might be described as a Samuel Beckett-ish Gold Rush-era surreal Western. The cover blurbs call it funny, but it didn’t make me laugh. However I was intrigued enough to keep reading beyond the first hundred pages. It took that long for me to find my bearings in this book—is it a dream, a play, life as a play or a dream? Maybe. Author Patrick DeWitt has fun with the forms. There are two sections he even calls “intermission,” the first of which ends with this: “There was a shift of the curtains in the house and I turned and left just as hastily as the girl had but in the opposite direction, and I did not at any point look back. . .” (146). A theater is called “a house,” and the curtains shifted [to denote intermission’s end and resumption of the play]. There is a lot of unfelt violence in this play of a book, just as you might dream it, with no remorse or any kind of feeling. And a lot of questioning of the insanity of man’s actions, lost purpose, and perpetual grasping for what he does not have—life in a River of Light.

What he was referring to was our inability to imagine the real possibility of creating, ourselves, a new way of living. There is something so orderly about going from reading Our Revolution to Suddenly, A Knock on the Door by an Israeli author who lives in tumult yet embodies alive imagination. The stories are not only so unpredictable they had me moaning and yelling “Oh god!” but sometimes they are even about the imagination they are jumpstarting. In a story called “A Good One,” a man has invented a board game called “Stop—Police” that “stimulates [a kid] to find his own solutions,” he tells the toy manufacturer he is pitching to. “You can think of this game as a sort of path of Rorschach blots that encourage you to use your imagination as you progress toward your goal—to win. (116)”Our Revolution and Suddenly, A Knock on the Door have nothing obvious in common; one is a heavy political treatise and the other is a little book of potent short-short stories.

A lot of fractured poetic clauses with adjectives and nouns used as verbs. It's the kind of stuff you either like or not. A coming-of-age story? The year: 1969. I was a senior in high school. Assuming the writer was about my age, I googled her, and to my surprise, I learned that she is all of twenty-five, so this was a period piece for her that she must have researched! I cannot tell you how weird this feels—to read a book written about my coming-of-age era that was researched by a young writer. But I guess every generation goes through this shock. Brava and okay, onward!The story, told in reportorial fashion from the believably wistful point of view of a woman who is much older than the author, is a fictionalized account of this woman's experience when she was fourteen. Evie Boyd is disgruntled at her home life and subsequently is seduced into a Charles Manson Family-like cult. The pace is very slow and so cerebral that in the beginning, I thought I might abandon the book as ""not for me."" But then came the seduction. Woah. The combination of mature knowing and willful innocence is brilliant and will be recognizable to anybody who has gone through a period of weakness when they believed some other magic person could make everything all right.Another thing that makes this a more mature book rather than Y.A. is that the fourteen-year-old's story alternates with the older woman's, which is a relief. We've all been through adolescence, and for me it can get boring really quickly. The mature woman is achingly believable and written with the same depth of understanding as the teenager. This is a dark, introspective story about denial, willful oblivion, profound immaturity, narcissism, and grandiose ego masquerading as enlightenment. It made me sick in the real time that I lived through it—I was the girl who refused to do any of it and watched with horror from the outside—and it still makes me sick. So since that's the meat of the story, well done.

This Independence Day short story remains one of my favorite things that I'vHappy Independence Day to all--whether you live in the U.S. or elsewhere. This Independence Day short story remains one of my favorite things that I've written. (Nothing to buy; it's free.)Jakey, Get Out of the BuggyGrampa Jake was a nasty, short-tempered, mean-spirited, frequently rude, sometimes sullen, usually drunk sonofabitch with no patience for anything or anybody, but I mean that in a good way.I loved Grampa Jake, and I know he would only allow me to write about him on condition that I'm honest, and this is the most honest I can be: Grampa Jake was a bastard.As far as I know, Grandma Ida (who I never met because I was born after the accident, which my father—her son—swore was no accident) and I were the only two human beings in the history of Jake's life to have had a conversation with him that didn't end in ""Go to hell!"" This and the fact that the tree killed Grandma may account for me being Jake's only visitor after he was put away in the Home. And I was not the best company due to my upset at being a 45-year-old waitress with a future that looked like a gaping black pit. But I'm getting ahead of myself. That is a really bad tendency of mine, which is the whole point of this story. So, although linear thought is not one of my strong points, I will attempt to tell this tale in a chronological fashion.My father, Grampa Jake's son, grew up with a deep-seated terror of becoming like Jake. So he never drank or smoked or told me I was insane to major in pottery at the most expensive college in the country. Instead, he paid for my passion for pots with the inheritance from my mother, a compulsive workaholic lawyer who was afraid to delegate responsibility. According to my father, Mom never left the office or her phone for more than ten minutes, except for the time she gave birth to me. Anyhow, the inheritance was the proceeds from the sale of her firm after she died from overwork when I was two. It financed my exorbitantly expensive BA in pottery plus two years of finding myself, only to discover that I had a deep-seated terror of being found and no marketable skills whatsoever. When the money ran out, I settled into my dead end job as a waitress for the meanest man in town, at which job I had been—at the time of my last visit to Grampa Jake—for 21 years, three months, and two days, and I hated every minute of it.""Tell the bastard to go f*** himself!"" boomed Grampa Jake. (To be honest, I must record that Jake used the ""f"" word frequently. I'm used to it, but out of sensitivity to those of you who are not, I will use the standard abbreviation.) ""F***ing scumbag! If he won't give you July Fourth off, quit!""And it was then, for the first time in 21 years, three months, and two days, that I really considered the possibility of life without this job, and my fantasies of destitution began. Let's be honest, who is going to hire a 45-year-old waitress with no marketable skills? Besides which I'm a terrible waitress.

The meandering quality is because the descriptions and sequence of them felt like a travelogue; a woman travels from Burlington, Vermont, to Turkey, and within Turkey, to the place of her honeymoon, to Konya (Rumi’s hometown), and to other smaller towns. Toward the end (page 211 of 225 pages), we are reminded that she has taken this journey because she is trying to recapture something from decades earlier, and then the list of events is recapped, culminating in the admission that she is lost. I almost felt as if I were reading the details of a well-researched trip, reported as they were observed—like travel notes in a journal, with no story in mind. In fact, it felt as if the story was superimposed on travel notes and the writer was a little lost about what she was attempting. For me, further disjointedness came from many emotional transitions that didn’t feel organic, a seemingly endless supply of money funding this trip that was never explained (the protagonist is a teacher), and a completely unbelievable ending. In other words, there were many aspects of this story that didn’t feel real, yet it also didn’t feel surreal or like a dream.Nevertheless, the writing is nice.I read this book because it was immediately available at my library and the two books by Vida that Goodreads friends had raved about were not.

Even the though the first story in this collection, ""The Payoff,"" had an ending that not only took me by surprise, but gave me one of those rare transcendent glimpses of a whole-life experience, it took me one more story to realize I was in the hands of somebody who would never take the easy way out. By that I mean, even if the material she was dealing with—in the case of the first two stories, young adults and domestic turmoil—might easily become genre stuff (young adult cute angst, navel-gazing women's fiction), no way would Perabo reduce it to that.

I've felt battered from the Trump insanity, ambivalent about the last few books I've read or abandoned, had a yen for a well-written page-turner, and Before the Fall was on my list. However escapism it was not, since it mimicked enough of Trumpland and newsland to be a little eerie—particularly since it was written before the investigations about possible money laundering and ties to sanctioned governments and features an albeit unbelievable cartoon of Bill O'Reilly . . . plus there's the added synchronicity of Roger Ailes dying just as I was reading about the head of a rightwing news conglomerate dying. But a main theme of this book is the power of synchronicity to distort reality. Here's what happens: a bunch of people go up in a plane and crash. That's as much plot as I'll give. The book is classified as a mystery, although it's a ""what happened?"" rather than a ""whodunit"" and there are no red herrings. But what I most enjoyed was the themes: the above-mentioned bit about synchronicity as well as the sometimes subtle and microscopic examination of time and identity and reality. For instance, what happens to a true identity once it becomes other people's stories? What is reality if it exists as specks of moments that we merely experience as a continuum? What is reality if, with the benefit of another context, it is not what it seemed? The book is not a navel-gazing literary treatise.

He dares to strip away façade—manners, civility, clothes, and skin—and write every nuance of a flailing human ego in a world of other flaming egos. He writes civilized, educated humans in their most primitive form—terrified for their survival in a world where they can’t control anything or anyone or ever ""get enough,"" where they are tribal, competitive, judgmental, craving, and scheming.No, this is not how we want to see ourselves, but I believe we all contain all these things as well as our more compassionate, generous, and curious qualities. We can loathe his psychopathic characters or, even as their behavior disgusts us (and, believe me, in this book, it does), we can feel their fear and their defenses, or stare straight in the eyes what we have witnessed in others and denied because it is too uncomfortable to acknowledge, and say, yes, it is true, and, in seeing, become more of our complete selves.Having read The Dinner and now Summer House with Swimming Pool (the gripping story of a doctor who cannot bear to see people uncovered, as he bares himself and everyone around him through his narrative), I'm aware that these are stories that many of us civilized folk would call despicable. But they express something necessary.I used to have a boss who'd suddenly declare, ""People are no damned good."" And we'd all laugh. In times of great frustration with other people's neuroses, I used to joke about opening an abuse therapy practice, and people would laugh. There's the famous Monty Python Argument Clinic sketch. Hilarious. Why? Because these things tap into the truth—our fleeting, secretive, psychopathic thoughts. I will never act out as Koch's characters do, but seeing them reeling in their bare-naked psychopathy is a relief—the relief of truth.And there's more:Not only is Koch is a teller of difficult truths, but he is a master of story structure, drama (he is a scriptwriter and actor—no surprise), and occasionally howlingly funny (particularly in the theater material). In other words, Koch is my kind of author and I'm grateful that he is on the planet, daring to write the books he writes.

Started with a bang and never let go. Characters and landscape so full and visceral they left imprints inside me. This was both an escape from reality and a trip into an alternate one that, even though I’ve never lived in Northern Michigan, never fought snowstorms and drug addicts, never did most of what is written about here, it felt familiar. The dialogue is spectacular—both authentic and stylized although you may not notice that. What’s stylized is trapeze-jumping thought transitions, from dealing with down-and-out drugging or weathering impossible elements to inventiveness, that although similar in each character and expressed with a certain formality (“do not” instead of “don’t,” for instance), is unique to each personality. It’s easier just to give you a taste. In this scene the protagonist, a 16-year-old girl named Percy, and Portis, her mother’s ex-boyfriend who is her closest thing to a parent figure, are fleeing drug dealers and trying to save a baby in the midst of a devastating Northern Michigan snowstorm:  “How far to the truck?” I [Percy] said.“A mile or so.”“That’s not bad.”“It won’t feel like any mile you’ve ever walked. I can promise you that.”It’s tough walking,” I said. “But it can’t be but so bad.”“We’re going uphill the whole way,” he said.“It doesn’t seem like it.”“It’s a gradual incline.”“That’s good,” I said. “Gradual is good.”“You say potato,” said Portis.

Eugene Henderson, an overblown, twice-married, millionaire pig farmer and violin player is having an existential crisis.I want, I want, I want, I want, I want!This is the geshrei that drives fifty-five-year-old Henderson into and through a spiritual quest in Africa. He doesn’t know what he wants, just that “everybody is working, making, digging, bulldozing, trucking, loading, and so on . . .” until it is a form of madness. (I think he would be right at home in our time when value is quantified by how many “likes” we’ve accrued.)Henderson the Rain King is a quest as complicated as any Haruki Murakami tale, but the protagonist is a bloated, bungling American—a man with “the Midas touch in reverse.” In Africa, his first stop is a village of people whose beloved cattle are dying of thirst because the water reserve is occupied by frogs. On one hand, Henderson wants to rescue everybody; on the other, he longs to be rescued:This was a beautiful, strange, special place, and I was moved by it. I believed the queen could straighten me out if she wanted to; as if, any minute now, she might open her hand and show me the thing, the source, the germ—the cipher. The mystery, you know. I was absolutely convinced she must have it. The earth is a huge ball which nothing holds up in space except its own motion and magnetism, and we conscious things who occupy it believe we have to move too, in our own space. We can’t allow ourselves to lie down and not do our share and imitate the greater entity. You see, this is our attitude. But now look at Willatale, the Bittah [highly evolved] woman; she had given up such notions, there was no anxious care in her, and she was sustained. Why, nothing bad happened! On the contrary, it all seemed good! Look how happy she was, grinning with her flat nose and gap teeth, the mother-of-pearl eye and the good eye, and look at her white head! It comforted me just to see her, and I felt that I might learn to be sustained too if I followed her example. (74)There was so much I could relate to in this wonderful book: the obsession with truth and purpose; the hopelessly flawed character of Henderson whose face belied every twisted thought and emotion; his chronic craving; and finally his exhaustion at the “too-muchness” of living with remedies for his predicament stymied by equal parts laziness, impatience for expanded consciousness, and terror of it. With so many references to mind-body medicine and scenes that will resonate for anybody who has practiced alternative therapies or body psychology, this feels like a modern book, although it was first published in 1959. I learned from the introduction that Bellow was practiced in (arguably the father of Western mind-body medicine) Wilhelm Reich’s body psychotherapies, and much of that work and characterology shows up in the book—a bonus for anybody with this knowledge.The writing is weighty, sometimes digressing in a kind of ADHD spasm, and Bellow lacks the precision I so admire in, my hero and Bellow’s contemporary, John Cheever, and the meticulous cleanliness that makes Murakami’s books so easy to read. But so be it.

He lies for the joy of it: “it’s a weakness, a compulsion. The painstaking construction of the lie and its intricate underpinnings: they make the adrenaline flow. . . . It’s necessary not to ignore the endgame, but that’s not where the sense of accomplishment lies for Roy. It’s in the execution, the act of deception. (103)”I’ve known pathological liars and the times I’ve been an unwitting personal witness to blatant lies and fabrications, it’s left me speechless. (Ditto vis-a-vis what is currently happening on the political front.) Why? To what end do they lie when there is nothing to gain? Roy answers these questions for me: Roy [talking to Betty, the woman he is conning] is not concerned about the sense of what he says; it simply fills the gaps. He hardly stops to consider whether his statements are comprehensible, let alone cogent, still less whether he actually believes this garbage. It’s all just part of the game, he thinks, men and women. He bestows on her a look of undiluted venom veiled by a beneficent smile. She is too stupid to see it, he thinks. (136–137)”Although Roy is absolutely despicable, it was fun to read a story about this kind of person—quite different from the person who lies out of desperation to survive.In the beginning of the book, I had trouble following the story. This was due to a combination of me being an American and the book being exceedingly British—in language and references, as well as the book’s self-consciously literary style, which I associate with technical immaturity: it is a first novel by a mature person. Sentences are convoluted, vocabulary is excessive (“‘Well, don’t say anything then,’ he riposted immediately, with intent.”) Also, the use of pronouns is sometimes confusing, but around page 252 the reason for this becomes shockingly clear. I will not give anything away, but the revelation made me reread earlier material and gasp with newfound understanding of the subversive use of pronouns. The story is really good. As other ers have said, there is something addictive about the plotting and structure—jumping back and forth from present to the ’30s, ’40s, and ’50s, little by little exposing Roy’s war years history. In fact, the more the story progressed, the more addictive it became. By the end, my comprehension problems had disappeared and I just enjoyed it....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,"Mar 08, 2016","Mar 09, 2016","Dec 30, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/25817485-the-good-liar

The novel comprises the recommendation letters (for worthy or less-than-worthy students) of one weary professor of creative writing and English at Payne University—pun intended. Professor Jason Fitger is twice divorced and sometimes has to direct his letters to his ex-wives or ex-lover. Not only is the novel funny, but it is moving. Fitger becomes more and more real; you can feel not only his disgust at his department (which he compares to the Titanic), at himself and his hopeless situation, but his aching concern for two people (a student and a colleague) for whom he is desperately seeking help. In the end, you fall in love with him. At least I did.I have never worked in academia, but I suspect if you do, you will enjoy this epistolary novel even more than I did. I envy you—not the job, but the laughs. For a good time and a moving experience, hang out on the other end of Prof. Fitger’s subversive missives.

By that I mean that the first-person narrator and characters are adolescent and sometimes the writing is as well; it alternates between fairly sophisticated retrospective writing (which is what kept me reading through the beginning) and dialogue that sounds like a kid trying to write what grownups say:Dad suggested that he and Jimenez talk in private in the kitchen, but the idea was promptly squelched by the lieutenant—“No way, nu-unh, not okay.”The times that the first-person narrator refers to his experience in retrospect—from an age distance—made me think he was much older (which turned out to be the case), but the dialogue felt awkward and mostly unbelievable to my ear, and although the overall plot was compelling, the plot points felt almost cut and pasted, as if the author thought a sudden revelation of a bad experience would fit well here, so let’s paste it in—with no emotional foundation or artistry of setup, undercurrent, and eventual exposure. Nevertheless, I kept reading to find out how the crime played out and who did what. Eventually the crime made me sick through repetition of it, and the researched messages integrated into the drama again felt cut and pasted.

I find myself thinking about another book with a parallel stilted style to this one: The Postman Always Rings Twice. Why did that one transcend the style and this one didn't for me? Better writing.

Although I'm not in any rush for it and I really loathe losing anyone I love, I am not turned off by death. It's inevitable and I'm very curious. I realize this is an idiosyncratic thing, but I've found that when someone I love dies, I instantly distinguish the dead body as an object quite different from the being who moments ago inhabited it and lose interest in the container; to my senses, it's suddenly like a well-worn shirt. I also rather enjoy the Buddhist exercise of imagining my own disintegration. So I dove into Caitlin Doughty's book, appreciating it for the treasure that it is: answers!Doughty went into the death biz to heal herself from a childhood trauma triggered by witnessing a little girl's death. But she finds the whole thing so fascinating that she wants to open it up for everyone. The book is written with delightful humor and an anthropologist/historian's research. You learn everything from the practical ""how to"" of cremation, to the history of death and body disposal, to rituals of different cultures and death mythology, to the secrets of the embalming industry. Doughty offers a curious reader ""The realistic interaction with death and the chance to face our own mortality."" (114) This is a very easy book to read—for me, a welcome education from an expert teacher. It was fun, fascinating, exhilarating, as freeing as the aforementioned Buddhist exercise, and validating of my personal decision to avoid the funeral industry and all expensive death rituals. ***Years ago I wrote a feature about free (as in no cost) body disposal by using what's left for altruistic purposes: Why I'm Leaving My Body to Science.

I wonder if this book could be intentionally as well-scored as this. In a short documentary about Fleisher's journey from being a world-class pianist to losing the use of one hand and coping with it by teaching and conducting, Fleisher talks about the ""inevitability"" of a piece of great music. In my opinion, inevitability might be characterized by pulse, motion, or life. And what makes it inevitable is that the artist who birthed the work realized it was much greater than she or he, and let it flow without attempts at manipulation. This requires a paradox: the writer must be such a well-honed vessel, so well-practiced in technique, and so skillful that the work can flow as if the writer isn't even there. When this happens, the work has an inevitability about the way it hurtles through time. Two of my favorite literary examples of this are John Williams's Stoner and Amy Bloom's Away, two very different works. I don't think Dept. of Speculation is the masterpiece that those two books are, but in its way, it is inevitable.Thank you, Jenna for your  and recommendation....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,"Dec 04, 2015","Dec 05, 2015","Nov 29, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17402288-dept-of-speculation

This is the story of a child named Pearl who seems sociopathic—all the more upsetting due to the simple, yet gorgeous poetic narrative of actions, such as putting her infant baby brother (“The Blob”) at the top of the stairs and watching him tumble down. This is a physically and emotionally violent story of being crazy and beholden to a crazy situation.

Not once does Davies attempt to create a net under this high-wire art by overwriting in an attempt to explain. Instead she shows and shows and shows.

Real, actual life, not some ivory-tower palaver, not a whole load of literature. What’s it like to be alive in the twenty-first century? Look at this place, for example.’ He sweeps an arm at the window, the glass anonymity of the International Financial Services Centre. . . . There are all these people, but nobody’s speaking to each other, everyone’s just looking at their phones. And that’s what this place is for. It’s a place for being somewhere else. Being here means not being here. And that’s modern life.’ (15)So begins Paul Murray’s new novel.The tale—twisting through the world of banking, the implosion of the economy, the sale of stuff that has no substance (derivatives of nothing, valued inequity, monetized failure), and the purpose or non-purpose of art, plus a love story—is at times hard to follow for somebody (moi) who does not have a finance or business vocabulary. Sometimes the tale twists feel like dead ends; I wanted to be laughing, but the action felt contrived. Sometimes the characters’ concerns (i.e., Claude’s for con man Paul’s decision to stop writing books) felt unfounded.And yet, the writing is glorious and sometimes (particularly in the earlier part of the book) hilarious. I read Murray’s Skippy Dies, loved it, but was bothered by some forced vocabulary particularly in the narrative parts. There are none of those problems in this new book. The nuts and bolts of the writing (vocabulary, sentence structure, exquisite narrative descriptions) is mature and honed. However the almost serial quality from chapter to chapter that worked so well in Skippy Dies here feels scattered. I don’t know if it’s the venue of finance with so many players, or if it’s my own limitations, but it was hard to remember who everybody was. Both Skippy and The Mark and the Void display virtuoso dialogue; Murray has a gift for accents. But in this new book, voices’ accents come and go, and Claude, the French protagonist, does not sound French. In fact, in a short chapter about corporations, with discussions about cameras and images and defeating death (265–268), he suddenly loses any sound semblance of a character. Or maybe this is simply what it sounds like—Murray expounding history and philosophy in an essay. An author’s essay splat in the middle of Claude’s narrative? Where was the editor? The text designer? (Since the book opens with an author’s note, a case could be made for this being a second one—if only they were delineated with some design element.) Where was Murray? Did he insist on this? Did everyone involved assume we readers are “just looking at [our] phones . . . being somewhere else” so we won’t notice? Was Murray considered “too big to fail” after Skippy Dies success so that he was allowed to make a mess? He could have cleaned up the whole thing by writing the book in the third person—so he could drop in the author’s omniscient voice whenever he wanted, give Claude an authentic French character’s sound, and make him into a true naïve who would make the decisions he makes, and leave the analytical philosophizing to the omniscient author. The voice/tone change during and following this essay is so radical that it makes it dubious that this articulate new person would have participated in some of the screwball action that preceded it as well as what follows.When I start thinking like this, I’m in my “professional editor’s head” and this is when I usually abandon a book. However, it was page 270 by the time this happened, and since I have such respect for Murray’s ineffable spark—it is a brilliant and scintillating talent—and his ideas are so compelling and clarifying to what is currently going on in the world, I kept reading just to watch him exercise his sparkle. (Fun fantasy: a panel discussion on the nature of our existence with Paul Murray and Haruki Murakami.)I recommend this book to people who are interested in Paul Murray’s work. But it’s like watching a very rough workout....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,"Dec 30, 2015","Jan 06, 2016","Nov 19, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23847942-the-mark-and-the-void

Much of the public commentary on this book frames it as a drama about ""what a parent might do for love--to protect their children."" In my opinion, this misses the point, and the reason I believe that comes at the very end of the book. No spoilers, but there is an understanding between father and son about entitlement trumping justice.In light of revelations about Donald Trump, Jr.'s knowingly meeting with a Russian lawyer, believing he and his cohorts were going to receive damning intelligence information on Hillary Clinton from the Russian government, which was working on Trump's behalf to elect him, I cannot stop thinking about this book, because for me, it answers all the motivation questions and explains the Teflon-covered certainty that the behavior was okay.The story takes place over a dinner between two couples—two brothers and their wives— and it plays out like a chess game. The players strategize. The first-person narrative of the brother, Paul, who is telling the story feels sometimes like a director’s commentary on a DVD movie; in this case there is a gap between what happens and Paul’s behind-the-scenes knowledge and twisted concerns. There are horrendous crimes. There is strategizing to un-know them, rewrite them, or make them disappear.This is a psychological thriller. Not my usual fare. But what makes it most compelling for me is that it answers questions I’ve long puzzled over regarding a certain kind of upper-crust White privilege (in this story, a possible metaphor as an unnamed genetically transmitted disorder). I’ve seen symptoms of this disorder most of my life. As of this update to my , I'm thinking only about current news, but I have had other experiences:I live next door to a building many of us used to call a frat house when most of the apartments were rented by youngish (thirties) White men who worked on Wall Street and held wild parties, blasting music into the common airspace of the backyard and terraces. Once, when my neighbor who lived in the garden apartment of my building complained, the party host hoisted huge ice blocks over their common wall and threw them into her yard. Another time, after I called the cops at around 2 a.m., it got quiet for a few minutes. Then as soon as the police officer left, a booming male chant erupted: “We will party all night! We will party all night!” Another time, when a number of partygoers—very handsome, collegiate-looking young men—were gathered on the sidewalk, one of them decided to try to break a branch off a young tree outside my building. When I yelled, “Don’t hurt that tree,” he came after me. As I went into my vestibule, he followed. In a jaunty, easy walk, with a look to charm in his eyes that I will never forget, he tried to push in my front door and he seemed surprised when I pushed back and managed to escape. The frat house landlady told me these men cared nothing about the noise fines or attorneys’ fees because money was like water to them. It took years for her to evict the one in the garden apartment; fighting in court became a game to the tenant.The Dinner finally answers my question about how somebody becomes that way. How does one get this disorder, characterized by certainty that he can do as he pleases, hurt anyone who displeases him, and he is above the law? How does he come to assume that the law will be on his side, he will always get more chances and can put whatever “mistake” he’s made behind him, and how is it that this is often the case? People become this way because they inherit the beliefs through their repeated teaching from parents to children—in the book, it is a DNA-testable disorder. People are taught to become this way by parents in prominent positions who are this way. They are taught by their experiences in a society that reinforces the entitlement.Here is an excellent piece by NY Times writer David Brooks on the legacy of our current toxic situation. Writes Brooks: It takes generations to hammer ethical considerations out of a person’s mind and to replace them entirely with the ruthless logic of winning and losing; to take the normal human yearning to be good and replace it with a single-minded desire for material conquest; to take the normal human instinct for kindness and replace it with a law-of-the-jungle mentality. . . .The Donald Trump Jr. we see through the Russia scandal story is not malevolent: He seems to be simply oblivious to the idea that ethical concerns could possibly play a role in everyday life. ...more",Notes are private!,0,42,1,"Dec 12, 2015","Dec 16, 2015","Oct 19, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15797938-the-dinner

Oshima tells Kafka:""What you're experiencing now is the motif of many Greek tragedies. Man doesn't choose fate. Fate chooses man. That's the basic worldview of Greek drama. And the sense of tragedy—according to Aristotle—comes, ironically enough, not from the protagonist's weak points but from his good qualities. . . . irony deepens a person, helps them mature. It's the entrance to salvation on a higher plane, to a place where you can find a more universal kind of hope. . . . everything in life is metaphor. People don't usually kill their father and sleep with their mother, right? In other words, we accept irony through a device called metaphor. And through that we grow and become deeper human beings."" (199–200)And later on, after Kafka sees a girl ghost who is a young version of the older woman who runs the library, he asks Oshima if it's possible that a living person can also exist as a ghost. And Oshima tells Kafka of such a story in The Tale of Genji, followed by this explanation:""The world of the grotesque is the darkness within us. Well before Freud and Jung shined a light on the workings of the subconscious, this correlation between darkness and our subconscious, these two forms of darkness, was obvious to people. It wasn't a metaphor, even. If you trace it back further, it wasn't even a correlation. Until Edison invented the electric light, most of the world was totally covered in darkness. The physical darkness outside and the inner darkness of the soul were mixed together, with no boundary separating the two. They were directly linked."" (225)I think it's wonderful that Kafka on the Shore has found an audience of people who are not necessarily versed in Eastern spiritual traditions, shamanism and indigenous wisdom, or string theory. I marvel at the fact that Murakami seems to communicate to people of all kinds. But for me, his work is a modern-day classical expression of all of the former traditions. The literature of indigenous and Eastern traditions is filled with anecdotes of realized beings who often appear in more than one place simultaneously, helpers who drop into our world from other dimensions, people who lose their souls and retrieve them, others who reincarnate within a lifetime, and explanations about karmic packs of people who incarnate to work things out together. String theory (which I don't pretend to understand scientifically, but whose broad concepts make sense to me) with its multiverses (parallel universes) explains such phenomena, delineating connections that are beyond our normal time-space construct.Briefly, Kafka on the Shore is the story of two people's instinct-driven pilgrimages (similar to walkabouts). The main characters are a fifteen-year-old run-away boy who names himself Kafka (Crow in Czech), and an old man named Nakata who became dumb (or ""hollow"") after a bizarre happening that left him in a coma when he was a child. Also playing important roles are Kafka and Nakata's respective helpers, Oshima and Hoshino. Add to that a delightful cast of subsidiary characters including Johnnie Walker (a cat-killer/famous sculptor), Colonel Sanders who talks about time warps and living in three dimensions versus other ways of living, and a magnificent philosopher prostitute whose casual conversation includes her thoughts on consciousness: ""Hegel believed that a person is not merely conscious of self and objects as separate entities, but through the projection of the self via the mediation of the object is volitionally able to gain a deeper understanding of the self. All of which constitutes self-consciousness."" (274)The book is a stunning, romantic construction—a meditation metaphor—weaving the threads of converging, merging, and separating lives from different times and spaces into a fabric of oneness, acceptance, and forgiveness. Both Kafka and Nakata have a dedication to meticulous personal and housekeeping cleanliness, and this same cleanliness characterizes Murakami's style. His clean, simple sentences both seduce and kind of mesmerize you—perhaps explaining why readers who have none of the aforementioned foundation can enjoy and feel the truth of the book without completely understanding it. The style is so simple, yet through the simplicity, Murakami creates the most complex story about the true nature of existence. "". . . there's a spot they call the Toilet Bowl [says Oshima's surfer brother as he conveys Kafka home after his pilgrimage]. There're these huge whirlpools because it's where the incoming and outgoing tides meet and crash into each other. It goes around and around like when you flush a toilet. If you wipe out there, you get pulled underwater and it's harder to float up again. Depending on the waves you might never make it back to the surface. So there you are, underwater, pounded by the waves and there's nothing you can do. Flailing around's not gonna get you anywhere. You'll just use up your energy. You've never been so scared in your life. But unless you get over that fear you'll never be a real surfer. You have to face death, get to really know it, then overcome it. When you're down in that whirlpool you start thinking about all kinds of things. It's like you get to be friends with death, have a heart-to-heart talk with it.""

Thirty-eight-year-old orphan Bartholomew Neil, a “developmentally stunted” man (according to his grief counselor), writes letters to the Buddhist activist actor Richard Gere after he discovers a form letter from Gere in his dead mother’s underwear drawer. They are sly letters—absolutely sincere on Bartholomew’s ingenuous level, but socially sly from the all-knowing author and the reader’s point of view. For instance, Bartholomew mentions how interesting it is that an actor can be named in an article where the name of the President of the United States is omitted, how an actor’s dinner party can do more for Tibet than a monk burning himself alive, “how it is okay to look at a man on fire on the Free Library’s Internet, but not two naked women licking each other. Who makes the rules? Death is okay. Sex is bad. Mothers must die. Cancer comes when you least expect it.”Ah, the twisted rules of a society of “normal people” and the unfairness of death.Bartholomew writes about the “pretending game” we all play—certainly one of my own favorite subjects: “Life is shit,” my young redheaded grief counselor Wendy says whenever we reach an impasse in our conversation.It is her default platitude.Her words of wisdom for me.“Life is shit.”When Wendy says that, it’s like she’s pretending we are not bound together by her job, but really truly are friends. It’s like we’re having a beer at the bar, like friends on TV do.“Life is shit.”She whispers it even. Like she’s not supposed to say that to me, but wants me to know that her happy talk and positivity are part of her pretending game.Other than noticing or playing the “pretending game” we humans play, Bartholomew’s other concern is finding where he belongs—his “flock.” To help him navigate life, he has Richard Gere in his head and a reactive angry little man in his stomach. Bartholomew plus a motley crew of friends—a defrocked priest, a cat-loving movie ticket-taker, and a “Girlbrarian” who is recovering from an alien abduction—go on a pilgrimage of sorts.The humor (from lampooning lingo-spouting therapists, grad student social workers, and other kinds of helpers to glorious mentions of Jungian and Buddhist wisdom), cadence, and obsessions about distinguishing who we are and maybe realizing (a.k.a. experiencing) “the good luck of right now” are so similar to my own obsessions and what I write that I sometimes had the weird feeling that I was reading something written by a middle-aged Buddhist Catholic male alter ego who favored light romantic stories. Rather than Richard Gere, I had “a little old lady” in my head when I was a child; as I matured, she morphed into something I simply refer to as the Voice. I too have a bully voice (my fearful ego) punching me from the inside out. But the good part of this is that no matter how much pretending is going on, my body never lies to me about what I’m really feeling (positive or negative), so I have a sense of my enduring flaws and what I don’t know and my direction, even in the midst of abject confusion—which is the unarticulated gift of truth that Bartholomew embodies for the reader. Like Bartholomew, I too often long to find my flock. I sense I’ve found part of it in this romantic little story of a pilgrimage. I’m guessing author Matthew Quick found a flock by writing The Good Luck of Right Now. And by ing it, maybe I’ll expand the flock to other solitary Goodreading birds. ...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Dec 17, 2015","Dec 21, 2015","Sep 10, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18054175-the-good-luck-of-right-now

A smart-alecky omniscient writer narrator tells us and 78-year-old Harriet Chance how she got to where she is. I wanted to like this book more than I did. The problem wasn't that I guessed all the plot revelations way before they happened. And it wasn't the dour character of Harriet, who felt familiar and flawed, which is something I usually love. The story involves talking to dead people, which I've been known to do, and there is a life —a habit of mine—so I should have been a huge fan. I think the problem was that the smart aleck omniscient narrator doesn't seem to like, empathize with, or respect Harriet, and the direction of his (the voice has a distinct male feeling and does not feel remotely like an alter-ego Harriet which, toward the end, seems intended) flippant finger-pointing made me, the reader, a voyeur. This narrator seems to have a complete understanding of Harriet's psychology—an understanding which could result in compassion—but he used his knowledge harshly (which felt particularly cruel when he dealt with her childhood pain). Toward the end, he diagnoses Harriet with ""contempt,"" and I found myself wondering if there is some of that in the narrator—so much so that I actually wanted defend Harriet from him and get to know her without him.

Plenty has been written about the book, so I'll just say my reactions: Often, particularly in the early chapters, I laughed till I felt sick to my stomach. I was astounded by DeLillo's mastery of the hilarious non sequitur (both lines and chapters) and ability to hurl them at the reader in a kind of relentless display and flaying of all that is self-conscious, bloated, and self-congratulatory in an American culture, where we can ""marvel at our own ability to manufacture awe"" and die in a state of ""lingering dread."" And I was sad at an ending that seems to conclude that we are all just doing time in the cacophony of white noise on our way to death.It takes tremendous spiritual and artistic muscularity to write such an extreme social satire where the protagonist always just tries his best and never judges the situation, even as he pronounces truths such as ""She had a history of being devout in her victimhood"" about his daughter. And likewise, a reader must exercise her expansion muscles; you simply cannot read White Noise in a contracted state; you will get bored and have to abandon the book. DeLillo's brilliance is that he subtly forces the willing reader to stay in an expanded point of view—seeing the ridiculousness of an exchange that goes from whether or not a parent is drugging herself to whether or not cockroaches get cancer—and this is the exhausting part of this book. It takes so much energy to stay open, to not polarize, and therefore to not deny the whole, ridiculous big picture of our lives—even if one does not share DeLillo's dismal conclusions.I need a nap....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,Sep 2015,"Sep 08, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/864321.White_Noise

She lives alone with no job and no friends in her dead great-aunt's house, where she tries not to hurt the feelings of all the inanimate objects in her life, and she seeks to mimic how ""real humans"" think and behave.A winner of the Irish Writers Centre Novel Fair 2014, Eggshells is Vivian's story of trying to be normal, while searching desperately for an entrance to a place where she belongs. I have never been to Ireland, but Eggshells gave me the kind of tour of Dublin that only a down-and-out resident could give. Through Vivien's confused and twisted mind, I saw street signs with letters blocked out, alleyways, boardwalks, buildings that ""look like they were dropped from a height and shoved together, with the Central Bank sticking up behind, like a Lego brick they forgot to paint."" I walked the roads, crossed bridges, visited shops, seeing everything through Vivien's skewed mind. Her extreme mind might have become too much if not for the hilarious interchanges she has when she actually talks to other humans—which mostly she doesn't.The writing is so rich and idiosyncratic, I could probably quote something from each page. But here's an example from fairly early in the novel:Following one of her random obsessions, Vivian decides to purchase only blue food. A ""heap of giddy rises in [her] throat"" as she approaches the check-out cashier:'Do you notice anything about my items?' I ask.She looks like she doesn't want to play my game, so I make it easy for her.'They're all blue!''Oh yeah, why?''I'm having a blue party!'The snarl on her face melts a little.'Is it his favourite colour?' she asks'Whose favourite colour?'She looks confused.'Your little boy, are these not for is birthday party?'I think for a moment.'Yes, they are. And I'm making a Smurf cake!'The woman behind me in the queue pokes her head into the conversation.'Ah that's lovely, what age is he?''They're six. I have boy twins.'The words glide out of my mouth like a silk thread.'You must have your hands full with them,' the woman behind me says, but the shop assistant only stares.'How come you never have them in here with you?''Oh . . .'I think for a minute.'They're in wheelchairs.''Ah God, that's terrible, terrible!''Who minds them?' asks the shop assistant. Her face is squeezed into strange shapes.'What?''When you come in here to do your shopping, who minds them?''Oh, they're fine on their own.''You leave them alone?'Her voice sounds like a cup shattered on a tile. I look from one angry face to the other.'They can't get out of their wheelchairs, they're fine.'They look at each other the way that girls in school used to look at each other: an eye-lock that doesn't include me. Then they look at me with a purity of hate that stiffens me. I pack my blue items into my bag—I wish I'd remembered to bring a blue plastic bag—and pay. The woman behind me is muttering to the woman behind her, and I catch the words, 'social services . . . shouldn't be let have kids . . . something wrong with her.' I take my change and hurry off with great big gulps of marbles in my throat. When I reach the house I rush in, close the door and bolt it. If social services come, they might be angrier that I'm not neglecting children I don't have than if I was neglecting children I did have. I feel sadder than I've ever felt before, sad like the end of the world has come and gone without me. (42–43)Eventually Vivien manages to find a sympatico friend, after advertising for a friend named Penelope—because she wants to know why the name doesn't rhyme with antelope. Here is a description of Penelope's driving when the two women go on a car trip:Penelope sighs and swerves to avoid a cyclist, who roars something I can't hear. She drives like a Don't Drink and Drive ad, she drives with a rattle and a wallop and a clang and a bang. When she doesn't like the feel of a lane or the colour of a puddle or the shape of a pothole, she glides into the other lane. I've never seen cars driving straight at me before, the drivers' mouths forming into cartoon 'O's before beeping and swerving. (144)I loved Eggshells, a well-written, funny, and ultimately heartbreaking book about an extreme outsider, and I recommend it to anybody who feels or has felt like or is open to stories about people on the margins of society. Other InformationA good interview with author Caitriona Lally in The Irish Times about how she wrote the book while she was having trouble finding work.Some information about the Irish Writer Centre Novel Fair, an event to ""introduce up-and-coming writers to top publishers and literary agents, giving novelists the opportunity to bypass the slush pile, pitch their ideas, and place their synopsis and sample chapters directly into the hands of publishers and agents."" (And here's the main Irish Writers Centre website.)A very good Irish Times  says that Eggshells favors language over plot. Essentially I agree, however, I'd like to say that there are different ways to write plot, and Eggshells does have plot: It is the slow, light-handed, tender revelation of Vivian's background. This is done with such skill and love, with such compassion for the character, that some readers may miss it.

She is knocked off balance, shocked, but no nanosecond of fear, no surge from the adrenal glands that can be quickly denied or sublimated. In the past, in treatment, she has dealt with anger, shame, false pride, and disgrace. She has been advised that these feelings might return. When she sees this former South American guerilla soldier on TV as part of peace talks, she reaches for his face on the TV screen, then recoils. But, again, no visceral fear. So there is nothing that roils under the surface of the calm telling of the horror she experienced. And the lack of subtext diminishes what comes next.Late in the story, she goes to confront the man, and although there is the first reference to ""terror"" faced in a hospital after the abuse thirty-seven years ago, because there has been no sign of what is being sublimated, we have no sense of the courage involved in her decision to meet her abuser. During the attempt to see him there are the first signs of visceral feeling—nausea. But these are interspersed with calmly told memories of the past. There is no sense of an imminent PTSD trigger.Shock and sublimation, denial and numbness make sense, but in this story, there is the complete lack of a natural visceral reaction underneath all that, and therefore the ending feels melodramatic and manipulated rather than gut-wrenching.

Unfortunately I was constantly interrupted during my reading of this book, and it is a testament to the writing that I was as frustrated as I was. I had to restart many times and I often had trouble recalling who people were. And the details in this book are important.My introduction to Karen Joy Fowler’s work was her novel We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves; it made me want to read all her other books. Sarah Canary is a very different creation—a historical novel that shows, from a sly writer’s perspective, the unfair plight of women and animals in our culture, and the unclear nature of truth:A man says something. Sometimes it turns out to be the truth, but this has nothing to do with the man who says it. What we say occupies a very thin surface, like the skin over a body of water. Beneath this, through the water itself, is what we see, sometimes clearly if the water is calm, sometimes vaguely if the water is troubled, and we imagine this vision to be the truth, clear or vague.

As they came nearer he had again the feeling that he was being absorbed, included in something with which he had had no relation before; but unlike the feeling of absorption he had experienced on the anonymous prairie, this feeling was one which promised, however vaguely, a richness and a fulfillment for which he had no name. (106)This is the best description of my experience reading this book that I can imagine. I am a vegan. I don’t proselytize; I feed my dog meat and am grateful that there are people who are willing to slaughter the lambs so that she can eat them. But I’m most comfortable living in a way that causes the least amount of harm to other sentient beings. So it was with some discomfort that I decided to read about a buffalo hunt. I won’t lie. It was difficult. I felt sick to my stomach reading about the preparations to slaughter—for their hides—an entire herd of animals, trapped in a valley. But I kept reading because I trust that if John Williams wrote it, it’s about more than violence. But that was another reservation—my trust is almost reverential: I so revere his book Stoner—I’ve read it twice and am now in the process of studying it chapter by chapter—that, in a way, I was nervous about being let down.There is no let-down in Butcher’s Crossing. The man writes with a pure life energy and depth of understanding, along with skill, flawless technique, and such visceral descriptions that, for a lot of this book I was in pain. Just when I thought I could not physically endure what I was feeling during the killing, there came relief: During the last hour of the stand he [Andrews] came to see Miller’s destruction of the buffalo, not as a lust for blood or a lust for the hides or a lust for what the hides would bring, or even at last the blind lust of fury that toiled darkly within him—he came to see the destruction as a cold, mindless response to the life in which Miller had immersed himself. And he looked upon himself, crawling dumbly after Miller upon the flat bed of the valley, picking up the empty cartridges that he spent, tugging the water keg, husbanding the rifle, cleaning it, offering it to Miller when he needed it—he looked upon himself, and did not know who he was, or where he went. (137)A transcendent point of view of the horror of disconnection from Source—a disconnection that is a particular malady of non-Native people; this was a White man’s hunt and slaughter and devaluing of or blindness to life. And after the evening of butchery, just when I thought I might throw up, an understanding of the horror: It came to him that he had turned away from the buffalo not because of a womanish nausea at blood and stench and spilling gut; it came to him that he had sickened and turned away because of his shock at seeing the buffalo, a few moments before proud and noble and full of the dignity of life, now stark and helpless, a length of inert meat, divested of itself, or his notion of its self, swinging grotesquely, mockingly, before him. It was not itself; or it was not that self that he had imagined it to be. That self was murdered; and in that murder he had felt the destruction of something within him, and he had not been able to face it. So he had turned away. (151)I’ve never been a terribly athletic person or one who is drawn to daredevil activities, but I understand the spiritual journey of “using yourself up” and thereby experiencing your essence. Although I find quite enough uninvited pain in just living, I understand the draw of everything from Outward Bound survival experiences to the Native American Sundance—where people go to their physical limits and maybe even beyond. But in all these rituals, the pain is experienced by the person who chose it: there is the risk of death, bearing unbearable pain. In Williams’s Butcher’s Crossing, yes, the men endure the violence of nature and weather and hunger and thirst. But the real violence is what they wreak on others—from the horses and oxen who serve them to the hundreds of buffalo they slaughter for (SPOILER) no apparent purpose other than the ritual of it. I read the last thirty pages of this book in a state of breathlessness. How would this end? My worst fear was that it would turn into a romantic noble cowboy fantasy. Then, when Andrews joined with a woman, I worried that it would devolve into some pat message about balanced male/female energies. Neither of those things happened. I will not spoil the ending. It is not a warm, comforting message, but it is true.

By not only holding the great revelation of this book until the beginning of chapter five (page 77), but by explaining the rationale for this at the time of the revelation, she throws floodlights into any dark rooms in our psyche that might have precluded our viscerally sharing her story.

I’ve never been the same.Let Me Tell You: New Stories, Essays, and Other Writings is filled with pieces that expose us. They are of their time and a certain culture—the domestic lives of educated and/or well-heeled people in the 1950s and early ’60s—but they are just as alive today as they were when they were so expertly written.Like The Stories of John Cheever, I think it might be best to own this volume rather than read an ebook from the library, as I’ve been doing. It’s a book that demands slow imbibing and digestion—maybe over the course of months. In fact, it feels almost like a sister book to Cheever’s collection. Perhaps I’ll buy it.Well, hot diggity, I did just that—my own  prompted me to shell out for a hard copy.[image]Oh, my aching sheetrock!I’ll continue on the blasted ebook until it arrives and, since I will no doubt spend 2017 slowly imbibing, I’ll just cut to the chase and give it 5 stars now.Update, 5/2/17: After four months of reading a bit here and there, I’ve just finished this wonderful anthology. Not all the pieces are great or even finished. Some seem more like exercises than finished stories, but there are some gems—particularly among the first section of unpublished and uncollected short stories, and most particularly a story called “Mrs. Spencer and the Oberons.” I’m glad this archive exists.

I’m seeing everything I’m reading these days through the metaphor of our insane political culture. Maybe that’s because we are in the midst of iconic metaphors—the stuff of Shakespeare, Aristotle, and more recently John Steinbeck.The Pearl, based on a classic Mexican folk tale, tells the story of Kino, Juana, and their infant son. They are simple people, whose life explodes with a scorpion bite. Poison! Poison leads to a need to pay for a bogus antidote, which leads to the discovery of the world’s greatest pearl, which leads to devastation.“I am a man,” says Kino in explanation of why clinging to the pearl at all costs is right. “It meant that Kino would drive his strength against a mountain and plunge his strength against the sea. Juana, in her woman’s soul, knew that the mountain would stand while the man broke himself; that the sea would surge while the man drowned in it.”In my opinion, this is where we all are right now—at the apex of the shift from “might makes right” to, I hope, something equally male and female.

Just like the cover which shows a child “holding still” mid-jump, surrounded by sky, the writing manages to simultaneously move and hold you.Sally Mann and I are the same age, we occupied the same territory for a time (same class at Bennington), but I don’t recall knowing her. If I did meet her, I’m sure I took one look at the ferocious expression in her eyes—illustrated in some of the many photographs in this book and acknowledged by her—and I would have given her a wide berth. She describes herself as a “feral child.” Funny, because I’ve used the same words to describe myself at that time. But where she was fearless, I was afraid of anything and everything. Where she moved forward with jet propulsion, I free fell. But I think now we would be friends. She is honest, self-aware, and naked about her personality proclivities: “. . . I have always been susceptible to some form of opportunistic sorrow—of the deepest, most soul-wrenching, step-off-the-cliff variety.” (203)In a world filled with people (and media) who move seamlessly from true grief to exaggerated, self-feeding “opportunistic sorrow,” I think this is the first time I’ve ever read it admitted and so well named, and it made me cheer. To name a feeling “opportunistic” requires so much more energy and emotional muscle than simply accepting it as true and reacting with it—particularly for self-described genetically disposed intense sensitives like Sally Mann. Opportunistic emotions are so seductive and even addictive because they’re fueled by a literal hormonal high. Not only high-drama sorrow, but anger, self-righteousness, and blind fear. And these highs do fuel themselves: the more we react with them, the more furious the flow: A bully name-calls; the target responds in kind. And on and on the snowball of emotions and the consequent dangerous situations expand.It takes reflection and willful stillness to interfere with this seductive process; Sally Mann doesn’t claim to have mastered this in her life, but in this book, as the photographer that she is, she insists on waiting, observing, and finally clicking—forcing stillness on an experience in all its ramifications, holding it so we all can see the truth or falseness of one moment. And if it’s a flawed moment, a moment of “opportunistic sorrow,” she eloquently names it. She also addresses the basic falseness of photography itself—how pictures distort reality and rob us of memories based on living in the moment.But there are so many things like that in this book—things that, when named, make you say, “But of course. I’ve always noticed or felt or known or lived that. But until now, I’ve never seen it in words.”This autobiography is rich in soul. It is an ode to Mann’s beloved Virginia land and the earth itself. It is an artist’s memoir. It is a deep discussion about race relations. And it is also an investigation: Going through an attic of family records, Mann connects the dots, finds the roots of her attractions and aversions and opportunistic idiosyncrasies in her ancestors. How often I’ve wished I could do something similar, but in my case, everybody is dead and there is no depository of family lore. But reading her story, I imagined doing the same thing and finding maybe one or two people—people I’ve never even heard of—who are just like me: obsessed and aware, motivated and lazy, terrified and fearless, alive and dying. And for some reason that gives me peace—peace that comes from seeing more of the whole picture, more truth. Mann writes:“I see both the beauty and the dark side of things; the loveliness of cornfields and full sails, but the ruin as well. And I see them at the same time, at once ecstatic at the beauty of things, and chary of that ecstasy. The Japanese have a phrase for this dual perception: mono no aware. It means ‘beauty tinged with sadness,’ for there cannot be any real beauty without the indolic whiff of decay. For me, living is the same thing as dying, and loving is the same thing as losing, and this does not make me a madwoman; I believe it can make me better at living, and better at loving, and just possibly, better at seeing.” (414-415)Here’s a recent interview Sally Mann and her daughter (pictured in some of the controversial photographs discussed in the book) did with Charlie Rose.And here is a short, unrelated lesson from an ex-CIA agent on the art of being still enough to listen to your adversaries . . . and what you might hear....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,"Jun 12, 2016","Jun 17, 2016","Jul 24, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23197288-hold-still

The unnumbered chapters feel like installments—switching protagonists and writer's point of view. Although common wisdom might say this would be a mess, it isn't. It works. It would also work well as a television series—the kind of BBC series, taking place in Dublin, centered around a boys' prep school, that Americans would love and find exotic. Another reason for this suggestion of a translation into film is that the dialogue is wonderful—more wonderful than the narrative; the vocabulary and particularly the choice of verbs in order to avoid repeating ""said"" sometimes feels forced.

""Delicious"" is the first word that comes to mind to describe Bradley Somer's exquisite prose. He expands moments, detailing fleeting actions or sensations. Here's a taste:Garth draws a deep breath to steady his heart and gives the package a squeeze, pinching it between the crook of his arm and his torso. It gives a reassuring crackle in return. He takes it in both hands and gives it another squeeze. The softness compresses to a point, and then he can feel something solid and hard in the middle. He repeats the motion and decides he has to run up the remaining flights. He needs to move through this horrible space as quickly as he can. He needs to get to his apartment and recapture the full excitement he had felt before the stairwell sucked it out of him.AndThat’s where she met Matt, her first crush. Matt lifted weights every day and was on the high school football team. Matt worked the same shifts that she did. He looked so good in his work uniform. The company logo bent so slightly around the curve of his sculpted pectoral muscle. An embroidered little man in a waiter’s uniform dashed away from Matt’s armpit and toward the cleft in his chest, carrying a burger the size of his head on a platter. Three embroidered steam lines on the logo implied the food was fresh and piping hot.AndIan [the titular fish] is torn from the scene when, as he falls past the eighteenth floor, he discovers the final betrayal of his body. His instinct for freedom has led to several such revelations so far. Even in the short second of his flight, the experience has been more edifying than the months he spent in his bowl. He not only has found that he can’t breathe in this atmosphere but also that eyelids are handy devices and evolution has left him ill prepared for flight. Now he learns that the aerodynamic nature of his body, which allows him to slice through water so effortlessly, with the right amount of wind shear transforms him into a streamlined, nose-down golden rocket. It pushes his tail to the sky and forces his head ground-ward. The turbulence compels his body to wiggle in a fashion not dissimilar to swimming in a strong current. No longer does he tumble. His descent becomes much more sinister and direct through the shrieking air.All these examples probably take the time of a thought, but the writing is so luscious and juicy and sometimes even crunchy and crispy that you want to read slowly. Hard, since the story is equally tasty and you want to know what happens next. This is a gentle, compassionate, exquisitely written look at life from a falling fish's eye view. I loved it!I had an interesting personal experience reading: Time in this story is altered in many ways—perception is slowed down, while events concurrently unfold in and out of real time. The quantum mechanics notion that time simply doesn't exist as we experience it is played with and discussed. While reading Fishbowl my private sense of time was altered. Slowed perceptions plus events in real time became my ""real"" time, to such an extent that when I put the book down, I felt as if all my actions, thoughts, and reactions were like slogging through molasses. Imagine being away from gravity and then returning to it. I'd be curious to hear if other readers had this experience.Thanks to Netgalley for an ARC of this book....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,"Jun 23, 2015","Jun 25, 2015","Jun 22, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23014685-fishbowl

This is a naked-in-public dream.(Caveat: If you can't, don't want to, or don't naturally go to this dream place within, you will likely be turned off by this book. However, if you're intrigued by going to dreamland within, read on.)In order to attempt to explain my own work and find copasetic readers, I've often (including in my Goodreads bio) told the story of radio host Jonathan Schwartz's anecdote about Stephen Sondheim: after Sondheim sold 25,000 copies of a book, someone asked him how he felt about it. ""It's always the same 25,000,"" replied Sondheim despairingly. Schwartz believes that the reason for the radically divergent (negative/positive) responses to Sondheim's work is that he exposes everything we wish most to hide or deny about ourselves. And for many people, this is variously enraging, boring, disgusting, or it just doesn't make any sense to them. Seeing the same work, others feel grateful. Perhaps they are in awe, freed from constraints they didn't even know they had. ""That's in me!"" we gasp; and whether horrified or amused, we laugh, moan, rock, and have some kind of catharsis because we have been energetically poked, prodded, and maybe even pierced. Filipacchi writes with this kind of energy and effect. We all have our own wonderful reasons for reading. Sometimes we just want to be entertained. We want a good story, a laugh, a diversion. We have plenty of other places in our lives to do work on ourselves and plenty of options for discomfort. If you're feeling this way, stay away from Filipacchi's work! However if you need and value transformation more than you do comfort and you like having such experiences from reading, for goodness sake, read Filipacchi's books; I would start with the most recent, The Unfortunate Importance of Beauty because it is the most artistically mature.Nude Men is the third of Filipacchi's books that I have read in very quick succession/obsession; it is the first book that she wrote (published in 1993 when she was only twenty-six!). What's mesmerizing to me is that what is often a pretty horrifying dream is conveyed with an almost transcendental delight.

This novel sounds like a memoir, and with enormous interest and horror I learned a lot about the Yugoslavian civil war. My interest comes from my alarm and dismay at our current American political climate. Because of our Constitution (our religious freedom, freedom of speech, separation of church and state, and despite what many claim, the fact that the USA is not affiliated with any one religion and is in fact a nation of immigrants and its founders were the founders only because they committed genocide and stole lands from Native Peoples—please forgive my rant; the insanity is contagious so perhaps I'm losing my mind), many of us who have grown up with the privilege of USA citizenship think we are immune to the kind of civil wars that are tearing up the rest of the world. I no longer think that anybody is immune to anything, and I guess I want to know more about what could happen.Girl at War is not high art or knock-your-socks-off writing, but it is relatable and did the job of educating me. The first third and a later section are about the war, and the rest is a serviceable plot about dealing with it. The writing has a Young Adult quality that lacks depth, and while it's an easy read, sometimes it felt like “PTSD-lite” and I wished for more soul. Part of the lack of depth—particularly in the dialogue, due to an absence of the ineffable stuff that can happen in the synapses between words—may be because the author is deaf, a fact I learned toward the end of my reading when I was puzzling over the difference in the writing in the war action sections and the American girlfriend/boyfriend talks. The following is from an interview with Sara Novic in The Guardian:Another part of writing that seems inextricable from hearing is dialogue. Someone who writes dialogue well is said to “have an ear” for it. I don’t think I write dialogue well. Whether this is just your average writerly paranoia or is linked to the physiology of hearing loss, I can’t say. . . In the writing world, any trace of this directness [of American Sign Language] translates as “bad dialogue.” “That’s not how people talk,” my workshop mates have said.

With a feeling reminiscent of the wonderful new TV series American Crime, this is the story of individual people and their relationships within the bloody 1999 protest against the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle. All sides — police and protestors, with a focus on a father cop and estranged son protestor, as well as other characters — are believably represented, which is emotionally powerful. I'm so torn about this book that I've hesitated to  it. The text alternates between being exquisite and annoyingly overwritten. There were moments I was in awe, moved, and admiring of this epic story about ""the whole ugly beautiful thing"" that is our life on this planet. Then other times, I almost screamed at the relentless flashbacks and narrative discourses just when the plot had worked up momentum.Many of the flashbacks are to fill in characters' histories, and sometimes this resulted in confusion: the time and place of different memories/events tumbled out in such a way that I didn't always know what was happening now (1999) and what was history. For example, in this scene, a woman named King is in the middle of ministering to her fellow protestors. It has been established three paragraphs earlier that she once lived with her boyfriend, John Henry, in a shipping container on the top of a hill:She fought the urge to just turn and run. There were bodies laying [sic] everywhere, the police wading through the pile up, three or four cops walking with spray bottles that looked like small fire extinguishers, the spray looping over them in an arc. King kept her head down. She kept her hands clean as she tried to remember what John Henry had taught her. The best protection is a gas mask. However, we can no longer recommend the Israeli gas mask as the lenses have been known to shatter on impact.King saw a woman on her knees in the middle of the intersection. Her hands clasped in prayer, her face a mask of running blood.Of course the locals thought they were crazy. But on their hill they had no neighbors. On a clear day, a hundred, two hundred miles of vision. Sight lines in every direction. No neighbors who could see like this.I'm guessing that last paragraph is a reference to living in the shipping container. And this is then followed by the story of an arrest that took place (when?) in New York City. However the flashbacks do not always kill the drama; sometimes they work organically. In other words, the skill level is uneven.On the positive side, the book's subject is timed perfectly to our current cultural police/people rift and I suspect there will be people who will rave about it, with none of my reservations. Your Heart Is a Muscle the Size of a Fist is smartly written by Sunil Yapa, a first-time novelist who has all his ducks in a row (education, jobs, connections).

I am such a person. Taking this route to charm, I realize, is misguided. At least in my case I think it is. I hope it is. But it’s also instinctive.

I and my dog were walking in Central Park this morning with my friend Lauren, a professional dog walker, when the conversation turned to peeing. Not really a surprise, considering our companions.

Since I'm a writer, and the story exposes a real writer's real mundane life, I was interested.Starting Out in the Evening is the story of New York intellectual Leonard Schiller, a seventy-one year writer of “lonely integrity,” who meets twenty-four-year-old Heather, a calculating and shrewd grad student researching her master’s thesis on him. Here's why she is so enamored:The people she admired in his books were people who walked away from the lives that other people expected them to live—Ellen in his first novel, the bohemian painters in his second. He had dwelled—in those early books, at least—on the glory of choosing your own life, even when it takes ruthlessness to do it.And here's what she observes as she gets to know Schiller:But now it occurred to her that he had only written about the beginning of the journey. He had never shown the consequences of the choice—never shown what happened to these people ten and twenty and thirty years down the line. And she felt that she was seeing the consequences, every day, in what she was seeing of him.This is also the story of younger people observing older people. Here's an observation from Schiller's thirty-nine-year-old daughter, Ariel, who's in the ""disorderly middle of life,"" witnessing her father in the hospital room of a dying friend, talking as they always do about writers and books: To Ariel it seemed as if they were averting their eyes from the larger questions. But maybe their way was better than hers—maybe they were serving eternity precisely by staying faithful to daily life. If she didn’t understand her father’s friends, she felt that they didn’t even come close to understanding her. Though as intellectuals they probably liked to think that “nothing human was alien to them,” she found them narrow in their interests: the only thing they thrilled to, really, was the written word. Ariel was outside their radar.In other words, the whole life process is observed from all angles with honesty. Why are we here? What are we doing? These are the questions Schiller explores:The primary human need, he decided—stronger than the need for food or sex or love—is the need for recognition, the need to make a mark in the world. One makes one’s mark according to one’s capacities. If you have talents, you exercise them: if you’re Mozart you write The Magic Flute. And if you don’t have any talents, you thrust yourself into the path of others in cruder ways: you wear stupid T-shirts or you become the impresario of the back of the bus. And if your life has been stunted from the first by violence and harsh surroundings, then you steal things or destroy things or hurt people: anything, anything, to leave an image of yourself in other people’s minds.Poignant, wise, sometimes humorous, sometimes heartbreaking, Starting Out in the Evening is a kind of languorous tour through Manhattan and aging....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,"Jul 08, 2015","Jul 11, 2015","May 11, 2015",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/382469.Starting_Out_in_the_Evening

I'd read parts of it many years ago, and, in a minute, I'll get to why I recently decided to read the whole book. The anthology is in three parts: a novel (Wise Blood), a collection of short stories and a novella (""A Good Man Is Hard to Find""), and another novel (The Violent Bear It Away). Since I couldn't remember what I'd previously read, I went from back to front in the hope of sampling the new material first.Part 3. I was brought up with no religion and in some ways I think that has sensitized me to fundamentalism in many forms—not only religious, but political (including progressive fundamentalism). Fundamentalism is characterized by somebody's absolute certainty that their belief is the only true one and anybody who does not agree is wrong, misguided, an idiot. In The Violent Bear It Away, O'Connor painfully evokes the feeling of being torn to bits by warring sides, of being a confused and helpless angry child without the wherewithal to deal with this level of extremes. O'Connor was Christian and deals with Christian fundamentalism, but the pain transcends the particular story. Reading through all the Scriptural references was a slog for me, since this is not my natural territory, but ultimately I found myself riveted by the basic human drama: a child torn apart by warring adults, and everybody is nuts. I can relate … Unless I completely missed the point and the great-uncle prophet who creates a murdering boy prophet is supposed to be sane. This was the most difficult (unenjoyable) section of the anthology—not easy reading.Part 2. The short stories and novella (""A Good Man Is Hard to Find"") are simultaneously painful, exhausting, and glorious. The writing is exquisite, the normality of rural Southern racism is excruciating, and reading story after story that exposes the worst of humanity is exhausting. One story in a magazine would have been a better way to encounter this work, but I'm glad to have had access to everything in one collection. I feel like O'Connor's student; there are no clichés and every narrative description comes from her idiosyncratic and formidable powers of observation. O'Connor is not a person to copy, but she is a model for finding your own way of observing and reporting on the world.Part 1. Wise Blood is a Southern-gothic kind of Keystone Kops of insane true believers: Hazel Motes, the protagonist who espouses a Church Without Christ, and his many antagonists. In the opening note to the story, O'Connor describes it as a ""comic novel about a Christian malgré lui."" She confirms that one must understand that ""belief in Christ is to some a matter of life and death"" and that Hazel Motes, an obsessed prophet who murders people, has an integrity that ""lies in his not being able to"" deny the Christ that his preaching denies. Yes, the novel is sometimes comic, but the story ends so darkly that I think it could only be perceived as positive by a Christian whose belief in Jesus's divinity is so important that it invalidates the value of life, compassion, and mortal kindness.I decided to read and reread this anthology now because I believe Flannery O'Connor's work sets a precedent for my own. When I was looking for writers to blurb my novel The Last Will & Testament of Zelda McFigg, I found that there really were no current female writers writing comic and grotesque characters. (Please correct me if I'm wrong; I'd appreciate knowing of any.) If O'Connor were still alive, I'd have begged her for a blurb, but instead I've quoted her sage explanation about why she wrote what she wrote. In The Fiction Writer and His Country, O'Connor says:The novelist with Christian concerns will find in modern life distortions which are repugnant to him, and his problem will be to make these appear as distortions to an audience which is used to seeing them as natural; and he may well be forced to take ever more violent means to get his vision across to this hostile audience. When you can assume that your audience holds the same beliefs you do, you can relax a little and use more normal means of talking to it; when you have to assume that it does not, then you have to make your vision apparent by shock—to the hard of hearing you shout, and for the almost-blind you draw large and startling figures.I would never define myself as a Christian (or any other religion), but I feel that my protagonist Zelda McFigg’s perhaps grotesque character is my attempt to shout about (and learn from) the deeper concerns in this novel: the insanity of some of the distortions of our American Dream—a zero-sum culture where you’re either right or wrong, good or bad, etc., and dependent on those dualities, you win or lose. In my opinion, the antidote is the sane vision of nonduality (that we are simultaneously right and wrong, good and bad), or compassion—which can hold the fact that we—all of us—are both love and hate; one does not wipe out the other. And it's the compassion for our human condition that makes the whole thing bearable.But that leads to my problem with O'Connor's work. Yes, it is sometimes humorous, but pain and oblivious cruelty rule, the characters learn nothing from it, and she leaves us with such bleakness (not quite as bad as what I've privately labeled the ""Bleak School of Literary Book Writing""), that I often found myself confounded by the point of it all. It's an odd thing to both admire and dread a writer's work.

And since I have many more active friends now, I thought I'd resurrect my . I envy anyone who gets to read this book for the first time.]Raw, wild and free-wheeling, blasphemous, pained, and hilarious, Making Nice is a novel made from a collection of stories that work like the shards of a shattered window falling in such a way that you can still see the pane (pun intended). Angry-young-man narrator Alby is a pushover for a stranded baby cardinal he names Gary, his dog Sparkles, a possibly suicidal grasshopper, and a slug named Cherokee Bob, but he can't control his hair-trigger temper or his mouth or, the bigger problem, life—the fact that stuff happens, people suffer, and no matter how hard you love, everyone and everything dies. In this rollicking, nasty story of his travails, he explains himself:Somewhere along the way I’d become incapable of relaxing, of allowing my body to be still, of rest. It isn’t that I have more energy than I know what to do with, because I don’t. It’s that my body is uncomfortable. It’s not pain, necessarily, but an antsy annoyance of the muscles and—when still—I become excruciatingly aware of just how uncomfortable I am. Then I have to move. I get up and pace around, shake my hand like I just touched something too hot, fidget, tap a table or countertop. I take long walks.In a car, though, I’m stuck, and the entire drive up from Wilmington had been a nonstop series of seat adjustments and shoulder rolls, opening and closing windows, switching CDs and tinkering with the volume knob, rubbing my eyeballs and punching myself in the legs, as if hurting the leg hurts the ache that’s in it. I smoked a lot of cigarettes, cracked my knuckles, my ankles, my back and my neck, cracked everything that was crackable and bobbed my head in order to make a smashed bug on the windshield appear to fly just above the treetops bordering the interstate, until I banged my chin on the steering wheel while attempting to clear a particularly tall pine outside of Richmond. When that got old, I looked for things to look at: the rearview, the rearview, trees, a dead dog next to a blue hospital sign and GOD BLESS OUR SOLDIERS BEEFY BURRITO $1.39, the rearview—anything but the road itself. I’ve been in over a dozen accidents, all of which were my fault. I hit a bridge once. I drove through a closed garage door. It’s stopping I have a problem with.Alby is a Holden Caulfield with no filters, on uppers, living in our crazy twenty-first century with way more noise, dysfunction, and heartbreak than Salinger ever imagined.

Yet there's unexpected humor (imagine a Canadian Long Day's Journey into Night with laughs!). Lawson's creation of place—a fictional town in snow-blanketed Northern Ontario, Canada, and London, England, in the 1960s—is stunning and visceral. Chapters alternate between first person and third; the father of the family speaks for himself and the text is so good it could work as a theater monologue; some chapters are third-person narratives; yet there's never a bump in transitions; the changes are organic and they flow. All the members of this big family are in some sense aliens, and their understated psychology is deep and impeccable (Lawson is a psychologist). This is a book for anybody who has tried, longed to try but never done it, or believed they could run away from their dysfunctional background—only to discover that they carry it within.I loved the writing, soaked it in, laughed, ached, and although I've never lived these events, they felt so familiar and intimate I almost can't write about them.

I’ve never seen the water, so I’ve gone there. Don’t worry, I’ve left you the truck. I can walk. I will try to remember to come back.”Along her journey she is accompanied by a talking coyote named James and a journalist. She sometimes dreams she is her husband and sometimes other people she knows. She sometimes becomes her husband (and vice versa) and “loses herself.” Meanwhile Otto makes papier-mâché sculptures of animals as gifts for Etta on her return. And he visits with his neighbor, Russell, who adopted himself into Otto’s family when they both were children. Russell, too, is in love with Etta and takes off after her, but ends up on his own quest. Etta and Otto embody a purity and simplicity that I believe is the essence of who we are. They occupy time—as does the story—that is nonlinear and vast. They just love and accept and are one with each other, no matter where or when they are. And each in his and her own way is completely unaffected by the culture of craving, status, and ego concerns.Interspersed with the present time (when Otto and Etta are in their 80s) are scenes from childhood and Otto’s service during World War II—one of which almost off-handedly expresses the map or theme of this book:Look, said Gérald [a soldier], it’s just like chess. Sometimes it’s our turn to be moved, either aggressively or defensively. Sometimes we’re not moved for ages. Sometimes we’re moved back to a place we’ve just been. It all seems random from here, but from above, for those who can see the whole board, it probably makes sense.Does this sound confusing? It does to me, writing it, but, for me, this love story was absolutely comprehensible and necessary to communicate in the unique form and language that belongs only to Emma Hooper (with the faintest echoes of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s The Little Prince). I’m not sure how it might be understood by readers with no interest in metaphysics, but it is more real than reality for somebody who accepts “the loop of life,” or has experienced awareness much bigger than normal time and space, or has taken a dip in the ocean (water) of consciousness from which we all erupt like waves from time to time. A Note about Quotation MarksAs a reader and editor who admires the Chicago Manual of Style, I loathe the latest writer’s fad of foregoing quotation marks around dialogue, and although I think denoting dialogue might improve the reading experience of Etta and Otto and Russell and James, this is the first time where I can see that their absence is in keeping with the idiosyncratic structure and style of this book. There were only a couple of times I had to reread in order to understand what was dialogue and what was narrative. That said, this is a wonderful, beautiful book.

An anonymous person in a Facebook writers’ group suggested it when I asked for recommendations of books that might attract readers similar to the ones who like my own work. In the beginning, She’s Come Undone undid me. Although it is a different style and has a whole different flavor than my work, it has so many similar ingredients to Plan Z by Leslie Kove (written ca. 1986, published in 2001) and newly published The Last Will & Testament of Zelda McFigg, as well as an unpublished book, that I feel a bit gobsmacked! Since I wrote my books long before I'd even heard of She's Come Undone, I can only conclude that my muse is two-timing me. Thwack-thwack, you slutty sprite!Okay, that's out of my system.Now on to She's Come Undone. I enjoyed protagonist Delores Price, but at first her voice struck me as too literary. Was this Wally Lamb unable to surrender to a character who might write less well than he does? But I was wrong. The pacing of the revelation of this literally enormous character is wonderful. She beaches slowly, like the whale who occupies the middle section of the book. The grownup literary voice at the beginning of the book deteriorates into the angry child and the crazy obese teenager of her life story, only to return once she recovers—a skillful permutation of first-person voice.The novel is divided into three parts: Our Lady of Sorrow, Whales, and The Flying Leg. I especially enjoyed Dolores's younger periods (the first two parts). For my taste, the book got too talky in part three—the kind of blow-by-blow description of thoughts and feelings that often characterizes ""women's fiction."" But I loved the ending.There is a lot of talk in the Introduction (which really should be an Afterword, since it's full of spoilers) about how miraculous it is for a male writer to so convincingly write from inside the head of a female protagonist. I disagree. Wally Lamb did what good writers do: he surrendered to his muse. And now that she's done with him, I hope she will get back to the pressing business with moi!...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Mar 18, 2015","Mar 21, 2015","Mar 18, 2015",,Mass Market Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5203.She_s_Come_Undone

Thank you, Kent Haruf, and I hope you are loving people loving this--wherever you are.7/24/15When I posted my “brief” yesterday it was because I’d just read the last radiant sentence of this wonderful novella and all I had was a heart-flood the size of my body and it wiped out all verbal skills.Words have returned after a night’s sleep and I’d like to elaborate. First, wiping out a reader’s ability to yack about a book because the feelings evoked by it transcend expression, in my opinion, is most writers’ dream. Mr. Haruf did it without obvious effort in a series of what Washington Post and Goodreads er Ron Charles calls “Shaker sentences”—meaning spare and without affectation. Bravo.As a novelist, I know intimately how fiction relates to a writer’s real life. It is autobiographical the way dreams are. Of course there are seeds in one’s life, but what they become in the writer’s dream process is, in the best books, something bigger and truer—a whole new entity with a life of its own. So many times I’ve answered readers’ “Is that autobiographical?” question this way and have seen skepticism fill their faces. Recently a woman on my block who’d just read The Last Will & Testament of Zelda McFigg responded by begging me to acknowledge that Zelda was real and that I’d once been obese like her. “No,” I answered knowing I was disappointing her. “Really, I made her up.”So you would think I’d know better. But I suffer from the reader’s longing also. I want Kent Haruf to have known the quiet peace of his books. I want him to have come to terms with dying, since he was facing his own death in November 2014. I want him to have had the tolerance and steadfastness and all the good qualities of his best male characters. This longing comes from gratitude for his writer’s dream. I know he must have been complicated, flawed, conflicted about things. I know he must have had cravings and aversions the same way all of us do. But . . .I believe he still exists in another form now—a more evolved form, so perhaps he will forgive my reader’s longing and just accept my gratitude. ...more",Notes are private!,0,39,1,"Jul 23, 2015","Jul 23, 2015","Mar 03, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23602562-our-souls-at-night

Protagonist Lillian (born in 1933), who first starts talking to us, at age fifty-seven (1990), from her bed with a man who won't wake up, is charming. Lillian is real, a girl from Missouri who went to Vassar. She is sexy and idiosyncratic, and despite its time period, this story is modern. I think that's because it is deeply honest. So many other books I've read about women in the 1930s and 40s (written by women who lived in that era) focus on female manipulations to get what they want and/or hoodwink some guy. Lillian has no part in any of that. ""Nobody came from where I came from or felt what I felt, so I adapted,"" she says, during a description of her life in Europe. And ""Whenever I leave after telling Judy about my sex life, I know she tells George Junior my stories. I worry a little about that. But if I've learned anything, it's this: The world has never loved a spinster, and never will. The more people she tells, the merrier."" Lilian on Life is such a refreshingly authentic portrait of a woman during a time before female autonomy.However, I do wonder how culturally accurate the book is, as the author, Alison Jean Lester, was born in 1966 and came of age in a time when admitting that women fart is permissible. I like to think that people are just people, so maybe it has taken a modern woman to write this way about a woman who came of age in the late 40s. This is a lusciously written slim book—145 pages in the library ebook I read, and many of those pages are chapter titles.

Yalom took the title of hisRenowned existential therapist and one of the most distinguished and popular authors writing about psychotherapy, Irvin D. Yalom took the title of his new book, Creatures of a Day: And Other Tales of Psychotherapy (Basic Books, February 24, 2015) from Meditations, the private scribblings of second-century Stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius on how best to live:All of us are creatures of a day; the rememberer and the remembered alike. All is ephemeral—both memory and the object of memory. The time is at hand when you will have forgotten everything; and the time is at hand when all will have forgotten you. Always reflect that soon you will be no one, and nowhere.Given our natural will to survive and our general anxiety about death, Dr. Yalom decided to tell ten riveting stories about his patients' and his own struggles with our chronic mortality. Yalom, age eighty-two, has been treating patients for fifty years and freely shares that he continues ""to thirst for answers to the question of what really helps"" people. And in this compelling new book, the reader gets to be a fly on the wall, observing the private therapeutic relationships and learning what helps: honesty and shared presence with another human being.Whether we are twenty-five or ninety-four, conscious or unconscious of it, we all have issues with death. Writes Yalom: ""Far more patients grapple with existential issues than is generally thought. The patients [in Creatures of a Day] deal with anxiety about death, about the loss of loved ones and the ultimate loss of oneself, about how to live a meaningful life, about coping with aging and diminished possibilities, about choice, about fundamental isolation.""In the incredibly moving opening story, a mysterious eighty-four-year-old who has hired Yalom for one consultation reveals his deepest desire: to simply be witnessed. Other patients grapple with what's real in their illusive lives, whether they are good enough people, how to deal with devastating pasts, and what they are really afraid of. In Creatures of a Day, Yalom and his patients are generous pioneers. They are facing what we all will face and reporting back to us. The fact that many of them are over seventy makes their journeys all the more helpful.The following abridged excerpt is from the chapter titled ""Get Your Own Damn Fatal Illness: An Homage to Ellie."" Ellie was ""about five foot two, apparently inattentive to her appearance, with tangled hair that cried out for a brushing, loose, shapeless clothing, and no jewelry or makeup . . . a faded, wistful flower child, a refugee from the sixties."" She was a woman dying from terminal ovarian cancer. Yalom alternates Ellie's writing (summaries of her therapy sessions) with his own:EXCERPTGradually, over the course of several months, my death anxiety diminished, and I grew more comfortable in my work with terminally ill patients.This life experience made it possible for me to be so present with Ellie, and there is no question that she was appreciative of my honesty. Denial was the enemy, and she voiced impatience with any form of it. In one of her summaries, she wrote:Other people, even others who also have cancer, tell me ""You're going to live 30 years."" They tell themselves, ""I'm not going to die of this."" Even Nancy in my support group, so wise and clear-sighted, emailed me yesterday ""All we can hope for is to hang on long enough until better treatments are developed.""But this isn't what I want to hear. This is a safety net with an enormous hole right in the middle. Whether I will live a long time or a short time, I'm alive now, at this moment. What I want is to know that there are other things to hope for besides length of life. What I want to know is that it isn't necessary to turn away from thoughts of suffering or death but neither is it necessary to give these thoughts too much time and space. What I want is to be intimate with the knowledge that life is temporary. And then, in the light (or shadow) of that knowledge, to know how to live. How to live now. Here's the one thing I've learned about cancer—it shows you mortal illness and then spits you back, back to the world, to your life, to all its pleasure and sweetness, which you feel now so much more than ever. And you know that something has been given and something has been taken away. ""Something has been given and something taken away."" I knew what Ellie meant. It was a single yet complex thought—a thought that must be unpacked slowly. What has been given is a new perspective on living life, and what has been taken away is the illusion of limitless life and the belief in a personal specialness exempting us from natural law.I'm alive now and that's what matters.	Life is temporary—always, for everyone.	My work is to live until I die.	My work is to make peace with my body and to love it, whole and entire, so that, from that stable core, I can reach out with strength and generosity. . . .Often, especially early in the course of her illness, Ellie was plagued by envy of the living and healthy. She knew these mean-spirited sentiments were unhealthy to her mind and body and struggled to overcome them. The very last time I saw Ellie she told me something remarkable: ""Now no more envy. It is gone. In fact, I'm able to feel generous. Maybe I can be a kind of pioneer of dying for my friends and siblings. It sounds weird, maybe Pollyannaish, but it sustains me and is a thought that doesn't fade like the others.""A pioneer of dying—what an extraordinary phrase! This took me back forty years, to the first time I encountered this idea in my work as a therapist. In my first group of patients with cancer, I tried hard, week after week, to comfort a gravely ill woman. I've forgotten her name, but I remember her essence and still, with great clarity, can see her despondent, deeply lined face and her sad, downcast grey eyes. One day she startled all of us in the group when she arrived looking bright and revitalized. She announced: ""I've made a big decision this week. I've decided to be a model for my children—a model of how to die!"" And indeed, until she died, she modeled grace and dignity, not only for her children but also for the group members and for everyone who came in contact with her. The idea of modeling how to die permits one to imbue life with meaning until the very last moment. Over the years, I passed her insight along to many patients, but Ellie's strong language (""a pioneer of dying"") gave it even greater force. As Nietzsche said, ""If we have our own 'why' of life, we shall get along with any 'how.'""* * *Irvin D. Yalom is an emeritus professor of psychiatry at Stanford University and a psychiatrist in private practice in San Francisco. He is the author of many books, including Love's Executioner, Theory and Practice in Group Psychotherapy, and When Nietzsche Wept.

One day she told a beggar to stand up straight and look people in the eye as he begged. At a Duane Reade one afternoon, ten or fifteen people were waiting to pay for their purchases. Two cashiers were working, and there was one line. A man in a business suit took a look at the situation and evidently decided that there were actually two lines—a line for each cashier—one extending all the way into the distant reaches of the dental care section, the other magically unpeopled. Going to the head of the magic line, he started unloading his basket in front of a cashier. The woman in the front of the actual line, a worn-out-looking woman in her thirties, stared at him with cartoonish outrage—her mouth was open—but didn’t say anything.Florence wasn’t even in the line—she and Emily [her granddaughter and research assistant] had just entered the store—but what she’d seen had incensed her.“Can’t you see the line here?” Florence said to him, pointing with her cane.“There’s two lines,” he said, without even looking at her.“Take another look.”“What’s it to you?”“You don’t throw your trash on the street, you don’t serve yourself first, and you don’t cut in line. It’s called civilization.”The girl at the cash register called out to the bedraggled woman: “Next customer,’ and said to the man, “End of the line, please.”“Fuck you, you crazy old bitch,” the man said to Florence. He dropped the basket and left the store.The tired-looking woman came forward with her shampoo.“Thank you,” she said to Florence.“You should stand up for yourself,” Florence said. (chapter 52)This is Florence Gordon, and this certainly is the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Whether the character is this irascible Jewish intellectual or a nineteen-year-old girl leaving her father to lose her virginity; whether the content is the varied nuanced responses one can have to success later in life or the confused inability to confront betrayal, the writing is pitch perfect and honest.

To reiterate earlier comments, I read from front to back as well as back to front. Not the best idea, it turns out, because the strongest stories are not in the middle. I'm adding this note for two reasons:First, I googled the one story in sixty-one that I didn't think worked, and I found a wonderful New Yorker piece by Brad Leithauser about Cheever's style and turn of phrase. I was a drama major and dropped out of all the lit classes I started when I was in school because the teachers seemed fixated on writers' personal lives which I thought was nobody's business. Maybe I had some bad teachers. I shouldn't say where because it's a renowned school (Bennington), but if Mr. Leithauser had been there, I would have taken his course. Perhaps some other readers will be interested in his article.Second, in addition to finishing Cheever's opus, I finally gave in and bought a Kindle. I hate it. And knowing that I feel that way makes me even more appreciative of the big fat orange Cheever book I own. When I finished it, I kissed it long and hard before I put it up on my shelf. And the fact that I can glance up at it—it's lying sideways because I've run out of space—and see Mr. Cheever's name in big white letters against a two-toned amber background gives me comfort. I've heard a lot of things about Cheever (my mother knew him) that make me pretty sure he wasn't always fun (yikes, none of my business! I apologize), but I am so happy to have him physically on my shelf. He is now a permanent member of my library family. Kindle can't come close to giving that kind of pleasure.Feb. 18, 2015An update to the earlier quasi- (see below). I still haven't finished this book, and I'm in no rush to. I'm reading from front to back and back to front, so when I finish, I'll be somewhere in the middle of the book--which, for inarticulate reasons, feels right. The stories flay and slay me, so one story a day, or every few days, is all I can handle.Last night I went to an Authors Guild symposium where one of the panelists described reading as ""an intimate social connection--between a reader and a writer."" I was struck by the word ""social."" Intimate, yes, but social? I certainly don't want John Cheever in the room while I'm reading, and I don't really want to meet him. But, yes, I feel intimately connected and safe in that connection because it is private, in my mind.I'm curious: do other people feel an intimate social connection with the writer of a book they're reading? And if so, what does that mean to them? Is there more that they want from the writer than the words and story in the book, privately? I'd love responses to this post. I'm really curious.Jan. 5, 2015I lied. I haven't finished reading this, but I'm just going to cut to the chase and give it five stars. The stories in this 693-page opus appear in the chronological order Cheever wrote them. I started reading from the front, then began reading from the back.I borrowed my copy of the book from the library, and since most of what I've read leaves me almost catatonic from awe and in need of inert time on my back on the couch in order to process, there is no way I'm going to finish this book in the two weeks allotted by the library. So in order to read this book in the time it demands, I'm going to have to buy it. Buying books scares me these days. Here's why:  [image]Nevertheless, I must risk it. Five stars.

The last chapter of Blink delineates, without bias, the “why” of the whole mess, as well as actions to take to change it. And the conclusion is optimistic:”Too often we are resigned to what happens in the blink of an eye. It doesn’t seem like we have much control over whatever bubbles to the surface from our unconscious. But we do, and if we can control that environment in which rapid cognition takes place, then we can control rapid cognition. We can prevent the people fighting wars or staffing emergency rooms or policing the streets from making mistakes.”If you want to understand the “why” of what is going on, I recommend this book.In addition, I'd recommend listening to this interview with civil rights attorney Constance Rice.

This is a popular novel—easy reading—with a simple story that would translate well to film. In fact, the metronome rhythm sounds like reporting or deposition—which is fitting since the protagonist, Dorie McKenna, is a journalist on a quest to get to know her twin sister, who is a Sister cloistered in a monastery. Dorie was adopted and until the start of the book was unaware of her biological connections.The sister/Sister is a fabulous painter, so the reporting extends not only to what life is like in a Catholic nunnery but to the art world. Fun. Dialogues resemble a reporter's interviews and the book feels well researched. It also delivers a spiritual/psychological parable about the conflict between ego-driven creation and truly surrendered creation, as well as the complex way we can trick ourselves into believing we are surrendered when we are actually in a full-fledged ego battle against our ego—by avoiding everything that might tempt it to reveal itself publicly. This is a sneaky battle that many people who work in the arts will resonate with.The book has a lovely and moving ending.I recommend Contrition to people who enjoy popular fiction, parables, and appreciate learning about other kinds of lives through a sturdily written simple plot....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Dec 11, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/22609271-contrition

Brown distills the most private human confusion, shame, hubris, hurt, anger, and self-delusion into spare writing that goes into the reader like emotion pushed through an IV. I found myself rocking and moaning. The range and diversity of the writing is also perfection. He’ll play with the short story form, turning it into a lyrical poem or, in a story recalling a memory, disorganized fragments — as if he wrote a story, tore it into individual sentences, then pieced them together randomly. And the creation relays the way memory really works. One of my favorite stories in this collection, “Night Life,” left me gasping.

It must have been so much fun to write such bad, offensive stories. I admire the freedom in them.For me, the chapters before the last one join the ranks of other writer-on-writer stories (Nobokov’s Pale Fire) where the work involves the idiosyncrasies of writer characters. Although it’s amusing — particularly to me, a writer — it does get kind of exhausting after a point.However, ultimately this is a confused book. It’s a novel, but the protagonist is called Mario and Varguitas. Huh? The chapters alternate between the protagonist’s real story of the courtship and finally marriage to his Aunt Julia, and wild chapters that read like crazy short stories. These, I gathered, are supposed to be the work of the title’s scriptwriter, Pedro Camacho — although Camacho wrote radio scripts, not straight prose. Okay, I could accept the conceit of that. And I was very intrigued to see where this whole thing would go — the scriptwriter’s escalating crazy stories and the first-person story. Since this was a novel and I had no clue how they’d come together, despite my reader’s exhaustion, I was intrigued enough to finish the book.[SPOILER ALERT FOR LAST PARAGRAPH]It finishes with the whimper of a memoir. Mario Varguitas moves away, divorces Aunt Julia, remarries his cousin, and returns to find Pedro Camacho in demeaning circumstances.

If you are a philosophy lover who can accept Kant’s statement that “time and space are first and foremost modes of perception and not attributes of the physical world,” or if you are excited by (and aware of) string theory’s descriptions of levels of existence that can make your head swim, or if you have an education in indigenous wisdom, shamanism, dream “medicine,” and ways of communication that have been around since the beginning of man (but are denied by modern Western European culture or referred to as “supernatural”), you may love Dreaming with Polar Bears.Dawn Baumann Brunke is a brave writer. And an even braver dreamer. In Dreaming with Polar Bears she “comes out” as a person who has experienced shared dreams with real living polar bears and meetings with Spirit bears and a Polar Bear Council that is hoping to awaken our human species. Brunke is not a New Age crank. She is a journalist. She is deeply educated in the ways of animals. And she is a skeptical and articulate explorer of her own experiences.Inherent in the act of translating into language something as experiential as a dream—even a lucid one—is using the language of the translator. Hence, a lot of the bear talk sounds like an articulate explorer. But there is more. In my favorite section, that intellectual language gives way to something visceral and exhilarating: the feeling of transforming into and being a polar bear. (I won’t spoil it for you, but it comes on page 113.) And this and all the other passages that allow you to feel as though you are walking in the Arctic as a bear, hearing sounds and smelling smells you’ve never sensed before, tasting air, feeling seal breath—this is what is transformative about this book. Yes, there is analysis and a clearly stated mission, but it’s when we get to feel what Brunke feels being a bear that we also feel a new connection to and reverence for Earth.Brunke wrote this book to serve the polar bears’ cause: to wake us humans up and help us reconnect to Earth and who we are. “. . . I sometimes felt a weighty responsibility,” she writes. “How to open to a dialogue between humans and polar bears? How to share a story about polar bears that is so far removed from the general experience of most humans? How to convey their bridge of dreams, their deeper sense of connection between all beings that spurs us to evolve and expand our awareness?”This is not a book for everyone. New Agers who don’t want to work to analyze their dreams, or people who scoff at any notion of intelligence in other species or real experience that does not happen in our everyday conscious state will not be fans.

Susan Jane Gilman is a master story weaver with perfect pitch — for dialogue, narrative, curlicued paradoxical human responses, and everything that contributes to a literary symphony. The time structure of this book is inspired — weaving from both the past, forward and the future, back to finally sync up in a central present.The story of the evolution of Russian Jewish immigrant child Malka Treynovsky into a Jewish Italian American Marie Antoinette/Leona Helmsley/Martha Stewart/Joan Rivers ice cream diva named Lillian Dunkle is both an only-in-the-USA story and a transcendently human tour-de-force of hurt, humiliation, resentment, delicious revenge, regret, and resilience.

And even the interspersed third-person sections have a meandering ""telling a story"" feel. I've never really thought about old Western movies, but after reading Falling from Horses (an Advanced Reading Copy), I never want to watch a Western of any era again. The violence against horses is hard on the stomach. There is violence against people as well, but the people chose to participate in it; the horses did not. And the book is, in many ways, about the commonplace violence that is often a part of living. Author Molly Gloss says it a lot better than I can (from chapter 33):. . . I always seem to be looking at the hard knot that is our myth of the cowboy West: the violence on the movie screen and behind it and the way the humanity has been hollowed out of our movie heroes and villains, the poverty, isolation, and precariousness of ranch work, the dignity and joy of it, and the necessary cruelty. At the start I thought that if I could get everything right, people would see where the cowboy stories went wrong, what we have missed or lost, and they might see that the cowboy life doesn't have to be so goddamn brave and bloody and lonesome as the movies make it out to be. But I have learned over the years that all I can do is reach for something difficult--try to get the colors right and the negative space, the angle of the light. And if a few people can see it, that has to be enough.I can see it, Ms. Gloss.

Like the family, the story is patchworked — the pieces, not necessarily linear, but when put together, they tell a more perfect story than tales that are forced into a tight chronological narrative. Events are revealed through a simultaneous tide-in and undertow-out flow of action and letters from the future; the writing voice changes from third person to various different first persons and yet it is never confusing. Why? Because Amy Bloom writes at the pleasure of a muse that is uniquely her own — a truly authentic and organic voice and structure. Bloom’s voice and structure are so naturally honest that they seem easy. But I’ve read writers who I’ve suspected have tried to copy her, and, in their copycat hands, you realize this level of honesty is anything but easy. Amy Bloom copies no one. She writes at the pleasure of her Original Voice. And so few writers find, let alone express themselves in or from their original voices that it seems rare. Maybe that’s just the way it is. An Original Voice is treasure. This book is treasure. I mean that in both an emotional and physical way. I found myself running my hands over the physical book — the lush colors and embossed type on the cover, the exquisite interior design and thick matte, deckle-edge paper (Susan Turner, designer), a reprise of the cover art in endpaper illustrations (Deborah Van Auten), and even a red detail on the top and bottom edges of the inner spine: this book — Bloom’s text and designers’ interpretation — is complete, cohesive, sensuous art. I read it as slowly as I could, rereading passages, not for the reasons I usually do — because a writer is “being literary” and therefore incomprehensible. I reread because I was savoring it, the way you would incredible food that you want to taste for as long as possible before swallowing and digesting it. Here’s a morsel, spoken by the younger sister, Evie, about her job telling fake fortunes in a beauty salon:If you’d asked me what I understood about fortune-telling, I would have told you that no one came to see someone like me because they were happy. I would have said, People come because they are so frightened, they wake up in a sweat. They look into the well of their true selves, and the consequences of being who they are, and they’re horrified.

Like Gladwell’s other work, it attempts to shatter assumptions and therefore expectations about who will succeed and why. However, taken in a context that includes some of the revelations of Outliers, this new book expands rather than shatters our notions. Because my primary interest is people rather than assumptions about class sizes and more amounts of anything being better than less (there’s plenty of that in this book), I’d like to focus on the outsider people aspect of the book:Through copious footnotes Gladwell takes pains to clarify that his misfit and underdog success stories are not always the rule: lots of illiterate people with dead parents and lousy childhoods end up in jail rather than lawyering or doctoring.Outliers illuminated the fact that when highly intelligent children who have been given guidance and nurturing are compared in adulthood to those who were not guided and nurtured, the non-nurtured adults are akin to a different “species.” Where the nurtured children become thriving successful adults, the equally intelligent non-nurtured ones can barely navigate life and live on the edges of society. (And I use “non-nurtured” to include people who were not only neglected but who were hurt and invalidated.) David and Goliath tells the stories of people who had enormous obstacles—inexperience, dyslexia, brutal childhoods, cultures of racism and warfare—who became braver because they had survived disasters unhurt. Some of these people were so without assets that they had nothing to lose and felt free to invent their own modes of conduct, taking daring chances when they were desperate. Some developed special skills to compensate for those they did not have. And because of this—as well as the fact that they were not so afraid of being afraid that they let it paralyze them—they triumph. And, says Gladwell, statistically it turns out that the cream of the successful crop of human entrepreneurs and trailblazers seems to be such people.In some ways, David and Goliath is the antidote to Outliers. If you grew up without guidance and nurturing, after reading Outliers you might just give up. (I want to write a book for such people, but more about that another time.) If David and Goliath shatters anything, it might be the despair that Outliers documented in the chapters about non-nurtured adults—because if you are such a person and you read this book to learn, you may begin to view your so-called deficiencies differently, as you contemplate the assets you do have and how you might exercise them in ways that are peculiar to you. For people with intelligence, David and Goliath is the fantasy good teacher who offers the material but leaves it to you to figure out what to do with it.So like an intelligent student, I’ve been cogitating: What might I do as a virtually unknown writer with a funny prize-winning novel coming out next year? I don’t have the stomach to jump into a cab with someone I don’t know and claim to be something I’m not (as one of Gladwell’s role models did), or to torture people (as another of Gladwell’s people did—a doctor who hurt kids in the interest of curing thousands more). But I am not averse to trying to piggyback on Gladwell’s book by telling you that my new novel, The Last Will & Testament of Zelda McFigg, is a “rollicking romp” (as one reader put it) from an underdog misfit who battles giants with a different and perhaps more common outcome than the heroes of David and Goliath.

It’s the space between thiPatty Dann’s excellent new novel Starfish occupies interstitial territory. “Interstice” means to stand still in the middle. It’s the space between things. And both the writing and the first-person protagonist, Charlotte Flax, live in this very difficult place. At age forty-two, Charlotte, who takes “no pleasure in change,” returns to her childhood home the way she does most everything—without a present connection, aimless, and searching. This is very difficult territory for a novel, but the writing is so beguiling that it holds you, makes you care, makes you wonder what happens next. Will this idiosyncratic woman from an equally idiosyncratic family ever connect to her present? If so, how? What makes this novel work is a subtle, nuanced thread of awareness within a story of no awareness: “All my life,” writes Charlotte, “I had felt like our family . . . had been on a ship without a captain drifting toward a dangerous waterfall.”“When I was in elementary school . . . I once watched girls play jump rope during recess on a hot September playground, but I was afraid to jump in myself. I wasn’t sure how. A boy in horn-rimmed glasses walked up to me and held a conch shell to my ear. He said I’d hear the ocean, but I knew even then that all I was hearing was the sounds inside my own head.”“I . . . stared at myself in the mirror. I’m not sure why I did that, probably just to see my own face and remind myself that I existed.”I won’t give away the end, but suffice it say that connection finally comes.

My first time reading Stoner, I of course had no idea what was coming and finished the book absolutely stunned by the story and the magnificence of the writing.The second and third times I read this book, I was consciously studying it, in awe of the technique.I tried, in this fourth reading, to study, but that kind of headiness wouldn’t hold against my emotions, as I felt the atmosphere around and in me become both dense and vibratingly vibrant for the entire time I read. This time, since I know the story so well, I was astounded by the writing of Stoner’s wife, Edith—I saw how well and fully she is written. Many readers dismiss her as a monster, but if you read again, you may see the psychological perfection of the growth of her character. And I think because I was so at one with the characters, particularly William Stoner, feeling the pain in the earlier part of the book, this time I felt a full release at the end. Yes, I still cried, but the full radiance of the ending—which I don’t think I was prepared for in the earlier read-throughs—was mine.I remain in awe.2/16/18Because I'm swimming in this book once more, and because of the video (see below), I learned about this 2013 BBC interview with Ian McEwan, in whose books I have also been swimming. McEwan is similarly enamored with Stoner and I find myself wondering if his On Chesil Beach may even be an homage to it.2/13/18I have just discovered a documentary about the effect of this book. The Art of Becoming. Magnificent. I recommend this for people who have already read Stoner and are as in love and obsessed with it as I am. It is so nice to have the company of the people in this documentary.2/14/16Scroll down to see earlier s. I swore I would not  or add to this  again, but I lied. I finished reading Stoner for the third time yesterday, and this book seems to get more powerful with every reading. In John Williams’s letters that follow the book in the 50th anniversary edition, one learns that Williams’s original title for this book was A Matter of Love. I prefer Stoner because of its dignity and weight, but I understand Williams’s fixation on the first title. This book is about all matters of love: love that persists no matter how much it is squashed, suppressed, rejected, or maligned. And love that is unknown. The greatest pain we human beings can know is not the love that we are denied, but love that we are not allowed to give. This was Stoner’s journey. I am, for the third time, a puddle.11/2/15Oh, oh, oh, I just received my 50th anniversary hardcover edition (GR doesn't have the cover posted yet; here it is.)[image](It is currently 30% off at NYRB) It doesn't have a dust jacket, but it does have a paper sleeve with praise from stellar people, and at the top, under the title and author's name, it says ""The International Best Seller.""I mention this because this edition includes letters from John Williams to his agent in which he seems to foretell the future of this book, despite massive discouragement. These letters are so wonderful because they give you a feeling for John Williams, the man. How clear, savvy, and aware he was of exactly what he had created—with almost no validation:From his agent, Marie RodellNow, from a business point of view: I may be totally wrong, but I don't see this as a novel with a high potential sale. Its technique of almost unrelieved narrative is out of fashion, and its theme to the average reader could well be depressing. . . .From John WilliamsI suspect that I agree with you about the commercial possibilities; but I also suspect that the novel may surprise us in this respect. . . . The only thing I'm sure of is it that it's a good novel; in time it may even be thought of as a substantially good one. A great deal more is going on in the novel than appears on the surface, and its technique is a great deal more ""revolutionary"" than it appears to be. Despite this, it is, I think available to the ordinary reader; or at least I hope it is. One afternoon a few weeks ago, I walked in on my typist (a junior history major, and pretty average, I'm afraid) while she was finishing typing chapter 15, and discovered great huge tears coursing down her cheeks. I shall love her forever.I shall love John Williams forever.9/27/15I'm overdue for my yearly read of Stoner; next time will be the third time. But I'm glad I've waited because on November 3, a fiftieth anniversary hardcover edition, including John Williams's letters to his agent about his frustration finding a publisher, will be published. I'm already lusting for my copy. I know others similarly revere this book, so I thought I'd add to my  now, giving the website where you can get an alert about the new edition: http://www.nyrb.com/products/stoner-1...* * *One of the most brilliantly written books I've ever read. Where to begin?In 278 pages, Williams manages to write an evolution of time and character that is epic, iconic, and almost mythological in its simplicity. The economy of the writing paradoxically creates a massive undertow of drama and contained emotion. The build of the plot and a whole lifetime of change contained in this book is a lesson to all writers on how to simply tell a story. No tricks. No showing off. Pure, insanely brilliant writing.* * * Almost a year since writing the above, I have just reread this magnificent book. It is even better the second time. I read it to see how Williams did it, and what jumps out at me this time is his astonishing and impeccable timing--the way he piles narrative and facts. He almost never tells you what somebody feels; instead he piles on facts, making time flow in what feels like the most organic way but which is in fact sped up so that years can pass in a paragraph. The pressure of the facts creates deep emotions in the reader. This is one of the best master class reads I've ever done.

You can read it from cover to cover or you can meditate on the spectacular rainbow-colored images of animals that manage to evoke more of who they are and their message to humans than literal renderings would. You can practice bibliomancy—close your eyes, open, point, and read—to get a message about whatever is going on in your life.Full disclosure: Animal communicator and Animal Teachings author Dawn Brunke is a friend of mine.

But none of that prepared me for the feeling of Christmas, my birthday, and finding treasure all rolled up into one experience as I pulled the book out of its envelope. If you love animals, get it. If the art weren’t copyrighted, I’d splash it all over the page here.Today’s bibliomancy landed on Seal: “While seals can be lively and full of fun, Seal’s serious side pulls us far down. Seals can stay submerged for an hour and dive to a depth of well over 1,000 feet. This connection with deep water reveals Seal as a wisdom keeper, in touch with oceanic rhythms and currents of the psyche. Seal assists us in remembering our deepest dreams, especially those we have forgotten because they seem too dense or cumbersome to bring to the surface.”The picture of Seal reminds me of an ancestor I never met. He makes me sad and glad all at the same time. So does all great art. So does this book....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Feb 24, 2012","May 16, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14571984-animal-teachings

Now I know something else—that it is my labor to understand others, & possibly even myself, that will be the accomplishment of my life—the accomplishment in the act of trying. Not to be understood, but to understand; not even, alas, to be loved, but to love.”If you are a person who sometimes makes others uncomfortable or angry, if you are alive in a way that sometimes scares people, this is a book for you.

Did you know that your heart has arms and legs? It does. The heart that we see in medical shBeyond the Leaving … and What I Learned from Gil Hedley1. Did you know that your heart has arms and legs? It does. The heart that we see in medical shows when a surgeon is saving somebody’s life is only part of the organ. The entire heart has long tendrils like tree branches that go down each arm and each leg. Imagine how amazing it would be if you could walk down the street looking at everybody through special X-ray–vision glasses that singled out the heart!2. Super models are freaks of nature because, according to poet/anatomist/teacher/author/ethicist/renaissance man Gil Hedley, “our bodies are not symmetrical. Not even close.” They’re full of surprises and anomalies—like the most perfectly formed little ovary that looked like a miniature brain … in an 83-year-old woman who had donated her body so that people like us could learn something and maybe wake up a little.3. It’s a well-known fact that New York pigeons smoke—you see them poking around sidewalks filled with butts, so who else could have dropped them? And lest you judge them harshly for stinking up the environment, just take another look—really look: See that pigeon taking off for the sky, tail feathers down, beak up, effortlessly defying our human body limitations and looking like a grey angel. I know this to be true because Gil Hedley showed slides of pigeons, both pre-smoking and frozen in flight, in his recent New York City intensive (which seemed to be over in about five minutes—blink, it’s eight hours later—really) at the Cantor Film Center, where about 120 of us packed into a tiny theater and were riveted, laughing, and grateful for what was really an indescribable experience of learning who we are through a mosaic of lecture, stories, slides, little movies, art, poetry, and Gil, Gil, Gil—who, in the course of a day, managed to gently and reverentially shatter all inhibitions, shame, judgments, and biases we humans walked in with. OK, enough about the intensive, since I can’t really describe what happened … but if you want the experience of being gently shattered, having your judgments replaced with curiosity, and maybe coming home to stand stark naked in front of a mirror to say, “Hello, I’d like to get to know you, and thank you” to your body for maybe the first time in your life, then take a look at Gil’s workshop schedule, and if he’s within driving distance, for goodness sake, drive!What I really meant to write about when I started this blog was Gil’s new book of free verse, Beyond the Leaving. Much like the aforementioned intensive, I cannot really tell you what happens in this little book. It’s only 86 pages, but it took me a month to read them. Why? Because they, too, reverentially shatter, move, take your breath away. Unlike Gil’s last book, Coming Into Form, which sometimes echoes of Rumi, Beyond the Leaving has no models. Like his workshop, it doesn’t copy anybody, doesn’t sound like anybody else, but is a spontaneous flow from this particular heart with arms and legs named Gil Hedley. It is the product of somebody who has investigated the heart, the body, life, and death and found that there are no separations between any of these things.If you can’t get to a workshop, if you don’t want to investigate who you are by seeing into another’s dead body, if this whole thing is just not your thing or too hard or … whatever, then just read this.

Search for the title in the store of your choice. Paperback is also available.I've published one of the short stories from the collection on my blog: Watching the Human Race. It's a story about softening our judgmental nature by experiencing a bigger truth. I wrote it a long time ago, but it feels timely now.Earlier ReviewI recently discovered that the ebook of this collection of short stories and one-act plays had gone out of print, so I decided to take the whole book back and revise it into a second edition.Here is the Author's Note to the second edition:Author's NoteThis is a revised edition of a collection that was published in 2005, however most of the short stories and trilogy of one-act plays span more than thirty years in creation prior to that date. Hence, some of the references: ""Girl Friday"" jobs in a time when gender discrimination was not even a topic, rent prices that are unheard of in our current era, and television shows such as The Mary Tyler Moore Show and Johnny Carson's nightly entertainment. Rather than try to update references for 2020, I have left these anachronisms and hope you will accept them in their time.The section of short-shorts entitled ""Short but Not At All Sweet"" as well as the section ""Getting Unstuck"" are new with this edition.The last play in this anthology, Darleen Dances, has had a long and still vital life. I wrote and performed it when I was a working actress in my thirties, and subsequently the opening monologue was published in an actors' monologue book that remains in print and interests many young actresses. If you are one of them, know that I wish you great success performing the monologue for auditions, and whatever age you are is appropriate for the material. However, as I aged, I began to understand more about what I had written and I realized that making Darleen much older than she was when I first wrote the piece made her dilemma deeper and more critical. Therefore in this published version, you may be surprised by her age. Do not let that dissuade you from performing the monologue.Because the stories were created over so many decades, in putting together a collection, I realized with the brilliance of hindsight that many of the characters were repeated in different stages of their lives. So I have made that apparent and hope you enjoy their evolution....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,not set,"Jan 03, 2020","Sep 06, 2011",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/61915521-girl-stories-game-plays

He was completely blind from a childhood accident, yet he could see. You will have to read the book to get more of an explanation for that. And by the way, I literally mean ""see""--form and light.I first met Lusseyran long after his death in 1971, when I went to work for Parabola magazine which was then publishing a book I ended up editing: a collection of mind-blowing essays by Lusseyran, Against the Pollution of the I: Selected Writings. (Both that and this autobiography have since been acquired and republished by another company.) Although I fell as madly in love with a man as is possible through his writing alone, until about ten years ago, I had only listened to the abridged version of And There Was Light--an extraordinary reading by Andre Gregory on tape, now out of print. So it was years after the job at Parabola that I finally dove into the complete edition in paperback, and my god!If you feel starved for truth, grace, humility, and true nobility, meet Mr. Lusseyran. Please! He is there to help.[By the way, Anthony Doerr borrowed from this book, fully credited in his acknowledgements, for his Pulitzer-winner All The Light We Cannot See. I loved that book, but Lusseyran still wins my admiration hands down in a contest between the two.]...more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,not set,not set,"Mar 20, 2011",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/288222.And_There_Was_Light
