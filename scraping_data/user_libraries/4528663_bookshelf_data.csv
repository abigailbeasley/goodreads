I’m not a huge fan of indie and tend to stay away from self-pub, but ever now and again, I check out what’s out there.This one was exactly as advertised. Convinced by his Machiavellian mustachioed and notoriously evil assistant, Devil, decides to retire and look for a replacement. Instead of promoting from within, he opts for recruiting out, settling on four potential candidates. Within the pages of the book, each is given an extensive backstory to show the reader just how worthy they are. Out of these, the disappointed superhero one is the most clever and resonant.Eventually the four gather together for an interview to vie for a job none had applied for. And yes, it will get dangerous.Pretty funny all around, decently written, quick read. It could do with a bit of editing, but the overall presentation is solid for a self-pub effort.

So I was excited to see another book of his on Netgalley and requested it straight away. And then took ages to get to, because I don’t love fat books. That said, if there’s anyone worth ignoring personal preferences and braving well over 400 pages for, it’s Marra. The man is far from prolific, but books he does produce are masterpieces. I do not use the word lightly. This book, like ACoVP, is stunning. Luminous. It took me an inordinate (or me) time to get through in no small way because sometimes I would just pause in awe and the sheer staggering beauty of a sentence or a paragraph. The skill with which Marra can write a tragedy humorously, the casual grace with which the man can break and remake your soul while reading, it nothing short of remarkable.As a writer and a reader, I admit this was not merely a read but a lesson in how to do it. That such humorous notes can sparkle in such darkness, that such cleverness should string the narrative together while jumping all over the place, geographically and temporarily, is hugely impressive.And of course, I love books about movies, and this ode to the golden age of cinema juxtaposed against the turbulence of WWII was right up my alley. It follows a diverse, largely immigrant cast in the industry they were instrumental in building and sustaining in a time when and a place where being an immigrant was not only challenging but outright dangerous. (And you can read the news to see how tragically not far the nation has come since in attitudes and prevailing mentality.)Or don’t read it for politics, read it for the characters and their journeys. Read it for the sheer joy of learning about different times and lives. For fans of historical fiction, literature, and character driven stories, this is about as good as it gets. In fact, it is up there on par with one of my all-time favorites, The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, which is about as high of a praise as I can dish out. Recommended. Recommended.

They are meant to escort the souls to the next level, but one of them, the eponymous Karmen, prefers a distinctly different, didactic approach, educating her “clients” on where they went wrong in life. She does this with her latest, a suicide victim, a particularly annoying young woman who is selfish and stupid, and accordingly decides to dispatch herself over a boy. Is she worth saving then? Well, Karmen thinks so, and therefore they begin to fly around the city and talk, talk, talk.The graphic novel is gorgeously drawn but written rather tediously. Too many words.

Still, she is only the fifth oldest person in the world, and when she erroneously comes to think that she only has a week to live, she decides to go out on top as it were, by killing the other four contenders for the longest-lived throne.Yes, it doesn’t make much sense, but this is about quaintness and cuteness and whimsical Irish charm, not logistics. And so, Sister Agatha embarks on a globe-trotting adventure with a murderous gleam in her eye. True to the very impetus of her quest, what follows is also a comedy of errors, but she gets to go to exciting faraway places for the first time and meet all sorts of wacky characters.

The thing with most sequI enjoyed The Lemon Man, both book and protagonist, enough to welcome the sequel, despite genuine preference for standalones. The thing with most sequels is that they don’t hold the candle to the original, and this one is no exception to the rule. It isn’t so much the book’s fault, it’s just that the crisp freshness of originality inevitably leaves the building when one takes to serializing. And so, the series tend to rely on the characters themselves, hoping the reader will form a strong enough attachment to sustain them. Does Lemon Man himself merit such an attachment? Well … first off, he doesn’t have OCD and the book should not advertise it. That just had to be said. You want to make your character quirky, hit some modern fiction prerequisites for diversity, sure, go for it. But don’t just mention a psychological disorder to check the box with nothing to back it up.That said, in the first book the protagonist had a baby and a new love interest to juggle, and that was fun. In this one, he only has the love interest (now a more permanent although difunctional situation). Yes, he still wears slippers to ride a bike, which makes no sense to anyone who rides bikes, unless slippers in Ireland are radically different from slippers elsewhere. Quirky, but is that enough?Since Lemon Man’s main appeal seems to be overcoming the odds, the author just layers on the abuse as heavily as he can. So instead of cushy paid assassin gigs, Lemon Man gets stuck doing random jobs and trying to save his bestie, while navigating a local gang war—the more he gets in, the more he gets beaten up. Violence is visited and revisited upon his person, until he can barely bike, though he preserves, of course, because he now is in the sequel, one that makes it very obvious a third book is planned.So, the plot didn’t do much for me. The writing is very, very plain. The opposite of literary fiction—commercial fiction, I suppose. Short plan sentences. One after another. It’s all like …This person walked in. They looked like * and wore * and did *. First person narration gives it a sort of engaging immediacy, so the book mainly coasts on that.My favorite thing about this was getting a bikeview tour of Dublin. That never gets old. The protagonist names every landmark and describes the city enough to make it into a character of its own, one likely more engaging that the rest put together. Overall, a quick, mildly entertaining read.

Aoileann’s entire life is dedicated to (with her grandmother) taking care of her mother who has been in a vegetative state more or less since Aoileann was born.This care is described in exhaustive, visceral detail to show you just how much of a nightmare the situation is. To make matters worse (and give the situation a slightly surreal atmosphere),at night, her mother apparently crawls around, etching letters into the floor with her bare fingers. When Rachel (with her newborn) shows up on the island for a temporarily artistic residency, Aoileann sees a window into a larger world open and grabs at it for dear life. It becomes a sort of toxic obsession where she can’t quite tell if she wants Rachel for a lover or a mother, but she wants Rachel and will stop at nothing to get her.Absolutely harrowing journey into a warped mind. Very well done.It seems the story had been reworked and expanded from the original, going by descriptions alone, and more importantly, it works. Sure, yeah, it checks A LOT of the current gotta-have-it boxes along the way: a tale of motherhood, mothers/daughters dynamics, reverential treatment of body fat, queer tones, etc. but it does so in a way that never seems gratuitous and really works within the story. It isn’t a fun read by any means, nor will it work for everyone, but it would be a deranged delight for connoisseurs of dark psychological fiction. Recommended.

It certainly had enough praise from various sources in the book itself.And the latter … well, the author did take her time getting there.

Despite having a perfectly nice life on paper, the protagonist, Elyria (a very appropriate name for this sort of book) stops being able to cope and flees to New Zealand. She doesn’t do much on either side of the ocean, but sort of lets life dictate her every step, for she confesses she is unable to say no when things are offered to her. Elyria isn’t much of a protagonist; her main characteristics are lost and uncertain. She overthinks as much as the author overwrites. She doesn’t do much. There isn’t much of a plot. It’s more of a character study—a protracted study of a moment (a low point) in person’s life stretched out indefinitely, it seems.

The supernatural aspect of the novel was so disappointing. It was almost like the author just couldn’t commit to it one way or another. Is Simon hallucinating, and if so, what explains his injuries?C.	The central mystery’s resolution was kind of underwhelming. And Simon seemed surprisingly forgiving of certain perpetrators because why? because they shared a sexuality? seriously?Having that been said, it was still a very entertaining read.

Still way too much of a formula to truly wow, but entertaining and compelling enough to keep the pages turning.I can’t say that I particularly cared about any of the characters (and that just isn’t how you spell the name Chelsea) but the suspense aspect was nicely done and well maintained, as were all the twists and turns toward the end. Like just about every single thriller of this kind out there, the book featured the right i.e. overwhelming amount of estrogen and girl power messaging with just enough token diversity thrown in. Like most YA authors turning to adult fiction, the book featured a lot of teenage and young characters written stronger and more credibly than the adults.

The previous four have all been solid four stars, and this one got dangerously close to going all the way, but a few logistical snafus in the end kept it at four.Still impressive. A most impressive solid performance in a genre so overpopulated by trite clichés that I’ve all but given up reading it. I make exceptions for Steadman. Totally worth it.Behind the prismatic cover of this book lies a tale of deceptions centered around an unexpected inheritance and a particularly tricked out basement. It’s impossible to tell how much is too much in discussing the plot here, and so to avoid giving anything away, let’s just say this is a novel of extreme survival and leave it at that.Steadman got a knack for detail which usually hampers (and needlessly bulks up) these sorts of thrillers, but in her work comes across seamlessly and, at times, literary. It is also commendable that she chose to do something different from the usual (missing child - driven mother, spouse with secrets, friends with a decades old secrets reunite, etc.) genre presets. And she gets the suspense just right, keeping you turning pages. It was the ending that left a lot to be desired here. From the neatness of the bow with which it was all tired up to some questionable logistics. Nevertheless, the book is very entertaining and very much worth a read.Please stop now if you haven’t read the novel. I’d like to discuss those logistical snafus without accusations of giving too much away. Okay? Okay, thanks.So, our presumably very intelligent protagonist doesn’t do a lot of work verifying her mysterious inheritance before jutting off to the remote island, does she?But more importantly, her allegedly brilliant and lovely father has no qualms designing a place clearly meant for nefarious purposes. Moreso, he seems more or less okay with it so long as it doesn’t affect his daughter. Moreso, he in fact suspects it may affect his daughter (this is during Lucinda’s visit) but nevertheless does nothing—NOTHING—to warn his daughter about this possibility or prepare her in any way, BUT he does rely on Lucinda’s good graces and kindness enough to ask her to avoid involving his daughter. In other words, he’d rather depend on someone with a proven track of evil deeds than simply warn his beloved only daughter. Interesting. And finally, why would a witness protection program relocate British citizens to the smaller towns, US? Isn’t the entire point of it to make people disappear? How’s putting a foreign national in a staunchly monolingual, socially conservative south of the country generally bewildered by accents going to help them blend in?

All of his books have been good, some more than others, The Great Man Theory was my favorite until this one came along, and well … it’s a winner!Wayne specializes in portraits of men, usually young (though not in TGMT), as they take on the American Dream. But Wayne had never his taken his protagonists quiet as far as he had Conor O’Toole, the twenty-five-year-old tennis coach who comes up from his native Yonkers to spend the summer with the glamorous moneyed population of a seaside community. Conor O’Toole is an all-American sweetheart of a young man, a real bootstrapper, diligent and indefatigable, he pulls and pulls himself up to make something of himself. Learning tennis gave him the opportunity to attend college on a scholarship, propelling him toward his dream of becoming a lawyer. Conor is a principled studious young man, a devoted son, drop-dead gorgeous to boot. Sure, he may not be the most emotionally available of men, but that doesn’t stop women from throwing themselves at him.All Conor wanted out of this summer was to make some money teaching tennis while he studies for the bar. The summer had other plans for him. The more he gets involved with the locals, the more he finds himself entangled in a love triangle so messy, it’s obvious it isn’t going to end nicely. But you may not expect just how “not nicely” it will end. Against the backdrop of simmering privilege and entitlement, Conor O’Toole will unravel in the most spectacular manner.There are some parallels that can be drawn here to Caroline Kepnes’ You (especially the season 4 of the TV adaptation which technically had almost nothing to do with Kepnes’ original vision, diverting wildly and smartly from the dud of the last book), but The Winner is fundamentally very much its own beast. Like some darkly twisted version of Gatsby, it has a classic feel to it. It’s also immensely readable and tough to put down, like snack food with all the quality and nutrition of a proper meal.It’s so well written with such interesting, nuanced characters, and the way Wayne handles the mounting dread and that good ole’ walls-closing-in feeling is a thing of beauty.So yeah, a winner all around.

With the notable exception of The Drift, all of her books have been five-star reads for me. And this one followed the trend very nicely.Mind you, I don’t even like vampire fiction. Actually, that alone probably speaks volumes to how good this book is—someone who doesn’t care for vampires loved it. Of course, Tudor does something new and exciting with vampires, setting aside the cobwebbed clichés, and making it all very … real. Wherein vampire fiction always relies on overdone gaudy excess and shabby chic glamour, the vampyrs of Tudor’s imagination are second class citizens, barely surviving on government allotted reservations. You can draw your own sociopolitical parallels there. Tudor might be British, but she’s got America’s number down.Needless to say, in this reality, vampyrs and people do not get along. There are … situations. Occasionally, those escalate into something a lot more severe. But to call a cull on the entire colony requires a proper investigation. And the man protagonist if the novel does just that when she is requested on the case in the tiny remote Alaskan town. With the assistance of the long-retired-but-dusted-off-and-out-into-action local sheriff, she will navigate the mounting agitation between the two sides of the conflict, trying desperately to avoid the bloodshed.That’s the basic story, and Tudor did everything right with it. She brought both her characters and her setting to life vividly. The suspense was taut throughout. The murder mystery woven into the plot was clever and threw in some last-minute plot surprises. Barbara, the lead, was compelling and engaging. Ditto for the side characters. This was a book I didn’t want to put down. Be sure to visit the perfectly named Deadhart, Alaska.

Naturally, I was excited to see a new novella of his available on Netgalley and requested it right away. Read it almost right away too, though ideally it should have been saved for right around Christmas time.So, then, remember that now old music video by Our Lady Peace where someone wakes up to find themselves the only person around? Everywhere they go, everything they do … there’s no one. All the places remain, and all the people are gone. Well, it’s kind of like that. But in a novella form. And with a moral, because after all, it is a Christmas story.But what lifts it above average such fare is Smith’s talent for detail. In this case, a particularly creepy detail of people stuck midway through their actions, stuck in their tracks. That is such a haunting image/metaphor, and Smith nails it, making an almost cozy read into something considerably more unsettling. Still, it’s cozy enough for Christmas. And an entertaining quick read for any season.

And yet, this novel about comics and their material manages to be both not particularly funny and not all that substantial somehow.It takes place over the course of a single day as a bunch of young people inexplicably convinced that being funny can be taught and their teachers who don’t seem convinced much of anything except that life slaps you around more and more the older you get muddle through their interactions and seemingly endless inner monologues.It’s a very internal sort of book (through rather readable, irrespective of the density it gives its narrative), so you get to spend a lot of time inside the characters’ minds. Which would be fine and dandy, had they been more likeable or interesting. And yet somehow despite their various crushes and conflicts and all, whether it’s a seasoned comic who got into hot waters for sleeping around with women thirty years his junior and casually proposing marriage or a comic just starting out who does everything right but doesn’t have much to say, it’s all just … tepid.The novel is objectively well written and occasionally mildly humorous, but it’s heavier than the story merits and not as engaging or exciting as you might have hoped for.

Most auspicious not just for a debut but for any novel, for any author.The novel takes place in 1961 Dutch province, middle of nowhere, where the protagonist, Isabel, lives alone in a house too large for one person and a life too small for any one person. Yet she hangs on to it tenaciously for it is all she has and all she knows. With nothing but her two brothers for occasional visits, an uncle nearby, and a maid for assistance, Isabel passes her days, all the same versions of the same day, until she meets Eva, the girlfriend her brother brings by and leaves behind.Isabel hates everything about Eva, but she cannot look away from her. Now that her life has been disrupted, now that her peace of mind has been taken away from her, what will she find instead … in a woman who is as different from her as different can be?Soon things begin to go missing, the claustrophobic confines of the place crank up the suspense, an obsession spirals out of control.And then the novel slips into the past, a brief but crucial journey, to turn everything you know about it around. And it’s all so beautifully clever that you just want to stand up and applaud. And it gives the story and its characters some terrific dimensionality that you immediately know the ending you want, the ending they need.So yes, the plotting is very clever, but the writing … it stands to mention just how stunning the writing is. Evocative, vivid, profoundly engaging, this is the book you’ll read with all your senses, a heartbreaking, mind whirling story you won’t want to put down. The relationship between the two main characters, the halting, unfinished sentences, the tentative reach, the silences, and all that hides and can be found in ellipses … it’s a thing of beauty. It’s also might be one of the most sensual, sexy books I’ve ever read.All in all, a gorgeous book. The sort of thing that rekindles one’s faith in written word. I absolutely loved it. Recommended.

And I’m definitely going to use the world book instead of a novel, because it certainly wasn’t much of a novel in a conventional sense. For that matter, it wasn’t much of a book either. More of a hallucinatory stream of consciousness rant stretched out over 256 pages.If there was a plot in there, it was thoroughly buried under the overwhelmingly overstylized, impenetrably dense prose. If anything, this read like a writing exercise that went on for too long. Or perhaps a joke or an experiment, as in “see what can get published these days.” This isn’t to say the writer isn’t talented, because there was some interring imagery in these pages, even a nice turn of phrase now and again. But again, mostly buried under there. Under all those precious stylings.I’m not saying all novels must follow convention. Not at all. But this was too far on the other side of it. Not just a 180 but a complete obliteration of the rubric. And there’s probably an audience out there for this sort of thing. This is just one reader’s opinion. For me, it was a complete waste of time. Though I did manage to more or less speed read through it in one sitting.

To which all I can say is, “Read more.”But leaving aside the fact that Malerman himself hasn’t produced a really good book in a minute, let’s focus on Jeffry and his novel. First off, it stands to mention that this book and the small press that published it, DarkLit, are both something of a huge deal in the indie community. And, because the indie genre community has such tragically low standards, it’s easy to see how a novel that strives to be literary and a press that puts out an almost properly edited (because when you address someone using their name, there’s usually a comma i.e. “Slow going, Ross.” not “Slow going Ross.” as the editor here seems to think) with solid formatting and cover that’s already a huge win.Objectively speaking, Jeffry’s writing is on a higher level than most indie authors out there. It’s the plotting and pacing that needs work. This novel drags like no novel, and certainly no novel of 300 pages, should. Torpid slog with obscenely protracted ending.Mind you, you probably should expect a particularly dynamic read about grief, but not this either.Basic plot revolves around a couple who just had a stillborn child. They are grieving. They bring their daughter’s ashes to a small seaside town to throw them in the sea. But lo and behold, the sea throws something at them instead. And because these two are plainly too daft to know their mythology, they totally take in a weird child with a famous sea monster name. To no one’s surprise, it doesn’t work out. Cue in the drama, cue in the slaughter. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Not overly original, not particularly good. Just decent enough. Strongly reminiscent of Clay Chapman’s latest, What Kind of Mother. Chapman is by far a superior author, and WKoM is his least good book. So this is like an inferior version of a good genre author’s lesser work. Something like that. Readable, sure. But this reader didn’t find it worth their time.

This novella of a torrid love affair between two women had somehow made it. Something about it struck the chord with the general audience and a slew of celebs of screen and written word as the many pages of praise preceding the story AND the numerous quoted letters to the author in the afterword attest so loudly to.Apparently, people found this sort of story relatable, be it their coming out book or what. It boasts a sort of beyond-queer appeal. Outside of all the noise, if you just take the story as is, it’s an easy one-sit read about a woman in her twenties who moves to NYC and begins an affair with a butch nineteen years her senior. The butch is in a ten-year relationship with a woman, but this is the first lesbian affair for the younger one. Cue in drama, heavy heavy drama. Bucketloads of drama. In some ways exactly the sort of drama ugly clichés about lesbian relationships might be talking about. Unnecessary, ludicrous, overbrlown drama.And yet, something about this tiny book—the confusion of it all, likely, of figuring out one’s sexuality and one’s needs and wants in a relationship—had really connected with the audience over the years, hence this ten-year anniversary reprint from a major publisher.Well, look at you go, tiny book. It is objectively compelling, so kudos there. Otherwise, your level of emotional engagement will depend entirely on your levels of personal confusion.

Or else, it’s just her own weird preference. But inexplicably, for a writer who is so immensely talented and so good at producing terrific supernatural and otherwise thrillers, every so often she feels the need to put out crap like The Beautiful Ones or The Return of the Sorceress or The Lover or now this.Maybe she is trying to branch out or prove to herself and the world she can do other genres. Sure, that’s admirable. But it also seems like a monumental waste of talent, especially talent that has a very specific genre lean.And yes, this is also from a er who dislikes fantasy and romance as genres, so take that under consideration. There might be some people out there who only know the author through her romance work. Pity that, but to each their own.Anyway, onto this book: The Seven Veils of Salome is a book I would have never picked up without Moreno-Garcia’s name on it. The laughably cheesy bodice ripper cover alone would have put me off. But it did have her name on it, and I do very much love books about movies, so I read it.And here’s the thing: yes, the book by and large lives up to the cheesiness of its cover—it’s all about young love, past and present. It’s a romance, but a kitchen sink of one, because the author took a rather manic, let’s-see-how-many-perspectives-we-can-cram-in-here approach. There’s no need for this—this isn’t World War Z—but it’s there anyway. When it reality there ought to be only three POVs. One of them is that of Salome. Because Moreno-Garcia is ambitious enough to cram deeply historical fiction into an already historical fiction. So not only do you get to spend time on movie sets in 1950s but also in palaces of antiquity.It’s all very, very girly with strong vibes of women’s lit. But then there’s the undeniable fact that Moreno-Garcia is good enough of a writer to even make that work and be compelling enough. So the book ends up being a perfectly readable if frustrating mess. Books about movies are all the rage now. The weird thing is that the author just put out a novel about a movie. And Silver Nitrate is an amazing novel. This is like doubling down to show that she can write about movies for everyone. And I suppose she can, the question is more along the lines of, should she?Either way, it’s entertaining and certainly much more intelligent than that terrible cover suggests. Now, with that nonsense out of the way, hopefully, the author can return to form.

But here’s the thing I kept hearing about and seeing Durgin’s name on FB touted as the new hot thing in indie horror, so I figured I’ll check it out. But here’s the thing with the FB horror scene—it’s a very tight, very friendly, very supportive community … that doesn’t seem to care all that much about quality. Most books sell on the force of personality and likeability of the author. It’s a popularity contest … like most things on social media. And, as with most things, mediocre things do well. Sad, sad truth. One my reading experience confirms over and over again.And this book of Durgin’s was mediocre at best. Sort of like Rapunzel redone as a horror story about a witch. Cardboard characters, cardboard writing, and dialogue so flat that some of it would make AI chatbox seem versatile and lively.There’s nothing wrong with the book technically in that the author gets the concept of plot, characters, actions, etc. One sentence goes into another, it’s all perfectly readable. But there’s nothing more to it. No ingenuity, no cleverness, and not much heart either. It’s all very, very basic.If unchallenging, bland, forgettable horror tales are your jam, by all means go for it. Or maybe you’re really into witches … same. Otherwise, I really don’t think this one offers much.Somehow, according to the afterword, this was somehow inspired by a Neil Gaiman masterclass, which I suppose just goes to show you that some things you cannot learn. Gaiman for all his faults is a wonderful, natural storyteller who can make a sentence sing and a story dance. Durgin, not so much. I’m sure it won’t stop him from becoming a well-known genre name or this book from selling like hotcakes. This reader found it a waste of time.

This book was in many ways just as good as her other work, but to be fair, I did round up the rating here, because it did leave something to be desired. It’s just difficult to put a finger on what that something was.This is, as the title suggests, a novel about a ship. A ship made famous by wrecking and the horrific events that followed. The story is told in dual narratives by two kid protagonists: in 1629, a young girl is on the way to meet her father in Batavia (modern-day Jakarta) when she becomes a witness to the terrible fates that befall the survivors of the shipwreck. In 1989, a young boy, traumatized by his mother’s death, accompanies his grandfather on the dig to uncover the remains of the shipwreck.And so it goes, two young lives paralleling each other in tragedy. Though each narrative starts of as an adventure before it becomes a tragedy. And then of course, there is the absolutely nightmarish events that follow the shipwreck with some of the crew going wild with mayhem and murder.It’s a rather long novel, though it doesn’t read particularly long. As I said, I’m not entirely sure why the narrative didn’t engage me quite as much as some of Kidd’s other work. Though I love historical fiction and nonfiction, have never heard of this story, and was interested to learn about it, there’s a strong chance I would have been much more impressed had she made up the story instead of uncovering it through research. It’s about the power of imagination competing with the power of creative re-creation. Either way, it was a good read. Greatness is more of a subjective matter.

I just don’t know what the point of them is anymore. It once left off on a bitter note, then took years to regroup and come back, and I’ve not been able to ascertain why besides the obvious reason: commercial. And maybe it’s because I don’t like soap operas. I really don’t: Saga is the only one I ever did. Or because I don’t like serials: I don’t, with few minor exceptions here and there. I understand the concept of getting emotionally involved with characters over the years and the appeal of being able to follow their trajectory (seemingly indefinitely), but there doesn’t seem to be much point to it, plus, honestly, it just seems kind of lazy of the creators. And the creators here are so talented: a great storyteller and an amazing artist. They can do whatever they like, instead of spinning the same yarn over and over again into inevitable nothingness. It’s lazy of readers too, to stick with the same story, instead of finding more. There’s more art, skill, originality, and creativity in standalones. And yet, it goes on. Even I’m guilty of it, reading yet another volume of Saga. Because it’s quick and pretty and I do like the characters. And it is comforting to know what to expect. Let’s face it: Saga has thus far only shocked us once. It wasn’t nice. It did disservice to the series. And now it’s all the same, over and over again. A pretty, commercial vehicle, working the formula, hugging the curve tightly, never to return to its former greatness.And yet, for all that, a fun read.This and more at https://advancetheplot.weebly.com/...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,"Dec 28, 2023","Dec 28, 2023","Jan 02, 2024",,ebook,view (with text),/book/show/29237226-saga-volume-11

Let’s go.Wordhunter is a gimmick thriller. Which is to say that instead of focusing on he said/she said, one-of-the-spouses-did-it, past-secrets-resurfaced sort of thing, it concentrates instead of a quirky protagonist solving a present-day mystery.The quick usually works, just look at all the undeserved praise Prose’s The Maid received. And the quirk here is that the protagonist is obsessed with words. That was the main draw for me with this book.I love words. I spend most of my life with words. Albeit on a wildly different level from the protagonist, who diagrams them, catalogues them, analyzes them, and tatooes them on her skin.I don’t think I realized how young of a protagonist this was, going into the book. She’s only twenty-one. Academically smart, very smart. Life-wise, not so much.But hey, she may be the brightest young woman in Florida, the smartest white trash Floridian there is.Florida of this novel is presented lusciously in all its trashy splendor, and for all her criticism of it, our protagonist is firmly a Floridian: a chain-smoking, Bud-drinking, motorcycle riding, junk eating (and junk taking), hard-living, potty-mouthed waitress … who also happens to be brilliant linguist, studying for her Master’s.Basically, Liz Salander, Florida-edition.But hey, someone’s gotta help out the local police to find missing girls. And so here she is.Sands has made a career of true crime writing, before turning to fiction. And as far as fictional thrillers go, this is pretty solid for what it is, squarely hitting genre marks on trends and clichés, although it does handle certain trigger/trend aspects of the plot rather oddly. This includes rape and pedos. The latter apparently gets no more than a frown and doesn't even so much as dissuade the association with the person, but hey, maybe that's the Florida way.The word gimmick is neat. The book and its protagonist are obviously set up for serializing. The one thing to elevate it from the million other similar books is that is has a decency to be short in the genre that seems to love dragging itself out. So you get a lean, reasonably entertaining story that’s a quick and easy read. Nothing special, but perfectly decent.

But then I’ve been a fan of Lebbon for a long time and was curious what he’d been up to. Apparently, this climate disaster of a novel. Which objectively isn’t a disaster of a novel, but it does leave a lot to be desired.Outside of occasional odd word repetition (which should have been dealt with in editorial), Lebbon is actually a very good writer. It’s what attracted me to his books in the first place. Literary, in my books, is the best horror, and Lebbon goes for literary. Character driven, well described, all that.What’s missing here is on the plot side of things. Droughts had turned a significant swatch of North America into a desert. It could use some rain. And, conveniently enough, the is a Rainmaker available. Only he doesn’t do that anymore and has done all he could to stop his daughter, who intertied his gift, from doing it too.As it turns out, when one makes the rain, they bring down more than just water. No idea why. None is this is really explained. The Rainmaking thing isn’t really explained either.The author chose to focus on the actual play-by-play of the chase (two chases, technically) that’s at the heart of this novel. It unravels in almost real time from multiple perspectives in minute detail.Lebon is good on detail, but at some point it becomes glaringly obvious that the entire novel is just people driving and shooting in the desert. It overrides everything, even the characters. Not to mention, the multiple perspective thing is drastically overdone with a dizzying amount of switches. People, tenses, etc. It’s way too much.It’s almost like there’s all this descriptive writing and narrative trickery to distract you from how thin the plot actually is.So, overall, it reads easily and quickly and is technically accomplished, but doesn’t really engage. I was trying to figure out what to rate it and decided to generously round it up. But this was likely one of my least favorite Lebbon books.

I don’t know if everyone will love this novel simply because its protagonist is such an unlovable one.

She survives on disability payments and charity of others around her, people whose charity she does nothing to deserve or engender. She can be, in fact, unapologetically nasty in an almost refreshing sort of way.When her past rears its ugly face, she is forced to confront the demons of her past. That is the arc of what otherwise is a rather straight-forward character study. It isn’t one of those cathartic confrontations either, in keeping with the narrative.

There is no such thing as private anymore. Certainly not for artists who make a career out of their personality and personal experiences.And sure, whatever. If people want to share, they can. They will, no matter what. Our culture is the culture of oversharing. And it is terrible that the author received threats like that, please don’t think I’m diminishing that experience in any way. It should be mentioned and addressed.But what may be a post or series of posts (or an essay, perhaps) doesn’t make a book. There is in theory plenty of material here to make a book: exploring the culture of online trolling, perhaps, of exigencies of fame, etc. but this book doesn’t really do that. It opts for personal/emotional journey, which is fine and valid, but it doesn’t offer much substance. And books, old-fashioned as this perspective may be, ought to have substance.At any rate, it was a very quick read....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,"Dec 04, 2023","Dec 04, 2023","Dec 05, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/54560209-death-threat

Burn the Negative is fun. It’s fun in that popcorn, slasher way. Very dynamic, it reads like a movie. The author, much like his protagonist, has spent plenty of time reporting on genre movies, and it shows. The book is a thoroughly enjoyable ride loaded with movie references to nerd out over as we follow the story of a former child star who returns to LA after three decades away to cover the remake of the movie that ended it all for her (and so many others), only to find out that the nightmare she thought she left behind is still there, waiting for her., impatiently and deadly.Cue in the bodies and suspense and slapped-together investigation as she follows the trail of movie stub crumbs back to the source.Yeah, the ending was a bit of a cheat for conventional slasher fans, but the book was overall too entertaining to fault it on details.

I don’t think I’ve ever read a book by a Cameroon-born author or one set in Cameroon, so when then book came up on Netgalley, it piqued my interest. There was also that cleverly tear-blurred cover.Anyway, unsurprisingly Cameroon turns out to be a nightmarish destination, even from the remove that reading affords. War-torn, divided between Anglophones and francophones, Christians and Muslims, and with positively medieval attitudes toward women and sexuality. In other words, not a great place to be a lesbian. More like one of the worst places in the world, actually.But one doesn’t get to choose where they are born, they just sort of learn to make the best of it. Especially, the novel’s protagonist, Bessem, who actively opts to stay in Cameroon despite possibility of obtaining political asylum in Canada or UK. The main reason she chooses to stay is because her soul is permanently anchored in Cameroon by a long-lost love, Fatima.It’s been well over a decade since they first met and had one of those passionate young love affairs one seldom if ever truly recovers from. They were as different as different can be, the Anglophone Christian Bessem and the Francophone Muslim Fatima. Bessem came from a well-to-do family, looked femme (timid and mild), and was popular with male suitors. Fatima was from a struggling family, presenting gay and brash enough to live her truth at all costs. And the costs were high indeed, especially since her own older brother was the one determined to “fix” her with punishments that rivaled each other in their brutality.Nevertheless, like true star-crossed lovers, Bessem and Fatima couldn’t stay away from each other, They made plans to be together forever and then Fatima disappeared. It locked Bessem emotionally for years to come. Years spent trying to find out what happened and writing tear-stained letters she had no way of sending. This is the story of her finally finding out the truth.You’d have to be rather unreasonably optimistic to expect a happy story from a novel about being gay in Cameroon with a title like that. It’s a heartrending, devastating, emotional gut-punch of a story. The language is rather simplistic at times, and the book could have used a bit more editorial tightening, but overall, it resonates. And serves as a sobering reminder of what life is like in some corners of the world.

I’ve probably said this before but … What that man doesn’t know about geography is likely not worth knowing. Which is to say, Marshall knows a LOT about geography and has written plenty about it. So much so that he might have exhausted terrestrial matters, because in this book he takes to the skies. Space being the final frontier, it’s a natural progression. People have spent centuries disputing and fighting over areas of Earth and eventually, they will take their squabbling into space. As technology progresses and more money is being poured into research and development, governments and private companies are looking to increase their presence in the outer space. The current laws governing these matters and vague and outdated, so it can be either a free-for-all or yet another source of contention, but nation after nation, people are reaching for the stars, whether for scientific, political, or purely pecuniary reasons. Okay, let’s be honest, it’s mostly the latter. From space retreats to tourism to exploiting other planets for their resources, people want to monetize space. It’s in the language itself, when the conversation turns to colonizing space. I mean, words like colony colonialism, colonization don’t particularly carry a lot of positive associations. Yet, it’s an inextricable part of the past that echoes into the present, and one day will likely feature in the future.The question is who gets there first and how. And that’s what this book is about, basically. And Tim Marshall does a terrific job of walking you through the current situation from contextualizing it through the past examples to playing out possible space war scenarios. Marshall writing style is intelligent, erudite, and rather funny, resulting in a nonfiction book that’s as engaging as any work of fiction, but smarter than most. It educates while entertaining and makes you look up to the sky with wonder from a more informed perspective.A great read. Recommended.

That has never stopped anyone from spinning a good yarn. Or in this case an average yarn but loaded with enough pirate pizazz to make you overlook its shortcomings. Almost.I am being too critical? I don’t want to be. I LOVE pirate stories. And female pirates are a delightful rarity I’d read about any day.But then as an author and a reader, I am rather fond of well written books, and it is impossible not to notice that this one could have used some more …well, at least editing. It stands to mention here that I read a Netgalley ARC, so it may not be the final version, but then again Simon and Schuster usually provides perfectly print-ready ARCs.I mean, this book has been edited in a sense that there are no typos and grammar snafus. But there are a lot of repetitions, sentences like so-and-so felt they could not find the words that felt right or clunkers like father’s mother’s tongue. Or usage of the word Lothario in 1655, just ever so slightly nearly 50 years before it originated (based upon a character in The Fair Penitent, a 1703 tragedy by Nicholas Rowe, if you care, since the author, editor, and publisher do not).This book had obviously taken a lot of work and research. It just needed more. Also, it’s no ballad. Not poetic, no musical accompaniment. It’s a saga or a folk tale or a legend, but it isn’t a ballad. But then, this isn’t the one for details or definitions.The thing is, it’s such a fun story. It has everything you want it a fun pirate book, all kinds of adventures. But the writing is so notably basic. Short simple sentences, nothing to dazzle you.It reads like a book sold on a premise rather than style. And of course, it would sell: this book and its author check every minority representational box there is. I mean, it probably sold just based on “gay pirates.” For those who did not get enough with “Our Flag Means Death”, this is a real treat.Except, OFMD is cleverer, funnier, and has Taika Waititi. This novel has a very young, very tough (almost unbelievably so) protagonist who gets a LOT done in a very (almost unbelievably so) short time. Also, just so we’re clear: I’m all about representation in fiction. I love it. I think there should be more of it. Definitely more gay pirates of all races. I am absolutely all for it. I’m just saying one shouldn’t be so dazzled by it as to overlook mediocre writing.Mind you, it is still fun. Oodles of fun. While dramatic scenes are a mixed bag, the action ones are great. It’s all wham, bam, kill it, ma’am. So overall, the book is very entertaining. Someone should probably go make a movie out of it right now. It’ll probably make the story even less realistic and who knows what that writing will be like, but hey … pirates! We may never know if Jacquotte Delahaye existed. But you kind of wish she did, don’t you? And now that there’s an entire book imagining her into existence … well, that’s sort of like a life, isn’t it? Books are magical like that.

It took me a moment to get into it, but once I did, I struggled to put it down. It’s a hefty volume, but then again, no one’s ever said the future would be light.In fact, in Alderman’s vision, it is quite dark, basically apocalyptic. And the three mega-moguls who more or less own the world, do nothing to improve it, but are quite interested in saving their own skins and surviving no matter what. While those closest to them have a very different idea about …well, the future.And so it goes. The epic power struggle. Who will win, morals or money? Read the book and find out.Here’s the thing with this novel for me: it read long but amazingly well. One of the best books I’ve read all year, easily. Stupendously clever. Alderman is definitely carving out a niche for herself in science fiction/dystopian genre, first with the power and now this. I love clever books. There are enough dumb ones out there to make you appreciate it. Alderman has terrific ideas, and her writing is superb. The worlds she writes come to life three-dimensionally and stunningly.But then, after the book is done there’s some distance/perspective, you realize that the grand concept here is actually rather simplistic or at least reductive. It casts the general population as wildly dumb/gullible/malleable/manipulatable/etc. which …well, isn’t far from the truth. But the novel’s solution for it is … kind of basic. And the timeline for it isn’t all that realistic either. It seems that for a novel so very clever with details and logic and rhetoric, it would come up with something a bit more sophisticated then “tweak the algorithm, tweak the people, save the world” sort of thing. And Alderman actually seems aware of it in the end, going by the very last chapter. It’s like a dark pessimistic/realistic cheery on top of a hugely optimistic, pro-environmental, pro-world message.But the thing is, you are not really aware of any of that while you’re in the novel (and what you do notice, you don’t much mind), and that’s purely because of Alderman’s skill as a writer. So it is an enormously engaging, enjoyable reading experience. Albeit one with arguable logistics. As opposed to The Power, which was sense through and through. Either way, recommended.

From what can be readily found online, Like her protagonist, L, Vanessa is an Asian-American native New Yorker with liberal arts education and years and years of experience writing for women magazines covering fashion, beauty, etc. I mean, when you slice that close to the skin, why not just write a memoir? Those are all the rage these days.But then so are these “serious” women fiction novels that tackle (or attempt to) all the serious modern topics: race, sexuality, fairness, career choices, love choices, etc.[So the author here chose to go with the fictional direction, resulting in the fashion writer writing about a fashion writer, who (wouldn’t you know it!) writes a novel about a fashion writer. META? You bet. In its own way.But here’s the thing: Lawrence can actually write. In fact, she can write so engagingly that she’ll almost make you forget about the shortcomings of the story she is writing. ALMOST.But then when you step away for a moment, you realize that what you’re reading is a story about someone who has actively chosen to pursue a very superficial and vapid career (and to an extent lifestyle) desperately struggling to justify her choices (mostly to herself) while striving for some imaginary/projected profundity. In other words, it’s kind of a joke. L is kind of a joke.She thinks herself superior to all the social media celebs and NYC pretty darlings she has to cover when in fact they all worship at the same superficial altar, and she merely has less money/popularity. Tragically, L isn’t even as clever as she thinks. She spends nearly the entirety of the novel obsessed with a beauty mogul named B who basically gives her canned career advice via text. The rest of the time, L obsesses over herself, navel-gazing exhaustively into her life choices, and meditating (also exhaustively) on the significance of her race/gender/sexuality as it informs those choices.In other words, L wallows. L is a wallower. Not the most dynamic or engaging characteristic in a protagonist.But yeah, you can easily see how this book sold. It has all the right buzzwords. It’s practically tailor-made for the modern generation. At least with Lawrence, she did use what she knows. But anyone else could just Google “what sells a novel these days” and come up with the same list used in this book.And that’s all fine. Sure, let’s discuss heavy topics. But can we wrap it in a stronger novel, something more than a walking talking cliché that seems straight out of those movies and TV shows L mocks in the book? Can we lower the estrogen levels so that it remains literature without veering into women’s fiction or, worse yet, chicklit? Can we level things out without the laughably hyperbolic declarative nonsense of the opening scene? Can we actually make the characters diverse and original without making them seem like cardboard cutouts someone decorated as diverse and original? Because buzzwords can only take a novel so far, it seems. Anyway, it’s readable. It’s all very readable. So much so it makes you wonder what it would have been like if the quality of plotting matched the quality of writing.

Three very different characters from different levels find themselves coming together to investigate what initially seems as a breach and turns out to be so much more. Dystopia weaves around mythology to potentially forge a new path for a world that has lost its way. You may call them dreamers, but they are not the only ones. For what is the world but a dream collectively agreed upon. And what worth does that agreement hold if it cannot be revisited and rewritten when change arises and new perspectives are offered.A striking, dare I say, poetic worldbuilding takes this book a long way. But then it is also exciting, character driven, and compelling in the way that’ll have you turning page after page toward its resolution.A thoroughly enjoyable read. Recommended.

It’s as fascinating as it is dizzying, but ultimately rather exciting.Much like its predecessor, this is essentially a murder mystery, albeit one of the highest literary order and one wrapped in science.One might argue that it is rather wrapped in science, but for me it was a plus. I’m tired of formulaic mystery thrillers that populate the market these days, and it’s a pleasure to see someone deviate from formula. Especially when that someone has the chops to do it, as Nova Jacobs clearly does.The setting is the character here in a huge way. It was definitely what attracted me to the story. Switzerland, Geneva, CERN laboratory. And a writer of Jacobs’s skill brings it all to life with transporting vividness.Much like its predecessor,. the story took a while to get going. It’s dense, heavily scientific. You have to appreciate those thing,. or you won’t care about it. If you do, though, it’s an excellent puzzle of a tale that’ll surprise you until the very end.Beautifully written, character driven, and (yes, I’ll say it again because not enough books are these days) so clever, this was an enjoyable read. Not the lightest or the easiest and somewhat slow, but ultimately rewarding, this novel takes you to a different place and makes you reconsider everyday things through a different lens.

Make no mistake, this is a YA novel, albeit perhaps for more macabre leaning young adults. And not just because the main protagonists are teenagers—there is absolutely a way to write adult fiction with teenage characters. This author just doesn’t have the chops for it. Instead he throws buckets of blood and guts and sex into the narrative to try and give it an edge. Which may work for the less demanding audience (and horror readers by and large tend to be VERY forgiving and very undemanding as far as quality goes), but no one with discerning taste will be distracted from how (YA) immature the narrative is.The plot is a cliché, too. A kid in the band looking for fame sell his soul to the devil for it. That’s it. Nothing extra, really. Not a glimmer of originality. The very beginning the and the very end showed some promise but nothing in between the two did.The writing is … serviceable. As in, it moves from one plain sentence to the next.

So when this one, his latest, showed up on Netgalley, I grabbed it. And read it and read it and read it some more. It took days to get through, and I really did try to like it, but in the end, it just wasn’t fork me.I’d like to think I’m aware enough and objective enough of a reader/er to be able to tell when the book is a dud or when it just isn’t my thing.

The story is smart and original, something that’s difficult to find in modern clichéd mystery thrillers. The fan of dystopian fiction in me was delighted by the setting. The fan of character-driven sci-fin in me appreciated the meditation on life and intelligence, organic and artificial, and the value of it—a theme tightly interwoven throughout the narrative. As a reader and a writer, I appreciated the language.But then there were the unignorable facts that I didn’t much care for any of the characters and found the plot, especially the murder mystery itself, to be excessively, exhaustively convoluted. That made the novel drag for me and it the end, outweighed the pluses. I’m uprating it some for the cleverness. User mileage may (and I’m sure, will) vary.

The multi-talented, semi-incestuous group of creatives gathering at Villa Diodati and daring themselves to outspook each other. So, in revisiting that alone, this book wouldn’t have much to offer. Accordingly, it does the smart thing and backpedals into Mary Shelley—then Mary Godwin’s—past to split the narrative and tell of a wildly intense friendship/romance Mary had with a tempestuous Isabella, while she went to stay with her family. There, amid that doomed connection, the readers shall discover the trace origins of Mary’s famous monster that later came to define her.Of course, we pretty much know how Mary and Isabell’s story ends, because most of her life and 50% of the book Mary spends madly in love with Percy, her elfin, questionably faithful poet. So yey Mary, no type, quick rebound. Aside from that, there’s the potentially difficult thing for modern audience in such vivid depictions of teenage sexuality. Because, of course, modern audience prefers to judge literature the past from its own woke soapbox rather than contextualize it. But yes, reader beware, Mary is 14 and 15 in about 50% of the book and only four years older in the rest of it. And to contextualize that, yes, she fell in love with Percy when he was 21 and she was 16 and got pregnant soon after with their first child. And yes, being so very young did not stop her from writing a masterpiece. Some people just start early.Anyway, that’s basically the plot. The star of this show is arguably the writing itself. It leans toward poeticism, but it is rather lovely and does a great job of drawing the reader in. What is more impressive is that the book is translated from Dutch into English, so kudos to both the writer and the translator. All in all, an interesting read, particularly for Shelley’s fans.

Sometimes it doesn’t. The Threat has more than a cute cover. The description makes it sound like an amusing satire. And it is, to be fair, for a while, before it gets tedious and stays tedious. The plot revolves around Melvin Levin, a thoroughly mediocre man who spends most of his life being as decent and inoffensive as possible. It hasn’t brought him much outside of a thankless job and a challenging-at-best apartment situation. Nevertheless, Levin perseveres … until he gets the eponymous threat. The threat, much like Levin as the protagonist, leaves a lot to be desired. It’s half-baked at most. But to Levin, it is by far the most exciting thing to have happened to him in pretty much ever, and thus he steadily proceeds to change his unexciting life into the life of someone existing under the threat of death. This essentially involves a lot of performative behavior, so the readers end up spending the entire novel in Levin’s mind as he convolutes himself to be more interesting. But the thing is, he can only get so far with all of that—he is literally written that way, with a lot of limitations.What’s curious is that there are a some genuinely clever and amusing things about this novel, but they fail to add up to a cohesive quality narrative. Instead, the novel reads like a cute but very much one note joke stretched out into nearly 200 pages, right down to the overwhelmingly underwhelming ending.It seems that the author tried with this debut to go for European existentialism and fell short. So at least he had the decency to make the overall production short. It reads quickly, too, though a difficult one to recommend.

You know what kind of novel this is. You know the genre. The place is definitely there if you look for it. The clock tower is definitely evil. But wait, there’s more. There’s an entire town and a very creepy mayor that’s dedicated to …arts, of all things. Yeah, creeps like the finer things in life. You can say it nourishes them. In a disturbingly literal sort of way.The novel opens in a rather clichéd fashion, with two girls/young women driving out of their way to the eponymous place for an art festival and a boy and stepping into some local-flavored cosmic doodoo. Not a particularly impressive beginning at all, even the language is like “towering clock tower.”But then the novel pivots very nicely. First off, it brings some adults in. Now the leads are the parents” the mother of one of the girls and the father of another. It’s been three years, and now, both of them get cryptic text messages from their daughters telling them to come find them.So, they do. They find the same creepy town, the same creepy clock tower, the same creepy mayor, and get properly embroiled in all that’s going on there.In size and mode and sheer number of characters, the novel is pretty epic. It’s very long. Too long for my taste, actually, but it reads pretty dynamically. I wasn’t particularly engaged with any of the characters, but the town intrigued me conceptually. In fact, the concept was fun enough for me to round up my rating of the book.Meyer is a competent writer with an impressive imagination, so his take on cosmic is pretty fun.

And yet, for X’s wife, it is the only thing that makes sense.In life, X was conventionally perceived as a sort of artistic genius, a multi-disciplined creative of considerably cultural significance for several decades. X was a fine artist, writer, singer/songwriter. And yet for all her outspokenness and strong opinions, she had managed to remain an enigma.After her death, a biographer attempted to resolve the puzzle of X by publishing an account of her life. X’s widow, finding that account unacceptable, sets off to write her own story.That’s the premise of the novel, and it alone would have been enough for a compelling narrative, but the author (showing off because she can, because she literally IS that good) also threw in some serious world building. Specially, she set her novel in an alternate US that had separated in two in 1945 and did not reunite until many decades later. The South had ceded and turned into the exact kind of nightmare one might expect: a backward, insular, oppressive ruinous place. The North progressed at a familiar pace.X, we learn, was born in the southern territories and managed to get out. Since then, her entire life had been about reinvention, subterfuge, and new skins worn and shed.Artistically, it made her fascinating. Personally, it made her a complicated mess. And yet, for her wife, she was … everything. A woman worth loving, a puzzle worth unraveling. So this is the journey of solving the puzzle of X. Because in the end, perhaps people are only who they are as seen by their loved ones. A mesmerizing read, albeit not an easy one. It’s stunningly written and exceptionally clever in its interweaving of real and imagined, but it’s rather dense and doesn’t have much by the way of conventionally likable characters. More than anything, it’s really interesting. And interesting is often wins over nice. For this reader, anyway. Overall, certainly worth a read and a great introduction to the new (to me) author).

If I hadn’t seen Jenning’s name on the cover, the first chapter of book three would have me thinking someone switched up the writers. The difference is that jarring.From precision-cut, detached third person perspectives—the split screen narrative shared by Villanelle and Eve evenly thus far— the novel shifts to Eve’s POV. Additionally, there are exhaustive summarizations of the plot up to now. Why? Was Jennings’ goal to make it easy to jump into the series at book three. Again, why? To sell more copies? The books are terrific and short enough to absolutely be read in their entirety and in order. None of this weird, come in as you please nonsense.But then, once you get past it, it’s still fun. More often than not, it’s still the same amazing, dynamic writing. Yes, a large portion of the novel is dedicated to depicting a spectacularly messed up relationship, but hey, the course of true love … and all that.And that’s the draw here, isn’t it? In the TV show and in the books—it’s always these two people, as different as different can be on the surface who see each other and recognize their impossible yet perfect match. They live in a crazy world, faced with monstrous choices, and in the end of the day they always find their way and they always find their way back to each other.That’s pretty freaking epic.This book is definitely the odd one out. It’s messier, less consistent, more over the top, and all that. And yet, it’s still impossible to put down and very, very fun. And moreover, the author managed to do the thing BBC writers f*cked up so spectacularly and give the fans and his characters the ending they deserve. The man deserves praise for that alone. But really, it’s for bringing to life such terrific, original, and wildly memorable characters. I’ve had a blast with these books. I love these books. There, I said it. Psychopaths deserve love.

Jennings’ novels are different, his characters are different … yet all too familiar. The thing is, I enjoy it, all of it, too much. I’d read the books on their own, never seeing the TV show and enjoy them, too. They are likely the only spy fiction I ever liked. And yes, I’d read it just for Villanelle, but objectively, Jennings is just a good writer. These books are genuinely exciting and thrilling, something you don’t often find in thrillers, ironically enough.The narrative is dynamic, succinct, elegant, even. It suits its mesmerizing protagonist to a murderous tee.And I’ve really enjoyed comparing the source material and its adaptation, especially since this book came out after BBC began airing the show.Jennings probably had an option to veer closer to the TV show but chose to pursue the same direction he laid out in book one. Things get crazier and crazier for the story’s protagonists as the world closes in on them, right until a stunning ending.

So naturally I was curious to see how my favorite character favored in books. And to my great surprise, the book was actually fun. I started it at 9:30 pm and read in one sitting until 1:30 am. Jennings is a very dynamic writer, his book is a slick and sleek action sequence but with enough character development and literary touches to denote quality.The thing of is it … it’s no Killing Eve. On its own, the book would be fun, but it pales when compared to its infinitely superior adaptation. As Villanelle would say, “Sorry Baby.”BBC show took plenty from the books, but spun it so cleverly, with such pazazz and style and darkly humorous notes, that it shines like the brightest star. And most DUE to its brightest star, Jodie Comer, who inhabited the role of Villanelle so perfectly.So, as a result, Jennings’ Villanelle on page is ice and on screen is fire. To the book’s credit, it does make things like all the killings for instance, seem more realistic. But who wants reality when you can have a near-perfect more then?In the end, Codename Villanelle is a well-crafted dispassionate, emotionally distant spy thriller, wherein Killing Eve is a spectacularly done, sizzling love story with spies in it. Choose your own adventure.I, for one, intend to read the rest of the books, if only to honor the creator of such a spectacular character. Which is more than the BBC show manage to do in the end.

I found the concept interesting and the New Zealand setting fun, but ultimately the book just did not satisfy, which isn’t ideal, especially considering its size.And I think what dragged the book down was its protagonist, Alice, a thirty-seven-year-old woman one point off genius-level IQ, who is basically a loser. She hasn’t done a thing with her life, apart from working in a tedious desk job and living in an apartment under her mom’s, which is technically her mom’s place subdivided. And no, they don’t get on. They chat via Morse code.Alice also chats with her imaginary friend, incessantly.That’s kind of this novel in a nutshell—quirky. But not quirky enough. And far from likable. Considering that the reader is forced to spend the entire 400 pages inside Alice’s mind, you’d want Alice to be someone interesting, engaging, something. And she isn’t. She doesn’t even come across that smart despite the constant mention of the IQ thing. She’s just like snarky at best. Mostly mopey.She lives at a time in the very near future when NZ is flooded with wealthugees, which is exactly what it sounds like—wealthy refugees from climate change-ruined places who reshape NZ’s socioeconomic reality. The most interesting thing that occurs in Alice’s life is meeting one of these wealthugees, who then leaves her with his fifteen-year-old daughter who turned out to be all kinds of different. Specifically, a real genius and much closer to the title.

I’ve only watched the cinematic adaptation of that, but I did read and absolutely love her other novel, Muse. So I figured I’d check out this book when it showed up on Netgalley, because hey, I love classic mythology.Since the publishing market is all about trends, this is actually a trend. These retellings of ancient myths using modern mores. Conceptually, I don’t love it. I think things should be read within their context not preimagined and prechewed for the latest generation’s ever more delicate sensibilities. And let’s face it, the ancient world was brutal to women, in real life and in mythology. The Greek deities were abusive, rape-y, and all kinds of mercurial with their affections.One of those women, sideswept and ruined by the desires of the immortals is Medusa. This is her story as told by Burton, author who seemingly utilized her background in YA fiction to tell a story appropriate for most ages. It isn’t YA per se, it isn’t not YA. The main protagonist is a teenager and so it her love interest, Perseus. They spend most of the novel talking without seeing each other. Because we all know how well it turns out once they do meet eye to eye. Or if you don’t know, you will after reading this story.Burton is an undeniably talented writer, her language sings. But beyond that, the story comes across as thin AND unnecessary. With heavy-handed moralism to boot.It’s a small book and a quick read, but I don’t know if I’d recommend it.If you’re thinking of requesting a Netgalley ARC, beware—the publisher has gone out of the way to make it uncomfortable to read, providing a terribly spaced-out copy.Unless you’re really into feminist retellings of Greek myths, or doomed teenage romances, I don’t know what you’d want with this book.

All I know is that I’ve read four books of his before this one, and only Tomb of the Gods was above average.But I can speculate about Flame Tree, a press lead by a veteran editor, who previously headlined Leisure Pub and Samhain, before both expired. The man appears to have found his niche, a comfortable formula that works and sells, and he is sticking to it. The press seldom if ever publishes anything that might pass for original, and this book is no exception.I love a Wendigo story, but this is as formulaic of a creature feature as they come—evil in the woods is stalking a small Minnesotan village full of Norwegian descendants. With ever cliché there is and a very American number of guns.Tons of characters, none are interesting or likable enough, with the focus inexplicably leveled onto a young married couple of losers, who have no business being married, let alone breeding, which hasn’t stopped them from either.Lots of action, lots of shooting, a good amount of gore. If you’re into that sort of thing, especially at the expense of originality or any sort of wow factor, go for it. This is by all means a perfectly serviceable book that works the formula well and reads easily, although at 304 pages it’s longer than most Flame Tree books with nothing to really justify the length.For those, who like me, prefer their horror literary, psychological, unique, etc., this bland wintery ride doesn't do much Wendigo or not.Thanks Netgalley....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Sep 12, 2023","Sep 13, 2023","Sep 14, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/134691276-they-stalk-the-night

You get a story of a grieving father who has a mysterious eponymous rift appear in his backyard. The man starts messing with the rift and eventually stumbles upon much more than he had bargained for. Because to no one’s surprise mysterious rifts appearing out of nowhere often lead to the darkest of places, especially in scary stories.The writing is perfectly serviceable. So is the plotting.

Every single thing and action is overdescribed. Exhaustively so. This might have been a much more dynamic novella if not for all the unnecessarily extra details. For another thing, there isn’t that much going here, plot-wise, and what there is, is about as original as the title, which isn’t very.It just kind of drags and isn’t very exciting and makes you think that there must have been something the author did to go from HarperCollins to Flame Tree.Besides, he thanks Dean Koontz for help with this book, and talk about mediocrities …Oh, wait this is on me, actually.

And with this novel, I am now officially a fan. It drew me in from the first chapter and didn’t release me until the very end. On a quest for a mysterious lost cinematic treasure, a movie expert finds an old woman in a desert who may or may not have the very last extant reels of the eponymous production. And from there on, the adventure unfolds, taking you back in time to the Golden Era of Cinema and beyond, to the bayous of Louisiana and a very unusual woman and her daughter branded as witches by the locals. Slowly but inexorably the storylines will collide into a dazzling mystery, a tale of obsession, revenge, and silver nitrate.If you watched Babylon and thought it was great, as I did, this is Babylon with a murder mystery.If, as I am, you’re a cinema buff, if you like historical fiction and stories that dance on the line between horrific and suspenseful, and are never less than thrilling, not to mention gorgeously written, this book is for you.Cleverly weaving in the real and imaginary, this marvel of a book will spellbind you as sure as any bayou witch. And the writing is just … oh so good. Russell handles descriptions like a fine artist, dialogue like a playwright, and language like a poet. But it is never overwrought or cumbersomely pretentious. Instead, it’s sheer beauty. Literary, elegant, epic.In case you can’t tell by now, I absolutely loved this book. Recommended to any reader of discerning taste.

It“Mommy fiction” is so popular these days, across genres, that even … um …daddies are jumping on it?The thing is parenthood is a terrifying concept. It has been explored tritely in a variety of thrillers and brilliantly in some darker, scarier ways like Katrina Monroe’s latest. And now Clay Chapman in adding to that pile, with a tale of very unconventional mothering of a very unconventional child. Southern Gothic is nature and tone, this novel is practically swampy with eeriness. A humid sot of a nightmare. The mommy here is Madi, who outside of raising a kid, has never made much of her life after getting knocked up as a teen. Now Madi’s back where she came from, Virginia, getting by on reading palms. Even her daughter has moved on, going to live with her more-situated-in-life dad.Madi meets an old crush of a hunky fisherman with sad eyes and proceeds to help him try to find his young son, who went missing as an infant.But if they do find him, what sort of a child would he be? And, perhaps more importantly What Kind of Mother would Madi be to him?I’m a fan of Chapman’s work, his last two books were very, very good. And this one is noticeably less so. Going by other GR s, I’m not in the minority here. WKoM is wildly uneven and not overly engaging. Chapman is a very good writer, that much is obvious and can be seen in this novel, too. It’s the plotting that drags here. For one thing, there’s barely enough of a plot for an entire 300-page novel. It’s more like one sustained watery nightmare. For another, I didn’t really care for any of the characters. The pacing was slow, but the book read fast, if that makes sense. Lots of dialogue, low word density per page, that sort of thing. And then toward the end, it did that weird thing where every chapter sort of read like the last one, but there was always one more after that. And then when you really thought it was done, there was an epilogue, too.So overall, not Chapman’s best, regrettably, and mostly worth reading only for the quality of the writing, not the story. Unless you’re really into the smothering mothering experience. Maybe the next one. What kind of a book would that be?This and more at https://advancetheplot.weebly.com/...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,"Oct 17, 2023","Oct 18, 2023","Aug 29, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/193387946-what-kind-of-mother

The first trip with Tuomainen was fun, although Mine was a very, very different book. This one is practically lighthearted by comparison. Sure, there’s death, there’s crime, but ultimately, it’s one of those uplifting and romantic stories that people seem to like, and Scandinavians, despite their normally rather dour output, seem to do well. The formula is as follows: take a main character and make him odd not too much just endearingly nerdy or off-beat, show how he’s stuck in life, then put him through a major upheaval. Throw in a cast of quirky side characters and a love interest (with maybe a secret), stir, and simmer.And thus, you have a tale of a mild-mannered actuary who’s only wish for life is that it should be sensible. He loses his job for being too upright and stick in the mud-like for a hip, modern workplace and simultaneously inherits an adventure park from his free-spirited (and now dead) brother. Reluctantly but dedicatedly, the protagonist throws himself into operating the park and realizes just how elaborate of an inheritance his brother left him, including the demanding and challenging employees and a considerable gambling debt to some rather dangerous individuals. He resolves to sort it all out through his beloved mathematics. If he can stay alive long enough and if he can sort out his romantic feelings for one of his employees, the artist who may or may not reciprocate.The book is rather charming, it reads quickly and easily for its length, and entertains considerably. The formula and cheeriness and the overdone romance take something away from the overall reading experience, but it’s fun enough.

I read it by the lake overlooking some perfectly nice houses. But then ...The thing with James Tynion iV’s writing is that he just can’t seem to get out of his own way. On the rare occasions he manages, his books are terrific. The Department of Truth series is one of my current favorites. But most of the rest leave a lot to be desired.I don’t know, maybe he’s just clever enough to know exactly what sells: YA, millennial drivel, queer-themed stories, etc. and he writes just that … or maybe that’s his level or writing and interest and he simply writes what he knows. No idea, mustn’t speculate. But point is, he manages to sink his own stories.Take this one, for instance. It’s got a terrific premise. A mutual acquaintance invites a group of ten diverse individuals to the eponymous slice of vacation awesomeness. Then he tells them they can’t leave because the world as they knew it has ended. They can have anything they want so long as they say at the location.Do these individuals express anything resembling gratitude? Nope. Instead, they poke and prod and moan and groan and whine. And then, only very reluctantly explore the place to see if they salvage the situation somehow. Basically, typical millennials. Meanwhile, through flashbacks we are told how each of the characters knows their host, and we learn something about the host, too. Mainly, that it is his people who are responsible for the destruction, and he was meant to observe but ended up going native. Basically, his fault is for making and loving too many friends. Not that the ingrates care.But point is, he is by far the most interesting character in this book, but doesn’t draw enough focus. The apocalypse doesn’t draw enough focus. All the focus is vacuumed up by the tedious cast of characters and their heavily stressed and depicted diversity and personal drama.So in the way the cover endorsement by one of LOST TV show makers is logical, but LOST had great characters and a great mystery. And here the balance is all wrong.Frustrating really, because the premise is so intriguing, and the art is absolutely stunning, reminds me of an older DC/Vertigo awesomeness. And yes, I plan to check out book two to see how it all plays out, but my expectations have been sufficiently adjusted.And just for the record, since we live in the day and age where these things have to be declared: I am all about diversity and love seeing it in books, movies, etc. I even believe there are some perfectly worthy millennials out there. The problem with this book isn’t the presence of diverse millennials, it’s the balance of character drama and plot leading to a rather disappointing reading experience.Anyway, this  is already much too long.

While one can argue on the significance of their religious and cultural reforms, one thing is easy to agree on: their crime and punishment situation was as horrifying as it was inadvertently hilarious. As this book so amply demonstrates.The combination of overzealousness, misguided ideas, absence of scientific knowledge, etc. made for some rather peculiar convictions. And then the barbaric appetites combined with whimsy of kings and queens created for some very disturbing punishments.They were bloodthirsty, all right, back in Tudor times. You’ll see plenty of evidence of that within these pages. But also, these are real tragedies of real people. Then, as now, crime was largely reflective of the socioeconomic divisions in the society—as dramatic then as they are now. The poor lives short, brutish lives and were often driven to crime by desperation.The curious thing about Tudor England was just how much those with money and power managed to get in the wrong, easily enough done with the ever-changing politics.Told accessibly and even entertainingly with an occasional wink-wink humorous touch and plenty of real life cases, this is a great and thorough (without getting bogged down) account of a time and a place that does its title justice.

But this one was such a dud.I think the only thing reading this story did was remind me that I am right to stay away from most thrillers populating the market right now. Specifically, these estrogen-heavy, mommy thrillers.This Berry is an expert child psychologist and uses that knowledge to write of aberrant child psychology. So you get a tale of classic evil kid, but one so trite and so carboardly written and plainly plotted that it does nothing but waste time.It isn’t thrilling enough for a thriller or mysterious enough for a mystery and it is certainly not literary enough to be literature.It’s just sort of there. A bland mediocrity. Because people like mediocrity, this Berry has made a career out of peddling them, it seems. One clichéd book after the next. Even the titles and the covers are straight out of genre-casting central. I've read one of them and was proven right. Then I immediately forgotten it. Otherwise, I wouldn't have selected this story.Basically, anyone with anything like a discerning taste should really make the effort to find something more interesting and original.

Okay, then…Last Acts is a very modern, uniquely American sort of novel about guns and money. A father/son story set in a sun-baked Arizona, it tells the readers of the ups and downs of Rizzo family. It begins with Nick, Rizzo son, returning from rehab, determined t stay clean, as his father clumsily navigates having an addict for a son.The father Rizzo owns a failing gun shop in the middle of nowhere. Nick uses his marketing experience and his personal story to make the business hop, thus turning the downward slide of the Rizzos into a roller-coaster. A strikingly competent debut as far as writing goes, but for me it misses a mark slightly. The tone varied too freely between serious drama and satire, the characters were unlikeable and not especially engaging, and the overall plot, albeit chewy didn’t really go too many places.

The book indeed provides you with an intense look into a grieving psyche, specifically that of a woman who finds her brother dead. Suicide.The woman, our protagonist, is indeed an author. There are snippets of her work through the book adding to the dizzying and trippy mess of the narrative. She is also BIPOC and queer which alone would sell this novel in today’s market.

A silly book that had a potential for more, but chose to (very deliberately, it seems) be as silly as possible.Raft is entertaining, sure, but that’s about it. It’s cute, too cute, aggressively cute as the story progresses. So your reading enjoyment will directly depend on how much that works for you.Overall, a light quick read.

Sargent comes from a book-forward family and has been in business for a long time, including the nearly four decades of being the boss at Macmillan before his relatively recent and less than amicable parting of ways with the company.So yeah, I figured I’d read it. And I’m glad I did. Differing from a typical discursive rambling memoir, Sargent’s book is lean and streamlined, organized into several cohesive sections and chaptered by events. It’s an almost anecdotal approach, a chronological storytelling. And Sargent certainly has stories to tell. Then man has met tons of famous people, from respectable authors to infamous pop stars. Everyone wants to write a book, from politicians to sports people.Sargent also gives a somewhat comprehensive overview of the advent of digital publishing and his struggle against Amazon. And there are other fun tales, my favorite being the time him and a colleague decided to charm Barnes and Noble into stocking one of their books by weaponizing beads during the time of fashionably clean-shaven professionals.Overall, an entertaining and enlightening look, a fun book about what goes into making one.

No wonder I’ve never heard of him.But here’s the weird thing: bizarrely enough, this very R-rated story is a prequel to a YA trilogy. The series features a serial killer, and this prequel is about his dad, who is also a serial killer.So, how’s that supposed to work exactly? I thought the point of these prequel novellas that many authors do was to tease and entice the readers into their fictional universe, but it’s difficult to imagine that one’s expectations will be met going from a very adult book to YA.Personally, I’m all for age divisions in reading. Kids books should be for kids, young adult books for young adults, etc. I think adults have no business reading YA outside of some tragic form of mental regression.So this doesn’t make much sense as a prequel. But as a standalone novella, it’s decent enough.

And, perhaps worst of all for this as a memoir, he isn’t that interesting or likeable as a character. Not the nicest thing to say, sure, but a book was read, and an opinion was formed and shared.

This book is odd, very odd, and not necessarily in a good way. It certainly blows up all expectations upon Finland—where the wild things are … weird. This book is odd, very odd, and not necessarily in a good way. It certainly blows up all expectations upon entry, but what it offers instead leaves a lot to be desired. First off, the troll in the book is nothing like trolls many or most might imagine. Nothing like the one in the recent Scandinavian eponymous movie or most movies for that matter, including the kids ones.Secondly, it isn’t a love story per se, either.At most, it’s a flirtation with bestiality with uncomfortable pedo undertones. Which, technically, might be someone’s idea of love, but it’s objectively far from “a love story.”It goes like this: an apparently sexually irresistible gay man finds a wounded young troll outside and takes him in. The troll here is a small hairy feline-ish animal, something like a lynx with, but heavy pheromones. The troll doesn’t belong with the man in his apartment, and the man has no business with the troll, especially once it’s strong enough to go live outside again, but some sort of a bond forms. Or rather, the man becomes obsessed with the troll and proceeds to treat him like a cross between a pet, a child, and a lover. Weird and not for the squeamish, but there it is.To no one’s surprise, the situation doesn’t work out, eventually blowing up in the man’s face.But you still have to get there but wading through the tepid waters of the man’s romantic and professional lives.The novel is relatively compact and interspersed heavily with troll-like research material from varied sources. It’s interesting enough in that train-wreck-can’t-quite-look-away kind of way and oscillates from disgusting to disturbing in narrative. It’s definitely subversive, but again, I’m not sure where the author was going with that. It certainly isn’t the most flattering depiction of queer life, in fact, it’s almost offensive in a way, playing into some of the ugliest stereotypes.Apparently beloved and critically acclaimed, it’s certainly original, but in a way that reminds you that originality alone isn’t always a good thing. No idea why the Finnish consider this great. Frankly, no idea why the Finnish think that’s what trolls are like. But there it is. Not the sort of thing you’d say enjoy to, either. Does check the box for international reading, though, so there. ...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Jun 27, 2023","Jun 28, 2023","Jul 01, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/19706906-troll

Or a version thereof.Although, technically this is a love story with immortality thrown in as opposed to a vice versa version of it. Think Age of Adaline, only instead of Blake Lively’s immensely likeable character who is struck with immortality you get a total waster like the protagonist of Evergreens who chooses it.And that’s the main detractor of the otherwise perfectly good novel—a profoundly crappy protagonist. Nothing as pedestrian as likable or unlikable, moral or not, etc. but he’s just fundamentally crap: neither interesting nor particularly compelling. All he does is waste his time and waste his gift.Although, of course, the novel doesn’t present immortality as a gift. Quite the opposite. The moral of this tale, a rather heavy-handed moral, one might add, is that one mustn’t mess with the natural rhythms of existence, take life as it comes, etc.Which honestly, again, isn’t as interesting as a lot of things one can do with immortality, but okay, there you have it.The thing is, though, the protagonist is so grrrr-stupid that he’d llkely end up wasting his life either way, immortality just sort of enables him to do it. As opposed to his beloved who lives her life naturally and manages to have a great one.So yeah, I didn’t care for him or the overall moral, but the thing is—and this is a major testament to Liam Brown’s talent as a writer— I was still completely engaged with the book. Didn’t want to put it down. I just really like the way he writes. And objectively speaking, this was an interesting take on immortality, and such things always make one think.

Now back to long form, this novel lightly echoes Talk To Me in the way it takes on people’s relationship with the natural world around them, but it’s an entirely different beast.Blue Skies may be an upbeat song, but it’s a terribly depressing novel…or it would be with a less skilled writer. This is basically a story of an unfolding climate apocalypse told through three alternating perspectives, following one family of well-meaning idiots. Well, some are more idiotic and/or more well-meaning than others, but there you have it.The narrative tone falls somewhere between satire and dark comedy with heavy dashes of drama. And it works nicely, especially considering that some of the narrators (yeah, Cat) are flat-out horrid. Cooper is somewhat more tolerable all things considered. And Ottilie, their mother, is doing the best she can, going to some stupendous length to change her ways, albeit too late in the game. It stands to mention that this is a family profoundly steeped in white privilege, which very much informs their attitude toward life and everything in it, one ridiculous idea at a time.The book is uniquely American in its cheerfully/insanely obstinate denial/perseverance attitude. California is on fire and Florida is under water, the entire species are dying out, and people still carry on with social media and having babies. In other words, these are not the protagonists you’re going to sympathize with, but irrespective of that, you still might have difficulty putting this book down. Boyle is just that good of a writer.And the frightening thing is the end of the world likely will roll in just like that, and people will be acting just the same. Books can be prescient this way. Without planning too, I read this book during the days of unbreathable air courtesy of Canadian wildfires, so it was a very harrowing eerily on-the-money experience. Books like warnings change nothing because no one listens. The same stubborn selfish stupidity that causes the situations in the first place.

His work is literary and offers consistent quality throughout, from one fine-crafted nightmare to the next. I’ve read most of his work and thus have read some of the novellas in this collection of mostly reprints, but long enough ago so that it didn’t matter. Which is to say I still enjoyed After the Fade¬—the tale of a break-up during an apocalypse and Skullbelly—something scary roams the woods and the rest of the novellas which I’ve not read before, including the brand-new closing one.Atmospheric, well-written, engaging…there’s so much to like here. To be fair, I wasn’t as blown away by this collection as I was by Malfi’s recent Ghostwritten. This is an author who I find improves over time, aging like fine blood-colored wine or something. Some of his earlier works were nowhere near as strong as his current output. But he is an author well-worth reading, committed to quality, which is most admirable, especially in the genre that can so easily sellout for cheap thrills.Overall, a solid collection of tales about things that lurk in the darkness.

So I figured it was time to check the author out in prinUntil now, I’ve only experienced Michael Cunningham’s work through his cinematic adaptations. So I figured it was time to check the author out in print (as author intended) and grabbed this latest book of his from Netgalley.It’s a concept as simple as the title: the novel follows characters around for one April day in 2019, 2020, and 2021. The timing is obviously auspicious, and turbulence is expected and presented.On paper (pardon the pun), Cunningham is plainly good, great even perhaps, as a prose stylist and a character writer. The language flows beautifully, the scenes are rendered expertly, with linguistic precision and a striking emotional palette. It’s all very well done, very accomplished. And yet…for how emotionally intelligent the writing is, it doesn’t quite emotionally engage. There’s a sort of disconnect with the characters. And since the almost-nothing-happens plot is ALL about the characters, that’s kind of a detractor.I would have liked to care more than I did. I would have liked to find the reading experience more compelling. Instead, it was sort of like gallery reading…as in you stand in the gallery and take in the artwork, admiring the brushstrokes, but at a remove. As opposed to diving into it for proper immersion. This was definitely very literary. A high literature, New York Times  section literature. But a rather dispassionate one. For this reader, anyway. User milage may (and likely will) vary.

This one isn’t clichéd at all.My Dirty California is all original, a compelling mystery wrapped into a love song for a state of dreamers. You get to follow a story of two estranged brothers, one as a ghostly presence lingering on the edges, one as a protagonist trying to solve his murder. It’s a maze of terrific characters and a plethora of concepts from crimes to conspiracy theories, all terrifically written and character driven.Sun-baked, ocean-bathed, dirty yet so beguiling, California is the main character of this story and so much more than just a location.The rest of the characters are no slouches either and are compelling in their own ways with their dramas and triumphs, conspiracy theories and crimes and complexly convoluted yet always engaging personal journeys. You get aspiring criminals, aspiring detectives, aspiring dimension travelers. A real kitchen sink of a novel in the best possible way.The mystery at the center of this novel is serpentine, clever, multi-layered, loaded with twists and surprises.All in all, a great read.

The main difference appears to be that ATFTD takes place on a movie set and features actors, director, etc. and this one is set in a small college town amid psychology researchers.Are movie sets, especially scary movie sets, inherently more exciting than academia and University campuses? Yes, one might make an argument that they are. But I’ve read plenty of great academia fiction, so…I suppose, for me personally, yes, because I love movies so much. I suppose for me the setting was what elevated ATFTD above average. And here, in this novel, there just wasn’t enough to provide that boost.MInd you, it’s on the good side of average. Jacobs is a pretty good writer and understands how thrillers work, dishing out measured amounts of information throughout to maintain the suspense and all that, but in the end of the day it wasn’t quite enough for me and didn’t seem like enough to distinguish this book among the many, many, maaaany ones just like it.And yes, I figured out who the killer is (a particularly dumb killer in this instance) and I appreciated that the author didn’t make it too easy to guess, but aside from that…middle of the road all the way, especially since I didn’t particularly like, found interesting, or care about any of the characters.Entertaining enough to pass the time, but nothing special.

I love clever books and I cannot lie. And Tidhar in this novel absolutely dazzles with his cleverness.I also love books about books and writers. Naturally. In this novel, Tidhar invents a golden age science fiction author who buys into his own fiction and ends up inventing a religion. (That sounds vaguely familiar, no? ;) ) The book that started it all becomes a much-searched-for near-mythical impossible-to-obtain object. And a cast of fascinating original characters get obsessed with looking for it.The book is told from each of their perspectives, plus the biographical tale of the author and the oh-so-appropriate dénouement. That’s a lot to pack into just 256 pages. But not for an author of Tidhar’s caliber. Boy, can that man write. There’s such beauty and succinctness to his narration. I dislike oversized overblown narratives as much as I love clever books—a lot. And this story is just about perfect in both length and execution. Because it’s too good to put down for long and is easily possible to read in one day as I did.Impossible to genre class this one; science fiction, sure, but also so much more. A grand adventure.

Well, then, guess it worked because I was unable to resist it. And having read it, am glad to report that there is indeed truth in advertising in this instance. This book IS clever. Viciously, deliciously so.I’ve been pretty burnt out on modern thrillers: too predictable, too formulaic, too trite. I was looking for something like this…a book that simultaneously plays with genre presets and dares to defy them.On a surface, it’s a typical locked private club mystery. A group of wealthy individuals that goes back a while gathers together to hunt. Or rather, a group of ostensibly wealthy incestuous liars and cheats gets together to play games with each other.Some games are deadlier than others. In their midst, is a private detective hired by (mystery) there to (mystery). AT first, he just enjoys the high life, but then the bodies begin to drop, and he has to get to work.And while all of that may sound like a very familiar mystery plot, nothing about this novel itself is familiar. From its structure to its twist.From the very first chapter, the author essentially takes a sledgehammer to the fourth wall, and he doesn’t stop until the very end. He talks to us or at us. He switches perspectives and tones to suit the mood. He goes on discursive discussions of mystery genre and its masters. It’s all rather brilliant. It really is.It can also probably seem like a lot, especially for readers who are used to the conventional the-wife-or-the-husband-did-this-because-of-the-secrets-in-their-past, etc. sort of mystery thrillers.This is very much a thinking person mystery. Like most very clever (and aware of it and not ashamed to flaunt it) things and people, it won’t be for everyone. But it definitely worked for me. Strikingly original and yes, clever, impressively clever, this is a mystery for mystery lovers looking for something different, something with substance and intelligence to charm and wow.

I didn’t even request it originally when it came up on Netgalley. I read the author’s previous book Winter Sister and found it thoroughly mediocre. But then the publisher sent the direct link and I was like, oh why not, it is, after all, such a nice cover. And what do you know…second time’s the charm. This book was a dramatic improvement upon its predecessor. The writing, the plotting, the character development…all so many levels up, you’d think you were in a different video game altogether. I certainly wouldn’t have attributed both books to the same author without knowing that to be the case. I mean, maybe the overly emotional ending showed some similarities, but that’s about it.  So, here’s something new and original to set this book above the homogeneous sea of same sort of thriller. This is a story of a family obsessed with true crime. And sure, true crime is a national obsession, even SNL just spoofed the neverending murder docuseries trend, but this family is extra crazy about it. It’s really their mother’s obsession, but since she’s the one with the finances to raise her family in a sort of minicult of six on a secluded island in an isolated mansion, that’s exactly what she did. People with money, right…Anyway, so this (let’s call it like it is, the book doesn’t seem to) lunatic of a woman marries a man of her dreams who seems to do nothing but hunt and they make four babies, two close in age older siblings and a younger set of twins. Their place that looks like a giant shrine to murder victims, the kids are all named after famous murder victims and they live on an island that has famously had a never apprehended serial killer. Not quite normal, is it…no small surprise the kids bail out as soon as they become of age and get their inheritance. But one of them has never come back. And his devastated twin has spent the last decade trying to find him. Now their father’s death brings the family together once again and a body is found in the family plot. And with those bones, many tragic and ugly secrets from the past get unburied also. Slowly, but inexorably, the Lighthouses, the family who lived for so long in the dark and ritualistically worshipped it from a safe distance, will find just how close the darkness has always been. This worked well on many levels. From an authentically creepy original premise to excellent representation of the variously mentally scarred characters (and it stands to mention again how normalized the mother was in this novel, considering, WTF) to the expertly sustained suspense. For a while there were several credible culprits and you really had to work to try to figure it out.  The things that didn’t work perfectly were few. The main reveal comes (not too surprisingly) at about 75%, which is pretty early on and creates for a too long of a denouement. Although there was one last great twist thrown in in the last 25% to make it worth it. The ending did get slightly too sentimental, considering how messed up the rest of the story is, but it worked. I liked the way it played around in the morally grey zone, instead of confirming to the rigidity of black and white moral presets. So yeah, good, almost great even. This novel goes as dark as you’d want from a work of psychological fiction, with a positively gothic scenery and a clever commentary on the national obsession. It was entertaining, exciting and fun. I enjoyed it very much. Recommended.

If I hadn’t read Monroe’s work before and thought highly of it, it’s difficult to tell whether this book would have attracted me by description alone. I tend to stay away from mommy thrillers aka books with main focus being on mothers’ relationships with their children, mothers trying to have children, mothers mothering children, etc. at all costs.But then you give the theme to someone talented enough and they’ll do something wild, strange, and original with it. Like here.In Monroe’s book, motherhood is a nightmare. Because really it is. If you take the hormonal mushiness out of it and view it objectively, it’s terrifying. And this book is so very good at highlighting all those terrors an exhausted (and post-partum) brain might weave.The plot centers around a first-time mother who is slowly driven mad by her baby. Isolated and turned essentially into a feeding machine for a voraciously hungry creature she doesn’t know how to love, with no real support from her wife or family, the woman starts suspecting madness. It is, after all in her genes. Time to track down her long-locked up mad mother and ask? Yeah, just how well that’s going to play out, you think?The real success of this book is in its claustrophobic atmosphere and vividly rendered slow psychological unraveling of a person. I read it during the same week I watched Rachel Weisz spectacular remake of Dead Ringers and the combination was horrifyingly awesome. If that doesn’t put people off motherhood, nothing will.But of course, the thing is…NOTHING WILL. Doesn’t matter the complications, dangers, or ramifications. Mommyhood always comes through, all shining and desirable. Even in stories like this. Presumably because the authors are mothers themselves and once that drive kicks in…So the ending is something of a letdown. Or rather a softening of an otherwise razor-sharp blade of a novel. But otherwise, it’s a really good read. So I'm going to round it up. For fans of dark psychological fiction. Recommended.

It also occurred to me that I’m not sure I’ve ever read a Finnish author. So this book seemed like the proverbial one stone.But then, it didn’t quite work for me. And because it’s a genuinely objectively solid book, I had to think of the reasons.As the title suggest, this is an epistolary novel, told primarily through diary-like entries the protagonist writes for their spouse, Sol, as she chases them across the universe.Sol is one of those mysteriously vanished spouses that exists in the periphery only: either in their wife’s memories or in occasional missives of their own.But the idea is that writing for Sol will eventually (whenever Sol shows up) will give them idea of what they’ve missed in their spouse’s daily life.A noble lovely idea for them as a couple maybe, but for the readers, it’s rather…less dynamic. Specially, it ends up like reading someone’s diary entries, slow, peculiarly dense and dreamy. Almost poetic-like and I’m not sure it’s a compliment.There are interesting things going on here, though. The novel takes place in the future, when Earth is all but completely devastated and space colonies are thriving, especially the Mars one. There’s a lot of political conflicts and space drama in which some of the characters may be involved to varying extent. That gives it all an element of suspense. And the worldbuilding is quite decent too. It’s just that to get to all that you have to wade through so much inner dialogue and melancholy diary-ing. So the overall result is a mixed bag. Yes, this is a well written and intelligent novel, but also it’s something of a slog to read. I don’t imagine it would be to everyone’s taste, but I also imagine there is the right audience for a book like this out there.

All while trying to figure out the mysterious shenanigans going on all around her that may or may not have something to do with her aunt’s past and The Nazis. Yes, it’s only been a couple of decades since WWII, the scars are still fresh.An entertaining and engaging book overall, despite the author’s best efforts to turn it into a trite women’s fic. Yes, those efforts do affect the overall quality (by, among other things, lightening what should by rights and themes be a rather dark story), but it’s still very readable, albeit more in a beach book sort of way. At least the book isn’t as bland as its cover.

The writing is solid, and the editing appears to be on the level. That’s already a huge win for a self-published book. The plot rambles a bit. There are way too many characters, and it not only overwhelms the plot, but also draws focus from the main event. My standard go-to for horror fiction are dark psychological stories. I don’t’ care for guts and gore and schlock of it all. But if I’m reading a Sasquatch (or Yeren) story, I want the main attraction to appear sooner than 70% in. And maybe more originality to the story than a flat-out battle royale between the species. Carnage is expected, sure, but can we make it mor original?

This one is very much in the same vein. With the only notable exception being that the mystery is contained (a locked place mystery) and the solution isn’t easily predictable.The rest is as trite as it gets with every character being a perfect cliché of themselves and a politically correct message about race, class, and academia wedged in there for some added weight.But really, the book has enough weight on its own.

It’s also really implausible in its premise because really the rules, their strictness, and everyone’s willingness to follow them after one contestant drops dead doesn’t seem even vaguely realistic.But overall, if you don’t overthink the plot, the book’s fine. It reads quickly. One of those mindless suspense mysteries you can zone out to.

Until we find out that the reason behind the weird naming rituals everyone engages in are so the objects around them can maintain their shape. Until we learn about the secrets the powers that be are hiding and what really happened to the failed colony.Until it gets REALLY WEIRD.Because in a world when you can shape reality with intent and words, there doesn’t have to be any limits.Tidbeck’s writing is best described as Scandinavian minimalism and it works really effectively here, in this ale of repressed society too afraid to open its eyes and minds.

The world building here is absolutely first rate.I loved how wild the author’s imagination spun within these pages, creating a pleasantly laconic but striking read.

I’ve also read Alderman’s latest (at the time of this ’s publication) novel, Power, and enjoyed it very much and am excited to see how Prime adapts it.Anyway, our library system has just now gotten a digital copy of disobedience, so yey, I set off to read it immediately. And what a mixed bag of impressions…I shall attempt to sort through them now here.First off, beginning at the end, I didn’t like the ending of the movie and was hoping the book had a different one. It did…and I didn’t like that one either.But hey, you know how they say write what you know? Well, Alderman raised into the exact same Orthodoxy in the same neighborhood as the book is set in, really used all she knew of her religion and surroundings in her debut.And because she is genuinely gifted writer, she makes that world come alive: every texture, every flavor, every claustrophobic mindset and attitude.It stands to mention that at the time of writing the novel, Alderman was a practicing Jew who has since left the religion or (in her own words) “wrote herself out of it."" But she wrote the novel still in her faith, albeit likely questioning, and it shows.This is no Women Talking, this is a very favorable representation of an extremely oppressive (particularly to women) way of life. The kind that had driven one of the novel’s protagonists, Ronit all the way across the ocean, and left the other, Esti, all but crushed.Now Ronit return to bury her father, The Rabbi, stirs up all sorts of dormant emotions and sets tremors through the entire suffocatingly tight community.It shakes it up just enough for something approaching a change but one so minute and insignificant, it barely counts. Oddly enough, it is neither Ronit nor Esti that seems to be the emotional backbone of this story, but Dovid, Ronit’s cousin and Esti’s spouse and the Rabbi’s proposed successor. This is likely due to the fact that neither Esti nor Ronit are all that likeable or engaging.That’s probably the main difference from the movie.Aside from the fact that the movie cast was much, much older than the book’s. Aside from the fact that the movie was much more romantic than the book. Aside from that WTF-kind-of-message-is-that ending of the book. Wherein in the movie it was just vague and underwhelming.And then, there’s the fact that each chapter of the book begins with a sermon on Jewish religion, which is enlightening but very…um…preachy.Yes, it’s important because it helps you understand the characters, their actions, their world. But it’s a lot. And it’s presented in a way that seems to approve and support the very restrictions and attitudes that make the lives of the characters so terrible. So, you know…it’s complicated. And nowhere near critical. In a way, the readers are left to draw their own conclusions. Apparently, the author did too.Still though, the writing and immersive depictions go, this is first rate dramatic literature.

Made for Love made me expect cleverness and originality. It certainly did not make me expect Tampa. I don’t know how anyone anticipates a book like that. In fact, honestly, I’m not sure how it ever got published.Which isn’t to say it’s a terrible book that doesn’t deserve to see the light of day so much as to say it’s way too in-your-face controversial for the delicate modern audiences. And yes, the book’s a decade old, but still…the reading audiences have only been getting more delicate with time. People can scarcely read books without content warnings now.And the contents of Tampa are rather…shocking even to a seasoned and diverse reader.Tampa is told from an almost stream-of-consciousness perspective of a predatorial female pedo. Or maybe that’s a redundancy? No, probably not, because Celeste is highly and unapologetically aggressive in her pursuits of teenage boys. Not just any, she has a very specific type, the barely-teens, fourteen, ideally.To that end, she gets a job as a middle grade teacher, as perfect of a hunting place as any pedo could ask for and then proceeds to find and seduce her victims.This novel is as brashly graphically sexual as it is controversial too. Celeste is constantly horny. The man she married can’t possibly satisfy here since he’s, you know, an adult man. And the boys she chooses, she just can’t get enough off.I’m no prude, and Celeste sexuality was still overwhelming. And also, just difficult to read about at times for obvious reasons.But for all its difficulties and nothing even remotely resembling easy likability or any likability, the novel does have that certain something—it is propulsive. Celeste is as amoral or morally repugnant of a protagonist as you can have, but her shamelessness, her blatant satisfaction of her appetites at all costs makes her strangely compelling like American Psycho or any other psycho. Or even Ted Bundy…a man who people found so charming, even at his own trial.And you know why Tampa has that? Because Nutting is a clever author. She really is. Because she takes the opportunity to explore our cultural obsession with beauty by showcasing how much her stunning gorgeous, superficially charming sociopath Celeste can and does get away with. Because Nutting doesn’t take the easy way out with her character by throwing in some twee remorse or cheap easy ways out. Celeste, for all her numerous faults, stays the course. She rejoices in her monstrosity. And the other clever thing about this novel is how subtly showcases the damage someone like Celeste can cause a young person. Because fundamentally no matter what centerfold dreams a teenage boy might have and no matter how stunning Celeste is, what she causes is severe damage.Still, though, how did this get sold? Or marketed? As a gender-flipped Lolita? But that book is practically chaste and moral when compared to Tampa.I guess hit just the right subversive notes. Who knows? Either way, an intense read and certainly not for everybody. But it does announce Nutting as a writer to watch.

Seriously.That was my initial impression, but because life kept getting in a way, this book took me an usually long time (several days as oppose to a customary day or two at most) to finish and thus I ended up with several fresh perspectives on it. Which is to say that as annoyingly pandering and self-consciously tryhard as I found it to begin with, I actually ended up not minding it that much and rather liking some aspects of it.So how do you write speculative fiction that sells in this day and age? Well, it has to be feminist, strongly so. In fact, avoid male characters in general whenever possible. Also, it has to be queer. As queer as you can make it. Throw in lesbians and trans people, heavily. Then make sure you have enough politically correct messages offered in a precise politically correct language. If you do it right, it will provide a clever sociopolitical commentary. As this book does, to its credit. Because the overall motif here seems to be that a dictatorship is a dictatorship no matter how well meant it might be and any dream taken too far can and will become a nightmare.Dystopian commentary aside, there’s some interesting worldbuilding here (as Earth becomes borderline uninhabitable and alternative methods for survival have to be engineered), though it takes a backseat to the ideology. The writing is mostly good but uneven as the author rushes to cover an expansive timeline and flips between alternating narrators. Sometimes it’s just too plain and factual, sometimes it’s surprisingly emotionally engaging. Sometimes (often) it’s pure women’s fiction, occasionally, it’s literature.But overall, it’s just about interesting enough, original enough and engaging enough to just about override it’s precocious, box-checking trendiness and enjoy.

And, true to the title, the women in this book (well, some of them) did have considerable historical significance. And then, they were summarily forgotten save for experts and aficionados.And of course, books like these that aim to shed much needed light of the interesting/exceptional aspects of the past. I’m all for historical fiction. I’m not superthrilled about this kind of it—the one that firmly lands under women’s fic, estrogen heavy, emotionally overwrought, and melodramatic—but the subject intrigued me enough to check this novel out.Sure enough, the book works primarily on the strength of its character. Nazimova. An émigré who took America by storm a century ago and was at the peak of her career the highest paid actress in Tinseltown. The peak didn’t stay, they seldom do, but it gave Nazimova’s story an perfect three-act ar—turbulent in real life, surely, but great for literary fodder.Curiously enough, the author chose to split the narrative duty between Nazimova and Maybelle, a somebody and a nobody, presumably to work that dynamic. The thing is Maybelle isn’t nearly as interesting of the character, she’s more of a plot device. Young, inexperienced, and fresh out of Kentucky farm, she provides the wide-eyed gee-haw perspective for the world of early day cinema she discovers in LA.She’s also a lesbian, which plays nicely against Nazimova’s famous bisexuality and generally rather scandalous love life.So you have the fascinating historical plotline of Nazimova’s life up against half-assed romantic and aspirational yearnings of Maybelle. Not especially comparable, but workable.Certainly more so that the writing itself, which is just…so freaking cheesy. The love scenes alone…it’s like stir some macaroni in there for a meal already.Definitely the kind of book where you gotta pick and choose. For me, my interest in all things cinema and queer/historical past mostly balanced out the twee estrogen-heavy aspects of the novel. And yes, had the subject been less interesting, that twee estrogen-heavy thing would have tanked the book, but alas, it works. It’s readable. It entertains.

Didn’t do much for me, didn’t think it was as clever or as wow as all that. Didn’t love the movie adaptation either. Clever, sure, but too precocious about it.This one, though, Reid’s sophomore effort, is all the things people were saying about his first novel. In a word (or two), kinda brilliant. In all of its deceptive simplicity, this novel that would only require three actors to adapt for the screen, is a story of a relationship. A seemingly happy married couple get surprised with huge, insane sort of news that the man, Junior, was selected for a space mission, a first of its kind, and can’t refuse. With his participation a mandatory thing, his wife gets compensated by having his specially engineered simulacrum staying with her for the duration. There’s also a company man staying with them, conducting studies, doing interviews.A far from ideal situation, but also a best way to test the strength of one’s relationship. So that’s the concept: apply abnormal pressure to a perfectly normal situation, change the familiar parameters, and watch how it plays out.Reid had done that perfectly in this novel. It manages to balance realism with heartrending emotionality with maddeningly taut suspense. It’s engaging, excitingly strange, and surprises the pants off of you in the end. An awesome plot twist.

The second story was practically dark comedy. Such a clever concept, but way too drawn out.Same with the last and longest novella, a clever suspense thriller, but so freaking long and slow and rambling with these ridiculous pages-long dialogues.

These stories, art to plot, reminded me so much of classic fantasies. A mighty warrior travels the land (while practically naked or, you know, wearing the skinniest bikini number available) and lands her fighting skills to those who can afford it. She's smart, tough, got a strong sense of justice, and an even stronger detector for BS. Red Sonja kicks ass. Oversexualized for sure, but that seems to be the fate of most superheroines.

I really like White’s previous book and got this one mainly going by author’s name, great titles, and the not-inconsiderable cover appeal. And sure enough, another winner.As if children’s shows were creepy enough, here comes Mister Magic. A show of truly mythical proportions. As in it might very well be the longest show on TV and yet there is barely any evidence of its existence. It lingers on the borders of one’s memory…like childhood trauma.Appropriately enough, because Mister Magic has certainly done its damndest to traumatize some kids. Let’s just say he’s no Mr. Rogers.So when the last official cast members of the show reunite at last three decades afterwards, their trauma still sizzles. Val, who spent the last thirty years off-grid and away from the world, was once a central character. Now she can’t remember a thing about that time, but her once-upon-a-time friends and fellow cast members find her and bring her back to the strange white place in the desert where the show was shot, and her memories begin coming back. Whether she wants them to or not. Past secrets, desert cults, strong character drama shot through with supernatural suspense, a thought-provoking mediation on the nature of religion, childrearing, and the role of obedience in both…this book has a lot to offer. Not to mention a writer who can really write – I love the way the scenes in this book come alive with cinematic vividness.What’s fascinating is how much the author’s own upbringing as a Mormon (she no longer is one) has informed her writing in this book. The personal perspective makes it all the more interesting and compelling of a narrative.All-in-all, a great read. Somewhat trippy but never more so than an average technicolor madness of a kids’ TV show. Great ending, too. Fans of dark supernatural fiction ought to enjoy this one. Recommended.

And all of those follow a formula. But every so often, an author comes along and works that formula TO THE BONE. Which is very much the case with this debut.Ironically enough, one of the main characters actively laments absence of daring and originality in genre fiction. But the author here seems to have a very astute understanding of what sells; it’s like she’s got a check list and is determined to check every single box.All female cast - check.Remote location with inclement weather – check.Catty rivalries – check.Queerness – so many checks. And yet, funnily enough, all of it is handled so tackily as to make it fetishized and weird. Page turning though cheap and mediocre at best writing – check.Over the top revelations and twists -check.There’s more, but let’s get into the plot some instead…The titular writing retreat is held by a mysterious radically feminist genre novelist whose gothic thrillers have propelled her to unparallel levels of fame. She’s somewhere in her 50s, hot, of course, in a vampy way, and is looking for new talent to nurture.She finds five of them, young writers desperate for a slice of her fame pie. They come to her remote mansion, get snowed in, psychologically messed with and eventually dead.You’d care about this if any of them more than cardboard cutouts of female characters, but they are, sadly not. We’re talking about a cast of women so clichéd and tedious, you might want them to get stuck at a murder retreat.Also, a cast of largely millennials and Gen Z just as caricaturist and tedious, every cliche in the book, amusingly, laboriously, strategically woke much as the narrative itself.Especially, the protagonist, who may or may not be queer though she can’t and won’t shut up about it. The one thing she isn’t is a good writer (you can tell by the excerpts of her work included) but hey, apparently being a good writer is no longer a prerequisite to getting published. Just look at Bartz.The Writing Retreat isn’t the worst of its kind, not like, for instance, it’s laughably failed sex scenes. The novel has a certain propulsive quality as its dramatically, ridiculously over-the-top characters convolute themselves into one insane situation after another. But it is, essentially just a steaming pile of pander doodoo.Pass.

I mean, yes, there’s still a homosexual protagonist-Tynion’s trademark¬–but other than that, DoT books are so viciously clever and sophisticated and mature that they are nothing, NOTHING, like the rest f the author’s work.Needless to say, after binging all the DoT books the library had, I was eager to read more Tynion, thinking…what did I miss out on there?Apparently nothing, going by this book. Which I downloaded purely on Tynion’s name recognition not realizing it was set in the same universe as Something’s Killing the Children. I should have realized it by the title alone, but SKtC is forgettable enough that the name didn’t stick to memory.Anyway, this is a prequel, giving you backstory on Aaron Slaughter who SKtC readers know as Erica’s rival. The book flips between past and present, so a bulk of it reads YA and of course, Aaron’s gay and there’s a gay romance. Tynion represents, as per usual. The book is visually attractive enough but the plot leaves a lot to be desired. Unless, of course, you’re a fan of that universe, in which case, you’ll probably love it. For me, it was mostly a reminder to really pay attention to plot summaries or at least basic descriptions, irrespective of the author....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Mar 04, 2023","Mar 04, 2023","Mar 07, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/62893649-house-of-slaughter

A welcome and most awesome quality for any novel, and most auspicious for a debut. It’s take on gender swapping was unique and fresh and just fun.I mean, this wasn’t mere Orlando for our time, this was different in every way. With potential to say so much about gender politics, relationship dynamics, etc. And it did…to an extent. For about 55% or so. And then it sort of meandered.Not a terrible thing because the writing is strong enough to engage even with meandering, but somewhat disappointing, mainly because the novel is good enough to verge on great.It goes like this, boy and girl meet, fall in love, get hastily married so that boy can accompany girl to the Balkans of all places, and then one day boy wakes up in the girl’s body and girl is nowhere to be found.Okay, girl and boy are not exactly accurate, these are two twenty-eight years olds, a vastly different two – different upbringings, different success levels, different drives, but still…They were kinda sorta making the differences work or plainly ignoring them until they couldn’t. Because apparently gender reversal throws a pretty significant wrench in the works.It seems like the book should have said more, like it was poised to say more, but then just as it was getting into the meat of it all, it decided to take an easy way out. Maybe it’s because I was so immersed in the narrative that I wanted more.Yes, it shifted perspectives and presented different views but never quite to the same level as part one with Eli as the narrator.The ending felt kind of…resigned when compared to the story’s potential and most of its narrative. Like, is this it? Is that all? Definitely leaves you wanting more.But then again, in a way that’s a compliment to the book. An overall good and interesting book that has a lot to say, even though it manages to say only some of it. People come together and stay together for different reasons, and it’s oftentimes an event random enough to pass for a collision. Dangerous or damaging as it may be, such collisions alter both parties. But then make for a good story. Featuring one of the best written, most plot relevant sex scenes I’ve ever read. That’s neither here nor there, but worth a mention. Overall, a good thought-provoking, engaging read. Recommended.

This book is a terrific example of that.

Some got out. This is their tale.Specifically, one psychologist who may quite possibly be too attached to her charges, but also the grand scheme of a city like Gotham, already quite chaotic and scary, with madness added on top.I didn’t quite love the art, not the way the artist rendered people’s faces, but that’s just regular people, so there was definitely more to see in the book.

I like him as an actor, I know he’s more educated than most actors, and I wanted to see, after reciting other people’s lines for decades, what sort of story he might come up with on his own.Well, that story is Kepler. A science fiction adventure with a clever and original concept and middling at best execution.The idea is that Earthlings found a planet in habitable Goldilocks zone and proceeded to slowly adapt it to their own needs, presumably for future colonization.The planet, Kepler, is populated with three species all reminiscent of early Earth people, like Neanderthals, and on its own was at a fairy primitive level, but with consistent deliberate interference by technologically advanced species, they got to the level of something like 1950s or ‘60s. These advanced species are worshipped in a sort of expanded cargo cult situation. But not everyone is happy with the situation. Some more so than others.There’s unrest on Kepler. It’s getting dangerous.At the center of all this action is a sixteen-year-old mixed-race girl. Why? Is this meant to be YA? It’s difficult to tell by the uneven writing and dialogue.Political intrigue, commentary on colonialism, environmental crisis, and more, Duchovny takes on a lot in Kepler, all sorts of current and trending topics, but the narrative falls rather flat. Something’s missing. It's messy and preachy, overambitious and overexplained. Planet of the Apes it categorically isn’t.Also, the look of it is weird. The faces are too weird.

I didn’t love all of Moreno-Garcia’s books–her fantasy efforts leave me indifferent. But this one…this one appears to be ripped straight out from my imagination.All the themes I love to see in fiction are here: movies, occult, historical events mixing with imaginary ones, yet another original historical setting (this time early ‘90s in Mexico City), magic (the right kind not the fantasy novel crap), cults, and just oodles and oodles of excitement.This book was SO much fun. Possibly author’s best since Mexican Gothic. Dynamic, thrilling, tough to put down from the first chapter straight down to the explosive (albeit considerably drawn out) denouement.Leave it to Moreno-Garcia to take two lifelong friends and mix them up with a shadowy Nazi occult magician and his followers, who have found a way to pursue arcane ends through modern (well, kinda sort since silver nitrate isn’t really in use anymore) means.They say movies are magic, but Moreno-Garcia puts her own, inimitable spin on that aphorism and succeeds wildly.Very, very awesome.

Goldberg doesn’t belong with all the pretentious twats around him, but he finds a kindred spirit in another “scholarship kid” who immediately becomes his new YOU.So the formula is there, but the execution is garbage. The romance (which is Goldberg’s sole raison d’etre) doesn’t work here, it’s too weak, too rushed. Of course, Goldberg’s romances are never right, that’s kind of the point, but here it never even seems right. The man comes across desperate and bitter, his famous narrative snark goes flat, tinged with angst and resentment in a way that obscures wit and charm and humorous social observations he used to specialize in. Kepnes has done it, it seems. She’s beaten her golden pony to dust. Used him all up and turned him into a sad caricature of himself.Wherein in season four of the TV show (at least the first five episodes since Netflix annoyingly divided them up), Goldberg is fun, fun, fun. Back to form and rocking it. Which is why the TV show is now billed as “inspired” by Kepnes’ books and she is no longer an executive producer. Outdone by TV writers. Outperformed by her own creation. Sad.So, hopefully, Kepnes can now leave Goldberg alone and maybe, just maybe write something new, and maybe it’ll be good and maybe not, but at least it’ll show range and versatility. Because right now her writing is only reflective of good business sense and marketability. The books are getting longer not stronger. Sad, again.Book four will make Goldberg’s fans annoyed. Maybe skip and stick with the TV show.

But I managed to subsequently forget it by the time, weeks later, I sleepily started reading it.So throughout the few hours it took to get through, I was thinking is this real? And only when I got to the end, did it register that yes, this was indeed real; a memoir.Freaking A. I don’t like memoirs. Certainly not by anyone too young to have written one. As a fiction, the narrative was rather far-fetched…can anyone really survive a family that horrid? An abuse that severe? Apparently. The author did.Even if fiction seldom if ever do you find a set of parents as horrifically villainous as hers. In fact, in fiction one might say it was over the top. But since this is real life…And yet, the author survived that nightmare to go on and chase dreams in New York City like so many gay girls with stars in their eyes before her. So then you got a large portion of the book dedicated to her string of tragic romances and sordid affairs with wildly inappropriate paramours only to eventually discover true love romcom style and live happily ever after. Ta-da.An arc as familiar as a classic sitcom plot. The writing’s decent enough, plain and not as funny as it was probably meant to be, but okay. Overall, nothing special, outside of horrific child abuse scenarios and romantic frankness.

It was very on brand for the author. The same sort of language and all, but this Southern Neo-Noir just didn’t land quite right with me.Smith does a great job with place as character, bringing to life the sinking south, specifically the Louisiana/Mississippi border, in vivid detail. But that is also the thing that sinks the narrative. Pardon the pun.The overwhelming amount of minute details is just enough for other characters to get lost in. Same with the plot. Or rather there isn’t enough plot here beneath all the precision-chosen words. Estranged father and daughter are reunited a few years after she took off with a much older man. Now, she is fleeing a danger the man brought into her life, the sort of thing where people get caught in crosshairs and die.The characters are interesting and realistic, but there’s such a disjointed quality to the narrative, it’s difficult to follow their individual stories. Kinda muddled, kinda messy. Not quite up to Farris’ standards. Stylish sure, stylistic even, but ultimately leaves you wanting.Still a good read, if only for the language and Oron. That dude was awesome, so much so, I’m going to round up my rating of the book. Also, a closing line for a title? A title for a closing line?

Drawing on extensive research, personal reimaginings, and various parallels, the author presents a fairly compelling quilt of a narrative. My main draw here was the historical aspect since I do not like and try to actively stay away from memoirs. Especially memoirs written by people who haven’t even hit middle age. Now only do I not care to read them, I also don’t like ing them, because it inevitably feels like I’m ing the person themselves. But how does one not do that? Seriously, how does one avoid forming judgements when reading heavily confessional accounts seasoned with equally heavy confessional details?Like how do I not think…well, this person is still single because she refers to her partners as lovers like some cheesy SNL sketch? Or question how someone who has relationships with men calls themselves a lesbian?See, what I mean? Profoundly personal business but one certainly opens themselves up to such inquiries when writing a memoir, no? Why even memoir at all? Is it a reflection on out modern culture of oversharing?Why not stick to the historical facts? Those were genuinely interesting. Maybe the author’s story might be too, sometime in the future. But biographical accounts present complete lives, different times and mentalities, different journeys in a much more interesting way. Often not needing interjections of what the author and her lover did or the author’s musings on her unshaven legs. At any rate, whatever you get out of this book, it’s worth a read. It is an objectively clever use of historical research to shed light on past more fascinating and storied than is seen at a brief glance.

The water has all sorts of terrifying things in it, hiding expectantly, ready to shred. Well, that and Aquaman.And so, using uniquely British folklore, this story makes you think twice about water. What’s there? So hungry, so ready to devour.One intrepid journalist is determined to find out. The recent events collide with her traumatic childhood experience in a way she can’t let go off. And so she goes back to her small town and sets off to uncover the truth behind all these people being dragged down into their watery graves. This was my first time reading Reynolds, and the first impression is solid. The man knows how to tell an exciting well-paced tale. I liked the backstory, the descriptions, the writing style.On the flip side, I wished the narrative was done in the past tense, for some reason the present tense for this particular story didn’t quite work for me. Didn’t like the ending much. And, most importantly, didn’t much like the protagonist, Sam. Specifically, I found her obnoxious, rude, and annoying. Don’t know how she got anywhere as a journalist. Just a sort of off-putting lead for a book. But overall, it worked well enough, and was a pleasantly quick read and a very decent introduction to the author.

But it is nice to see that he’s a man of many talents. And as much as I don’t care for modern poetry, this collection was actually quite nice.I mean, nice may not be a particularly exciting descriptor, but in this case, it seems really accurate. Colins essentially writes about his life, his poems are mini confessionals. A bulk of them is about the decades-long love he’s shared with his wife and it was to find out in the afterword that after 30 years together the two of them separated. You’d think poetry like that would be enough of a glue to hold them together, but alas…Other than that, he cries a lot, he jogs a lot (shirtless, ladies), he thinks a lot about his purpose in life. There are meditations on family, children, etc.Supernatural isn’t mentioned just so the fans know.Overall, this reads almost like a stylized memoir. Plenty of sharing is done, though apparently Collins is still holding something back. The poems have a pleasantly descriptive quality to them and give a strong impression of a man behind them. It comes across as sincere and not particularly vanity-driven, which is nice too. Ah, there’s that “nice” again. But if the shoe fits…A quick read.

I don’t actually care for true crime, but serial killers are undeniably interesting from psychological perspective. Especially, the unusual ones. Especially, female ones.I’ve never heard of Belle Gunness, not the woman, not the mystery. A Norwegian immigrant who became America’s first serial killer and by all accounts racked up a terrifyingly impressive body count.The story is fascinating, the book should have been riveting. And yet, it chose a different path. Specifically, a purely narrative, all-in-the-mind, almost stream of consciousness like style that never varies until the last page. A style that often works with short stories but stretched over 200 pages becomes rather…dense, monotonous, difficult to enjoy. Unless you really want to spend that much time in Belle’s lovelorn, affection-hungry, careening straight into madness mind.Yes, there is a hypnotic quality to this style of writing, it’s elegant and literary, and it’s easy to see what the author was going for, but the overall result just didn’t work for me.

So here we go. A western Shape of Water tale.And if you’re thinking what? how? The west is dusty and arid and aquatic creatures need…well, aqua, then you’re absolutely right. It’s an undeniable fact and one the author inexplicably chooses not to address. At all. At no point during the 190 or so pages of this volume is it mentioned that the eponymous Charlie Fish, fished out and forced to live on land, needs or requires or might die without water. Go figure.But then again, the author kind of gets away with that logistical snafu because the book is so good. I don’t even particularly like westerns and I can recognize the beauty within these pages, the easy-flowing, organic narrative style, the profoundly engaging characters, the almost-musicality of writing.The story itself is very simple and straight-forward. In 1900 Galveston, Texas, a freshly cobbled-by-circumstance-together family (a widow, a lone man, two young orphan siblings–a seer and a gunslinger, and a sea creature) fights to survive a pair of scoundrels AND the most devastating natural disaster to hit US. Their abode might not be high enough for the rising waters, but their moral ground is as elevated as K2, which in many ways doubles their work and the danger.All in all, this book was an absolutely pleasure to read, one that went by quickly, delighting and entertaining throughout.

There’ve been other variations done on the same theme, most notably in Jeff Lemire’s superlative Ascender and Descender series.

Ironically so for something with the goal of doing just the opposite. There are other things too, notably a school shooting. But it’s handled…oddly. As choppily as the rest of the plot.Altogether, there are just too many disparate elements that never quite cohere into a smooth narrative. Seems like good intent can only drive a story so far.

This book is just the latest shiny example of the whimsical charm, originality and sheer fun that the author is skilled at producing all in a very neat, very readable 200 or so page package. While he usually veers on the science fiction side of things, this is more of a…fairy tale for adults. Still firmly a work of speculative fiction but a different one. This time, it’s a book about books. Or more like the book about the power of books, cleverly blurring the lines between fiction and reality.And so, when a D list actor and children show presenter goes on one of those genealogy TV shows to boost his popularity, he gets a wildly unexpected reaction to his reveal of being a scion and inheritor of a beloved kids’ books series estate. The books are a typical post-war Narnia-style fare, but the inspiration behind them is anything but.Soon, there’s all sorts of shenanigans and intrigue. The stories may have been fictionalized but the dangers are very real. And thus, you, the readers, get to have a fun and exciting adventure, through the wardrobe and back.Okay, to be fair, the wardrobe (and Narnia business in general) is a heavy borrow, and, frankly, too dominant here, including the cover, which might have been more attractive. I mean, the wardrobe in the book is way more attractive than the black slab gracing the cover and chapter separations. But other than that, this was a great, greatly entertaining read. Recommended.

A heavy multi-generational drama featuring a variegated cast of characters. Not of who are particularly happy. But complex, and that’s what one most likely wants in serious literary fiction.Most auspicious debut, this novel features some first class writing and it makes the story and its characters come alive in the most vivid ways. But then again, it’s heavy and not just in its page count/volume/weight, but in the way spending close to 400 pages with a bunch of profoundly unhappy and not overwhelmingly likeable characters can be.Besides we only et so much time with each. The novel spans four generations, so just as you get into one story, it ends and propels you forward in time. And sure, the old characters get revisited still directly and indirectly, through flashbacks and memories and side appearances, but it isn’t quite the same.And while the characters’ fallibility is rendered exceptionally, the sheer volume of it eventually weighs the novel down. Mind you, I don’t mind sad or tragic stories, but something about this novel was ever so slightly…oppressing. Just one devastation after another as all these people are scrabbling through life that doesn’t seem to offer much. All these private quiet devastations. And the stubborn determination to go on anyway. I suppose there’s something admirable about that. But also profoundly Sisyphean. At any rate, a very well written novel. Moving, poignant, depressing.

By design. The author discusses it extensively in her afterword. Which is fine. Different is good. But this book didn’t strike me as an improvement upon its exceptional predecessor.The genre remains, this is still very much a work of historical fiction with horrific elements interwoven throughout. The bulk of the novel takes place during WWII in the US and highlights American-Japanese relationship at the time. Specifically, what was done to Japanese people in America during those years. Dispossession. Discrimination. Internment camps.People may not rise to the occasion when love’s involved, but give someone a reason to hate and they’ll do their worst, every single time.So, seeing some modern parallels, the author wrote this novel. It is devastating, starkly bleak, frightening…but it is also overdone. Seems like when personal emotions get involved, things like this occur. Preachiness, heavy-handedness. You can’t argue with the novel’s message, but the transmission might leave something to be desired.Katsu can write. Of that, there is no question. She knows exactly how to write best-selling page turning sort of fiction. This book’s no exception. But it’s overinflated in content and overweighted by good intentions. The novel would be served very nicely by letting the terrors it describes speak for itself. And for the readers to draw their own conclusions. A more subtle approach perhaps.

It’s clever, hilarious, and poignant, and (okay, this one comparison really was kind of on the money) it does read like a Black Mirror episode, a good one, one on par with San Junipero.So I loved these short stories for how original, smart, quirky, interesting, bizarre they were. It probably won’t sing for everyone, but for those who do hear its funhouse tune, it’ll be pure magic. Recommended.

Still though, the publishers had a lot of gall in comparing this to Good Omens. This is about as far from Good Omens as Flame Tree Press is from top five.In fact, lately the quality of the books they’ve been putting out has been leaving a lot to be desired.In this case, they didn’t even manage to provide a proper ARC for Netgalley readers. The copy was rife with giant letters proclaiming a version of FOR YOUR EYES ONLY. As if it’s some great treasure to be protected at all costs. And yes, that sort of thing really does detract from reading enjoyment.The rest of it is essentially a tale of bureaucracy in Hell with strong undertones of sympathy for the devil. Moreover, the author ambitiously goes as far as to rewrite the entire history of the world as we know it, featuring an all female and partially queer star cast because he’s woke like that or knows what sells in today’s market. The basic plot involves a career businessman who lives, eats, and sh*ts work, getting recruited by Lucy Fair (get it? get it?) to improve Hell’s numbers and efficiency.The Lucy Fair joke is about as funny as it gets in this falsely-advertised-as-comedy production.There are some power struggles, some decently imaginative world building, some romance.

Not just any desk, of course. An antique grotesque with terrible bloody history to it. You know, just the sort of gift one might expect from a loved one with more money than sense. Madness ensues…So, how meta is it when a genre writer writes of a genre writer? Some?Both are men in their 50s, but Fracassi’s star seems to be ascending while his protagonist’s, Tyson’s, has been on a steady downward spiral for years. When we meet Tyson, he’s in the process of sabotaging his last chance at redemption by risking a deal with Morrow.But on the flip side, Tyson is a nice guy. Something of an old-fashioned flabby sad sack, but a devoted dad, a loving partner, a good friend, etc.And then his girlfriend decides to replace the desk he’s had since college and had written all his bestsellers at, with a 25K monstrosity. And Tyson immediately gets possessed by his new possession; his entire personality switch flips, and now he’s a total ass. Obnoxious, rude, volent ass. This is the guy you’re stuck with for the rest of the novel. But then, there is so plenty going on around Tyson. From a mysterious femme fatale coming after his precious desk to reboarding the rollercoaster of fame and fortune to the way it all affects his relationships. And at the center of it all is one freakishly terrifying desk.There will be blood. It’s only a matter of time.So did Fracassi succeed at writing a genuinely terrifying tale about a man desperately trying to write genuinely terrifying tales? Well, he comes close.The writing itself is somewhat uneven, peculiarly so because when it’s good it’s really good, but then there are weird repetitions, relays, all-over-the-place pacing and tonal switches. Sometimes it varies between near amateurish name-dropping fanboy glee and solid literary frightfest. It’s entirely possible some of it is due to this being an ARC, but it reads perfectly finished otherwise.But the sustained darkness of the overall plot and the mood are solid. As is the character writing. The book absolutely succeeds at drawing the reader into its nightmare and holding them there. I read the entire thing in one morning/afternoon, which is no small task given the book’s size (400 pages), so that alone speaks volumes of it. There’s definitely something about the way it all unfolds even though you know (you know) where it’s going and then that positively theatrical/cinematic denouncement. Very nice. So I’m rounding up my rating.Fracassi as a career screenwriter is, of course, no stranger to cinematic writing. What’s funny is that his screenwriting work was featured by Disney and Lifetime. Read this book, then think about that fact. It’s freaking hilarious. Overall, interesting, compelling, and worth checking out. Recommended for fans of dark fiction.

He’s by far my favorite Jeopardy GOAT which to the uninitiated is Greatest of All Time. He’s also a fun writer, and I’ve enjoyed his books over the years, so I immediately requested the ARC of his latest when it popped up on Netgalley.The concept here is charmingly simple…the book is essentially a compendium of afterlife as it is depicted in mythology, religion, books, movies, arts, etc. There are sections on each with alphabetically arranged entries. But, of course, Jennings ad libs. The idea here is to stick to the facts but give them a humorous spin, turning this into something of travelogue, albeit to destinations perhaps best left alone, speculative or otherwise.So do you want Jennings as your Virgil for touring the underworld? Well, sure, he’s a fun guy. So this book is on lighter side for such a heavy topic. But then it’s also lite as it lightweight in a way. Like Jennings deliberately holds back his famous snark and sarcasm it seems to appease the general public. Must be all that Jeopardy host training.He’s a smart, funny, erudite guy with sweeping knowledge of random facts and pop culture and he utilizes it all well, but…mildly? Like holding most of his opinions to himself. Which is a shame, says this reader, because nonfiction if often best when it is presented by an opinionated author.So basically don’t go in expecting too much meditation on the subject or comparative studies or things like that. You will learn some things, especially in the first two sections of religion and mythology. The rest are basically Jennings rehashing plots of famous books, movies, etc. Which is entertaining but only so much. And reader beware, he does give away the plot. Every single time. The ending and all.So overall, this quirky travelogue is somewhat educational, plenty entertaining, leaves something to be desired (specifically more of the author's personality, thoughts, opinions, etc.).

Or more like Mick, his ex-Army protagonist, is back. It’s been two years since his last adventure and Mick is now officially retired, so he gets back to the only place he thinks of as home and immediately gets involved in some murder business.By now Offutt has established something of a formula for his protagonist. There’s never a lot of time, so his involvement always is immediate and he never stays away for long. And then there’s all the backwoodsy, backwatery hills business. Apparently with a code of their own. Which makes for their very own brand of justice among other things.Offutt is a one trick pony, but he’s really mastered that trick. His writing is really good, which brings me back to his books time and again. Now his trickery is even more limited since instead of standalones, he’s focusing on a series. Cue in repetition, recycling of similar scenes, plots, attitudes, etc. Probably more lucrative and certainly easier to write, but considerably less interesting for more demanding audiences. And yet, it’s fun in its own way and Mick is a solidly likable guy. Maybe too much so, since Offutt has made him into something like a knight errant, all too good and too noble. Also, conspicuously free with his money and his prospects. Generosity so off the charts, it may not even be in the code, but Mick’s own.Personally, backwoodsy backwatery setitngs don’t do much for me. Kentucky or otherwise. Offutt renders it very well, but it gets tiresome after a while. Appalachian Neo-Noir or whatever this is has got to be a matter of acquired taste. Like moonshine, country music, and all manner of hillbilly delights. But if one must read about it, Offutt is a good go-to author. The man can write.

But there isn’t much conventional about The Merc with a Mouth, the charmingly abrasive, sarcastic and only somewhat heroic character who enjoys casually taking a sledgehammer to the fourth wall.And so I’ve read and enjoyed some Deadpool comics. This one, though, not so much.The premise here was to take a classic eighties comic adventure, one of those huge productions with all the supers uniting and fighting an intergalactic supervillain, and infuse it with some Deadpoolness. To be fair, the comic needed it, as you can plainly see from the original included at the end of this book. The original that’s all too serious and much like most Marvel comics of its time dramatically overwritten, overexplained and goofily drawn.This collaboration is an improvement in every way, it looks and reads more fun. But still not enough fun because one can only do so much with a stale premise and clichéd supers. The concept is entertaining much in the same way as Deadpool movies being by far and away the most entertaining (and clever) of all of Marvel Universe productions, but it only goes so far. At the end of the day, Deadpool does better on his own with his own comically bizarre adventures and not following the preset, same old, trite and tired Marvel playbook.

Very clever. Modern audience is probably (sadly) most familiar with Norse Mythology from Marvel Universe. Think of this as a clever expansion pack. Closer to the origin, goofier, and more elaborate.

The diary entries interspersed with the main narrative might have been done tighter, the story began to drag out after a while. The evilness of the mask might have done with more of a backstory.

Coppel’s writing is usually very streamlined, plain and simple, but here it’s all the way down to basic.

Based on the surrounding writing, one might guess the latter.But either way, she mayb be the center but she isn’t the star of the show here. The star is Christmas, North Pole, Santa. Which is to say whatever this novel doesn’t bring in narrative quality, it makes up for in sheer imagination by serving up the most awesome Christmas origin story. A wildly imaginative, genuinely original origin story.So yeah, it really works for a Christmas read, simple and cheesy and sappy as it might be at times. Made for a fun quick read.

To be fair, the books I’ve read of his were very different–standalone original stories. So this is quite a departure. But he still features an Indian protagonist, and his writing remains the same: very strong and possibly too lyrical for a superhero comic. Just possibly. Maybe that is just the tone of Swap Thing. Or maybe that’s just the direction Ram V. and the comic universe powers that be wanted it to go. Either way, you get a moody and brooding creature and the reluctant man behind him. Then again, you can’t blame him, carrying the green mantle is a heavy thing. With so much at stake.Swamp Thing is likely the most environmentally conscious superhero, so there’s a lot of meditation on that. And then, there’s the art. This book is Oh Wow striking. The artist did that spectacular of a job. Because Swamp Thing doesn’t cut the traditional supe figure, the art here is by and large above and beyond a typical supe comic. Absolutely gorgeous. By far the most striking Ram V. book I’ve read thus far.So yeah, good writing, awesome art…there’s much to like here. Even for those who, like me, prefer original stories and characters. Because there’s still a present comic universe – DC Universe – I can’t say I loved it, but it was fun.

Lately more so since they’ve acquired a strongly relatable side. This debut novel fits both of those categories and for those and many others reasons it is easy to love.This is a tale of a family whose lives revolve around writing, albeit for each of them it’s a completely different story. Some of those stories are less likely than others.And so we have a patriarch – Ward, a preeminent writer, allegedly the voice of his generation, albeit his fame has possibly more to do with cultivation than talent. We have his almost unbelievably tolerant wife, Claire, who has nourished his talent and ego in simply stupendous ways over their long marriage. And we have their only child, a thirty-five-year-old Isabelle, who desperately wants to be a writer good enough to impress her father – at the expense of all other things in her life.Overall, this stew of a family is somewhat toxic. There’s love there, but the balance is off, especially, once Claire passes away, leaving Ward to obsess over his dwindling career and Isabelle to obsess over her non-starting one. Throw in a catalyst and watch it all unravel.So…is it kinda sorta reminiscent of Meg Wolitzer’s Wife? Yeah. Is the ending of it wrapped up too neatly with a bow that slightly perfumes-stinks of women’s fiction? Slightly. Does Claire come across as too much of a martyr? Yes, kind of. But the rest is just so freaking good, it obliterates the detractors.The writing is so strong, so finely emotionally attuned, so propulsive. And the characters…Abramson has a real knack for writing unlovable people lovingly. In all their numerous faults and foibles, they still engage you, still make you care. And her meditations of success, fame, and talent in this book are absolutely terrific. All of which makes for a first rate literary novel and a first rate reading experience. Recommended.

For me that glaring omission has long been 1984. Why? No real reason. I love dystopian fiction. I appreciate classics. I know all the pop culture references from the book. And still the novel remains elusive until I came across a graphic novel adaptation of it at the library. That’s when I knew the time has come. And so, now I have read it. And I’m happy to report, it is as good as everyone says and very much a classic in the real meaning of the word – timeless.What I didn’t expect as how terrifying it was. Positively horrific, and I’m a longtime genre connoisseur so I say that with conviction. For my money, 1984 of the grandest works of psychological terror.It’s also very well-written, engaging, and emotionally devastating. And very, very smart. Viciously clever. Still strikingly relevant all these decades after publication in its estimation of the world and people in it, social order, authoritarian regimes, and power delineation. The graphic adaptation featured art very well suited to the story, with almost cartoonish faces but really heavy scenery, reinforcing the tone, the ambiance, and the message of the novel. Overall, a powerhouse and a masterwork of dystopian fiction. Of fiction in general, really. It really ought to be required reading.

And Adam, in his grief and his anguish, falls back onto his former experience as an investigator to try and figure out just what happened.He begins poking around and, before he knows it, his journey is taking him right behind the curtain of Annie’s life (fraught, complicated, messy) and music business (much the same) itself.Like many people, Annie Linden was more likeable and admirable when shrouded in mystery, but Adam can’t stop, won’t stop. Not until he finds out who killed the last songbird.A very solid debut from Daniel Weizmann. Well-written, character driven, exciting. The author writes music like someone who really knows music, the way it stays with you, lives with you, defines you. A very LA story–drive all night, bright lights, outsized personalities sort of thing. A very solid neoNoir tone to the narrative. A very solid suspense thriller that has you guessing until the very end. This one works on all levels and entertains plenty. Recommended.

And how often do you finish the book and walk away in pure awe of the author’s talent? I’ve been impressed with DiLouie since his Children of Red Peak, so I was excited to check out his latest and he certainly did not disappoint. The opposite, in fact. Well, ok then, now I’m very, very impressed.There’s been a slew of novels lately that tell a story in found-footage style. It’s often surprisingly effective, and I saw surprisingly because I don’t much care for the found-footage style in cinema. It might just be something more suited to written word.At any rate, DiLouie does it justice, utilizing camera footage, journal entries, interviews, etc. to present us, the readers, with an unforgettable episode of fictionalized television.Fade to Black is another one of those ghost hunting shows, striving to distinguish itself by primarily utilizing the strong dynamic of its married cohosts–he’s a believer, she’s a sceptic. Together they investigate the paranormal. And they find the best place to do it; a site of a long-abandoned psych experiment that seems to have been sitting around waiting just for them, untouched and shrouded in mystery. Sitting around all the way from the 60s and 70s, when groovy psych experiments were all the rage. Only this time, the experiment might have actually grazed upon something…in a way, though there’s no one left to tell the tale–the scientists have vanished, the subjects (mostly) didn’t make it. So yeah, a perfect setting to hunt some ghosts, make some fun tv, distinguish oneself from a million similar shows.Fade to Black team goes in. What they find in the place…well, you just have to read to find out. If you dare. It’s one of those trips–a terrifying descent into darkness and madness, where supernatural and metaphysical blend and distort all reality. A classic case of abyss gazing back. As mentioned, pure wow. Nearly impossible to put down, electric ride of a story. Bravo, author. Must read for genre fans. Recommended.

The quality is there, and the theme is just right: Asian women in dark speculative fiction. Bookended by famous author provided Foreword and Afterword and featuring lesser known names as entries, this anthology takes on the restrictive gender stereotypes, the oppressing importance of conventional family structures and heavy weight of expectations that Asian culture traditionally places on women.The range of the stories is quite striking and most are very good, very compelling. Definitely good introductions to some new authors (a lot of them from Australia and New Zealand) for me. I can’t say there were any real standouts for me, but that bodes well for the overall quality. I know I cared less for the more fantasy-like tale and enjoyed the more realistic narratives.

Very, very good.Does anyone else see Paul Newman’s face in Shadow’s? Why does Fabry’s idea of Shadow varies so much from the other artists? It’s like he draws a different character, one, oddly enough, darker and darker skinned as the story progresses, when Shadow is clearly described as ambiguously multiracial, a crucial description–a mix and a melting pot in one man to echo the multiracial makeup of the country itself. Also, weird to learn just how much the artists relied on Photoshop. Maybe I’m just old-fashioned enough to find it weird.But at any rate, what an adventure. Categorically an epic.

Even watched Starz’ mess of an adaptation. Well, some of it, anyway, Before it became utter caca.American Gods is the last time Gaiman did proper adult fiction. Which boggles the mind because he is so, SO good at it. But for some reason he seems to prefer children and YA writing, even though he occasionally passes the latter for adult. So then, it’s special.So then, naturally I was interested in checking out the graphic adaptation. Yes, it’s three volumes, but the book itself is huge. Plus, I like Russell’s art, and the guest artists are just as good. Reading volume one was a trip down memory lane. I don’t usually remember books very well because I read so many, but some are more memorable than others. Plus, the TV show did get some things right. Not Shadow, not really. In my mind he’s forever kind of like young Vin Diesel. I actually do prefer him as Russell draws him to the Starz’s casting, but in the graphic novel he doesn’t look that huge. Not like he’s meant to be. Tall yes, but quite slim, actually. Nice face, though. And faces are kind of weird in this book at times, weird angles, anyway.The book itself though does the original justice. There’s a lot of material to process there. It’s why the TV adaptation likely failed, but books are a different beast. And Gaiman is no stranger to comic book writing, so this works. This works very nicely.Even knowing the story, I found myself completely drawn into the mysterious world, much as Shadow Moon does. Completely admiring the author’s skill and imagination. The artist’s talent. All in all, a very good read. Now all I want to do is read the rest of the books. Long as they are. I suppose that’s as much of a compliment as one can pay to a book.

After Death. After science figured out functional immortality. And we, the readers, are following a protagonist who questions it, in a similar manner as Conway does in the original.Is it a compelling journey? You bet.

Plus, Lemire’s expressive ink and watercolor art. (Which actually looks so very much (too much?) like his Roughneck book). But back to Snyder…he’s obviously talented in either form. And this book alternates seamlessly between an illustrated novel and a graphic novel, all in service of a story.And it’s a really good story too, interesting, emotionally potent, and with a great plot twist in the end to boot.Thought provoking too.

Loads of money, a 16.5 million dollar penthouse and the evil child, whom Gil ends up inheriting when a car crash orphans the kid.Gil and his sister have been estranged for years, ever since her evil kid nearly killed Gil’s daughter. So understandably, Gil, his wife, and two daughters are reluctant to take the kid in now. But not only is he family, not only is Gil technically his godfather, but the kid is also worth a ton; his monthly allowance alone is 10K. This, Gil, reluctantly figured, will help them get out of debt, maybe put some money aside for college funds. Plus, the kid is already seventeen. Practically, an adult. In eight months, he’ll be off to college and that’ll be that.Sound logical, right?Interestingly enough, the kid, well the young man, really, when he arrives is nothing as expected. In fact, he is nice, polite, charming. Very smart. Very personable.But while others may begin to relax around him, tentatively toeing the forgive-and-forget waters, Gil is as vigilant as ever. Gil believes the kid to be evil and will stop at nothing to prove it to the rest of the world. Gil would die trying to prove it.And so, the games begin. Taut phycological games. And it’s oodles of fun.Yes, it’s kind of one-note in a sense that you see where it’s going and then it goes exactly there. Yes, there isn’t a twist one might expect in the end. But still, oodles of fun.So yeah, evil kids. Nature or nurture? Or is it just a flaw in the design? Either way, the concept entertains. Recommended.

An insightfuDykette is one of those novels that’s supposed to be good if not revelatory, a sort of modern manifesto on lesbianism, queerness and all. An insightful incisive look at gender, sexual orientation, etc. Graphic, visceral, splayed before readers, poised and primed to stun with its in-your-face, no holds barred narrative.And yet…Kinda hated it. Sorry. Tried as I might, it just didn’t work for me. The novel’s overt frankness seemed almost strategically manipulative and the emotional engagement just wasn’t there at all. Didn’t like any of the characters, not even remotely. Didn’t care for their lives, affairs, endless b*ching and moaning. Didn’t find any of them interesting.It’s frustrating, really, because the novel is rather well written, but it doesn’t matter how meticulously and eloquently one might describe their characters’ emotional states if the reader doesn’t care about those characters.The novel is essentially a tale of three lesbian couples of varied queerness who get together at the fancy end of Long Island for an extended Christmas vacation. And it is about as compelling as third-wheeling to a party you don’t care for.It’s meant to be funny according to the description. Really? I mean, the cover is, sure. The cover is great. The rest, though…Yey for increasing representation. Yey for effort? But the execution leaves a lot to be desired, resulting in a disappointing read.

So like most poetry collections, it’s a very, very personal thing.There’s a much too long author’s introduction that reads like a sort of political manifesto on immigration, assimilation, etc.And then it gets into the poems. Which, as modern times seem to require, are all rhythm and no rhyme. But the style and imagery are there, brightly vivid. The author uses so many Indian words that the collection comes with its own notes/glossary.

But then again, I’m not a fan of modern poetry – I don’t care for its choppy unrhymed inelegance and the highly self-focused/navel-gazing quality of most of it, so maybe don’t go by my opinion.

His stories are consistently difficult to categorize and equally difficult to put down. Though, to his credit, they are often short enough to easy land themselves to a single sitting read.Normally, Doubinsky writes a sort of oddball science fiction/dystopian/bizarro tales set in an interconnected universe. This is very much a new direction for him and I was excited to check it out.It also stands to mention that I’d read his co-author Breukelaar’s short story collection, Collision, and liked it too. Plus, I like few things more than a good scary story, so yeah…an easy choice all around.And it doesn’t disappoint.Beyond the creepy-ass cover, lies a procession of creepy-ass tales separated by seasons and more creepy-ass art.These almanac-style entries read like a strange blend of folklore, fairy tales, and horror. Some in prose, some in verse, these stories are invariably, unsettlingly spooky.Wherein Breukelaar seems to go for more poetic moody things, Doubinsky provides one subtle nightmare after another in his deceptively plain, marvelously effective style. The overall effect is uneven, with one of the co-authors noticeable outshining the other. But otherwise, it’s oodles of eerie fun. I stayed up well into the night reading it with the lights off and was properly disturbed once the book was over and my Kindle screen turned off, leaving me in the darkness. Because who knows what lurks there…right?And Seb Doubinsky’s terrific venture into the realm of all things horrific reminds us of that very thing. Very good read.

That was what attracted me to this book, and on that front it definitely did not disappoint. In fact, I am surprised by the low ratings this novel has on GR. I found it riveting. Difficult to put down. I actually ended up reading it on Thanksgiving so was forced to put it down on multiple occasions and every time found myself eager to go back. If that doesn’t sound like a ringing endorsement for a book, I don’t know what might.So yeah, I liked almost everything about it. The snappy smart writing and dialogue, the pop culture references, the strong characters. I loved the way the author dished out the suspense in proportional, tantalizing chapter-sized servings. And I loved how much random weirdness the author crammed into the novel from historical facts to magic to ley lines to other dimensions.The protagonist, Violet, is a perfect Gen X love child, and her acts are sometimes magical sometimes dangerous sometimes volatile. Yet, like a real magician she remains off-screen for the readers, told only through perspectives of others as the tenth anniversary of her mysterious disappearance dawns.The more you get to know her, the less you are certain of what to think of her. She’s deliciously complicated. And never easy. Certainly, she has never been easy on her only sister, to whom majority of the narrative belongs.In fact, that might be the only aspect of the novel I didn’t love. How in the end it seems like the entire production was mainly about sisterhood. That just isn’t that interesting to me. And it smells suspiciously of women’s fiction. Now magic…that’s different. For my money, this novel should have maintained its focus on magic.Either way, I enjoyed it tremendously right up until the final plot twist. And even afterwards, the overall impressions are good. This was definitely a smarter, more original thriller than most.

And nI was ever so sad about the cancellation of BBC’s Gentleman Jack – it’s the lesbian, thinking person Downton Abbey, in case you’re not familiar. And now, having read this biography of Jack’s wife, I’m thinking maybe they did end it at just the right time. It would have been terribly depressing going forward.Why so?Well, because it’s kind of a sad story. It’s a love story, for sure, and a passionate one at that, but ultimately, not a very happy one.But then again, the main premise of this biography is that a woman mustn’t be defined by the actions of their spouse (however famous or infamous) alone. To that end, the author has done some admirably meticulous research and created this excellent portrait of a woman of her time. Fleshing out character traits and personality from glimpses, references, empirical evidence of the time and Ann’s own (albeit scant comparing to her wife) diaries, Batley brings Ann Walker’s life to…well, life. Exactly as intended.Was it a good life? Well, not especially, but then again, Ann Walker did not live at a time that was particularly kind to women, especially women who dared to row against the current as it were.Ann was very much a woman of her time in great many respects, a charitable wealthy religious woman deeply entangled within the web of her family. Not regarded as particularly strong mentally or physically, she had always been treated as such by people around her.In fact, her life is punctuated by episodes of what now would have been described as anxiety, depression, etc. and back then was a locked-up-able offense.And then, there was Jack. Who swept into her life comet-like, and changed it forever. All of Ann’s reluctance, all of Ann’s upbringing and ides couldn’t make her stay away.The two of them begun a scandalous affair, disapproved by virtually all around them, and despite it all, ended up being married (after a fashion). And then, like so many married couples they proceeded to make each other desperately unhappy.A tragic fate, really, for such an awesome historical first as a first lesbian marriage.They were together for six years during which Jack cheated, lied, and went through Ann’s money like water.And yet, Batley does a great valiant effort of teasing out the softer moments, the genuine signs of love and affection between the two. The relationship didn’t last; death did them apart six years in. Ann ended up committed by her family and then quietly retired to fade away. Neither Jack nor his wife had lived long, and yet, Jack’s words have preserved them both, ensconced in diary pages as if in amber. And isn’t that awesome to contemplate?Now Batley restores some of the imbalance of the relationship by presenting the other side, for there are always two. And does a great job of it. A very good biography and a very good read. Recommended.

And then promptly blew me away.Not every author can transition so smoothly, and sure enough, Poster Girl’s protagonist’s most crucial time (until the events of the story unfold) is when she was sixteen and seventeen, but this is an adult novel through and through and an exceptional one at that.Once upon a time, Sonya Kantor was the eponymous poster girl for Delegation regime. Then the regime collapsed. Now, Sonya, the sole survivor of her family, is locked up in a large self-governed prison system Aperture along with other followers of the old regime, while a new regime reigns supreme.Most people locked up at kids are being released, but Sonya is just above the age cut off, and therefore is likely to stay put, getting by in a bleak world of prosecuted has-beens, performing small repairs to stay sane and useful. And then, she is given a chance. Find a young girl reassigned to another family by the old regime and all will eb forgiven. And so, she begins her investigation, pulling various threads until the entire fabric of all she’d ever known about the world and her family unravels.So yeah, this book gets a wow from me. A solid, vividly rendered dystopian character-driven fiction loaded with sustained suspense and clever plot twists until the very end. Very well done.The sort of book you can’t put down.

Anything to do with books and people who love them, deal with them, deal in them, etc.The drawback was a number of negative or lukewarm s, but turned out, none of that mattered ¬ I found the book to be an utter delight. A classic mystery at its best. A golden oldie that actually deserved its moniker.It begins with a death of a bookseller. And, his friend, a policeman, who refuses to leave the case alone. Even when a suspect is arrested. See, the policeman is an amateur bookdealer himself, someone who was just taking his first steps into the world of first editions and printed word trade, when his guide, his new friend, was murdered, and now he simply can’t let it go until justice is properly served. To this end, on his own time and against his supervisor’s advice, he’ll plunge himself into the murky wheelings and dealings of the booksellers. And yeah, it seems mild, but it can be murder.There’s also a fun supernatural aspect here you don’t usually encounter in this type of fiction, where the murdered bookseller in life speculated and specialized in the occult and may have dabbled in it too. It seems that a lot of readers didn’t care for it, but for me, as a genre fan, it was the cherry on top.Farmer had actually worked as a cop and was a book collector, so he brings his first-hand experiences to really flesh out and detail the world he’s writing about. As a result, the book is vivid, engaging, and a pleasure to read. Plus, his characters are…well, they are really a cast of characters, quirky, off-beat, oddball bunch, plus, a genuinely decent protagonist, a good man, a policeman of good values and good steady manner. Just what one might need to sort through this lot.Nowhere near as dated as some of the older mysteries and lots of fun to play along with.

It’s as atmospheric, loaded with suspense and excitement and thrilling as you’d ever want in a scary story. And as gorgeously rendered as comics go. The thing with my reading of it was that the library only had the first five available for ages, so by the time I found the last volume some of the momentum of the story was, admittedly, regrettably lost. Which is to say that the conclusion, however appropriate and dramatic, underwhelmed ever so slighty. To be honest, confused ever so slightly too, but then the volume provided Lemire’s original script so that helped figure out all the nuances.At any rate, Lemire’s version of the upside down – the nightmarish world on the other side – is well worth checking out. In fact, his vision may be more complex than the original reading suggests. Just check out the supplemental materials in this volume for the multiverse logistics and schematics. It’s really impressive.And that art, those gorgeous double panels, the cubes and slices and Möbius loops of Lemire’s imagined reality are just…wow.Spooky. Freaky. Fun.

The stiltedness and triteness of the first chapters demonstrates this especially. Almost amateurish. And very, very basic.

Not perfect (more on that later), but really, really good.Do I love Westerns? No, not particularly. I’m not even sure this one qualifies, although it is a novel of American West with the place as prominently featured as any character and deadlier than some.Into this windblown and isolated Montana setting, a woman arrives. She plans to homestead, taking advantage of the opportunity offered by the government, and to that end she acquires a small remote property. All she has with her is a large heavy trunk.A trunk that we as the readers watch her leave her parents’ farm with in the stunning first scene. The farm behind her on fire, the bodies of her parents left behind to burn. It’s positively cinematic. But Adelaide is a woman with secrets. All will be revealed in good time, just you wait.In Montana, she finds a patchy community of self-determined resolute wind-beaten womenfolk she proceeds to associate with, however reservedly.But then the trunk is opened and her secret leaps into the world. Danger sighs flash as Adelaide panics. All the while the world around her with the local politics and local powers that be have their own ideas about the land and the people of it…and that’s a different but all too real sort of danger too.Negotiating her traumatic past and her complicated present, Adelaide proceeds. With a marvelously variegated cast of friends she acquires. And as a reader you can’t help but cheer for themThat’s how emotionally engaging this book is; how well written it is, how exciting it is.It really is such a great book; one of the few I read and had it play as vividly as a movie in my mind.But remember that thing about it not being perfect…well (and this might be purely personal), I don’t care for speculative fiction that overpowers itself with messages. Or more like MESSAGES.While I appreciate diversity (race, gender, sexual orientation, etc.) in my reading, LaValle seems to really lay it on heavily here. Yes, the book is very Girl-Powered, with a strong feminist message. Yey. Yes, the book features characters of different races and ethnicities and queerness and all that. Yey.But does it have to be handed quite so heavily? I mean, almost literally the book is divided so that all the good and moral characters are people of color and LGBTQ+ umbrella and all the evil ones are white sisgendered individuals. At least the gender thing isn’t as divisive: there’s a nice pair of female villains to counter all those virtuous ones.But really? LaValle is too good of an author for such unsubtleness.Then, there’s the ending – so fist-pumpingly proud, so pretty-bow-happy, and quaint for a story that dark, it’s almost jarring. But then again…by then you care about the characters so much, you kind of want that sort of resolution, no matter how twee or over-sentimental. In the end and overall, this book was a pleasure to read. And a thrill too. The best of both worlds. Wildly entertaining tale of secrets, redemption, forgiveness.

Oh no, Cline is genuinely and hugely talented.The way she writes – it has that certain mesmeric quality. Particularly effective with this novel, which is essentially a prolonged trainwreck sequence.You’d think a novel that hinges entirely upon a shoulders of a not-especially likeable protagonist wouldn’t be so compelling and yet…you just can’t look away.Maybe not quite a trainwreck, but the momentum is similar. It’s also kind of like one of those scenes where a character loses their footing and they pinwheel their arms as fast as they can trying to regain it and never quite do. Gravity always wins out.That’s what Alex is doing, pinwheeling for her life. Not much of a life, one made of scrounging, using people, stealing, lying, manipulating, kind of like a perpetual low grade grift to stay afloat. One might make an argument that at twenty-two, she just doesn’t know any different, but then again, she had seen plenty in her short years. Mostly from working as a sort of prostitute/escort in the city, through associating with all manner of characters from upper echelons of society to bottom dregs. Fleeing one of the latter, a dreg that won’t let her go because she stole from him, Alex hitches a ride to high life with a man thirty years her senior and costs in luxury for a while until she screws that up too and gets booted out.Determined to get back into the cushy life the man provided, she decides to stick around and win his affections back at the upcoming party. All she has to do is kill a few days.Which turns out to be a surprisingly killer proposition for someone who’s short on funds, good graces, and ability to not f*ck up.See, that’s sort of Alex’s specialty. Even if she means well, things just spin out when she’s around. And most of the time she’s either too drunk or too high to properly pilot herself.So yeah, not an overwhelmingly sympathetic character and yet…The way Cline writes her, you just can’t look away, as she leaps from frying pan into the fire, over and over, until the inevitable and stunningly rendered conclusion.And underneath all that, there’s a simmering commentary on the wealth divide and class differential and people living in a dizzyingly stratified universe where people like Alex, essentially all service people of the world can easily and unnoticeable fall by the wayside as the elite continues to prosper in pampered unfathomable luxury.What a terrific novel. A striking study of what it's like to be constantly living at someone's whim and mercy. To depend on the kindness and decency of others reluctant or unable to give it.

I’d even say above that. All the classic genre presets from mostly female cast to the alternating storylines and timelines and prerequisite plot twists in this tale of a podcast-maker who comes to small town and over the course of a few days stirred up enough mud about a two-decade old case of (you guessed it) the girls who disappeared that the bodies start turning up.To no one’s (well, no one who’s ever read a thriller) surprise, someone doesn’t want the truth to be known. Someone has been covering it up all this time and wants it to stay that way.All around entertaining if not vastly original production, elevated by strong compelling writing and nicely sustained element of suspense with even tinges of supernatural to add some color/darkness to the proceedings.The book’s on a longer side but reads quickly enough.

This is, of course, just one reader’s opinion. A reader, it stands to mention, who is quite particular about their science fiction but loves scary stories and creature features unabashedly.I mean, these stories were fine. Then first one was quite good, but then they all seemed to be if not same or similar then certainly in the same vein. All leaning heavily on some sort of intergalactic war situation. And I do not like military angle in fiction, especially sci-fi (a good WWII story is a different matter), so this collection didn’t quite work for me.Also, because the stories seems so alike, there wasn’t much of a range. When the range did make an appearance – Politicos – it was most welcome. But it also highlighted just how alike the rest of the stories were.There are glimpses throughout the collection of Chambers writing stronger and darker, mor horrific things, and I wish he’d lean into those more.Either way, they went by quickly enough, at 158 pages this collection doesn’t overstay its welcome and is an entertaining read.

I’ll try, anyway.Expect Me Tomorrow is my first rIt’s difficult, so very difficult, to explain why you don’t love the book that is so obviously good. I’ll try, anyway.Expect Me Tomorrow is my first read by the author, though I absolutely loved the cinematic adaptation of his movie Prestige. Granted, some of that love might have had to do with it being about magicians (one of my favorite subjects) and he fact that it was simply a very well-made movie, but still…So, that’s what made me aware of Priest, and when this, his latest novel, came up on Netgalley, featuring more twins and alternative timelines and science, I figured it was time to check him out.Well, ok, I did. Took days to get through – unusual for me. And for a book not much over 300 pages.There’s so much good within these pages, too. Priest has really crammed it with plots and subplots and information. The latter of which might have been the novel’s downfall for me.Downfall’s too dramatic, though; more like a lamentable detractor.There’s a paragraph or two toward the end where one of the characters described the book by another as heavy going and too loaded with detail or something like that, and it’s exactly my opinion of this novel.For all the ingenious interwoven structure of the plot, for all its clever use of utilizing a dramatized version of an old true crime case, for how well it alternates between historical and futuristic fiction, for all of its prescient timely message about the climate…it is so freaking heavy going, dense, and minutely detailed that it’s kind of a slog to read.The climate message particularly is very heavy-handed here. In both timelines. The first protagonist is a climatologist from late 1800s/early 1900s; the second is a police consultant enhanced by experimental technology who gets involve in analyzing and creating a climate report.The trick (well, one of them) is that the latter is a descendant of the former, and through his new tech device he traces his relative in time and contacts him.The irony is that climatologist of yore wasn’t paid much attention to because the science was too new and too experimental, and in 2050, similar reports are ignored or dismissed as alarmist, because people are simply too stupid and self-involved to understand and appreciate them.Priest, though, pays attention. It’s obvious that a tremendous amount of research went into writing this novel, but that is also responsible for all the times it seemingly turns from fiction into a climate change documentary.Mind you, I’m all for it. This is a significant hugely important subject, and it should be taught, discussed, etc. but…maybe not to this extent in a fictional novel?It’s frustrating, really, because the novel is otherwise so well composed and written. Priest is obviously a very talented author and storyteller, and this novel of yesterday and tomorrow demonstrates it amply. But it weighs itself down with an anchor as heavy as it is well-meaning.So didn’t’ quite work for me. User mileage may vary.

Well, an armchair version thereof, but still…This short novel offered just that and did so nicely. The message of it might be fairly trite and heard-it-all-before: the contemplation of the meaning of freedom and all that…is it worth it to chuck it all (fame, fortune, etc.) away to live as you please or does one stay locked in a race wheel of success?The protagonist of this novel, a young journalist fresh from being dumped and crushed, who goes on one sensational assignment in a bid to get a promotion, wasn’t ready for all that contemplation. All he was after was a good story about the mysterious surfer champion.But the mysterious surfer champion isn’t all that mysterious – he’s just a man who’s tired of it all, had enough, and now just wants to surf in the sun.Which is an easy option because his gf is floating their lifestyle.And soon enough, the surfer’s laid back do what thou will ways are going to seep into the journalist’s mind. Of course, those types of choices/mentalities only work when there is something to throw away or walk away from, so it is, in a way, a privilege. But it is a tough choice and as such makes for a compelling read.In fact, no matter where you are on the moral choices here, compelling is what the author got right.

The book was nothing special and revisiting the author confirms it: meh all around.

Wizards? Ok, let’s give them wizards. A renegade mage with a wounded heart and a bleeding conscience. The sort that would do all sorts of forbidden things. Get it? Get it?Ok, well, fine.

Drives him to find her when she disappears. Leaving a doozy of a surprise behind.This is a love story, a science story, a road trip story. In its own way, set to its own melody, it is lovely.

Who has been doing just that for the many decades of her spectacularly prolific career. As this collection so marvelously demonstrates.I’ve read the previous collection Midnight Circus by Yolen before, so I knew what to expect and sure enough, this was a delight in every way. If one had to categorize it, something like romantic fantasy might suffice. Not to say these are all love stories, but they are about love, as all fairy tales in a way are.I can sing Yolen’s praises and use all sorts of excited superlatives…or I can just say that some people have the gift of natural storytelling and this author is one of them. He weaves her fairy tale gold just as expertly as any of the classic masters and leaves you just as warm and happy reading them. These stories are charming, lovely, things of beauty. Don’t care for poetry in the footnotes so much but that’s neither here nor there. The main attraction is utter delight, pure reading pleasure. For you, for your neglected inner child. Recommended.

Tudor being Tudor, this one still has plenty of elements of mystery and thriller, plus, concept alone (straight out of the recent few years) is enough to terrify and yet…And yet, the book left something to be desired. I believe it had to do with the fact that for the overwhelming majority of the novel, it reads like three separate stories and only toward the end does it properly come together.Sometimes that works. Sometimes it just kind of overpowers the story. I mean, the number of individual characters and plot threads alone was way too much here.And yes, Tudor being Tudor does bring it all together in the end in a very clever and satisfying fashion, but getting there is…kind of a mess, lots of juggling narratives. As a result, there’s a choppy quality to the book itself. Mind you, it’s still all very well written and eerily claustrophobic and all that, but it just…well, it just not really my favorite Tudor book. In fact, it’s my least favorite Tudor book.Considering the golden standard the author set with her previous works, even her lesser than is still a good read.

Well, in any case. I didn’t, reading it the same day I was approved for it by Netgalley.To its credit, the book was actually a quick read, making it possible to get through by bedtime.The question is, as always, was it worth it?So, I’m going to go with yes, but a conditional one.Ultimately, it’s a fun read. A young man kills himself in a pretty spectacular fashion by a disembowelment, and his suicide is preceded by a steadily declining mental state, hallucinatory episodes, etc. The young man’s sister, devastated and bereft, decides to find out what happened and in doing so gets closer and closer to his fiancé (ex-fiancé now) whose peculiar charms prove first irresistible and, later, dangerous.That sounds all kinds of fun, doesn’t it?Continuing…Since the book is pushing both the queer and the gothic element, let’s look at those.The gothic thing was done right. Mind you, it’s a thoroughly modern gothic, but it is set in the haunted Savannah, in a marvelously creepy townhouse Poison Ivy wouldn’t feel out of place in and it is dark. Very dark. There are some terrific claustrophobic elements at play there too.The queer thing…well, it works if you’re into the crazy/manipulative/femme fatale lesbians of the 90s cinema thing. Otherwise, it’s just ok. Don’t go into it expecting lots of sex either. The romantic aspects of this novel are firmly on a psycho side of things, but the plants…the plants are terrifying. The scares are in the flora, people. And that’s kind of fun and different.All in all, plenty entertaining with a nicely done creep factor. So much so, that the reading of it got more enjoyable as the night outside got darker. Recommended.

But then again, I hI’ve not read Landay until now because I had always thought of him as a writer of court dramas, and I don’t especially like those. But then again, I heard good things, so I kind of meant to. When the ARC for his latest came to Netgalley, I downloaded it, and then, upon a strong passionate recommendation of a good friend moved it up on my reading queue.Well, what can In say. I was missing out. That much was blatantly obvious from the first page.There’s this elusive, difficult to describe quality some writers have, like they were born to tell stories. The way their narrative just envelops you, the profound immersiveness of their books.Landay has that. Loads of it.The man can just take a deceptively simple tale that can be in theory summed up as A Man May or May Not Have Killed His Wife Forty Years Ago and make it sing. Make it wow.So how does he do it? Well, his writing is just that good. But also, he’s so clever about the narrative structure, about the subtleties of characters, about maintaining plausible deniability and suspense.The case is this: in 1975 a well-to-do lawyer’s wife and mother of their three children disappears without a trace. The suspicion inevitably falls on the man, because that’s just how it goes and because he’s kind of scummy, and with a girlfriend on the side.And yet no one can prove his guilt and so for decades him and his children and the wife’s sister are submerged in a sea of suspicion and mistrust.The following paragraphs may give away some of the plot turns, though I’ll take great care not to. Read at your discretion. You’ve been warned.The novel starts with a man writing a book about the case. The man has family connections and uses them, and of course not everyone in the family is happy about it. The eldest son maintains his father’s innocence or at least the right to be left alone. The youngest daughter is struggling with it all.Next up, a chapter from the dead wife herself. Just how that’s possible (and this is so freaking clever) you don’t find out until the next chapter wherein the family at last decides to get some form of justice and sues the father. Yes, now there’s a court drama and yes, it was my least favorite part of the book, but a. it was still compelling and b. it didn’t take very long.And then the last chapter, that sees the father as an old man with the youngest daughter as his devoted caretaker. And what did you expect really from an adult woman who never stopped calling his Daddy?Old age had mellowed the scum off the man and now he’s practically a decent if senile person, preparing to take his own life to avoid further degradation. Apparently, bygones have been relegated to bygone-specific places and some peace was found. And then, a bombshell of a revelation at the last moment. An ending twist that cuts like knife. Oh so good.OK, you can look now.Yes, that’s how you do did-he-or-didn’t-he novel. That’s how you do a novel period. What an awesome book. What an emotional powerhouse. One of the best reading experiences in a long while, and given the amount of books this reader/er goes through, that’s no small praise. Great read. Recommended. I mean, read this book. Go. Do it.

And TOR seems to love it; if publishing was prom, TOR would be a shoo-in for “most likely to prove their woke street cred” award.For me, the woke cred largely irrelevant. Personally, I look to TOR for latest in exciting science fiction, and, lately, horror. But, much like the case with this book, oftentimes the Message tends to override the story.And mind you, it’s difficult to write a less than glowing  of a trans-centric book by a trans author in this day and age and not get accused of transphobia (it’s always easier to throw dirt than take criticism) but that simply isn’t the case here. In fact, the book had a lot of potential and a conceptually fascinating haunted house. It just all got buried under The Message (fascism and transphobia are evil) so thoroughly, that only glimpses of the story managed to peak out.And yes, of course, fascism and transphobia are evil, and yes, both are on the rise as the world seems so steadily going to doodoo all around. And yes, attention must be paid and awareness/representation must be raised. And yes, there is a way to do it in speculative fiction, but not like this. It ought to be subtler, cleverer.The way the original Candyman and not Peele’s remake handled it. But then again, Peele is a stranger to subtlety when it comes to horror. Odd since he was so good at it in comedy.Anyway, back to the book. There is a haunted house there, creepy AF. There’s a trio of trans/transadjacent protagonists that spend time there. Most of the book is concentrated on the trio’s personal connections, which are…well, messy would be an understatement.The book is in-your-face visceral, rapey, definitely rated R, perhaps even NC-17, and while I’m not at all a prude, I found its viscerality absolutely disgusting (like, let’s wow the reader with how far we can push it) disgusting, disturbing, and sometimes just gross.That, just in case it requires mentioning, isn’t because of any trans related things, it’s just the way the author writes. Deliberately, it seems.So yeah, didn’t really work for me. Far be it for me to tell a book it’s worthless, but it certainly wasn’t worth my time.

The raindrops wipe away your memory, so depending on how wet you get, it’s anywhere from forgetting where you were going to forgetting how to stay alive.A very dangerous rain indeed.There’s no explanation for it. It’s just what’s going on in this novella. We know about this because we are told epistolary style via diary entries of an older woman, a determined survivor. She writes things down so she doesn’t forget them, she conducts experiments to determine the rain’s effectiveness, etc.Maybe it’s only rainy in her small corner of the world.

And as such it’s surprisingly solid and well done, especially for a debut. The plot is fairly straight forward. A Komodo dragon is minding its own business in the wilds of its native Indonesia when it gets kidnapped (dragonnapped?) and brought over to the swampy wilds of Florida. This is neither legal not well thought out, but greed is ugly and stupid, and now Florida has a hungry apex predator on the loose.Call in the troops. Or at least, TJ Forte, US Fish and Wildlife officer, who normally specializes in python but is smart enough to adapt.Now let the chase begin.Komodos are very smart, unlike most Floridians. So it takes locals a very long time to figure out that what they are dealing with isn’t just a renegade gator or two.There’s plenty of information about both species and more in the book. That was probably my favorite part: the author has obviously done loads of research and it shows in the way narrative comes to life in vivid detail. Both from people’s and Komodo’s perspective. Good amount of animal and people abuse, killing, eating, etc. Nature’s brutal.Overall, the book is dynamic, entertaining, and fun. This is one trip to Florida you’re going to want to take at an armchair remove.

Physically attractive and physiologically as messy as spilled garbage can, she finds two fundamentally nice people at the lowest point of their lives and proceeds to seduce and manipulate them in their roles as best friend and lover. For the reader, it’s almost difficult to see the appeal, since you can only imagine the physical beauty and the grifter charm is somewhat on a thin side with obvious red flags all over. But hey, it’s always easier for the observers. For people swept up in the sh*tstorm of a sociopath it’s a different story altogether.And quite a story. Trainwreck compelling and very well written.

It makes sense, even in a poetic sort of way; we are all haunted in some way by someone.This novel just takes it to a dramatically elevated level.

This is just how it goes when the writing is really good – it drags you in whether the narrative is relatable or not. It’s just that compelling, that exciting. And so, this bullet train of a novel does all those things. It drags you into the strange mad world its protagonists inhabit. It interests, excites, disgusts.

In fact, the way the color is used to stand out in the otherwise monochrome bluish tone of the narrative so perfectly matching North Canada where the story is set is very clever.The portraiture is expressive, just right for a story that’s a pure character driven drama. A story of a man whose life is driven by inherited violence beat into him as a child.

And while this folk horror frightfest is perfectly suitable for October, it would also make a great fit for Christmas since the story takes place around and on Winter Solstice.So whenever you’re choosing to read it…here’s my two cents.First and foremost, it’s an impressive tome: in sheer volume, in quality of writing, in haunting terror of it all. The concept isn’t the most original thing, but then again, what in genre is? You have your nightmarish creatures that sleep most of the time and sometimes wake up to demand sacrifices and wreak havoc on a small community. You have your heroic locals and your villainous locals and the epic battle between good and evil. And all that. So far so familiar. And like I always say, if you can’t reinvent the wheel, make sure to spin it well. That the author does. He spins his yarn well, expertly. Perhaps, too intensely so? By this I mean, it’s detailed. It’s exhaustively detailed. It reads nearly real time…sometimes, it reads longer than real time. Every action, every thought, is described with a precision of a clockmaker. It’s what accounts for much of the book’s considerable bulk. And it’s ultimately what served as the main detractor for me with this otherwise very good book.But it stands to mention, this is a very personal preference. I do not like fat books and I cannot lie. I find them (mostly) indulgent and overdone. I believe in streamlining the narrative. I also don’t necessarily need every single thing in the story to be described so minutely. For me it drags the reading experience down. Makes it kind of a slog. Which is crazy because this is by nature a very dynamic book chock loaded with action.Is that action fun? Yes, absolutely. Did it need to be described with such play-by-play precision? Not for me. But aside from that not-inconsiderable aside, the book gets a lot right. From a nice mythology-steeped backstory to strong exciting characters. The latter are pretty much all women. The author obviously knows what sells these days, but whatever happened to diversity? Don’t want to mix it up with some Y chromosome? No, not really, all women, the heroes and the villains. And good ones, too.And there are some really great intense scenes in the book that actually work due to or in spite of the overdetailing.So, overall, a well written, atmospheric, exciting literary horror, albeit at times much too long and over-rendered for this er. In recognition of all that's right here, I'm even going to round up my rating.

But still, her life hit the peaks of…positively cinematic dimensions. Makes for a good story, at least.Does this graphic novel add something new to what I already knew about Lamarr? No, not really. It repeats the same known facts with a smidge of speculation necessary for dramatization of events. The art is serviceable and brightly colored, but cartoonish in a way, with a distinct European style. If you know nothing about this remarkable person and her remarkable life, it’s a good primer. If you know biographical basics and looking to learn more, it’s just an ok read. And if you’re just looking to read for the sake of reading, it’s a quick and entertaining story....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Oct 06, 2022","Oct 06, 2022","Oct 08, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/42744927-hedy-lamarr

It has a stunning sense of place. The remote Scottish isles come alive in all their forbidding stormy beauty on these pages. But outside of that, all you have is a small town (village, really) mystery that is drawn out and protracted much, much too much. It’s a good mystery, it has a nice twist, it deals with madness and guilt and secrets. It even has intriguing hints of supernatural. But it takes so long to get anywhere. And it’s probably actually due to the fact that the author can write so well; it’s almost as if she gets lost in her descriptions and characters’ inner lives and pacing and dynamism of the narrative pay the toll. And no, I wasn’t expecting a wham-bam-thank-you-ma’am sort of pacing of an action thriller, but still…This proved itself to be rather too slow, too maudlin, too overdone on the dramatics and introspective and all that.

And turned out unlike any other book about books out there since this is a book about…eating books.So what’s that…bibliophagia?Anyway, Book Eaters are a world onto themselves, an old world dynasty surviving in present day England by maintaining their backwards practices rigorously and ruthlessly. That is the world the protagonist, Devon, of this novel is born into and that is the world she spends the entire novel fleeing.Not just her, but her young son, who was born a deviation of his kind – a mind eater, a more dangerous variety that needs to kill to survive. And mommy Devon will kill to feed her baby, even other babies. Mother’s love and all that.Anyway, naturally Devon is chased and naturally there’s all sorts of intrigue and action, but mainly this book skates by on its original idea and the concomitant world building. These are people who EAT books. Imagine absorbing knowledge that way. And yet, the written word is quite beyond them – they cannot write. They live like a fairy tale, a dark one. The one where princesses are sacrificed for timeworn traditions. There are no happy princesses in this tale.But Devon, shedding her royal title, is determined to forge her own path in a world she lived besides and hardly knew. For her own sake and for the sake of her murderous baby boy. For the sake of trying to find a new (and improved) life.Meanwhile, in flashbacks we are told of courtly intrigue, Book Eater’s policies, and Devon’s life until now. Do the flashbacks get to be too much and overpower the plot? At times, yes. But then again, this is a debut. Debuts tend to cram too much in. Did I love the protagonist? Not as such, but did find her compelling. Was it too fantasy like for my liking? Yeah, often. But, overall, this debut is quite dense and proved to be a notably slow read, but it was interesting and original enough to entertain. Plus, it allows the er to say, “Now you know.

And they are all either handsome or cute and this is mentioned with exhaustive frequency.Actually, most things here are mentioned with exhaustive frequency that often accompanies amateurish writing, like stiltedness of narrative, wooden characterizations, etc.So anyway, once upon a time some murders occurred in the manor and the tragedy haunts the place since but now that the giggling blonde is here (yes, readers, she giggles, A LOT) the manor just wants to love her and tell her all her secrets.All that and a bag of laughably silly and processed cheesy romance and there you have it.It is readable a such, does appear to have been professionally edited and does go by quickly, but that’s about all the things you can put in a Pro column here.

Like the way the (stunningly talented) artist tends to draw people very similarly, so that the girl protagonist of Ascender looks almost exactly like the robot boy protagonist of Descender but hairstyled longer. Or the way the adults of masculine and feminine persuasion respectively have similar features. And now, three books in.

And that blandness is especially noticeable in the art, which constantly looks like flat made-for-TV-on-a-budget cartoons or cheaply digitalized video game imagery. It’s kinda sorta entertaining overall, and certainly reads quickly, especially for a 280 page book, but outside of purely representational themes, there isn’t much here to appreciate and/or love.This and more at https://advancetheplot.weebly.com/...more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Sep 26, 2022","Sep 26, 2022","Sep 27, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/60228224-malika

And proved to be an interesting if uneven read.Borja Gonzalez is a self-taught Spanish artist and is obviously talented. Panel after panel reveals striking imagery and silhouettes all set in a very specific color palette. The story is somewhat muddled, somewhat whimsical. There are two intersecting narratives, one from the past one from the present.In the past, the protagonist is a young aristocrat who’s meant to be preparing for her social debut but all she wants to do is write abstract poetry and you can just imagine how well that goes over with her family.In the present, there is a band of three teen who wanna be punk but don’t have the talent for it.So, it seems like a YA novel, which in my book is categorically a no-no for adult audiences, but this one is so short you won’t mind the (oddly faceless) characters' youth too much. And the intersection twist is clever, so there’s that. But to be honest, there just isn’t that much to the story or of a story here. It’s mostly a mood read, mostly an art book. And as such it’s pleasant and has a certain charm.This and more at https://advancetheplot.weebly.com/...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,"Sep 25, 2022","Sep 25, 2022","Sep 27, 2022",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/50641217-a-gift-for-a-ghost

It’s been done and it’s been done and I can’t honestly tell you that Red Queen brings something new to either the genre of that very particular set up.In fact, it’s quite underwhelming as far as those things go. Because, of course, you got to get your Sherlock right. Meaning the oddball has to be originally compellingly odd and Antonia Scott is garden variety odd at best.She’s meant to be a genius, a person with the highest IQ out there. And of course, she’s traumatized, because trauma forges the best character traits. Though maybe not in her case so much; in her case, it just made her into an emotionally stunted shut-in with a crappy diet. And then she gets dragged out once again into the field to track down a kidnapper/killer. And then man to drag her out is a jumbo-sized (and allegedly mostly muscle) police detective who veered off the blue path to follow his morals and the only way to get out of the doodoo he’s in now is by working with Antonia.And so, the two of them chase after their mystery fiend all over Madrid. Which is nice locale wise and was one of the main things that attracted me to this novel in the first place.So, score for international reading. And objectively, the book was plenty entertaining and perfectly decently written. Just…nothing special. Much like its protagonist. Which is frustrating because she's meant to be exceptional and, presumably, exceptionally interesting. Plus, the book is quite bulky at something like 400 pages. Certainly not enough here to draw interest for the entire trilogy.It’s sort of like an inferior version of Kill The Father (Colomba Casselli trilogy) by Sandrone Dazieri. So if you want to read a genius and detective team solve crimes books done right, go for those.Otherwise, this was fine, passed the time, some fun was had.

There is a lovely rhythm to his narrative, a terrific elegance to his sentences – why, there are as elegant as a perfectly tailored suit and the analogy is apt for there is a strong (almost peculiarly strong) focus on sartorial matters in this novel. And so, the characters come to life as you read this book…plus, you’ll always know what they are wearing and how good them look in it.But more importantly so, the place comes alive.

One that resonates particularly every seven years when a tithe of seven lives must be paid for the safety and prosperity of the islanders.It’s an ancient tradition dating back to the Druids, but Nina doesn’t know any of it when she marries Lord Treadway and becomes the Lady of the island. She finds out almost the day off and by then, of course, it’s much too late to do anything but ride The Day out.And yes, advertising the novel as The Wicker Man meets Final Destination works, lazy as it may be.Folk is all the rage in genre right now and Lute is a solid entry into the realm. Not especially original, but quite well executed with almost live time intensity of the narrative and a tight focus on the protagonist’s fish-out-of-the-water perspective.It isn’t without faults, chief among them women’s fiction undertones of Nina’s suddenly overexciting love life and a backdrop of WWIII aka Waters Wars with USA and UK on the opposite sides which seems to go nowhere and do nothing outside of providing the reason for the locals to be distrusting on Nina the American. In fac, the novel kind of reads like it’s set during WWII and then texting is mentioned and you go, oh, modern time. Well, modern time with a. twist, but you get it.As for the estrogen overload, well, you kind of have to look at the author’s oeuvre to know that should have been expected. In fact, all things considered, it is understated in Lute.And then there’s the granddaddy of them all – the logic. Logically, would such sacrifices perpetuate in modern times? On an island THAT small? I mean, for a population of 200, seven sacrifices is pretty extreme. And everyone seems quite cavalier about it.But the sacrifices themselves are written nicely, interestingly, and very creepily, so kudos to the author on that. And the ending does the underlying logic good service by introducing much needed modernization to an ancient concept. So overall quite a fun read, entertaining enough, not too long. The cover is underwhelming. Folks, what folks get up to on remote islands is a quite disturbing. But you already knew it. Likely from The Wicker Man.

It was mostly the Moon Knight himself that didn’t do it for. Or so I thought.And then, primarily due to our library’s scarcity of choices when it comes to quality e-versions of graphic novels, I read more Moon Night. Once more, a trilogy. But this time done by three different authors. So I read book one and lo and behold, I saw the appeal of the man in white. I even learned why he wears white to fight crime at night - it’s because he’s so kickass, he wants the criminals to see him coming.So where did Lemire go wrong and Ellis go right?Well, for my money, Lemire’s concept took things too seriously concentrating on Moon Knight’s very messed up state of mind, thus making it interesting and moody and dark but also, oddly enough, not that compelling. Or maybe just not what I expect or like in conventional superhero fare.Ellis just kind of had fun with it. Less text, more action. Less inner thoughts, more outer swagger. Plus, the graphic novel comprises five individual self-contained stories, which I really liked as a format for this sort of thing. And it read very quickly.

I’ve been waiting to read this book for a while, ever since Netgalley offered a deficient ARC. The first chapter engaged me absolutely and then I had to wait until the publisher reached out and ever so kindly furnished a proper ARC. So naturally the question is…as it worth the wait?The answer is YES…mostly. The story did take some directions I didn’t quite expect from the first chapter, but hey, don’t you want your books to surprise you?I love con stories. I find them uniquely American, like apple pie and gun violence. I’m sure there are con artists all over the world, but there’s something about the very specifically American blend of stupidity/gullibility, rampant and baseless exceptionalism and individualism and, above all, the greed and exigencies of Mammon that makes the art of con proliferate and thrive here.This is very much a con story.A story of two young men - the proverbial odd couple of charm and brains – that sets up a personality programing cult. Well, technically they start off small, but cults are where the real money are, so they turn to that. And they are killing it too, for a while. But then, like every tower that reaches too far…What gives the story its emotional backbone is the profound, obsessive, and ultimately destructive love the two men share. Or, more specifically, one of them has for the other. The balance is way off between the geek and his Adonis and it ends up being as messy and complicated as such dynamics tend to go.And so, in three classic acts, you get to witness a version of the American dream. The pursuit of green at all costs. All that.And yes, it is compelling and well-crafted and clever. Like a good con.Not sure how much I enjoyed the characters as far as emotional engagements go. There’s something tragically pathetic about the geek and something oddly vague and unfocused about the object of his desperate attentions. But overall, this was definitely a very good read.

Based on those two, Finlay showed enough promise to make me download the ARC of his latest without even getting into the plot description.

Not just a dud, not just a read that dismays, but the one that actively causes disgust. (more on that later). I’d love to be able to say that you can see the traces of Madam in here and that the book merely missed something, but that would be a lie. Because this obnoxious, tedious, pretentious stab at a murder thriller is a sad excuse and a waste of talent/promise, etc. Yeah, sorry, this is harsh, but the thing is, I hated this book. In concept more so than in the execution, meaning objectively Wynne CAN write, she just needs stronger stories.Meaning, a tale of a bunch of young girls vacationing with their utter disgusting parents and family friends isn’t that strong of a story.Sure, Wynne dragged it out into one, but she did so by selecting the nastiest aspects of it and dragging it out into a very specific brand of tedium.And now, for some specifics: this is a book about child abuse. (And no, I’m not one of those squeamish readers who only wants tales from the sunny side of life; fact is, I usually prefer the other kind, but…) The adults in this story are TERRIBLE. You have three male friends from way back and their respective families, wives, kids, all of it. All are wealthy English, vacationing in the French chateau belonging to one of them. And yes, it’s set back in the mid 80s and yes, the British are notoriously withholding and polite and all that, but at least one of the adults exhibits active peado behaviour, molesting girl after girl, often in plain view of others, including the kids’ parents and no one says Boo, or if they do, it’s barely a reprimand, more like…Oh, you. It’s just him being himself, etc. And this goes on and on and ON.The bulk of the story takes place in the past and that’s most of the past. Adults bicker, fight, and misbehave and kids cower in terror of them. On repeat. Yey, what fun, Wynne, what fun.And while Wynne can indeed write, here she very deliberately chooses a very tedious, poshly pretentious tone of the upstairs portion of the upstairs/downstairs dynamic that makes the novel read like something decades and decades older than it is.The overall effect is obnoxious (stupid?), like teens who dye their hair grey. Also, because of all the childrens’ perspectives, the novel reads oddly young at the same time.And slow, so very slow. Same thing repeat over and over, after we long established the adults are perverts, and the kids are playing out their own dramas that read like BBC historical tv series at their most drawn-out and maudlin.This entire novel is a stuck up fifth digit holding up a starched crisp serviette.

Katsu has done many different things during her writing career from outright garbagey romancey looking series to spy fiction to (my favorite) historical fiction based literary frights. This story is definitely of the latter variety, which is good. It’s the execution of it that left a lot to be desired. Surprisingly so.Inspired by January 6th 2021 events, the story is set during the end of WWII. Because authoritarianism, jingoism, and lie-based ultranationalism translates well throughout time and offers plenty of examples. This is the story told from the losing side of war, where one village decides to pick up the metaphorical pitchforks and fight the Allies in a very area-specific, local folklore-based fashion. Which the title explains quite plainly.Primarily it is a story of one man who gets caught up in the fervor and madness of the moment and compromises his principles for false ideology. Good idea, sure, and the historical fiction aspect is done nicely, but the writing itself is so oddly flat here. More than plain, it’s practically amateurish in its blandness.

There were some other motifs, mostly about race, just less personal, and more historically based ones.Overall, didn’t do much for me. Not the right sort of intimacy.

I am interested in that era, so I learned about it some time ago and let the knowledge sit around the mind palace unused. The author of this book, though, did no such thing upon learning of the program and instead did her research and wrote a book about it. So, kudos on that.Now, by itself, just going by the author’s other work, I’d never pick up a book of hers. She seems to specialize in women’s fiction, maternal fiction if that’s a thing, estrogen heavy kind of Lifetime TV crap.But the subject interested me, so I checked it out. And sure enough, it ended up being exactly as expected: estrogen-heavy, women’s fiction, but a well-researched one with meticulous attention to detail and an interesting subject. A peculiar combination, but it worked…to an extent.The author may not have the pure literary talent or emotional range to turn this into a Schindler’s List, but she does her level best, her fairly decent level best, to tell a tale of three intersecting narratives, three females (two young, one older) caught up in a hideous experiment at a terrible time in a country gone mad. War dramas are a popular genre and this is the sort of book that’s sure to find its audience among the fans. Perfectly readable, somewhat engaging despite all those heavy Lifetime undertones, plot-wise the book is ok, but the historical fiction aspects of it elevate the entire production. The author even talks about it in her extensive afterword, all the research she did. If you’ve never heard of Lebensborn, this is a good (fictional) primer on the subject. And surprisingly timely, since reproductive rights seem to be such a huge thing lately. Sadly. If this book does nothing but serve as a fresh reminder that society that wishes to control and manipulate its women and their reproductive rights so viciously is doing something wrong. But then again, if people learned lessons from books, the world would be a very different place.

Luthor here is moral but it’s a morality of his own making. Flawed but compellingly so. Even romantic albeit in a kind of frightening way. In other words, a fascinating character to read about.

Now, his daughter is desperate; she is Jewish and a lover of a Nazi officer, a terrifying combination,So Clementine does her best spy impersonation and gets involved on friendly and professional basis with another Nazi. Intrigue ensues.And if the intrigue doesn’t do it for you, there is still so much to love here. The author does a splendid job of bringing a place to life and using it as a character of its own. There is a magnificent wealth and vividness of detail; the atmosphere is completely immersive. And the characters are charming, memorable, and interesting too.Clementine, whose age is confusing and if going strictly by the book seems like 80 but is stated as 72 in the official description, doesn’t really seem like her years, whatever they are. She’s almost difficult to buy as a senior citizen in actions, mentality, etc. But she is a fascinating and compelling protagonist and if this was a movie, Glenn Close would probably nail it. Overall, an exceptional armchair trip in time and place. A terrific read.
