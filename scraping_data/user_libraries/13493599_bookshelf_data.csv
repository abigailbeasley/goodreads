Don Quixote knows he’s in a book; SterneAt The Limits of MetafictionThe first metafictional gestures in European fiction were fairly straightforward. Don Quixote knows he’s in a book; Sterne’s narrator greets us from the pages of Tristram Shandy (“You must have a little patience… my dear friend and companion…let me go on, and tell my story my own way” and so forth). In postmodernism, metafiction has become much more complex, most recently with the interest in autofiction, where we’re asked to suspend our disbelief not in the fictional world, but in the lack of difference between the narrator, who has the author’s name, and the author, who has put their name on the title page. Tom LeClair’s book is perhaps the most intricate of these games. If you buy this book, Passing Again, you will be collecting a part of a sequence of self-referential books that go back through a series of novels Passing Off, Passing On, Passing Through, and Passing Away, and also to LeClair’s earlier work as a literary critic (because that work is referred to in Passing Again), when he advocated “monsterpieces” (long, complex postmodern fictions) and championed the work of Don DeLillo. Starting Passing Again is not easy: the first chapter title is followed by an asterisk to a nonexistent website, which is intentional—but then the second chapter title is followed by an asterisk to a real website (""Audiotape*""), and page after that there’s a link to a second website. The first website, ibeambooks.com/passing-again-a-novel, points to another site with improved versions of the photographs in the book, a page about LeClair’s protests against Trump, and an “Author’s Supplement,” which includes an “Epilogue,” an interview with LeClair, and several essays, all written by him. So it takes quite a while—perhaps a couple of hours—to actually begin the novel.The delays and diversions continue throughout the book. There are continuous references, often many times a page, to the earlier Passing novels and other sources outside the book. In that Passing Again is like Arno Schmidt's Bottom's Dream, or, archetypically, Ulysses. An ideal reader will either recognize or check all the references to previous books, so the reading experience will itself be discontinuous (reading or remembering will go from this book to many others).There’s also an unusual subdivision of the author’s name and function. Following Gérard Genette, Wayne Booth, and Umberto Eco, we’ve learned to distinguish (1) the narrator in the fiction from (2) the implied author, (3) the implied reader, and (4) the actual, real-world author, whom LeClair calls the AUTHOR. In LeClair’s work, and in some autofiction, it’s helpful to divide this even further. There are, at the least: (1a) the narrator of parts of this book named, named Tom LeClair, for whom Michael Keever is a friend(1b) the narrator of other parts, named Michael Keever(1c) the joint narrator, because most of this book is presented as edited versions of emails exchanged between the two, altered so they appear to be conversations(2a) the implied author of some other Passing novels, Michael Keever(2b) the implied author of other novels and parts of this one, Tom LeClair, for whom Keever is an invention(3a) the implied reader: someone interested in metafiction(3b) the ideal implied reader: a person who knows the previous Passing books)(3c) the proximate implied readers: Tom LeClair and Michael Keever, who are co-authoring this book for themselves, and possibly for the women in their lives (see below)and so on. The utility of this sort of list is just to register the multiplying possibilities. In practice, these identities are easily kept in mind, but when they’re set out they can be difficult to remember. In one line Michael Keever may be a real-life, independently-minded person, and in the next a character invented by LeClair. A new kind of large-scale novelPassing Again isn’t straightforwardly monumental in ambition like the “monsterpieces” LeClair wrote about as a critic, but it is a large, complex whole built out of modest parts. I think it’s possible that large fictional projects assembled from disparate parts are a new phenomenon in writing. In addition to the Passing sequence, there’s Agustin Fernandez Mallo's Nocilla Trilogy, Philipp Weiss's Am Weltenrand sitzen die Menschen und lachen, and Jim Hugunin’s series of books published with U-Turn. Like the individual volumes in each of those examples, LeClair’s books are intentionally disparate, written in different voices and different styles.The imagesFrom the outset, the relation between the images and the accompanying texts is reminiscent of Teju Cole, by which I mean that the narrator knows how to perform photo criticism. In Cole's case of course he's showing off both his practice and his critical acumen, which can be less than inviting. In Passing Again it's clear from fairly early on (and explicit on the website and in the Introduction to Designs of Darkness) that the author (number 4 in the schema) is an appreciative critic of Owczennikow's photography, which is a more inviting possibility. In fact reading the first section after reading the last section produces yet another metafictional effect, because I find myself hearing Tom LeClair's voice in those parts of Michael Keever's texts where details of the images matter, and Michael Keever's voice in the other sections.The picture credits at the end of the book add yet another layer by noting the similarity of photos ""ascribed to characters Michael and Kara, and to Tom LeClair."" Looking at all the pictures in that category modifies a suggestion made by the narrator Tom LeClair (meaning 2b) that ""most of my snapshots are either of people or for people I know"" (p. 222) -- not least because those ""people"" may also be characters. And at the same time, that very unusual mention of fictional characters in a nonfictional credits page gives me another sense of the LeClair (meaning 4) -- that he wants to repossess images that might be wrongly ascribed to two of his fictional characters.Breaking the fourth wall, repeatedlyOne of the final sections, ""Audiotape Number Five,"" has a flux of confessions and truths that threaten to break the metafiction into autobiography, but surprisingly don't. The tenaciousness of the metafiction was the real surprise for me. First (in my enumeration) is the reference to LeClair’s (number 4) book of literary criticism called Art of Excess, and how he (meaning 2b) lost interest in academic criticism and started writing fiction at age 47. Then the possibility that the audience might be ""the women we used to live with"" (meaning 3c) -- an especially poignant idea since at this point the reader's been aware for 200-odd pages that Michael is a character, and so it's as if the speaker (meaning 2b) can't quite bear to put the pronoun in the singular. Then comes the interesting idea, given to Michael, that Tom and Michael might be distinct not because of psychological or physiological differences but because Tom is ""separate from people."" (This is an author-figure accusing himself of being alienated from people, and giving that thought to an imaginary friend.) Next: on the same page, 223, Tom says he knows ""some of what it's like to be left,"" even though Tom has always been identified as the one who left the women in his life, and Michael as the one who was left. Having Tom say this suggests that this minor or limited experience might be much larger than any reader could have supposed -- large enough to underwrite the creation of an entire life that embodies abandonment. And finally, at the very end of ""Audiotape Number Five,"" there's the idea that Tom may be leaving the (meta)fictional world, not for fiction, but for life. In doing that, he divides his life into four parts: childhood (perhaps up through his work in the sawmill, described on pp. 47-51); academic career, novelist, and partner.It's fascinating that even after this most personal declaration, the metafiction still holds. I think people often say the opposite about metafiction, that it ruins the suspension of disbelief by pointing past the implied author to the actual author. Or, in autofiction, there's the notion that naming the author, and making sure his name is the same as the one on the copyright page, suspends the suspension of disbelief in favor of a knowing ambiguity. But after reading a couple hundred pages of nearly pure metafiction, with references outside the next on every page, I find that I close the book with characters, an implied author, and an actual author -- including all the permutations of my list -- all in mind together....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,not set,"May 05, 2023",,,view (with text),/book/show/149119037-passing-again

That's true in a literal sense: both the author and the main character are converts to Catholicism, and we read the Lord's Prayer several times in Latin. (One er said he skips those passages--an amazing lapse of critical responsibility. I won't name the er.) But it doesn't help to describe the book, its author, or its main character simply as religious, not only because religion does not illuminate everything in the book, but also because religious belief is presented as a desperate last bid for sanity in a life nearly ruined by loss and by alcohol: that is, it's part of the narrative.The second problem in the critical reception has to do with the identity of the principal character, Asle. He shares a name and a profession with another character also named Asle. A number of ers have called them ""Doppelgaengers."" (The Guardian, November 9, 2019; The Irish Times, January 4, 2020.) They certainly are that, since both are single, have grey hair, and are painters, and alcoholism has been, or is, part of their lives. (I'll call the main narrator, who earns his living from painting, the older Asle, and the other, who is on the point of dying from his alcoholism, the younger one.) Toward the beginning, I imagine most readers wonder if they are the same person, but after the older Asle visits the younger one, rescues him from freezing and takes him to a hospital, it may appear that Fosse is up to something else--yet it's curious no ers I've read say exactly what that might be. The New York Times er thinks all possibilities are open: ""the namesake-doppelgänger story line is never definitively established as an extended speculative exercise or an astounding coincidence (or taciturn act of autofiction)."" (February 22, 2022.) Surely definitive resolutions aren't the stock in trade of 800-page novels, but hopefully interesting accommodations are. There is another possibility, which needs to be taken seriously: the sober Asle is actually misremembering an episode earlier in his own life, when he was rescued (by someone else, now erased from his memory) and taken to the hospital. There are reasons to consider this, which have to do with some disjointed descriptions later in The Other Name. For example there's a long episode about the older Asle and his sister when they were children. During this there are several pages in which the two children are disturbed by a loud noise. A little later a third child dies, and the noise is forgotten. Later in the novel, the older Asle is alone in his house, in a state of exhaustion, possibly asleep, and a disturbing noise intrudes on his thoughts. It turns out to be a friend's snowplow. That is intended, I think, to let us know that the earlier episode of the children was also dreamt, or hallucinated, by the older Asle.The problem here is that hints and parallels like this are inconsistently depicted. The book as a whole is loosely written, by which I mean quickly enough, with a sufficiently small number of revisions, so that difficult narrative structures--like the possibility that the entire memory of the children takes place when the older Asle is asleep, rather than driving, as we're told--become unpersuasive. There wouldn't be sense in criticizing a book for being too quickly written, or for being written without revisions: there are too many examples of successful improvisational books for that to make sense. (I am thinking of Aira and Bolano, but also of Tao Lin and Mark Leyner.) But there's a suggestion in this book that is fairly spectacular--that the main character has been permanently damaged by his alcoholism and more or less continuously experiences the hallucination that his younger, alcoholic self lives an hour away and might be rescued--but in order for that to work as a serious possibility, the constructions of dreams, daydreams, and waking truths need to be adjusted so they are consistent enough to permit readers to doubt each of them. As proof of this I offer the fact that no er I've seen takes seriously the possibility that there is only one Asle: the reality and temporality we're given is too consistent, and the character's dreams, daydreams, and hallucinations are too safely sequestered in the times he's exhausted or actually sleeping.Fosse is a relentless repeater of everyday actions and trivial conversation, exactly like his one-time student Knausgaard. I marked many passages as perfect anticipations of Knausgaard's affectless inventorying of everyday life. (I won't quote any here: they're long and by their nature devoid of insight.) It may be one of Knausgaard's biggest achievements to have realized that the mode of relentless reporting is not easily mixed with dramas of life crises, drownings, molestation, and other events that happen in Fosse's book. And many novelists, I think, will see places where the dreams and hallucinations could have been handled more carefully, so that readers would keep wondering: Could it be? Could this person be that deeply deranged, so that he lives his waking life with a specter of his earlier self?...more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,not set,not set,"Feb 03, 2023",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/46024004-the-other-name

It's printed in an obtrusive surprising large font to stretch it to 227 pages. The cover's not a help, either: the Pantheon (American) edition has an indifferent oil painting of a forest, credited to the well-known ""Max5799/iStock/Getty Images."" The original English edition has what I'm guessing is one of Hockney's English landscapes, or something of its type. Neither one fits the book, whose narrator is a conceptual painter whose canvases are palimpsests of words from poems and novels, perhaps something like like Glenn Ligon.I've only read three of Smith's novels (""Artful,"" ""The accidental"") and this one has the same curious psychology as those: full-on emotion is elided, not because it's gauche or disruptive, but apparently because ellipses, evasions, interruptions, allegories, and everything else in the quiver of classical rhetoric can sharpen it, give it a target it somehow lacks. In this book the narrator's father is in hospital. Nearly all the other characters in the book turn out to be hallucinations or daydreams, even though the narrator continues to play with the possibility they might be real. (For me the decisive moment in which they become fictional devices is page 115 paragraph 4.) Once they reveal themselves as figments in the fiction, the real fear, that the narrator may well lose her father, is meant to become more intense. (Or poignant? Or effecting?) For me all this has a sort of opposite effect: Smith's enjoyment of language (especially letters, letterforms, words, and phonetics, and not so much grammar or syntax) is so happily and continuously manifest, and her pleasure and skill in invention so continuous, that I ended up watching the way she imagines figments within fictions can sharpen emotion more than I ended up feeling much of anything.That's one argment I'll make about this book. The other is perhaps less charitable. This is clearly the product of an author who has been a professional for many years, and has just finished a major effort (even if it was, as ers have noted, written at astonishing speed). It isn't worried that it takes thirty pages to tell a mythic medievalizing story of a girl and her bird, or that it leaps from one set piece to the next with widely varying results. It's the kind of book that can only be written by someone who has proven herself as much as she wishes to, at least for the time being, has a guaranteed public, a mainly reliable bank of well-inclined ers, and a lack of deadlines. For me it crossed and re-crossed the line between a report on life under Covid (a zeitgeisty enactment of those disorienting years, a theme I don't care about at all and don't happen to share) and a book written with measurably less care than any number of indie films on streaming services that I could have watched instead. I am not comparing skill or artfulness here: I'm comparing forms of attention. I won't be returning to her work until a er alerts me to something done with particular care....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Nov 30, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/58511594-companion-piece

It's also thoughtful for people who might need encouragement to read the book. My notes here are usually critical, because I use this forum to try to understand what I might have done differently than the author. At the same time I usually only write about books that I think are worth engaging. This is a forgettable book, in the cliché phrase, and so the proper thing for me to do would be to forget it. But like many readers I have spent some portion of my life on books like this, and every hundred or so forgettable books I like to stop and protest. That was my time! I'd like to say, and if I can't get it back, at least it should be possible to articulate the frustration. In that entirely ungenerous spirit here are some thoughts on this novel.""Weasels in the Attic"" is loosely imagined. If it were a photograph or film it would be out of focus. Oyamada misses opportunities to make things sharp and persuasive. She opts instead for a kind of perpetual panning shot, in which scenes swing by without stopping. The book's form (three stories woven together) is only superficially innovative. Each of the three has a very familiar structure, composed of framing elements, temporal gaps, and surprise endings. But mainly, for me, the problem is that the book is poorly written. The kind of writing failure I have in mind is not an effect of translation, and it isn't a matter of cultural differences. I know this because the issues I have in mind are problems in narration. This is just poor writing.In the first story, the characters are in an apartment filled with fish tanks. They have nothing to snack on. One person goes ""over to a cabinet with a fish tank on top,"" opens it, and pulls out a plastic bag of dried shrimp. That's all you need to know to conclude that he's giving his friends fish food. But Oyamada thinks it needs a long setup:""Once he finally looked up, Saiki saw the shrimp and jerked back. 'Is that....'""'Sure is,' Urabe grinned as he picked up a shrimp from the pile and put it in his mouth. I was about to grab one, but Saki reached out to stop me.""'What?' I asked, but Saki didn't answer. 'H-Hey, Urabe...' Saki's voice shook. I didn't understand. they looked like ordinary shrimp to me.""'Why are you looking at me like tha? It's just dried shrimp.'""'But they're...'""'Totally safe. I eat them all the time.'Urabe took another one, took a sip from his cup, then said, 'Great stuff.' His giant Adam's apple slid up and down.Saki turned to me with a serious look and said, 'The shrimp... are for them.'""'Them?'""'The fish.'"" (pp. 13-14)My copy is marked with strikethroughs and marginal notes like ""not necessary,"" ""reader knows,"" ""timing is wrong."" You don't need to be an editor like Gordon Lish (famous for cutting dialogue to bare bones) to find fault here. A reader who needs this long passage in order to relish the idea that someone might inadvertently eat fish food is a reader whose attention, whose capacity for imaginative engagement, is significantly different from mine. The book asks me to be a reader who does not pay full attention to the writing, who treats the story or novella format as a screenplay, storyboard, or graphic novel. ""Bad writing"" here isn't a disguised appeal to a norm that has been supported by privileged readers, critics, and publishers and needs to be rethought in each new context. (As if, for example, a look at contemporary Japanese atitudes to fertility requires a lack of focus of the sort that leads to page-long descriptions like the one I quoted.) ""Bad writing"" in this context is a marker of a departure from various practices that comprise the current state of writing, including literary fiction.As long as I'm likely to get some sour replies for my sourness, I'll go a couple of steps farther. ""Weasels in the Attic"" has the kind of writing errors and missed possibilities that would be flagged by many literary magazines and MFA programs. New Directions should not have published it.

Some people found it in its original Irish, and many more in its 1973 translation. Here are some coordinates of my own, written in a pastiche of O'Brien's prose:1. I read it finally, probably thirty years after I first heard of it. Those thirty years correspond fairly well to my marriage to Margaret MacNamidhe, who comprises 100% of the Irish portion of our marriage. 2. At the beginning of that period I attempted one summer's worth of Irish classes in a Gaeltacht. They sometimes involved driving at night, down extremely narrow winding deserted country roads, in pelting rain. I abandoned those lessons in a state of awed bewilderment.3. Also in that period I read English versions of two books that absolutely have to be read before ""The Poor Mouth,"" because otherwise a reader will entirely fail to laugh at the appointed times. They are: Tomás Ó Criomhthain's ""The Islandman,"" in which, among other things, a man plasters a wound caused by a seal bite with meat taken from the seal, and, among other things, the author says without irony and with a fair measure of pride ""our like will not be seen again,"" which is repeated incessantly in ""The Poor Mouth""; and Peig Sayers's ""Peig,"" in which everyone dies, as most people do in ""The Poor Mouth."" The darkness of O'Brien's satire absolutely cannot be appreciated without an experience of the humorless, portentous Catholic suffering expounded in ""The Islandman"" and ""Peig."" 4. The reason I read ""The Islandman"" and ""Peig"" was because I was trying to gain a better understanding of my wife's formation, something that I now realize was hopeless, mainly because she disliked those books because they were in Irish, because they were required, and, I think, because they were humorless, whereas O'Brien disliked them because their suffering was very close to his but their self-awareness was a galaxy apart. 5. It is one of the most rermarkable facts of cultural development in any nation that ""The Islandman"" was written only 12 years before ""The Poor Mouth."" I would have guessed centuries.6. This year I finally found time to read ""The Poor Mouth"" as part of an attempt to read all of O'Brien's work. This time my motive isn't marital harmony or cultural curiosity but an interest in novels that are irrational. ""The Third Policeman"" is crazy in many ways, and ""The Dalkey Archive"" crazier in some other ways, and ""Cruiskeen Lawn"" (his newspaper columns) extremely funny and bitter... so I still have no clear sense of who he is, or how often his imagination became as spectaculary disarranged as it does in ""The Third Policeman"" or ""The Dalkey Archive.""This is by way of saying anyone who sits down to read this without thinking of its various contexts will miss it almost entirely, which will not at all decrease its brilliance.And may I note that this is book is not a satire in the normal sense of that word, which supposes an author in control of his viewpoint and his pen? ""The Poor Mouth"" more often rudderless than it is Swiftian. It has funny stretches and short stories, and some bitter satire about Gaels and people like Tomás Ó Criomhthain. But it veers, at the end, suddenly into maudlin bathos and tragedy, and it seldom manages a steady keel between the Scylla of sniping social commentary and the Charybdis of bottomless suffering. So let's do it the favor of not calling it a satire: it's much more interesting than that....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,not set,"Nov 20, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/59641.The_Poor_Mouth

Self-contained pieces on individual writers and books alternate with autobiographical pieces on the author's depression and suicidal thoughts.For long stretches this book reads as a list of my own interests: the idea and problem of writing about essays in an essayistic way; the lure of ""essayism""; the nature of lists; questions of style, taste, melancholy, the fragment, the detail, aphorisms—those are all the titles of sections. Page after page, the authors Dillon mentions are ones I have read, taught, and written about: Gass, Adorno, La Rochefoucauld, Pascal, Wilde, Sontag, Deleuze, Stein, Derrida, Starobinski, Barthes, Clark, Perec, Browne, Wallace.He wonders, as I have, what constitutes an essay, and he looks at many of the same sources. (Mine: tinyurl.com/theoriesofessays.) He has some excellent set pieces, which may be among those adapted from previously published s, on Maeve Brennan, Cyril Connolly, and Elizabeth Hardwick.Despite these promising and surprising similarities, the more I read the lonelier I felt. Dillon's treatments of the authors are too quick. If an essay is anything, it's an unspooling of thought. As Montaigne knew, thought wanders. Even in Adorno's very tightly worked essay on the essay, form is deliberately elusive, and excerpts especially unrepresentative. What happens in this book belongs more to the world of journalism, where two to four pages corresponds with a feature or a five-minute read. Dillon surveys each book or author, finding interesting places to pause, raising questions, and then letting them stand as stated. It's like being introduced to interesting people at a party and then walking away while they're still talking. It's a kind of nonstop tour that works best in journalism, where evocation and enthusiasm matter and there may be no promise of slower forms of thought.He skims over Sontag, mentioning her diaries, but in comparison to books on her (for example Lopate's) his excerpts are inconclusive. He switches rapirdly from Musil to Woolf. He dispenses with Robert Burton in a page-long parenthesis of abbreviated and inconclusive praise. He does not consider the paradoxes or challenges of Adorno's essay. Occasionally the short form is just right, for example in three excellent pages conjuring Gass's ""On Being Blue,"" but usually it's glancing, as in the single page on Sebald or the few pages on Barthes's ""Camera Lucida."" Reading these I felt lonely: there are many passages that he must have felt adequate for his purposes—conjuring a problem, picking an evocative passage—where I had the impression I was being led away before the interesting questions had even arrived. It's as if we actually read different authors.I wonder if the real tension in this book is not between ""essayism"" and the author's depression—a theme he entertains in several passages—but between essays and journalism. Near the beginning he runs through several of the dozens of available definitions of essays. The only odd notes I saw are passages that conjure the idea that essays should have ""a sort of polish and integrity"" (p. 18), ""a smooth and gleaming surface,"" (p. 32), or be ""seamless and well-made"" (p. 21). I wonder where those came from, since I haven't run across them in reading essays about essays. Could they be the moments when an ideal of journalism surfaces? Even though Dillon identifies himself as a journalist, who wants ""only to make a living"" from writing (p. 33), journalism isn't otherwise presented as an ideal separable from essayism—and yet for me, in this book, it is.A letter to the authorDear Brian Dillon, I've always had a bad habit on Goodreads of writing in such a way that I can never show the author what I've written. I doubt you will ever see this—the internet is fabulous at burying people's voices—so let me do the inevitable, impolite thing and suggest my own book, ""What Photography Is,"" a full-length answer to ""Camera Lucida."" It's far from perfect, but I tried to follow the consequences of some of the questions you raise in regard to Barthes's book regarding his project of theorizing, writing a memoir, and using images, all at once. I am not sure what my book is, but I think of it as an essay, and also as something different from journalism.PostscriptFor people who have been following these notes on Goodreads: I have been revising and rewriting these more or less continuously, but this is the first original post for about five years. It's not that I've stopped writing notes on books: it's that I've been reading only two books during that period, ""Finnegans Wake"" and ""Bottom's Dream.""

The Case of the Antipodean Archive of Horse RacingThis is my fifth or sixth time trying to understand what Gerald Murnane means by ""fiction"" and ""real,"" as in ""real world."" Here I'll just talk about one of the stories in this collection, ""The Interior of Gaaldine,"" and mainly just about the story's second half, which introduces the Antipodean Archive. Thanks to Ben Winch for steering me to this ""fiction"" in particular, and for several corrections to a draft of this essay. ""The Interior of Gaaldine"" can be usefully divided into three parts: a conventional narrative in which an author sets out to a literary conference in Tasmania; a scene in which a woman visits him and gives him a manuscript by an unpublished author, whose story she tells; and a detailed inventory of the contents of that manuscript. Because ""The Interior of Gaaldine"" was in a collection that didn't sell well, and because it begins with the line ""A true account of certain events recalled on the evening when I decided to write no more fiction"" (in Italics, set off from the body text by a double space), it's reasonable to see it as a hinge between his eearlier fiction (the first third of the story) and the project he apparently devoted himself to (the Antipodean Archive, described in the last third of the story).An initial problem has to do with the word ""fiction"" in Murnane's first line. Nominally it refers to the fiction he had written up to that moment, pointedly including the near-travesty of his earlier writing in the conventional opening narrative. But in order to make sense of the word in relation to his later work, I would also like to read ""fiction"" as applying to work from ""Barley Patch"" onward, and also to the Antipodean Archive. On that last point, Murnane thought of himself as giving up fiction for the Antipodean Archive—and other texts, such as his logs of encounters with women—but he also called the Archive ""fiction.""It's been widely known for several decades now that Murnane's files contain a particularly extensive set of notes for imaginary horse races, which he calls the Antipodean Archive. Mark Binelli's piece in ""The New York Times"" Sunday magazine for March 27, 2018 has an excellent description of the files and how they were arranged in Murnane's house. (Or rather, his shed.) It seems likely there will be a printed edition of the Antipodean Archive at some point. I can imagine it done expensively in color facsimile, the way it's been done for Emily Dickinson's envelopes, Robert Walser's microscripts, Nabokov's notecards for ""The Original of Laura,"" and miscellaneous diagrams and lists left behind by Walter Benjamin.""The Interior of Gaaldine"" contains a supposedly fictionalized account of the method and content of the horse racing files. In the story they are a manuscript given to ""Murnane"" by an unpublished writer. (I'm calling the narrator ""Murnane"" to distinguish him from Gerald Murnane.) The woman who delivers the manuscript first tells ""Murnane"" about how the man has led an isolated life, not doing more for his job than he needs to, and moving often to avoid having friends (pp. 454-60). Supposedly Murnane doesn't remember her telling him any of this, but that's probably so Gerald Murnane did not have to write dialogue (p. 454). The man's life is very similar, in its benign misanthropy or autistic pleasure in isolation, to Gerald Murnane's and to what we know of ""Murnane.""After the woman leaves, ""Murnane"" peruses the manuscript. It's 2,000 pages written between ""the late 1950s"" and the present, which would be sometime shortly after 1987, when ""The Interior of Gaaldine"" may have been written. (It was published in 1995, in the collection ""Emerald Blue."") Binelli reports Murnane began his horse racing file ""in secret beginning in 1985."" If Binelli is right, ""The Interior of Gaaldine"" is a report on the early days of the Antipodean Archive, long before it swelled to however many thousand pages it is now.The place, Gaaldine, is mentioned by Emily Brontë as an imaginary place beyond Gondal, the imaginary setting of the stories she and her sisters wrote as children. There's a hint of that in ""The Interior of Gaaldine."" In an interview in ""Music & Literature"" in 2012, Murnane says this relates to ""my seeming discovery, in the 1980s and 1990s, that beyond the fictional landscape that I saw... there was a further landscape of imaginary horse racing"" (M&L vol. 3, p. 19). He then goes on to explain that apparently entire unaccountable, private, and irratonal ""explanation"" with an even weirder one. The woman in the story, he says, wakes the narrator in the middle of the night (and so she's like a dream, and by implication part of his own imagination). Actually he doesn't say the visit happened in the middle of the night, but he makes it dreamlike, saying her knocking was like a sound in a dream. Then, in ""Music & Literature,"" Murnane goes on to explain that an ""astute reader"" would realize her name isn't Alice but Ellis (a confusion perhaps made easier in Australian English), Emily Brontë's first pen name. ""So,"" Murnane concludes, ""if this woman is Emily Brontë, or pretending to be Emily Brontë, she is using Emily Brontë's fictional name to say who she is, and it's all very complicated and twisting and turning, but that is my answer to your question.""It's one of the most openly irrational accounts of literature I have ever seen. In what world, using what logic, is this anything even distantly approaching an explanation for the relation between the Antipodean Archive and fiction? In what world does Murnane imagine that even this simple, truncated version of his full ""twisting and turning"" explanation could possibly make sense to to any reader or listener? Murnane is serious: he just cannot find ways to explain his sense of fiction to anyone. I think the best approach here is to leave aside the literary feints (Brontë, the manuscript by an unpublished author, ""Murnane"") and note that the Antipodean Archive documents a world in the ""interior"" of fiction, a world more real in crucial senses than fiction, and a world that depends, as I'll describe in a moment, on mechanically ingesting and processing fiction.At the end of the story, we're given several different reasons why ""Murnane"" thinks the woman might have wanted him to see the unnamed author's text. One is that ""the author of the pages wanted to meet me in order to persuade me to write a different sort of fiction in the future."" So on a first reading, ""The Interior of Gaaldine"" is a fictionalized account of a new kind of writing Murnane had invented, which made him change his mind about how to write. In this way of understanding the story, he kept writing fiction, but understood it differently. Three things complicate this. The first is a description we get just before ""Murnane"" starts explaining the details of how horse races are invented and recorded in the file. ""If the pages comprised a work of literature,"" he writes, ""I might report that the first thousand or so comprise an introduction to the work while the other pages are samples chosen at intervals from the narrative proper."" And then, immediately, an odd repetititon:""If the pages comprised a work of literature, I might describe that work as a novel with many thousands of characters and a plot of infinite complications."" (p. 460)From what is known about the Antipodean Archive, it has nothing in common with the novel form. Even for Georges Perec it would be a stretch to say the jockeys and horses are ""thousands of characters"" and the racing seasons comprise ""a plot of infinite complications."" Identifying the horse racing file as a novel is exactly as incomprehensible as Sartre's comment that ""The Family Fool,"" his 2,600 page nonfiction study of the young Flaubert, is really a novel. If this is what Murnane means by not writing fiction—while still writing novels—it's not something he has done.A second complication is the role traditional literature plays in the Antipodean Archive, as it is described in this story. ""Murnane"" says the author buys novels, finds passages that are especially striking, and writes them out, letter by letter, vertically down the columns of his imagined racing forms, so that it's possible to read a series of letters across each row starting from each horse's name. Numerical values attached to the letters of the alphabet yield numbers, which indicate the horse's rank at different moments in the race.This wouldn't matter, except that the author uses Victorian novels because ""the profusion of realistic details in Victorian novels gives to the images of horse-racing that they cause to arise in his mind an unsurpassed richness and vividness."" He calls this ""decoding"" Victorian novels. He then uses the direct dialogue in Victorian novels in the same way in order to find out the winner of each race, and he calls that method the ""gutting"" of the novel (pp. 464-65). The best writers for this numerological exercise, the unnamed author says, are those that ""suppose that the best fiction is the most life-like."" So the Antipodean Archive is an engine for converting a certain kind of fiction, valued for its realism, into a more realistic world of horse racing. It takes realism to create realism, but the original realism must be destroyed to make the new one. This could be a model for not writing fiction, except that it isn't, because it produces stronger fiction.And third, there's a passage just after these descriptions in which ""Murnane"" addresses the reader, who he thinks must be wondering why the author went to such trouble to invent imaginary horses, race courses, jockeys, and even uniforms, when he could have written about ones that already exist. ""Murnane"" answers, weirdly, in the first person, as if he's the author (which of course he is!). He wasn't surprised by this, he says, because:""I have always been interested in what is usually called the real world but only because it provides me with evidence for the existence of another world. I have never written any piece of fiction with the simple purpose of understanding what I might call the real world. I have always written fiction in order to suggest to myself that another world exists."" (p. 466)This is an idea that's pushed much farther in the novel ""Barley Patch,"" the book that followed ""the Interior of Gaaldine"" by a decade and re-started Murnane's career. There we're told that what's most interesting in fiction is the fictional lives of the characters, but mainly as they lead them when no one is watching—when they're doing things that aren't described in the novels. In ""Barlety Patch"" he says he had always ""wanted to learn what places appeared in the mind of one or another fictional character whenever he or she stared past the furthest place mentioned in the text that had seemed to give rise to him or her... Now, I was free to suppose what I had often suspected: many a so-called fictional character was not a native of some or another fictional text but of a further region never yet written about.""This is a conventional world-building model for fiction, compatible with work by Frank Herbert, J.R. Tolkein, or George R.R. Martin: it's the sense that the fictional world continues on when the book is closed, when the characters are asleep, or after the last page. Murnane's idea is not quite the same as wondering what a Hobbit does when he walks offstage, because the ""further region"" isn't a direct extension of the fictional world. But in my experience nothing of this sort, or of the Herbert and Tolkein sort, happens in Murnane's fiction. (I don't doubt it happens for Murnane, but I'm concerned with readers' pausible responses.) The artifice is so intense, and in the case of the Antipodean Archive, so dependent on just one person's hermetic self-imposed rules and ideas, that absolutely nothing continues when the book is closed.What counts as the ""real world"" in Murnane's fiction? It's something artificially constructed, using rules that the author himself can barely understand, that are often confused or unexplained, but that he perceives as inevitable, or simply given, or necessary to create realism out of the ""decoded"" and ""gutted"" remains of ordinary fiction. They are nothing like Oulipeans' intellectual constraints: they're rules that have to be obeyed in order to make at least provisional, hedged and qualified sense out of the otherwise meaningless world....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Aug 07, 2023","Aug 23, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35259553-stream-system

But it's not, because it often fails to follow its own logic. Inconsistency is suggested in the list of Bénabou's books at the end. Most of them do not exist, but some do: one is a scholarly text, and another is a collaboraive project with Perec. So it's advertised in the book itself that the title is not accurate.The sort of inconsistency I have in mind is not the same as Roussel's (apparently!) intentional misdirection in ""How I Wrote Certain of My Books,"" which doesn't actually make good on the promise of its titles. And it's not the kind of inconsistency that results in an incompete project, as in Perec's exhausted ""Attempt at Exhausting a Place in Paris,"" or the common, perhaps inevitable, kind of inconsistency that comes from making mistakes in the application of one's own self-imposed constraints. Those three kinds of inconsistency are consistent with the Oulipean project, because they do not affect the writing's fundamental disaffection.What happens in this book is different. Bénabou begins and ends with ideas about why fiction should avoid any number of normal practices. He notes that at one point he ""set out to turn a treatise on rhetoric into an adventure story and a very well known anthology for students into a love story,"" and he even toyed with other categories—""dictionaries, encyclopedias, chronologies, even... the white and yellow pages"" (p. 103). He sometimes talks like a doctor who would like to cure people of literature: he wanted to ""raise a bit of anxiety,"" he says, ""provide a bit of uneasiness—if mild, if fleeting—in those who... gave themselves over in all tranquility to literary activity"" (p. 98).He is also clear, sometimes, on the ontological claims implicit in his title. ""Thus, writing that one would like to write is already writing,"" he says, ""so I knew what was left to me to do: a kind of tour de force by which I would have to manage to give fictive existence to books that don't really exist."" (p. 105). The result is that in the end—on the book's penultimate page—he concludes that the book ""could claim to be a very classic novel"" (p. 107). But the reason it could claim such a thing springs from the inconsistency in the book, because he's thinking that he's actually told ""the story of an ever deferred meeting, of a frustrated love strewn with obstacles""—referring to the book's main narrative, which is about how he spent his early years dreaming of writing a single book that would encompass all of his life and all of literature. That story is essentially a memoir. He dreams of writing a perfect book, but he can't bring himself to start. He chides himself for being lazy, he recounts his family's expectations (p. 63), he wonders if his Jewish milieu made his anxiety and ambition inevitable (p. 75). He was ecstatic when he discovered the pleasure of blank sheets of paper (p. 79), and he collected blank notebooks. He was full of ""dreaminess"" and ""illusions."" He observes the literary world from a safe distance (p. 55). He never thought to question his own ""taste for preparations, preiminaries, and preludes"" (of which the book is full), his ""mania for analysis"" (p. 59). All this seems self-reflective, but it's a standard narrative, a Bildungsroman. It doesn't have to do with doubting literature, as Oulipo does. It has to do with the narrator doubting himself, struggling with his ambition and inability to write. Eventually, Bénabou turns that back into an Oulipean skepticism about writing, by means of a further narrative of discovery.He continues with his biography for about a third of the book, then, as if he's recovering from the belief in the exact kind of narrative he's been providing (supposedly under cover of irony, in the name of explaining why he ended up not writing any of his books), he tells us how he began to doubt autobiography and memoir (there would be no more ""gushing over my childhood,"" p. 89), and realism itself (""I scorned the idea of describing my house with its wrought-iron doors,"" p. 88), and decided to turn to fiction (p. 91), before doubting that, too, and emerging into the position he currently holds. There is a difference between not writing any of your books because you want to show ""writing that one would like to write is already writing,"" or because you don't want to repeat conventional forms like memoirs or realist novels, and not writing any of your books because you are overwhelmed by the difficulty of literature, swamped by your own unformed ambition, hypnotized by paper or by the ideal of the single perfect book. It's in the spirit of Oulipo to take a diffident, metaphysical stand against literature, and to come by that stand after considering the many ""traps"" (as Bénabou says) of conventional forms. It is not in the spirit of Oulipo to tell a story about your ambition to write and how it failed. And it's not in the logic of Oulipo to move from one mode to the other through a narrative of self-discovery....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,"Aug 22, 2022",not set,"Aug 22, 2022",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/355501.Why_I_Have_Not_Written_Any_of_My_Books

It has a supernatural coA  of the best  of NauseaVladimir Nabokov's  of Nausea is the most perfect single page of criticism I know. It has a supernatural concision, and within that concision it has a beautiful balance of topics and emphases. It begins with small points and progresses to a point so large, so fundamental, that it could be the subject of a year-long seminar. I offer some remarks on it here, in place of the ten milionth  of the book itself.Nabokov's piece is so short I encourage you to read it first. It's here: tinyurl.com/sartrenabokov.The opening paragraph is charming, snide, and condescending all at once: three admirable qualities for a , because they promise the reader an interesting critic, as well as—or in place of!—an interesting author.Then comes the critique of the translator of Sartre's novel. Nabokov was fluent in French, even though he said he was never influenced by his years in France one way or the other. (He declined to be wowed by Paris, as he knew he was supposed to be.) His ease with French is on impeccable display, and the three examples are perrectly chosen: they are funny—they're what contemporary ers so aggressively call ""howlers,"" concisely establishing the translation is appalling.Note there are only four more paragraphs in the .The first is a literary genealogy for Nausea, which is still read as a philosophical novel written by a philosopher—that is, a work whose place in the history of novels isn't pertinent. The art world also often ignores precedents, except to mention names without explaining the connections—Olafur Eliasson is indebted to Romantic landscape painting, is indebted to AbEx, and so forth. In this brief paragraph Nabokov provides a sketch for a new style (a ""really very loose type of writing""), traces it to Dostoyevsky (""at his worst,"" presumably the programmatic parts), and then traces Dostoeyevsky to a lesser-known progenitor, Eugène Sue (1804-57). It's infinitely suggestive and plausible, and fulfills the part of the critical task that requires art history.The next two paragraphs complete the plot summary started in the first. Any account of the content of an artwork—in visual art criticism this is the ""formal analysis,"" description, or ekphrasis—has to abbreviate, and given that necessity it's often best to select just one passage, part, or episode. Nabokov's choice is Sartre's fantasy of an American composer. It's all clichés (I count seven) and it isn't even factual (the composer was Canadian).It really helps, in art criticism as in any writing, if the writer can put words together well. Nabokov was, on many scales, a brilliant writer, and the phrase ""in an equivocal flash of clairvoyance"" is amazing: it's intriguing (since we haven't yet seen the evidence) and, in retrospect, it's a crystalline verdict.The final pargraph is five sentences. First: Nausea is an existentialist novel. Then comes a trenchant criticism of philosophic novels in general: their philosophy is ""on a purely mental level,"" meaning it's detached from the feelings and experiences of the rest of the novel. But instead of saying that, as I've just done, Nabokov gives an example, making it immediately clear why it's not a good idea to superimpose the ""purely mental level"" of philosophy on a novel. In such a novel, the character, Roquentin in this case, is ""hapless"": invented from other parts of the writer's imagination, vulnerable to misuse by the autocratic novelist, who ""inflicts"" his philosophy on him. Notice that Nabokov isn't saying that Sartre's philosophy is an ""idle and arbitrary fancy"": things appear that way because Roquentin is a living creature with his own thoughts. That's why (in the second-to-last sentence) a reader won't be annoyed at Roquentin. But they might well be annoyed at the author (the last sentence) because he wasn't capable of imagining a world in which the character and his ideas are a connected. It's a wonderful critique of the entire genre of philosophical novels.So in one brief page, you have: a critique of materials (in this case, translation), a plot summary, fact-checking, a  of the pertinent history, a philosophic rumination, and an exceptionally stron, deliberately overstated judgment (the book wasn't worth translating). And almost a dozen memorable turns of phrase. A perfect work of art criticism....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,not set,not set,"Jun 04, 2022",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/298275.Nausea

The table of contents lists eight named chapters or sections, one with five named subsections.The last two are odd: the penultimate section is ""Babelle’s Photo Album,"" which is 34 pages of photos of London, in alphabetical order according to location, preceded by a color foldout map of Fulham and Chelsea. The final section is an ""Index of Names"" -- proper names cited in the book.The third-to-last section is ""Pillow Notes,"" a series of end notes comprising an independent story about wandering through London. Every other section or chapter, 450 pages of material, is arranged as text on right-facing pages and footnotes on left-facing pages. In this way a reader turns each page and reads the right-facing page, sometimes pausing to consult the footnotes on the left, and occasionally turning to the end notes in the ""Pillow Notes"" section.The organization is experimental. So is the language, which is full of puns and portmanteau words that must have been difficult to translate. (The book was translated by Richard Francis, Suzanne Levine, and the author, and it won a translation prize.) Ríos is often said to be influenced by, or to be answering, Joyce's Finnegans Wake. But the notes and formatting mayowe more Arno Schmidt than Joyce (Nabokov's Pale Fire has also been cited, but it's an overused point of reference; compulsive scholarly annotation is more an interest of Schmidt's), and the precedent for Ríos's wordplay is more Schmidt than Finnegans Wake. There are also demonstrably other obsessions in Ríos's project: the third book in the projected five-volume series, Poundemonium, is nominally a response to the Cantos. Larva is determinedly unserious (in that sense, like Finnegans Wake) and consistently lascivious and oversexed (and in that sense very much like Schmidt's obsessions with nymphets and unlike Joyce's contorted and stifled narratives of HCE and Issy). Larva is stuffed with every simple pun the author could imagine. ""Pots and puns! and lick 'em all clean,"" he writes on p. 139. The wordplay is mainly sexual, and sometimes literary. To me, the puns are compulsive, not funny, and seldom engaging. When they are at their most inventive, they can be reminiscent of Finnegans Wake, for example on pp. 151-3 where short paragraphs play on multilingual near-rhymes: ""Back! Bak! Vade retro, bakuninlinguist""; ""Slaap! Sleep! Sloop! Pillow talk""; ""Raaskallen! Rusk a la carte, rascals..."" and so forth.To my ear there are few such passages. A chunk of prose on p. 363 reads like an attempt to emulate Finnegans Wake, and there are other examples. On p. 413 there's a long word, which is an onomatopoeic scream in a dozen languages:""Krioskrigcritschreihuutocrijeritanskrikkkrikkrzykscreamkialtaskravyischreeuw!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""This is an echo of the ""thunder words"" in Finnegans Wake, especially the long word for Humpty Dumpty's fall, and the ""scream"" comes at a crux in the book, after Ríos has spent a full 60 pages listing all the women his narrator has known. (This happens in an unnamed subsection of a subsection of the book -- a fact that signals how random the table of contents is in some respects.) After the ""Scream"" comes a new section, ""Blackout.""The majority of the book is not especially sensitive to verbal strategies other than puns, homonyms, and rhymes, and the prose seldom rewards rereading. In Finnegans Wake, close reading will typically reveal layers of meaning pertinent to the narrative; this is more a kind of stream-of-consciousness multilingualism. Again more proximate model is Arno Schmidt, who was just as beset by relentless lasciviousness (and sexism), and who also loved drama, theater, and breathless expositions.There are a half-dozen exceptions to the Larva's doctrinaire unseriousness, and they stand out oddly. On p. 25 there's a paragraph about a woman beaten by ""a psychopathic Sikh"" until she is ""almost unrecognizable."" These serious passages come and go without motivation, and the effect is that the author seems insouciant and irresponsible about his own material -- and also afraid of being serious, even while he is wildly ambitious as a novelist.As in Finnegans Wake, there are metafictional references to the book itself, which rehearse different possible meanings and justifications for Larva. On p. 30, a footnote on ""volume voluminous!"" calls the book a ""paraodyssey,"" and says of the author (in the third person) that ""his graphomanionanism"" was ""living the written,"" which sounds to me at once vague and self-aggrandizing. Page 434 has a better version of the book, calling it a ""black novel.""As an approximation, I would describe this book as an attempt to write alongside Schmidt -- or, since I don't know if Ríos was aware of Schmidt -- along with a flattened notion of Joyce that Schmidt shared -- and to do so by being as carefree, obscene, fragmented, random, and compulsive with language, plot, sense, and narrative as possible. In theory that could have produced a good result, and the book's formatting (left-facing footnotes, end notes, photographs) is promising, but the result is both intentionally and unintentionally tiring.It's sometimes said in the Joyce scholarship that Ríos is one of the principal authors influenced by Finnegans Wake. But that scholarship has a very unresolved formulation of books said to be influenced by Finnegans Wake. See for example Sam Slote, “‘Odds Without Ends’: Raymond Queneau and the Twisted Language of the Wake,” especially n. 2, citing David Hayman's anthology In the Wake of the Wake (1978), which is an unaccountably miscellaneous collection of authors said to constitute the influence of Finnegans Wake. That book remains an anomaly in its lack of any coherent historical reception outside of the academic Joyce industry. It's not that Larva isn't influenced by Finnegans Wake, or at least made possible by it: it's that if books like this are the signs of Finnegans Wake's presence in literature, then it isn't really present. Or, to put it in Harold Bloom's terms, if Larva counts as a response to Finnegans Wake, then its author may have been too traumatized by that book to think clearly about it.

If literary strength can be partly comprised of those qualities, then Murnane is one of the world's major writers. The caveat, for me, is that I am not sure how much of his writing Murnane controls, and how much is the result of a way of thinking or set of mental habits that occasionally intersect with the project of writing fiction. None of us has full control of either our intentions or our literary structures, and I do not object to rule-generated fiction. But with Murnane the compulsive, automatistic elements are both fundamental and pervasive, so my reading is divided: I can read the work as fiction, meaning as intended invention, but I need to also read it as symptom. I think of this as a limitation, not of the text's interest as a document of psychology or psychopathology, and not for its interest for a sociology of fiction, but for my capacity to read and value it as a contribution to the history of modernism, postmodernism, or fiction.The clearest sign that fiction is only one of several interchangeable modes in which Murnane records his thoughts is the existence of his forty-odd filing cabinets cmoprised of a twenty-drawer ""personal"" or ""chronological archive"" (including notes on every woman he went out with), a ""literary archive"" in tweleve drawers, and other filing cabinets filled with an elaborate information about two horse racing leagues, including the names and studbooks of every horse, all their races, invented pennants, chronology, jockeys, and venues, all invented. (Some of this is in the New York Times Sunday Magazine profile, which I refer to on another Goodreads ; the counts of drawers are from an interview with Antoni Gach in the Review of Contemporary Fiction, fall 2013.)I will only give one example of this double reading here. One of the stories in this collection is ""The Battle of Acosta Nu."" (A note about spoilers. This is literary fiction, so the concept of a spoiler does not apply: what matters is the way the work is constructed. In this  I reveal something that happens toward the end of Murnane's story: but it isn't a spoiler. There is, in the final paragraph of the story, an existential turn, which could be imagined as a spoiler. I won't mention it. But the fact that mentioning it could undermine a reading of the story may be a sign that it is not integrally part of the story, and that the ""Battle of Acosta Nu"" is something other than literary fiction.)The narrator in ""Battle of Acosta Nu"" descends from Australians, but lives in Paraguay. He has never been to Australia, but he is exclusively preoccupied with what he imagines as Australia, and the presence of covert, perhaps unconsciously Australian people in Paraguay. His son falls ill, and over the course of the story, slowly worsens and dies. In that sense the story's model is ""The Death of Ivan Ilych,"" except this is sociopathically cold and affectively nearly a perfect vacuum.As his son lies in his hospital bed, struggling for life, the narrator thinks:""Standing awkwardly apart from them I felt compelled to perform some Australian gesture in that room where the very air seemed oppressively Paraguayan. In the corner was a couch where a parent could sleep during a night watch. I sat down on this couch and took out of my bag a book of fiction that was my current reading. I thought I noticed a sudden tension in the room as the doctors and nurses noticed one by one what I was doing and looked at me curiously. I hoped I was not mistaken; it would have cheered me just then to have those orthodox Paraguayans wondering what subject could be so important that a man would want to read about it while his son lay fighting for his life nearby."" (p. 87)These episodes of cognitive dissonance, in which the father thinks only of his imagined Australian and Paraguayan identities, continue to the very end. In the last ten pages they are increasingly striking and bizarre; in the logic of the narrative they are signs of the father's inability to connect and to be fully present at the death of his son. The entire story is a consistent parable about lack of feeling and lack of capacity for feeling.That is a first reading, done without knowledge of Murnane, the author. In a interview in 2013 (in the journal I cited above), Murnane said two momentous things had happened in his otherwise unmemorable life, which he had spent exclusuvely in Victoria (he never traveled outside Australia, and rarely outside the suburbs of Melbourne). The first was when he held his dying son in his arms, and then his son revived; and the second was the more recent death of his wife. He said he hadn't yet written about his wife's death, because usually there was a time lag between such an event and the fiction that came from it.""There's always this time lag... my son fell seriously ill in 1977. And it was five years before I fictionalized that experience, in something that's a sadly neglected piece of fiction. This piece is in ""Landscape with Landscape."" It's called ""The Battle of Acosta Nu."" ... the medical details of that are exactly as they were in real life, so to call it, except that in real life the son is revived after his heart stopped beating, but in the story he doesn't, he's not revived."" (p. 36)Notice the phrase, ""so to call it."" Murnane has said that in different ways, he considers his fictions as real as so-called real life, and in some ways even more so, and he has always spoken of his ""fictions"" as if they were problems to be solved, or inquiries, and not fictions in the usual sense, except in terms of readers' expectations. Note also the weird present tense in the next clause: ""the son is revived,"" as if his son was a character in fiction.With this knowledge in mind, a re-reading of ""The Battle of Acosta Nu"" reveals an author (Murnane, not the anonymous implied author of the text) who believes he is writing a ""fiction"" about a man who lives in a place he, Murnane, has never been, and who also knows that he is somehow, after ""a time lag"" following his son's recovery, writing a ""fictionalized"" account--that is, he's coming to terms with the experience of nearly having lost his son by writing about a man who could not think directly about his son. He is encountering an unthinkable experience by imagining a person who could not encounter either unthinkable experiences or ordinary, everyday ones.A difficulty, for me, is that knowing this, I see the story not as a controlled fiction, but as an uncontrolled, automatically generated text that uses its narrator's emotional absence to convince the author that he has thought things through. Toward the end of the story, where the son is clearly dying and the father still thinks about Australian identity, the surreal juxapositions of unspeakable suffering and unaccountable detachment are clearly devised to shock. After his son dies, the narrator walks out of the hospital:""Outside the hospital I walked beside a busy road that led into the centre of Melbourne,"" he writes, shocking us as readers, since he has always been in Paraguay. ""It was a cool cloudless morning that promised another of those autumn days more Australian than Paraguayan."" The explanation shows he is, in fact, in Paraguay, but that's a different kind of shock because it shows how little he is thinking about his son.Earlier in the story, however, the juxtapositions of events in the narrator's life and his preoccupations happen more slowly and organically, and that's where I lose the ability to understand this fiction as a piece that was planned around a certain idea (a man who thinks only of an Australia he's never seen, no matter what happens to him). Instead I'm presented with a writer, Murnane, who is himself in the hurricane of his thoughts, which tear him from the ""so called"" real world and into his writing, whether it's about imaginary horse races or his own son. In ""The Battle of Acosta Nu"" he sets out to think about his son by writing about a man who cannot not think about his son, and he sets up a simple and strong rule to keep his story in order: the man sees everything in the world as a problem of hidden Paraguayan and Australian identities. But Murnane is not in control of this simple and strong idea. It is not a strategy for fiction or mourning: it's the way he thinks. It's a kind of writing that wants to demonstrate complete control, by an author who believes himself to be in control, but isn't: his writing is also a symptom of a syndrome that happens to include work that other people read as fiction....more",Notes are private!,0,20,1,not set,"Jul 27, 2023","Dec 25, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1457415.Landscape_with_Landscape

About halWhen You Feel You're Too Old for a Book""Savage Theories"" is inventive and sharp, but as I read I felt a certain distance from its interests. About halfway through the book I began to realize my reservation was a matter of my age.I'd like to say that certain novels seem to be directed to people younger than I am. But I'm not at all sure how to argue that, and there isn't even a proper description of the particular degree of youth I have in mind. If someone says they read contemporary fiction, that implies they don't read primarily children's books or YA fiction. But there's no category for fiction mainly written by, or aimed at, people between the ages of, say, 20 and 40. ""Savage Theories"" made me think there should be such a category. It's a tricky subject because the qualities I'm talking about aren't necessarily matters of calendrical age. I'm twenty years older than Oloixarac, but there are plenty of novels written by older writers that raise these same questions for me, and there is no lack of authors who wrote presciently about old age when they were in their teens. Still, I'd like to suggest that there could be a category of fiction that would include ""Savage Theories""—books that might seem less than engaging to people for whom college, and even the decade or so after, are well in the past. This is also a difficult subject because the disaffection or failure of empathy I have in mind does not depend on the subject matter: there's nothing in this book that alienates me because it has too many Gen-X, Y, or Z references. It has something to do with tone, and in particular to a certain lack of distance or control on the narrator's part when it comes to her enthusiasms.The narrator and the implied author tend to get swept away by ""theories,"" which mainly means political theories, with some psychoanalysis and existentialism. I'm not allergic to novels full of theories and literary references (from Musil and Szentkuthy to Vila Matas), but in this case I am unhappy with something about the way those theories are presented. To start, there is a strange equivalence between the narrator's passion for theories and her passion for sex.1. SexDescriptions of sex can obliterate or derail narrative, as many novelists know, but in novels by writers who are representing (or living through) the decades I'm thinking of, sex can be a flood that washes through the room several times in each chapter. Oloixarac's descriptions of sexuality are as rich in visual metaphors as Neruda's poems about natural objects.On the other hand, when the characters in ""Savage Theories"" talk about sex, they are matter-of-fact, dispassionate, and insouciant about combinations of lovers and ideals of beauty. (One of the characters is supposedly fat and ugly, and one of the people she has sex with—in a group of four—praises only her feet.) Sex itself is curiously distanceless, and talk about it is oddly distanced, and that combination strikes me as young. Even the character in Eimear McBride's ""Lesser Bohemians"" has more distance on sex than the characters in ""Savage Theories.""2. TheoriesTheories also captivate the characters in this ""Savage Theories."" The book is full of the sort of breathless allusions I remember from my undergraduate years. ""I must say,"" a man says in a seduction scene, ""I'm very impressed that you caught that hidden reference to Marx's 'The German Ideology.'"" Although that might seen entirely parodic, on the next page the narrator herself gets swept up in her theorizing: ""I took advantage of the fact that he was chewing, and added that ever since the Knowledge Industry decided to proclaim itself critical (i.e., since the dernier cri of its blusterings is to fancy itself a critic), humanism has been reduced to a republican version of intellectual purity; in the end, product differentiation is as important for (and within) the academy as it is for the capitalist corporations that academics love to hate."" (p. 135)This isn't ironic, except as an example of the mandatory veneer of self-awareness on the narrator's part. It's heartfelt, and the implied author seems entranced by the possibilities granted to her by the unlimited spaces of the novel. 3. Mixing sex and theoriesBoth sex and theory are hypnotic, and tend to ruin the narrator's ability to focus on other things. They are only mixed in a few passages. Here is one: the narrator has just stopped a man from kissing her by asking for a song. It's a triumph, but she dislikes him for acceeding. That thought leads her on to some political theory:""Behind my eyes I confirm the presence of a feeling so powerful I want to bite him: his very being exudes a vulnerability so unpleasant that it makes me dizzy, rivals the strength of my patience without rising to the level of my disgust. But enough. Let us return to the scene. I have no desire to distort a rigorous political theory such as has been established in this book just to make of it a practice drill for some monstrous sort of love."" (p. 164)That last sentence is only slightly ironic: the narrator and the implied author care about their theories, believe in them. Usually the intense scenes of sexuality and equally intense scenes of theorizing alternate without interacting. Passions overwhelm the recurring ambition to be ironic and controlled: and that again strikes me as young.*That is part of why I feel too old for this book. Some decades have passed since I was in college, and both sex and theories have become more entangled and less breathless. Dylan's ""My Back Pages"" says this well:""A self-ordained professor's tongue too serious to foolSpouted out that liberty is just equality in school'Equality,' I spoke the word as if a wedding vowAh, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now.""And even that stanza flies its flags a bit too stridently....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Nov 16, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34713510-savage-theories

It's about a book that won the Man Booker prize in 2018, so I imagine almost no one is reading it now. And what I have to say runs against what Kwame Anthony Appiah said, speaking for the judges:""None of us has ever read anything like this before... Set in a society divided against itself, Milkman explores the insidious forms oppression can take in everyday life.""This isn't wrong, but it orients a reader's response in the wrong way. Burns takes pains to keep everything generic. Northern Ireland isn't mentioned, and neither is England (it is ""the flag"" or ""the country over the water"") or even Belfast, and people are ""maybe-boyfriend,"" ""longest friend,"" ""third sister,"" and so on. The utility of that for this novel is clear: it permits Burns to give voice to the way her main character isolates herself from the politics of her community: she experiences people as signs of different types of permitted, preferred, and problematic relationships. The precedent for this studied anonymity is existential literature, especially Kafka and Beckett but also the Coetzee of ""Waiting for the Barbarians"" or Buzzati's ""Tartar Steppe,"" and there are hints of Calvino and others in the same lineage.I don't read novels to find out about the world, but inevitably many things in Milkman present themselves a found facts from Burns's upbringing. She couldn't have invented, for example, the idea that in a neighborhood opposed to the ""state"" (England), and full of ""renouncers"" and paramilitaries, people didn't want to go to the hospital because they'd be reported to ""the flag"" and ""the army"" or ""the police"" might try either to turn them into spies or spread the word that they were spies. In the course of Milkman I learned a number of probable facts like that. But I didn't read it to experience Belfast in the 1970s, and those realizations were intrusive.As a novel, it is a study in ""brutality, sexual encroachment and resistance,"" as Appiah also says, and it achieves its effect line by line. The precedent for Burns's blank, affectless, but curiously tortured prose is Gertude Stein, and Stein is also the source of some overly wrought passages, like the final clause in this sentence:""And he experimented with food, thinking all the time he was an average guy, with no average guy, not even his mates, who did like him, thinking him this also."" (32)Milkman is exceptionally tightly crafted. It reads at an unchanging slow pace from the first page to the last, again like Stein. The anomalies are therefore all the more obtrusive. One is the main character's own reading, which is 18th and 19th c. European literature: Gogol (20), ""The Brothers Karamazov, Tristram Shandy, Vanity Fair, or Madame Bovary"" (17) and so on. These are just tokens of the narrator's dangerous detachment from her politicized surroundings--they're a 20th c. version of Madame Bovary's gothic novels. They're also obtrusive because they refer too directly, too specifically, to Burns's own teenage years. And yet writers like Austen do echo in Milkman, because its portraits of the convoluted, paranoid, insufficiently self-aware thoughts of its characters owe more to 19th c. realist and romantic novels than to the 20th c. writers who were Burns's closer models. The mostly tightly woven prose helps make the book claustrophobic, helps convey its stifled fear and anger, helps express the narrator's ostrich-in-the-sand survival strategy. It's a really unusual accomplishment, and it is at its strongest when Burns gives us 2- or 3-page essays on different social dilemmas and particular constructions of lies and self-deception.As in the early modern ""novel-essays"" studied by Roberto Ercolino, Sianne Ngai, and others, and like Kafka's parables and Beckett's dramas, things that actually happen are either muffled by rumor or ineffective at changing the narrator's life. Plot is inimical to this kind of novel because it presents easy solutions to problems that the author has demonstrated, over many pages of careful prose, to be either insoluble or so easily renewed that there is no point in trying to solve them.That is why the last two chapters of Milkman, beginning around p. 260, should be seen as disappointing. If they aren't, that's because readers expect a certain kind of plot, one with resolutions, justice, and especially an escape for the beleaguered heroine. In the last hundred pages the narrator's mother finally connects with her true love after an agonizing mismatched marriage; the narrator witnesses one of her brothers belatedly connecting with the woman he loves, who has been poisoned and is nearly blind; the narrator has a delicious revenge against one of her sisters; she herself is poisoned and nearly dies; the man who has been following her around is killed; another man who has been harrassing her is beaten; her ""maybe-boyfriend"" turns out to be bisexual and more in love with his male partner; and she realizes at last that it's been useless to try to ignore the place she lives in and bury herself in 19th c. novels. Those are all spoilers, but they shouldn't be, because until p. 260 or so this is not the kind of novel that can be spoiled by plot points. There are no spoilers in Kafka, Beckett, or others, because there is no sense that a dramatic turn of events could solve or resolve anything. Plot, from that perspective, is fantasy, and exposition is at least the possibility of veracity. (And not, as Ngai thinks, a ""gimmick."") Nothing in my reading of the first 260 pages is diminished by knowing the things I have mentioned: those are dense pages, written with an exceptional degree of control, and it's just too bad, in retrospect, and Burns felt she needed a sudden string of revenges, epiphanies, morals (""how terrifying it was not to be numb,"" p. 294), and happy endings to wrap up her novel. Beckett, Kafka, and even Stein could have told her she didn't. (And looking back, I still can't understand why she thought those plotlines were plausible, given that the preceding 260 pages had demonstrated so forcibly that everyone in the city was caught in an enormous web. Was she thinking of the expectations of commercial fiction? Was she so inviolved in her character that she made that character's fantasies into facts? Was it the only way she could stand to relive those years? I hope she writes a book on paralysis without cure.)...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,not set,"Nov 05, 2020",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36047860-milkman

Its plot could be told in three or four sentences. It centers on the feelings of an 11-year-old girl over the course of a winter. Her bond with another girl is mirrored by the changing landscape, which probably occupies more than half the book. There are no linguistic pyrotechnics, no clever emplotments, no complex interior monologues, no irony, no satire, no carefully wrought conversations, nothing witty, no jokes or humor, no virtuoso set pieces, no play with genres or styles, no summaries, no flashbacks, no anticipations of the future.From a postmodern perspective that would pretty much make complexity impossible. In this book it comes from the way that simple thoughts, barely articulated, are mirrored by the landscape, which is itself simply but carefully observed. The main character has very few ideas in the course of the novel, but the landscape in which she lives responds slowly, repeatedly, and at length,weaving her few thoughts and moods into water, snow, trees, and ice. ""The Ice Palace"" could be criticized for being an example of late romantic ideas, for relying to heavily on the pathetic fallacy, for being uninterested in politics and immune to much of the modernist history of the novel. Marilynne Robinson is the current incarnation of some of these ideas about community, nature, narrative, piety (although it's not a n explicit theme in ""The Ice Palace""), and a sort of timeless present.

It is a ""comedy"" (Bernhard's word) in the way that Buechner's ""Leonce and Lena"" is a ""comedy,"" not in the way that Sunday comics are comedies: ""Old Masters"" is venomous, despairing, and desperate. Real spirit is in short supply, someone says in ""Leonce and Lena"": ""From now on, we will have to drink our spirits from liqueur glasses."" ""Old Masters"" is a parody of certain kinds of negative judgments, especially about visual art, but that does not mean the author is light-hearted. I think Bernhard would have hated this book with the same intensity he directed at contemporary theater (note the last line of this book!), contemporary music (he rejected even the canon of avant-garde composers, the ones Adorno triumphed, and prefered Josef Matthias Hauer's monotonous endless dissonances), writing (see his dismissal of Marianne Fritz, who was published by one of his own publishers, Suhrkamp), and painting. ""Old Masters"" rejects all of painting, except Goya and one painting by Tintoretto, and it does not do that as a joke. The idea that Bernhard's themes in ""Old Masters"" might be subjects for an afternoon read and a laugh would have made him even more dementedly angry than he aready was. This is a book written during a personal tragedy, and that should be enough of a clue that more was at stake than a diverting jab at bourgeois taste.I'll take just one example. There's a double-page spread with the following text, taken from ""Old Masters"":""We could have accepted so many great minds and so many old masters as companions, but they are not a replacement for people, so said Reger, in the end we are, by all these so-called great minds and these so-called old masters, left alone, and we see that we will be mocked by these great minds and old masters in the most vulgar ways."" (pp. 124-25).Bernhard struggled to compare himself to ""great minds"" like Wittgenstein, Goethe, and Gould, and took their lack of (imaginary) companionship very seriously. This was a person for whom most of human society was intolerable, and he hoped, repeatedly, that he could find some common ground with people he admired. So the sentiment in this passage is as serious as any could be for him: since people couldn't be companions, at least there could be solace in sitting silently in front of one of the few remaining acceptable works of art--until, that is, it became apparent that even the great ""old masters"" would have despised him.And how does Mahler illustrate this? With a scene on the left-facing page of Reger, sitting in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, his back to us, comically small on his museum bench, wearing a wide flat-brimmed Italian priest's hat. He stares out past a high cordon toward the lower parts of three large, dark, looming picture frames, too high above his eye height to see. On the right-facing page, Reger and his bench have shrunk down to the width of a couple coins on the blank page. The cordon has moved and now it surrounds him. The words ""left alone"" float in the air above him. Mahler's illustration is sentimental and whimsical at the same time: two more emotions Bernhard hated. ""Old Masters"" is acidic, as full of vitriol as a book can be, and its humor is pitch black. Anyone, like Mahler, who reads it as poignant or simply amusing is misunderstanding Bernhard's serious and hard-earned judgments against Austrian society: Mahler is exactly the kind of uncomprehending bourgeois whom Bernhard parodied in other novels, and in his prize acceptance speeches: a person who does not see the serious judgments behind the ""comedy.""I'm sorry if this  seems too negative for an internet forum. As I read Mahler's book I could feel Bernhard writhing, and to be faithful to my sense of Bernhard's accomplishment I felt I had to respond, useless as it is to write into empty cyberspace. And--of course--it doesn't matter if Mahler misunderstood Bernhard, because he has produced a book of his own, with lots of easily digested light humor and toothless parody. It's a consistent and legible book, it's just not an interesting book....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,not set,not set,"Oct 07, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/42625419-old-masters-illustrated-by-nicolas-mahler

The layout of the pagesProblems with Dream LogicThese are notes on ""The Book of Communities"" (1974), first of the trilogy translated in this book. 1. The layout of the pagesLlansol (pronounced, roughly, Yensol) has been compared to Clarice Lispector and, more distantly, to Pessoa and, still more distantly, to Dickinson (whom Llansol translated). One striking similarity with Dickinson is the odd gaps in Llansol's paragraphs, which are like Dickinson's increasingly wayward dashes:...they laughed, they listened to the voice that slowly read whatthey had written and, in the end, even imitated their laughter youmust know that a soul laughter must generally pass firstthrough two nights that the mystics call purgations laughter or...never again bring me a message that doesn't know how to tell mewhat I want. The door closed with a softdisturbance of airwhich agitated the scarfwhich wrote to look for the book; a short phrase, once found, was lostagain... [18-19](In these excerpts, you have to imagine the words ""what,"" ""you,"" ""first,"" ""or,"" ""me,"" and ""lost"" are right-justified.) The text in general is right-justified, but with gaps, and at times it breaks into shorter left-justified lines, mimicking blank verse. As in Dickinson's dashes, some of these gaps make sense (""laughter"" does), and others are difficult to interpret. The effect isn't so much prose alternating with poetry as prose broken by thoughts that have not been written. (I wonder if any of Dickinson's dashes can be read that way.)2. Dramatis personaeIn the book, Ana wanders around her house, and through landscapes, in the intermittent company of a half-dozen other people: St. John of the Cross (San Juan de la Cruz); the early 16th c. German reformer Thomas Müntzer; Henry Suso, the 14th c. German mystic; Meister Eckhart, the early 14th c. German mystic; and Nietzsche. Sometimes these characters are people, and other times they are animals, and a loosely dream-like logic is maintained throughout. The main character, Ana de Mercado y Peñalosa, funded the tomb of St. John of the Cross in Segovia, and may have been the woman he said he loved in the poem ""Llama de amor viva."" The presence in the book of an unknown person (Ana) together with well-known people (St. John of the Cross, Eckhart, Suso, Nietzsche) and several perhaps less-known people (Müntzer) makes for a dream-like atmosphere. At one point Ana shaves Nietzsche's moustache (she describes one of the photographs taken lae in his life) and his head, and he falls asleep on top of her. Other characters are more ethereal or surreal. Müntzer was beheaded, and his head falls into various scenes. The entire book is about writing, and in a sense all the characters are writing, or thinking of writing. Writing takes places in memories, on paper, as metaphors of light and water. And as Benjamin Moser notes in the Afterword, there is a remendous loneliness in the book: it was written in exile, in Brussels, and its author had little hope anyone would ever read it.All this is makes for a memorable combination: disparate historical characters, most of them mystics or theologians, and a waking dream of solitude disarticulated by unexplained gaps. ""The Book of Communities"" has no real structure. It is a continuous dreamlike meditation on writing. In that sense it is like a combination of Lispector and St. John of the Cross (or Eckhart), and it also made me think of spectral music (Grisey, Murail), which was contemporaneous.3. Issues with the dream logicReading becomes difficult, for me, whenever any of the characters is named, which happens several times on some pages. With a few exceptions, Llansol does not have her historical characters quote their own writing, and none behave in ways that can be connected to what they wrote. All of them drift in and out of the narrator's imagination with equal freedom. This wouldn't be an issue if I hadn't read all of them (except Müntzer), so their proper names conjure many specific ideas, images, tones, voices, problems, and cadences, none of which are used by Llansol. She seems to have read only ""Zarathustra"" among Nietzsche's books, and I can't be sure what she has read of St. John, Eckhart, or Suso. In an abstract sense this shouldn't matter, because what counts is what they say and do in the novel: but it does matter, because readers will bring their own knowledge with them, and that will be continuously unaccountably distracting. On the other hand, if Llansol had used only Ana's name, or perhaps only Müntzer's (who has read him, or even read about him? Scholars of the Reformation?), then the oddity of the book would be reduced, and it would be less memorable.A solution might have been to quote just selected words from each writer: that would have signaled to readers that those writers were included for particular lines or images. Alternatively, the writers might have behaved more differently from one another, signaling the author's interests in their imagined presences. As it is, they are mainly walking proper name tags. That logic works in dreams, where a Meister Eckhart might make an appearance without needing to explain himself, but not in novels, where an actual public, no matter how distant from the author's life, is waiting to know whether they are included in the author's dream, or merely ignored. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,not set,"Oct 05, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/34381087-geography-of-rebels-trilogy

The consumer s on Excessive Metaphors as an Illness of WritingMost of the online s of the English translation mention Antunes's language. The consumer s on Amazon and elsewhere call it ""amazing,"" ""dense,"" and ""difficult."" To be a little more specific, the complexity comes from French surrealism, Celine, and Latin American Magic Realism. Yet Antunes is different from Lispector, Lorca, Dos Passos, or any number of possible precedents, beause he is addicted to tropes. He lards sentences with as many figures of speech as he can, and seems not to pause to ask if his metaphors are appropriate to the narrative, or make sense together, or even make any kind of sense at all. ""Language of Hell"" seems entirely unedited, as if Antunes never met a metaphor he didn't like. A  at ""Three Percent"" says Antunes's sentences are ""labrinthine"" and ""carefully wrought."" The first is sometimes true; the second almost never is. This book is partly about a psychiatric asylum outside Lisbon, and partly about the Angolan war of 1961-74. An interview in the ""Paris Review"" focuses on the trauma of that war, implying it is enough to account for the avalanche of tropes. But at an early point -- maybe ten pages in -- the ""hell"" of mental asylums and bloody wars became endless and therefore uninteresting. My interest turned to diagnosing Antunes's severe addiction to metaphors.Here's an opening example:""...the sky was composed of successive layers of overlapping gray, the river shuddered with a fever all the way to the sea, and the rain furiously burrowed hundreds of crystal braids into the highway. The windshield wipers moved their shaky automaton elbows, shaving away the persistent acne of the raindrops."" [p. 63]In my count that is five tropes. The first is rare in this book, because it is only minimally figural. A river shuddering with fever is a good image, because it fits, in reverse, the narrator's rushed trip back to his more feverish life in Lisbon. The first part of the third trope (""the rain furiously burrowed"") complements the river image, but the next part of doesn't (""hundreds of crystal braids""). The next two figures of speech veer into unrelated imagery, first robots and then pimples. In order, then: naturalistic, strong, overdone, rote, ridiculous. (A note about these examples: I've tried to choose passages that are minimally dependent on the translator's choices. My comments here have to do with the logic of Antunes's tropes. Other tropes in the translation are undoubtedly modified from the original in ways that would make it necessary to look at the original.)Many metaphors in ""Knowledge of Hell"" are maudlin, as when the narrator compares himself to a dead dog in a park, covered with leaves (p. 81), or when he defines loneliness as ""the people standing before me and their gestures of wounded birds, their damp gentle gestures that seem to drag themselves [sic: the people], like dying animals, in search of impossible help."" (p. 72) Antunes seems not to register the maudlin. It's not that he uses it too often, or believes in it too much: it's that he doesn't notice it. But the maudlin is part of a rainbow of moods, and for me the most affecting, because genuine, is the feeling of desperation that hangs over the sentences: he needs to escape from literal description. Every thought and image needs to be transformed. Inevitably some are cliches, many don't work, and some, like these two, are emotionally off-key. The anxiety about covering (or decorating, or beautifying, or intensifying) ordinary language is itself maudlin.If Antunes's obsession (or addiction, or compulsion, or perceived duty) to chain tropes endlessly, and to avoid writing purely descriptive prose, can be imagined as an illness of writing, then one cure would be William Empson's ""Seven Types of Ambiguity."" That book is like a tonic for this one. Antunes seems never to interrogate his choices of tropes or pause to consider why he feels his narrative needs to be continuously transformed. He seems never to have paused to wonder what any given metaphor meant: it feels like inspiration was followed quickly by obliviousness, as if he felt his writing forced him to invent and move on. Empson is the exact opposite. He worryies at exhilirating length over a couplet in Shakespeare or a few lines of Wordsworth.Another sense in which the endless figure of speech are like an illness is the juxtaposition of entirely unrelated tropes in long sentences. Another is Antunes's proclivity for tropes that are strong and suprising, but lose their meaning immediately after they're read or even while they're being read. Two examples:""...in Messines the absence of the sea is so total that the wind hawks the phlegm of bronchitis in the throats of the streets"" [p. 60].And this one, which Antunes apparently especially likes, because he repeats it twice:Loneliness ""is a child's gun in a plastic bag in the hand of a frightened woman"" [pp. 68, 71]Empson might say: Well, let's see. What is a child's gun? A gun that doesn't function? And why is it in a plastic bag? Because that's cheaper than a paper bag or a handbag, and therefore indicates desperation? The kind of desperation that drives a person to go out carrying a plasic bag? And why is loneliness frightened? (And, although it's a different matter, why is loneliness personified by a woman, when the narrator is a man?) I doubt Empson would have been engaged by Antunes; he would have thought the writing was too loose. In his headlong accumulation of tropes Antunes is very unlike Celine, Dos Passos, or Lispector: he'd more like an expressionist painter who feels compelled to use all the colors in the palette in every painting.One more example:""...he didn't realize he had left Albufeira until he stopped smelling in his nostrils the sweetish odor, of candied squash, from the sea. It was a smooth and bland odor identical to the perfume of coloring agents, to the aroma of liqueur-filled bonbons, to the lavender that emanates from linen in chests..."" [p. 40]In my count that is five metaphors and three qualities (""sweetish,"" ""smooth,"" ""bland""). They vary in legibility and pertinence, and they are presented without any connection to one another (except for the assertion that they are all ""identical""). It's not that long sentences with enchained tropes are necessarily a bad thing, and it's not that writers need to choose the best of their tropes and delete the rest, and it's not that writing can't be interesting when it is wildly overstocked. (As in Celine.) It's that Antunes himself seems not to be listening. It's as if the author himself doesn't seem to be reading his own book. He operates under a compulsion much more stringent and unremitting even than the horrors of war in Angola or the tortured lives of the patients in the Lisbon asylum: he is pursued, deviled, by the feeling that every sentence, every thought, has to be ornamented, has to be brought out of its literal life, and then, because that operation is so violent and random, it has to be immediately forgotten. That itself is the content of the book for me: it's a pathology of writing, and for that reason it is interesting as long as I keep finding new symptoms, new clues to the ways he thinks. For me, that source of interest ran out long before the book ended....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,not set,"Apr 22, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2514704.Knowledge_of_Hell

As Michael Hofmann says in the ""London Review of Books,"" Yiyun Li's book is ""intimate, but not personal; or personal, but not private""(June 2017), and it is as literary as Pessoa or Vila-Matas. There are any number of complimentary things that could be said about her attempts at honesty and truth. A fair amount of the book is about writers, and readers, and the literary life, and it is very much concerned with communities and possibilities for understanding and empathy. But I felt consistently excluded from the book's imaginary roster of readers, because the writers who engage her imagination, both as models for her own writing and as lives she can hope to understand, are so conservative. The book ends with a partial list of writers she has mentioned; they include Austen, Chekhov, Hardy, Hemingway, Tolstoy, Mansfield, and Turgenev. There are a few moderns, mainly Larkin (d. 1985) and Moore (d. 1972). Li opens and closes the book with stories about her friendship with the Irish authors William Trevor and John McGahern. Those choices epitomize my unhappiness. They were both excellent writers, but also among the most conservative of their generation. Not only are the modernists missing (Joyce is hardly mentioned), but so is the entire last fifty years of Irish fiction. Surely Li knows many of them personally, since she teaches at Princeton and has attended writers' events for decades. But modernists, pstmodernists, and younger writers do not impinge on her imagination, despite the fact that many have written about the same issues that preoccupy her in this book. (I'm thinking of Enright and McBride in particular.)The authors she reads are this book's main interlocutors, much more prominent than the scattered (and often susprisingly painful) memories of her mother, her friends, or her fellow patients. It makes sense that what matters most are the authors' letters, not their fiction, because this book is about imaginative connections between lives, and not the craft of fiction. In that sense it may not be cogent to complain that Li cites mainly 19th and early 20th century writers. But younger writers, postmodern writers, contemporary writers, also write letters, and novels about letters. Li could just as easily have found her issues there.This is why I feel compelled to make this complaint, and why I sense I am excluded from the otherwise accommodating field of this book's imagined readers. In my own field, the history of art, there is a history of modern Chinese artists responding to the more conservative strains of modernism: Matisse instead of Picasso, the School of Paris instead of surrealism, neoromanticism instead of conceptual art, and so on. Even now the traces of those preferences can be found in art academies and in work that does not participate in the uniform expectations of the international art market. I can't help but see Yiyun Li as part of that same phenomenon, but whatever the reasons, her choices exclude me from the roster of writers I am invited to imagine she might engage. And that's a pity, because her book could only have been written in the 21st century. Its honesty about suicide, its affinity to autofiction, its fragmented self-questioning, all make it contemporary, but the literary world that provides its stories ended in the last century.*Since I raised this question, I'll make a brief and very tentative attempt at an answer. The kinds of ruminations and observations that apparently sustained her, at least on the page (as opposed to what might have been said and thought in the hospital, a site we are not allowed to witness), have a certain character. They flow easily into one another, forming loosely enchained chapters bound by themes. There's an elegance to that, and it's an elegance that may very well have been healing, but it is far from the more fragmented, disconnected, dissociative forms of the imagination in other books written under pressure of suicidally strong thoughts, such as Beckett's ""Watt,"" Handke's ""Sorrow Beyond Dreams,"" or Bachmann's ""Malina."" The more contemporary the writer, the more extreme the forces that work against the sort of mellifluous prose in this book. The back cover endorsements on my copy of Li's book include one by Marilynne Robinson, perhaps the current height of trust in seamlessly unfurling prose.

Why is there so little talk about music in ""The Loser""? This is a book abWhy Fiction and Music May Not MixI'd like to pose this  as a question. Why is there so little talk about music in ""The Loser""? This is a book about Glenn Gould (named, and with mainly true things said about him), Horowitz (same), a character named Wertheimer (who has echoes of Paul Wittgenstein, the pianist and friend of Bernhard's), and the narrator, also a pianist. The entire novel is consumed with music, and yet there is very little here that's specific about music: a couple of individual pieces are named, and there are stray mentions of Schoenberg, Webern, Handel, and some others. There is exactly one passage on an individual piece of music, when Wertheimer overhears Gould playing the second half of the Aria in the Goldberg Variations.It's known that Bernhard knew a great deal about music (one of his favrites was Josef Matthias Hauer: you can judge your own knowledge of modernist music by whether or not you know him), and so it's clear that he made a decision to omit any detailed talk about music from the book.In the book, music and pianism are entirely matters of ""genius."" The narrator talks incessantly about who was the ""best"" ""piano artist,"" and who was second best. Gould was of course ""better"" than Horowitz, and so forth. What strikes me here is that this is not how any professional I know, in any field of the arts, thinks. Once you learn about an art (classical piano, abstract painting, whatever) you come to care about individual artists and artworks, and even about parts of artworks. I admire Gould for his performance of some of the variations in Beethoven's Op. 109, but not others; some preludes and fugues in the WTC, but not others. I am convinced by his performance of individual passages and even single notes in Bach, and not others -- for example in the Aria, where some notes sound overdone and intrusively ornamental, and others crisp and ""modern."" I don't think this is unusual, and it's attested by the intense scrutiny listeners give to performances by their favorite pianists. (Those comparative videos on Youtube are a contemporary manifestation.) Once you get to know an art, a medium, or an instrument, it no longer makes sense to say things like ""Gould was the best pianist in the world.""(This is related to the reason why I put off reading ""The Loser"" until I'd read almost all Bernhard's work: I have my own ideas about Gould and Horowitz, and I imagined Bernhard's thoughts would get in the way of a sympathetic reading of his novel. As it turns out, there are no specific ideas about Gould or Horowitz at all -- you could never tell, from ""The Loser,"" how they played.)So this is my question: why did Bernhard deliberately avoid writing anything specific about Gould's technique, or Horowitz's, or about their interpretaions of any pieces of music?Here are a couple of possibilities.1. ""The Loser"" has a satiric purpose, and it's about obsession, self-destruction, and people driven by claims of precedence, fame, and genius. This question could perhaps be asked without reference to music. There is little of Wright's architecture in ""The Corrections,"" little of the Wittgensteins in ""Wittgenstein's Nephew,"" little of Goethe in ""Goethe Dies,"" and so forth. But ""The Loser"" seems different to me, because it names enough actual music to signal the reader it is not only about personalities, that the music matters.2. Bernhard thought that literature itself -- fiction -- could not accommodate detailed discussions of music, because references to individual works would not be known to readers. I don't like this as an answer, because Bernhard was absolutely the last person to care about his readers' level of education.3. He was averse to music criticism, description, or analysis of any sort. This is possible; I don't know his position here.4. He thought discussion of music is incompatible with the narrative forms and voices of literature. This is the explanation that intrigues me. Bernhard was aware of precedents for including descriptions of individual passages and performances, especially Proust.Two postscripts:- This question is a live one for me, because I am working on a novel that includes not only precise descriptions of music, but actual sheet music. If there's something to the fourth answer, I'd like to understand it better.- And I should add that ordinarily I would not pursue a question that asks for an answer outside the narrative, in the real world. But this book points insistently outside itself by repeating the names Gould and Horowitz. The answers I'd like to find are about the implied and actual author, Bernhard, not about the narrator, who is entirely swept up in the desire to be ""best"" ""piano artist."" ...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,not set,"Feb 05, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/92570.The_Loser

I can understand the popular reception of Godot and other plays, and I can see postwar works as exemplars of existentialism, but I am baffled that a book as bizarre, as emotionally and affectively opaque, as formally unaccountable, as multiply wrecked and fragmented, as little in control of its logic, could ever come to be widely understood as a classic of the kind that attracts Nobel committees. Watt makes ""The Third Policeman"" and ""The Dalkey Archive"" seem congenial. It makes ""Memoirs of my Mental Illness"" look like a simpleminded diagnosis. How can it possibly begin to explain Watt's weirdness to note that it was composed while in hiding from the Nazis, as if that particular anxiety had diffused through the book, metastasing into the exotic bruises and bacterial growths of Watt's imagination? Anyone who finishes this book and experiences mainly the cryptic complaints of a Resistance fighter in hiding has refused the words that Beckett wrote, which have nothing to say about war or exile. One of Beckett's principal scholars, David Hayman, thinks of him as a ""difficult"" author, a ""St. Sebastian type"" with a ""paranoid personality,"" whose reception ""has always rested on the willingness of a masochistic(?) audience to surmount the obstacles placed in its way in order to join a limited group of adepts, to share in Beckett's mind set."" (Hayman, ""Continuing Now: Crisis Enjambments in the Watt Manuscripts,"" 2002, p. 212 , n. 8.) What does ""difficult"" mean if it amounts to such a simple diagnosis? Beckett is not a club with a steep membership fee, furnished on the inside with comfortable lounge chairs.This is a novel of barely managed compulsions, of nearly uncontrolled experiences of meaninglessness. The narrator is like a helium balloon tethered to his own life by unraveling threads. He secures and resecures his experiences to their meanings by rehearsing self-imposed conditions and lists. He finds it especially comforting -- although the comfort lasts only as long as the rehearsal -- to run through lists of two things, arranged in groups of three, or three, taken in pairs, or four, taken in groups of three, or six, taken in pairs... it hardly matters, provided there is a combinatorics that can be rehearsed without omissions. I assume it is equally unclear both to the narrator and the author how these sorts of rehearsals, which keep freezing the narrative into mechanical lists, can possibly reattach experience to meaning, except by the act of threading and rethreading sets of objects to one another, pulling out the thread with each new stitch. Entire pages of ""Watt"" are ceystallized into short phrases separated by commas:""Not that Watt felt calm and free and glad, for he did not.. but he thought that perhaps he felt calm and free and glad, or if not calm and free and glad, at least calm and free, or free and glad, or glad and calm, or if not calm and free, or free and glad, or glad and calm, or if not calm and free, or free and glad, or glad and calm..."" (p. 133)Watt exercises constant vigilance for understanding and control of his own experiences. As a reader one finds oneself watching for the first signs of the impending autistic combinatorics. Sometimes alliteration or slant rhyme is the first sign:""And from [Mr. Knott's room] this ambience followed him forth, when he moved, in the house, in the garden, with him moved, dimming all, dulling all, stilling all, numbing all, where he passed."" (p. 199)At this point I felt the prose tightening: an attack of combinatorics was coming on. The subject matter does not matter. What concerns a reader is what will be listed, and how long will it take? The narrator continues:""The clothes that Mr. Knott wore, in his room, about the house, amid his garden, were very various, very very various. Now heavy, now light; now smart, now dowdy; now sober, now gaudy; now decent, now daring (his skirtless bathing-costume, for example).""The sentences become increasingly rhythmic, like the signs of a seizure. He continues:""Often he wore, by his fireside, or as he mooched about the rooms, the stairs, the passage-ways of his home, a hat, or a cap, or, imprisoning his rare his wanton hair, a net.""Short phrases are often the trigger, and on the next page the list commences. I quote just the first couple of lines (they occupy more than a full page):""As for his feet, sometimes he wore on each a sock, or on the one a sock and on the other a stocking, or a boot, or a shoe, or a slipper, or a sock and a boot, or a sock and a shoe, or a sock and a slipper, ora stocking and a boot, or a stocking and a shoe, or a stocking and a slipper..."" (p. 200)On the following page this mechanical recitation simply stops, and the narrative continues. The reader and narrator may be ""transported"" (as Arthur's story does on p. 198) -- clearly these lists are presented as therapeutic -- but the relief is temporary. An itch has been scratched, but it will start to bother the narrator again soon. Amazing lyrical paragraphs, done with long periods as in Proust or some Joyce, have a special tendency to collapse into lists (pp. 173, 201-203). The lists may have ""great formal brilliance,"" but also ""indeterminable import,"" and they end without comment. (p. 71)This sort of narrative behavior can't be ""designed"" to ""render"" the narrator's thoughts ""simultaneously absurd and rigorous"" as Hayman says: that's their effect, but the judgment about design and rendering assumes the author has control of his invention. If that's the case, why would he wish to demonstrate it again and again? I experience the author here as struggling, not at all demonstrating or rendering. (Hayman, ""Beckett's Watt -- The Graphic Accompaniment: Marginalia in the Manuscripts,"" Word andImage 13, 1997, p. 177.)A better formulation is S. E. Gontarski's proposal that Beckett (1) ""created absences"" by deleting ""detail"" and""explanation"" from experiences, (2) ""destroyed"" chronology, and (3) created ""an alternative arrangement or internal relationship"" that could emphasize ""pattern."" Dirk Van Hulle quotes this in his book ""Manuscript Genetics, Joyce's Know-How, Beckett's Nohow"" and says the emphasis on pattern and order ""counterbalances and nuances Beckett's (over)emphasis on not being in control of his material."" (2008, p. 120) I don't like that parenthetical (over)! Might it be possible to countenance the possibility that artists mean it when they report their lack of system?I doubt Beckett could have produced anything resembling an explanation for the structure of ""Watt,"" except in the obvious sense that there are stages to Watt's employment. I imagine Beckett understood perfectly well -- perhaps I should say excruciatingly well -- that nothing could explain or justify the length of the book's set pieces or speeches. Hayman says it is ""astonishing"" to find out Beckett had no plan at the beginning:""It may seem astonishing, but when he set out to write what was to become his ur-Watt, Beckett had no idea where he was going, no project, no outline, no plot, no setting, and effectively no characters: tabula rasa."" (""Getting Where? Beckett's Opening Gambit for Watt,"" 2002, p. 28.)This is really as close to idiocy as literary criticism gets. Of course it is not ""astonishing"" to learn Beckett did not know where he was going with Watt. By the fifth page any reader who is listening for something other than a clue or a key or a plot knows this is desperate stuff. There will not be any understanding, only coping.*That is the end of my notes on Watt. What follows has to do with the images, which is a special interest of mine. (See writingwithimages.com.) The manuscript has hundreds of images, and the published book has three typographic insertions that are like musical notation. I will consider each in turn.(A) Visual and musical elementsThe six-volume manuscript of ""Watt,"" in Austin, still has not been reproduced in facsimile. A book by Mark Byron, The Making of Samuel Beckett's Watt: The Beckett Manuscript Project, is the next step (due 2020). I agree with Hayman that some of the marginal doodles, caricatures, cartoons, and diagrams in the manuscript were probably intended as illuminations. (Hayman, ""Beckett's Watt -- The Graphic Accompaniment,"" p. 177.)The most extended ekphrasis in the book is the description of an abstract painting of a broken circle and a dot (pp. 129-31). Hayman's essay ""Beckett’s Watt, the Art-Historical Trace: An Archeological Inquest"" (2004) relates this to Beckett's 1936 trip to Germany, which was an attempt to provide himself with credentials as an art historian. Hayman says that in the sketches the passage is much longer:""I should add that the original version was anything but straightforward. It was in fact complicated by long digressions on the relationship of the circle to its center, on the person who could have brought the picture there, on the servant to whom it might have belonged, etc. Nested in this larger art historical setting are the passages that relate to the artist who painted the image and to Watt’s experience with the art world."" (p. 97)In the notebooks, the passage is also full of art historical ""procedures and preoccupations"" (MS, vol. 3:160–77; typescript, pp. 317–29):""For example, Watt first describes the location and mounting of the image and even names its painter. Then he tries to explain its aesthetic impact: what is on the canvas, what illusions it conveys, how the center relates to the circumference, how the illusion is conveyed. He tries to establish who could have brought it to Quin’s house and when, and whether or not it enjoys permanent status there(whether it is a “classic”). In the early drafts, he even attempts attribution before positing the names of other works that could have preceded it."" (pp. 97-98)What remains in the book is not ""universals"" or ""tropes,"" as Hayward says, but a mechanically formalist examination of a very restricted set of possible meanings for the circle and dot. It comes across as an idiot savant's attempt at an inventory of symbolic meanings.Watt imagines the painting in different orientations, and in the notebooks, there is a page showing the painting in different orientations. (It is online, and in Hayward's ""Word and Image"" essay.) Hayward says only this might reflect ""an aesthetic impulse"" (but why? and why that one?). I would rather not blur what happens here with the term aesthetic: this is a combinatorics, licensed by his invention of such a simple two-part painting. It is like one of Beckett's stage sets, or like Knott's room in the novel: a game of simple movable parts.(It's interesting that the painter Beckett probably had in mind, Bram van Velde, subject of his first published essay in French, made work that is nothing like the painting in Watt, despite Hayward's weak protestations. Elsewhere Beckett mentions Elsheimer, Seghers, and Friedrich, although he was allergic to Freidrich's pantheism: ""Kreuz im Gebirge won’t do at all, appeals to the very dregs of aesthesia."")(B) What is music in Watt?There are three typographic interruptions in the text that are musical or rhythmic. There is a ""mixed choir"" (pp. 32-33), a chorus of frogs (pp. 135-37), and the words to the ""descant"" heard earlier (pp. 254-55). I may well have missed a scholarly source, but I haven't seen much discussion of these aside from some notes on variants in different editions. (Byron and Ackerley, ""Watt Is Not a Well-Wrought Pot,"" 2015, pp. 38-39.) None is normal music notation. The first looks like music because it has rhythms noted as eighth notes, quarter notes, and rests, but it has no pitches. Some of the words may denote pitches (""Fifty two point two eight five seven"" may be sol re do re do sol ti), but others are not (""Great gran ma Ma grew do you do blooming thanks...""). It is carefully set in the typescript, with errata, suggesting there's method in it that hasn't yet been located. Dirk Van Hulle points out it is a canon ""with the subject and countersubjects greatgranma, granma, mama, [and] Miss Magrew,"" and the ""contrapuntal states"" of ""blooming, withering, drooping, forgotten."" (p. 165) He also points out the canon is echoed on p. 231. But this doesn't address how it is to be read or heard.Same with the frogs' chorus. I'm not especially patient with puzzles, but this seems to be one. Beckett says the frogs croaked at ""one, nine, seventeen, twenty-five, etc"" (p. 135) and if I count line by line, that gives me the ""Krak! Krek! Krik!"" etc. down the left-hand column. Then he says they croak by ""one, six, eleven, sixteen, etc.,"" that nearly corresponds with the second column. I wonder if this is meant to be puzzled out: it's polyrhythm, resulting from the superposition of several sequences.And the ""descant"" (pp. 254-55), which supposedly gives the rhythm of the ""mixed choir"" (pp. 32-33) only adds different words, and does not correspond to the rhythm of the choir, though I assume it's supposed to.Puzzles aside, I wonder at the sense of music, or rhythm, that we're supposed to get. I can tap out the frogs's chorus, but I can't sing the choir. I can't even understand what its words are. It's a graphical notation, like a table or chart, which reminds me of music, but isn't, for a reason I am not given.It's also interesting that these three interpolations have the same unresolved epistemology as images often do in fiction: it is not clear who transcribed them and put them on the page for us to see. Watt could have shown his transcriptions to the narrator, but the narrator is silent about that. (This is a common theme in novels with images, when the narrators are not carrying cameras; see writingwithimages.com). As Byron and Ackerley note: ""Intentional infelicities and inconsistencies in the textare ascribed to the narrating voice, but it is not certain, forexample, that the narrating voice is responsible for the inclusion of the musical scores."" (Byron and Ackerley, p. 37.)It is curious that none of the marginal doodles and diagrams in the manuscript survived into the book, but the three typographic musical interruptions were retained. That makes Watt one of the very few novels with something resembling printed music. Perhaps it was the whimsical nature of the caricatures that made Beckett decide to exclude them: the musical graphics are different, because they are ciphers like the unaccountable acts of counting that perforate the text.This is a strange book, and its strangeness is what counts, not its puzzles, its process of composition, its supposedly underlying philosophy, or its political moment....more",Notes are private!,0,15,2,not setnot set,not setnot set,"Jan 08, 2020",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/104613.Watt

The s I have read tend to make generalized references to the novel's ""single sentence"" (it isn't a sentence) and the narrator's ""stream of consciousness"" (it isn't). The s say that with the exception of a dozen brief passages about the life of a mountain lion, all 1,020 pages take place in the narrator's mind. For me, they don't: many, and in the end most, take place in the mind of the implied author. I do not think the actual author, Lucy Ellmann, wanted her readers to spend so much time thinking about how the book was written: there's nothing metafictional in the text, no references to writing, and strangely not even any references to surfing the internet, even though the narrator is clearly surfing all day long to check things, just as the implied author must have done. I find myself thinking about Lucy Ellmann, the book's actual author, and also about what the critic Wayne Booth called the ""implied author"" (the person the narrative allows us to imagine writing the book)--even though nothing in the narrative leads me to think I'm supposed to be concerned wuth anything except the narrator's thoughts. This is the kind of issue writing instructors watch for, a ""writing problem,"" meaning a property of a book that may contribute to its strength or interest but appears as a flaw in conception or execution. The apparently endless sentence in this novel is no more a sentence than the one in Mike McCormack's Solar Bones or Mathias Enard's Zone: it is a paragraphless run-on sentence, a set of clauses linked by commas. Part of the idea is to register what is called ""interior monologue"": the presented contents of consciousness, the continuous string of fragments and impressions chosen in the instant by the narrator. In this sense interior monologue can differ from the more famous expression ""stream of consciousness,"" coined by William James, which can break with grammar more definitively, producing fragments and analocuthons. What matters here is that the interior monologue or stream of consciousness does not include selections, summaries, and other edits produced by the narrator at another time. The stream of consciousnessParul Sehgal says the novel's form ""mimics the way our minds move now"" (NYT, September 3, 2019). This is because it toggles ""between tabs, between the needs of small children and aging parents, between news of ecological collapse and school shootings while somehow remembering to pay taxes and fold the laundry."" Let me say this a little more carefully, and suggest three sources for novel's kind of stream of consciousness.The internetToggling ""between tabs"" is shorthand for the whole issue of screen addiction, divided attention, ADHD, and social media. The narrator worries about this, but she's also an example of it, both because she's ""scatterbrained"" (as she says at one point) and has ""no memory,"" and because she herself clearly spends a lot of time on the internet. We don't look over her shoulder while she surfs, which is odd, and it's especially distracting when it is clear the author has paused her writing to go look something up. It is, I think, impossible not to imagine the implied author writing this book with tabs open to Wikipedia, Google, the OED, and other sources. Yet the avalanche of information we receive is supposedly all recalled from some unspecified earlier time in the day or the narrator's life when she was surfing.If the book was intended to represent a literal stream of consciousness, we'd have to be told she is on her phone or her computer at virtually every moment, checking things and looking up things she can use. As it is, we're supposed to imagine that the narrator has done all that poking around before she began the narrative of the book, and that she just brings all the words and facts to mind without surfing for inspiration or accuracy. I found that conceit unconvincing and unnecessary: why couldn't we have been told about the hours (or the scattered minutes and seconds) she spends on her phone? Why couldn't we have been told she keeps her phone or iPad on all the time? Why are the narrator and the author so coy about describing surfing? She's even reticent about informing us when she watches cable television and listens to the radio (p. 190). At one point, after pages of details about animals that could only be found by searching the internet, the narrator says ""I was going to look up sea urchins myself after Ben finished with the iPad""--but even there, we're not allowed to watch her actually surfing (p. 284). It's intrusive, too, when the narrator ""remembers"" long lists of facts of the sort that can't plausibly be remembered and recalled so precisely (like ""the fact that demoic acid is killing birds and seals in Oxnard, Southern California,"" p. 249). Things like that were clearly transcribed from a screen by the actual author and the narrator, but that is never described (pp. 266, 678).I picture this book being written in one pass, with brief stops made many times a page to look things up, augmented by multiple passes for revision, planned repetition, augmentation, and contradiction. That entire process is meant to be invisible (we're meant to think only of the narrator, in real time), but it isn't, because we are compelled to picture it whenever the narrator's rhythms of reference refer us back to the implied author who wrote them down. This is, in short, an inadequately self-referential narrative, or, to put it the other way around, a narrative inadequately sealed off from references to the conditions of its production.Modernist and postmodernist streams of consciousnessThe second part of Sehgal's sentence (""between the needs of small children and aging parents, between news of ecological collapse and school shootings while somehow remembering to pay taxes and fold the laundry"") signals another of Ellmann's sources, the idea of stream of consciousness.There is first-generation stream of consciousness, as in Faulkner, Woolf, Gombrowicz, and Joyce; and there are postmodern streams of consciousness, as in Wallace, Lerner, McBride, and many others, and especially novelists praised for supposedly using long single sentences, like McCormack and Enard.These are the book's precedents, its guides and its points of comparison. As Harold Bloom would say, they are what drive part of the literary ambition of the book. The closest example, I think, is Kenneth Goldsmith. His texts taken from various sources (the book that transcribes an issue of the NYT, one that transcribes a weather report, another that lists every movement or his body) have the special endlessness of this book, even though Ducks, Newburyport"" is composed in a literary mode rather than abducted from a source as in conceptual poetry. But the book has more of the endlessness of flarf, text dumps, and appropriation, than it has of the directed and structured inner monologues and streams of consciouness in modernist or postmodernist novels.Compulsive verbal ticsThis is a third source for the narrator's way of thinking, not mentioned by Sehgal or any other critic I've found. This book has a lot in common with excessive and uncontrolled verbalization in neuroses and autistic spectrum behaviors. (Parts of it reminded me of a person I heard of who lived in a retirement community, who spent his last years writing 15,000 compulsively and rapidly constructed limericks.) Not every list in the book is ticcy. Many of the lists of nouns in the book are composed in the way prose poems might be. Some are presented as free association, but a large number are deliberately constructed using alliteration, strings of similar word stems, or unexpected puns. Here's a typical example: ""USB stick, styptic stick, scabbard, haggard, hassled..."" (p. 48)It's possible to parse this sequence: the styptic stick is another stick that comes to the narrator's mine; scabbard echoes the ""c"" and ""s""; ""haggard"" has a double consonant, ""hassled"" is a slant rhyme for ""haggard,"" and so on.It's worth saying that the phrase repeated over all 1,000 pages of the novel --""the fact that"" -- is not a representation of thinking, whether mediated or stream of consciousness. It lends itself to many entertaining writerly games: ""the fact that what's that word"" (p. 229), ""the fact that that is possible"" (p. 177). Those also entail an implied author who is thinking up unusual expressions. The satire of Trump based on the word supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, ""SUPER CALLOUS FRAGILE RACIST SEXIST NAZI POTUS,"" has been widely quoted (p. 771). In context, it is an obtrusively witty, world-class invention that must put every reader in mind of the actual author and not the narrator, whose wordplay occupies a different level.But a number of the lists in the book are not so much composed as compulsive. At one point the narrator is thinking of the phoneme ""wh"":""what a heel, whhat a hhheel, snaggled-toothed sand eel, whh, whiskey, whhiskey, whhich whittler is whittier and when, why, who, whom, whale, the Princess of Whales, football whatch parties..."" (p. 253)The narrator doesn't think of herself as neurotic or ticcy. She describes her thinking as ""scatterbrained"" (p. 156), ""not straight"" (p. 243), ""in spirals"" (p. 278), or as the result of OCD (p. 538). But she is also ticcy, and the narrator's and author's inability to articulate that makes it plausible that tics determine the text more than the considered collages and inventions that close reading traditionally uncovers in stream of consciousness narration.One of the reasons that each of these three sources creates writing problems is that a continuous interior monologue or stream of consciousness takes place while the narrator is thinking, and therefore in real time. It can become difficult to move the narrator along through the world, and have events happen, because the interior monologue is continuous and should flow up to and past every event. That would mean alternating between reported dialogue or events and the narrator's sometimes disconnected thoughts.Ellman gets around that in several ways, some of which I find awkward. This is especially the case on pp. 278-79, when the narrator is stranded with a flat tire (p. 207) and waits some time (71 pages' worth of waiting) to be rescued. When the tire is eventually sorted out, Ellman needs to avoid a potentially disruptive narrative in which everything that happens -- the conversation with the man who stops for her, the procedure of hooking up and towing the car, the coffee and conversation in the garage -- would have to be interlarded with her thoughts. So the implied author puts the rescue in past tense (""the fact that he drove out to look for me in a snow storm"" etc.). This despite the fact that the 277 preceding pages (excepting the mountain lion interludes) have been in the present tense. I think this assumes the reader will have a loose and somewhat inattantive attitude toward real-life events; but that attitude isn't really possible given the logic of the text, which has been all about deadlines for the delivery of her pies, and even an appointment with a dentist (which is conveniently free of conversation; p. 200). There is perhaps no good solution to the problem of realist narrative embedded in continuous interior monologue.The Map, Glossary, and AppendixReviewers have hardly mentioned the fact that the 988 pages of narrative are followed by a map, a 24-page glossary with approximately 1,000 entries, all acronyms used in the book, and a 4-page Appendix that is actually a collection of quotations that could have been epigraphs. When I began this book I leafed to the end and discovered the glossary and its odd subtitle: ""A Round-up of Abbreviations, Sanitized for Your Comfort.""It seemed there were two possibilities: either the Glossary was there for a reason that would be revealed in the text (maybe it was a Pynchonesque guide to paranoiac fantasies, or a register of our lives under late capitalism, dominated by administration, multinationals, and big pharma), or Ellman had put it there because it seemed like an unusual, experimental thing to do. It might be taken by readers (so I imagine Ellman thinking) as a helpful index to some of the narrator's thoughts, and possibly also as a small indication of the amount of preparatory work the novel required. That possibility worried me as I read the book. But the looseness of such a motive would be at odds with the careful construction of the narrator's unending inner monologue, which has all sorts of careful acts of writing, cross-references, different forms of syntax, and lists of curiously related words. I like lists, and the history of lists, going back to Rabelais and forward to Perec, but lists are not read like the continuous narrative of this novel, even by list addicts like me. Lists are skimmed, used for reference. The possibility that Ellman would have tacked a long, basically unreadable list onto a very carefully worked continuous thousand-page run-on sentence made me skeptical about the entire project of the novel. Why would she be content to think so little about the possible meanings of the Glossary when she clearly spent so long laboring over the main text? Now that I've finished the novel, it's clear that the Glossary actually has very little use. There was only one place (p. 975) when I thought I was expected to consult it. Instead it functions, in retrospect, like another kind of indictment of comporary American life. It covers some of the same ground the narrator does (big pharma, monopolies, bad government, transnationals, government regulations). But it isn't a nod in the direction of Charles Bernstein or conceptual poetry, and the subtitle indicates as much. ""Round-up"" is inexplicably folksy. The narrator doesn't speak like that, so it comes across as the implied author's voice, more as a political message appended to the novel than as part of the narrator's mental world. The map is odd. If a reader glances at it before reading the book, it signals that at least some of the book will be a Young Adult-style fiction. In fact that is what happens in the pages interpolated throughout he novel (beginning with the first page) that describe the life of a mountain lion who loses her cubs.The mountain lion narrativeThe sections on the mountain lion are usually about one page long, and come right in the middle of the narrator's interior monologue. They become more problematic as the book progresses, because they keep changing in style, focalization (the representation of the mountain lion's thoughts), and implied reader (ranging from adult to young child). At first the mountain lion narratives are presented as straightforward attempts to imagine a mountain lion's experiences. But writing problems emerge when the syle and mood shift.In one section the mountain lion witnesses a suicide and waxes philosophic (pp. 732-33). Then comes a section in which the book's narrator (who hasn't been part of these interpolated passages) contributes some information from the local news (pp. 776-77); a section in which the mountain lion just happens upon a private zoo from which half-starved animals are escaping (pp. 818-19); and a section with a wildly improbable-sounding story in which the mountain lion is captured and escapes when the car carrying it crashes (pp. 862-63). The section on pp. 875-77 gives us a mythologized animal friendship story. One of the last interpolations has a suddenly poetic and insightful description of what people look like from a mountain lion's perspective (p. 928). These are all different, as if the author was experimenting with tone and voice, the way you might when you're sketching out an idea. There is no indication in the text that we are supposed to be thinking of the implied author or the writing process in these passages.The dramatic final incidentThere is a similar shift in tone in the last twenty pages. First the mountain lion story is resolved with a fairy-tale happy completeness that went out of fashion in YA fiction after Harry Potter (note, when you read it, her childrens' reaction to the fate of Jim). Then the narrator undergoes a dramatic incident in which she is nearly killed. These pages suddenly read like notes for a TV drama, complete with gunshots and a fight (pp. 958-59), and they are followed by the book's final twenty pages, in which the narrator draws about a dozen different morals. We have been told that there's a parallel between the mountain lion's cubs and the narrator's children (""kids really are wild animals,"" p. 749) and we've been told that the narrator is alone in her life like the mountain lion (p. 934), but in the book's final twenty pages there are a dozen more morals: the narrator's traumatic experience makes her want to arm herself, despite her fear and disapproval of guns (p. 974); she realizes her experience ""corruped her mind"" and weakened her rather than bringing clarity (p. 968, 973); she contemplates the open-endedness of PTSD (p. 972); and she sees that being tested doesn't make people stronger (p. 971).The book has a few other such moments in which the style jumps abruptly, including some on massacres, and especially a Finnegans-Wake-style passage on sex (p. 514).I've been calling these writing proboems, even though they're integral to the book's achievement, because changes of tone, style, voice, and implied reader are the sorts of things that are flagged in MFA workshops. The narrative keeps referring, inadvertently, to the implied or actual author, as if the reader is asked to explain her decisions.*There are many other issues in this book--the strangely absent and complacent husband, whom we may suspect has been having an affair, the odd lack of progress the narrator makes in understanding her mother's death or even in remembering her adequately, the unresolved question of how (or even whether) she actually talks to her children--but for me, those and other questions are continuously drowned out by the persistent unacknowledged presence of the implied author and the attendant issues in writing....more",Notes are private!,0,30,2,not setnot set,"Jul 09, 2023not set","Sep 12, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/43412920-ducks-newburyport

This book has English translations of writings by all 41 members, from the founding in 1963 to 2018. The last two assessments of the movement, ""The End of Oulipo?: An Attempt to Exhaust a Movement"" by Lauren Elkin and Veronica Scott Esposito (2012) and Cécile De Bary’s ""Une nouvelle pratique littéraire en France: Histoire du groupe Oulipo de 1960 à nos jours"" (2014), were both ed by Mitchell Kerley in SubStance (2018, online). This anthology is more wide-ranging than the materials covered in either book.This is a reaction (not a ). It's an attempt to understand something that has puzzled me for a long time: Oulipo writers speak about their constraints, but never about the expressive effect of the constraints on their texts. The constraints in texts like Perec's ""A Void"" can be simple, but they produce intricate effects on the writing: ""A Void"" can sound offhand, colloquial, awkward, inept, regional, foreign, and bureaucratic in the space of a sentence, because of the word choices. Oulipo is a puzzle to me because unlike some contemporary conceptual poets, its writers are not producing ""objects"" or ""outcomes"": they remain interested in constructing examples of literature and poetry, and their texts are full of the conventional elements of writing (narrative forms, common character types, common class and gender constructions, traditional tropes and choices of words, unsurprising imagery)--and yet they talk only about the constraints, as if constraints could block all convention and produce texts cleaned of any historical traces.1. Literary value Esposito's critique of Jouet as not sufficiently ""literary"" -- his Métro poems, one of which is in this anthology, are criticized as ""mealy mouthed,"" like a ""first draft""--and his praise for Cesar Aira is a useful way to raise the question of literary value. Technically, Oulipo's productions aren't supposed to have literary value: first because they are only ""potentially"" literature (""littérature potentielle""), and then because the interest is supposed to lodge in the constraint and the new forms it enables, not in conventional literary ideals such as expression, insight, affect, or realism. Nevertheless it isn't possible to avoid the impression that Oulipo has produced a possibly disproportionately large number of forgettable texts. In this book there is Hervé Le Tellier's ""Liquid Tales"" (2012), a set of harmless apercus that are occasionally whimsical or existential; Olivier Salon's ""Shark Poem"" (2013), a trite parallel between poets and sharks; Pablo Martín Sánchez’s ""Metric Poetry"" (2012), which does not add much to Jouet's idea of writing on the Métro... there are many forgettable entries in this anthology. (The anthology has several excellent pieces. Harry Mathews's ""Saint Catherina"" (2000) is a hypertrohpied sestina in prose, and the effect is a kind of hypnotic dementia; and Pierre Rosenstiehl's ""Frieze of the Paris Métro"" (1998) is an excellent fusion of visual elements--mathematical diagrams--and prose, and it's followed by one of Jouet's actual Paris Métro poems.)So I am interested in Esposito's criticisms of Jouet and others, and in his praise of Aira and other non-Oulipians such as Tom McCarthy, Édouard Levé, and Christian Bök (I've written on all these, except Levé), but the assessment of literary value is not an Oulipian criterion. Esposito's co-author, Lauren Elkin--no relation of mine--is concerned with gender representation, especially in Hervé Le Tellier's work. As Kerley puts it, she notes that Le Tellier and many other Oulipeans fail to ""question or examine the existing structures of either power or language."" This is also significant, but it is also not an Oulipean criterion.The problem of literary value, for me, has to be raised alongside the problem of the members' lack of attention to the concept. I don't say lack of awareness, because literature and literary value are continuously present in Oulipean writing. But it is seldom clear which qualities of literature are to be emulated, which are to be avoided, and how constraints affect those qualities. 2. ConstraintsThe idea of constrained writing is itself curiously unconstrained. Some of Oulipo's constraints are very challenging: monovocalisms, permutations on the sestina, lipograms, etc. But many others are so loose that they effectively don't prevent any content. Michele Audin's ""Caroline, October 21, 1935"" (2015) is an inventory of objects on a tabletop. Is this usefully understood as a constraint, or is it more like a theme, or even an interest, or a focus? Paul Formel's ""Novels"" (2006) is described by the editors of this anthology as an ""extended descendent"" of Queneau's ""Exercises in Style,"" in which an anecdote is retold 99 times. Formel retells a story from 7 perspectives. It's more like ""Rashomon,"" but whatever its genealogy, there is no appreciable effect of the constraint: ""Novels"" is just 7 pieces of average flash fiction.In order to make sense as a constraint, a constraint should exert a perceptible effect on the writing--perhaps by excluding words or ideas, or by forcing their inclusion; or else by distorting the language itself, for example by redirecting the narrative, or rearranging morphemes, words, or elements of narrative. In addition (and this is a second, separate theme) if the constraint is apparent, if the author publishes it, or if it can be deduced from the text, then it becomes part of the work. It exerts its own pull on the reader, and has its own ""literary value."" I will consider these points separately.(a) When constraints are known, or can be deducedThis anthology provides a wonderful contribution to this topic, in the form of Calvino's ""How I Wrote One of My Books"" (1982), describing ""If on a Winter's Night a Traveler"" (1979). The text, which occupies 15 pages in this anthology, can be used as a guide to all 12 chapters of Calvino's book, and at the end Calvino gives page references in Greimas's ""Du sens"" that provided the structuralist semiotic combinatorics. This text, ""How I Wrote One of My Books,"" now becomes part of the book for English-language readers. The reading experience of the book now changes. It will always be possible to read ""If on a Winter's Night a Traveler"" by itself, just as it is possible to read Perec's ""Life: A User's Manual"" without the astonishing documents of its constraints (they are all online: see escarbille.free.fr/vme.php). But these documents are not of the same kind as Flaubert's letters, or Sartre's, or discarded drafts of manuscripts: they are finished documents, the exact equivalents of simpler statements of constraints given throughout this anthology. When constraints are known, or can be deduced, it seems to me they produce a more interesting hybrid text, comprised of the constraints and the texts they have been permitted to produce. The problem for literary criticism and reception multiplies, because Calvino's ""How I Wrote One of My Books"" is actually readable.(b) Motives Given the variety and sometimes the intricacy of Oulipean constraints, it is surprising that there is so little on the subject of motivation. What has prompted members and followers of Oulipo to impose constraints? There is an interesting passage in Jacques Roubaud's piece called ""⊂"" that bears on this problem. (The ⊂ is explained by the editors of this book as ""the mathematical symbol for complementarity,"" which is wrong; they also have a very poor explanation of Queneau numbers [p. 220], which makes me think that they have little affinity for the often strong mathematical content of Oulipo.) Roubaud remarks:""I sensed... that I was not going to be able to stop myself from having mathematics play a part in [my] process... it was initially just a desire for amazement, a hoax, [a desire for] singularity, originality, an aesthetic meaning which was of course not entirely inexistent (Max, calligrams, cummings). But now I want to take this hoax thorugh to its end."" (p. 277)To me, this is a remarkable passage, because he declines to think about what mathematics is actually doing for his writing. Naturally enough, when he first started, it would have been a pleasure to produce ""amazement"" in his readers, and there would have been times when his mathematical constraints were taken as a ""hoax,"" and other times when they were recognized as ""original."" But now that those motives have passed, he still remains committed, and it is not clear why--and more puzzling, it is not at all clear why he does not perceive the need to explain that commitment. There are similar passages by other Oulipo writers, in which the hardest thing seems to be thinking about what literary effects constraint actually produces. Among the implicit and explicit answers to that question, there is the possibility that constraints produce originality by dismantling or blocking literary conventions that are unknowingly brought into the text. That is often true, but it is never entirely true: certain conventions will be made difficult or prevented by certain constraints, but many other will not be, including the underlying conventional desire to produce ""good"" or ""strong"" literature. (c) The effects of constraints on writingThe idea of multiplying constraints as a blockade against conventions has been explored much more thoroughly in music. Stockhausen's Klavierstueck 10 is an example: for that, he invented 12 ""dimensions"" of music (like pitch, pedalling, etc.), divided each one into 7 ""levels,"" and then made permutations of each one. Almost nothing of older music could survive in the final composition. The result is still not impossible to listen to as a virtuoso composition in the romantic mode, and that is an aspect of its reception in performance. Boulez did the same kind of thing in the Second Piano Sonata, and it is full of fragmentary equations from Berlioz, Wagner, and any number of predecessors. Constraints do not necessarily produce originality or the freedom from convention, and when they do, they work in ways that are entirely unpredictable. Perec's ""A Void"" is an excellent example of this unpredictability. I am not aware of any s or assessments that remark on the strange kinds of English that result from the lack of the letter ""e,"" but the effect is intense and kaleidoscopic. (I assume it's the same in French, but I can't assess that.) The beginning of a sentence might sound like patois, and then it might evoke a vernacular usage or even an obscenity, then veer into a surprising ventriloquism of some dialect (like Southern American English, or Midlands UK English). None of this would be intentional. The simple constraint does indeed produce a complex originality, but that originality is not itself analyzed, because Oulipo constrains itself to speak only of its constraints. (I've written on ""A Void,"" for example on Goodreads, and also on Bök's ""Xenotext,"" which has passages that sounds like weird Loeb Classical Library translations. An example in this anthology is Olivier Salon's ""Invisible Cities: Lille"" (2007), which is a variant of a lipogram in that it contains only the vowels in ""Lille."" It veers senselessly between various implied styles: offhand, literal-minded, formal, oddly abbreviated, jocular, Joycean, beginner's prose... and I am only reading the first three lines:""Lille's glimmering. It seems impressive. Lille stretches then Lille rises. Night's ending, it's high time! Lille's sheer steeples rise, then it flicks its index finger right there..."" (p. 213)I can't imagine a way of approaching texts like this, or Perec's lipogrammatic texts, without acknowledging this ruleless, uncontrolled collage of pastiche styles.(d) The difference between literary texts and listsI would also like to explore the possibility that there are two flavors to Oulipo: readable texts, like Perec's, and lists, like Bernard Cerquiglini's ""A Very Busy Year"" (2013), which gathers all the emails he received at work regarding the closures of departments and facilities related to his job:""The Digital Francophone Campus of Tbilisi will be closed from January 1 through January 7.""The West Africa Office and the Digital Francophone Campus of Saint-Louis will be closed on Thursday, January 12, in observance of Magal de Touba"" (p. 253)And so on for many pages. Without a narrative, the expressive value comes from the unusual placenames. Carquiglini ends with an optimistic note:""The entire staff of the Middle East region wishes all of you excellent holidays and a new year filled with joy, good health, and peace.""This balances whatever sense of dissipation and uselessness might have accumulated over the long read of the list. In the aesthetics of lists and what has been called ""cruft"" (see David Letzler's excellent book, ""The Cruft of Fiction: Mega-Novels and the Science of Paying Attention""), the question of attention looms. How should such texts be read? Kenny Goldsmith chooses to read his own unoriginal texts quite expressively, as if they were conventional mid-century poetry. Others read in a carefully affectless voice. Tan Lin has said that his texts ask for different kinds of attention and inattention--skimming, glancing, selecting. All of these questions of reader's attention are raised by texts like this one that avoid narrative. It's such a fundamental choice that it seems to me it should count as a fork in the Oulipo road. It leads to flarf, conceptual poetry, and aleatorics, and away from problems of literature.3. The visual element in OulipoVisual elements in fiction are one of my principal interests (writingwithimages.com). The are perhaps four kinds of visual elements in this anthology: comics, mathematical diagrams, mathematical and structuralist symbols (in Roubaud and Calvino), and lists and tables. The overtly visual contributions are comics, and they are weak. Étienne Lécroart’s ""Counting on You"" (2012) is disappointing because it is the only entry that makes an attempt to apply constraints to visual material (he limits the number of lines in each drawing), but does so in an entirely unvoncincing manner. I am more interested in the other three kinds of visuality. Rhett McNeil, reading an earlier draft of this text online, noted that even lipograms are visual, and that's true. In that sense a high percentage of Oulipo is is oriented toward the visual. Very provisionally, the kinds would be:(1) graphic novels, comics, pictures(2) diagrams(3) symbols, mathematical and other(4) lists, charts, and other formats(5) visual appearances of pages of ordinary text (as in lipograms).The last is especially intriguing, and I may write more on it. But the moral, in terms of this anthology, is that Oulipo authors might consider the visual more inclusively and more reflectively, to avoid exercises like Lécroart’s, and to fully include diagrams like Rosenstiehl's.Concluding thoughtsI'm hoping this will be the last time I feel the need to write about Oulipo. I agree with Esposito's concern with literary value even if I'd make different choices, and with Elkin's concern with the fact that constraints haven't produced effective politics or gender representations. (And to that I'd add that constraints also haven't prevented whimsy from being Oulipo's principal mood.) But in addition it is difficult for me to understand descriptions of Oulipean texts that do not address the question of whether the constraints themselves are, or aren't, to be read as parts of the text itself.And it is difficult to understand or believe in the critical reception of Oulipean texts as long as the literary values and meanings that are produced by the constraints go unanalyzed and even unremarked. In some contemporary conceptual poetry and writing descended from Oulipo, it makes sense to say the product of the process isn't a poem or a piece of writing in the usual sense, even if that is more a rhetorical position than a claim that squares with readers' responses. But the Oulipo authors consistently write about literature, and produce texts that are versions of very recognizable forms, expressed in entirely recognizable conventions. I am interested in writing texts that ask to be read differently, including texts that seem to be produced by constraints, and texts that seem to be non-narrative, like lists. But I am uninterested in abrogating the writer's duty to analyze and understand their own methods and strategies by applying constraints in the hope that they will produce innovative effects. Writing is so much more interesting than that....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,not set,"Jul 31, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/41131222-all-that-is-evident-is-suspect

It takes the form of a dictionary, which is an unusual gambit for a novel. A principal precedent is Milorad Pavić's ""Dictionary of the Khazars"" (1984). (See the note at the end of this .) Are there others? There are shorter pieces by Borges, Perec, and Lem, but I am not aware of other book-length dictionaries that ask to be read as novels. The model for the organization of Han's novel was possibly Kundera's ""Unbearable Lightness of Being,"" a novel Han translated (生命中不能承受之轻; from the English translation, I assume), where each chapter is about a word.1. ""A Dictionary of Maqiao"" as experimental fictionA case could be made that this is one of the world's untranslatable novels, because it depends so much on local vocabulary, dialect, and phonetics. The narrator is continuously exploring differences between the Maqiao ""dialect""--its pronunciation, and especially its idioms--and Mandarin from ""the city."" The translator, Julia Lovell, strikes a compromise by giving Chinese characters for each dictionary entry and finding English for everything else. Katherine Wolff's brief ""New York Times""  (August 31, 2003) sees the book as ""a meditation on the trapdoors of language and on the microhistories buried within words."" Many of the stories are explicitly about language, and not character development. The entries are not in the usual Chinese ""alphabetical"" order, because--as a prefatory note explains--it is easier to follow the book's stories if they are disarranged. Almost all the entries are discontinuous and independent, and the majority are self-contained stories. For all these reasons--independent pieces of fiction, arbitrarily arranged, the dictionary format, the experiment in language--the book could be read as part of postwar French-influenced European and North American fiction in the general tradition of Oulipo. But I don't think that is an adequate description, because it is overtaken by two other readings.2. ""A Dictionary of Maqiao"" as political textA look at the online s in English seems to indicate the book has been mainly received as a political essay. The narrator went to Maqiao as part of the Cultural Revolution, and there are many references to the futility and comedy of attempting to standardize Chinese life.As ""Kirkus Reviews"" put it: ""The result is a subtle and smashingly effective critique of the futility of totalitarian efforts to suppress language and thought."" Or as Danny Yee puts it, the book is ""a powerful demonstration of just how different a remote rural village can be—or, for the Western audience of this translation, of the diversity of China."" A reader with the screen name Bjorn, on Goodreads, says the novel is ""a deconstruction of the idea of ideological revolution (whether Maoist or capitalist) imposed from outside.""In these readings, Han is primarily sending a message to anyone in China who feels minorities can be safely classified and contained by a central administration. I don't think the online ers are wrong, and the book can be read as a critique of ideology, with the Maqiao dialect as its principal example.3. ""A Dictionary of Maqiao"" as traditional Chinese narrationFor me even the political reading is less central than a third reading, which would connect the book to Ming ""novels"" and earlier texts. Han's dictionary entries are often stories that draw morals, and in that respect they present themselves as variants on traditional sorts of Chinese fables and stories. The ""Publisher's Weekly""  does a good job at conjuring this:""A sharp, sophisticated observer, [Han] narrates... folkloric tales from the vantage point of contemporary China, situating them within a richly informative historical and philosophical framework. Among the stories that deserve mention are those of Wanyu, the village's best singer and reputed Don Juan, who is discovered to lack the male 'dragon'; of 'poisonous' Yanzao, so called both because his aged mother has a reputation as a poisoner and because he is assigned to spread pesticides (and in so doing absorbs such a quantity of toxins that mosquitoes die upon contact with him); and of Tiexiang, the adulterous wife of Party Secretary Benyi, who takes up with Three Ears, so called because of the rudimentary third ear that grows under one of his armpits.""For a while I experimented in adding titles to the dictionary entries, so that instead of single words they had brief discursive titles in the manner of older Chinese narratives. (I was thinking mainly of Cao Xueqin, and also the ""Journey to the West."") Here are some examples, Han's dictionary entry first, and then my invented title:""Tincture of iodine [碘酊]""On the unexpected accuracy of some rural expressions.""Sweet [甜]""In which the narrator draws a simple moral from the observation that impoverished language leads to misunderstandings.""Same pot [同锅]""In which a lucky marriage helps fills the stomachs of a young couple from the city.""Placing the pot""On a colorful and slightly violent old custom and what it once led to.""Qingming rain"" [清明雨]""In which the author muses on how rain stirs political memories, lost on the young.""Rough""In which a man appears to be a sage in disguise, but the author won't tell us for sure.This traditionalism is most prominent source of meaning for me, and it reduces both the political messaging and the linguistic experimentation to vehicles. As Jenny Lee pointed out, reading a draft of this , it is likely Han's interest in Ming and older texts was partly filtered through Lu Xun, who had done work on vernacular Chinese, folklore, translation issues, and rural/urban divides back in the 1920s and 1930s. So it's likely that Han might have experienced his echoes of Ming and earlier texts in a more modernist way--but for me, it's the broad reference that counts, and from a European or North American point of view, the references to folktales, moral narratives, and similar forms seems an imposition in the experimental regime. I'm tempted to see it as the Darmstadt composers saw what Richard Taruskin calls ""bad Bartok""--the Bartok who was more interested in eastern European folksong than in his modernist experiments. This creates a conundrum in reading: either the book is richer because of its mixture of traditional and experimental, or its author has been distracted from his experimental interests by the pull of traditional forms. Although I can appreciate the book's historical position in 1980s-1990s Chinese eclectic experimental writing, as a novel it seems overwhelmed by immiscible traditional forms. 4. A note on the AfterwordThe book ends with a three-page Afterword, which proposes two morals. Han begins by regretting that his Mandarin has ""standardized"" him. ""Even the 40,000-odd characters in the Kangxi Dictionary,"" he writes, ""have banished this enormous amount of feeling... beyond the controlling imperial brush and inkstone of scholars."" However he hopes that new forms of difference (that's my 21st century term) will emerge:""Who can say for sure, while people search for and use a broadly standard form of language.. that new dimensions in sound, form, meaning, and regulations aren't emerging at all stages? Aren't psychological processes of nonstandardization or antistandardization constantly, simulatneously in progress?""It's a lovely and unexpected moral. The second moral is only a single sentence, and it isn't supported by the novel itself: ""Providing we don't intend exchange to become a process of mutual neutralization,"" he writes, ""then we must maintain vigilance and resistance toward exchange... this implies, then, that when people speak, everyone needs their own, unique dictionary.""That is fairly astonishing, and if Han had developed it as he wrote, the novel would have been very different.How, then, to locate this book? According to Wikipedia, Han is influenced by Kafka and Marquez. (It's not clear if that's the encyclopedist's notion, or Han's.) Traces of Kundera's ""Unbearable Lightness of Being"" are visible throughout. But Han also translated Pessoa's ""Book of Disquietude"" (惶然录), and I can't begin to guess what he got from that experience: I don't see anything of Pessoa's endless introspection, and only a few traces of his interest in the writing itself. It would be good to know more about what Han read, and whether he imagined this book as a response to postwar experimental writing, from Pavić to Oulipo.*Thanks to Jenny Lee for the Chinese titles of Han's translations. Regarding Pavic's ""Dictionary of the Khazars"": a Chinese art historian, Li Yiqing, sent me this:""I googled The Dictionary of Maoqiao, and found a piece of sensational news about the 'Maqiao Event' (1996-1999). This can explain who influenced Han Shaogong and the controversies of this influence. The story goes like this: in 1996, some writers and scholars claimed that Han Shaogong’s ''Dictionary of Maqiao plagiarized Pavic's 'Dictionary of the Khazars.' Zhou Yiwu from Beijing University said that the book is a complete copy of 'Dictionary of the Khazars.' In 1997 Han sued Zhou and six other writers, arguing that his novel is not a copy of any other writer’s work. Han won the suit. Yet the argument did not end with the court judgement. Some influential writers urged the China Writers Association to investigate the plagiarism issue, and hundreds of articles were published about the event... Later, some scholars found that Pavic's 'Dictionary of the Khazars' is similar to Jorge Luis Borges’s 'Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius.' At the end of the last century, the 'Maoqiao Event' aroused a nationwide discussion about originality and innovation of literature. Some scholars have said that the 'Maoqiao Event' is more interesting and more significant than the 'Dictionary of Maoqiao.'"" That's from Li Yiqing. I don't know anything more about the 'Event'; but I have read 'Dictionary of the Khazars,' and in my memory it is very distant from Han's novel....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Jul 27, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/590810.A_Dictionary_of_Maqiao

A sentence or two might be found about which someone might say, I could improve that, but such a person would only be thinking such a thing on account of his own reading of Gordon Lish's work, and on account of the reduction of his customary patterns of thinking into the very harsh and patterns of the person, Gordon Lish, whom he had been reading. This problem, of the difficulty of criticizing Gordon Lish, comes also from the very wide acceptance and indeed adulation of his famous interrigations of other people's writing, and his well known and indeed famous and infamous, both famous and infamous, razorwire attention to individual sentences, resulting, in well known cases, of his utter and surprisingly quick rejection of entire manuscripts, indeed probably also of entire novels, on the basis of his quickly delivered verdict regarding the very opening sentences of the manuscripts, without his even reading the entirety of the manuscripts, or even actually more than their opening sentences.Lish is remembered with affection and awe by students, and his novels aren't usually criticized or, perhaps, widely read. It may seem his legacy is his exemplary impatience with fustian and ill-formed sentences. But it isn't true that Lish was a teacher and that's the ""beginning and end of it,"" as one person wrote on Twitter in response to this , because his teaching points to, and limits, a kind of practice, which the novels exhibit. His wasn't simply good teaching or exemplary editing: it was a particular sort of editing, which has specifiable consequences for writing. In other words: if you value Lish's example as a teacher, it's worth worrying about what kinds of writing it enables and entails.In this book by Gordon Lish, a man named Lish rants and raves for chapters on end about his desire to fuck a large number of women, and his exasperation at one woman, and his shredded life and its many injustices and wounds. The person Lish in the novel is described, immodestly by the author Gordon Lish himself, very clearly the author of the endorsement and description on the dust jacket, as a ""ravishing shriek of a man,"" ""desperately libidinous"" and""grotesquely comic,"" which are true, but also marred by the reader's uncomfortable awareness that only one person could possibly have written those lines, and that is the author of the book, Gordon Lish, eventhough the result is queasy making. But I digress.The book, Zimzum, opens with an epigraph by Thomas Bernhard, and I think that was a mistake. Calling Bernhard's rants to mind sheds an unhappy light on Lish's, because Lish's character Lish rants in a very precise way: his thoughts are unravelled and artfully scrambled, which is proper to a rant, but the sentences that convey his scrambled thoughts have clearly been subjected to a sharp sober patient scrutiny that is entirely of a different order than the unsettling and trackless rants in Bernhard's books. Lish has nearly perfect control over me, that is what each one of his sentences says, and when it says that, it entirely and permanently forecloses the possibility that the ""shreik of a man"" might actually be dangerous or clinically damaged or ruined or frozen or broken, and those are all metaphors form Bernhard's books, where people are not saved by the omniscient clarity of their narrator....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,not set,"Jul 20, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/526548.Zimzum

Ovid wrote two sets of poems from his exile in Tomis (in Pontus, a region of present-day Turkey on the Black Sea, and in Constanta, a Romanian city, also on the Black Sea), called Tristia and Epistulae ex Ponto. Malouf used Tristia for his picture of the nearly barbarian outpost Pontus, but other than that he invented his ""imaginary life."" It strikes me as a quadruple allegory:1. It's an allegory of poetry, because Ovid is described as redicovering poetry in Pontus. First he finds it in the people there and their shaman, whose language is not as inflected as Latin (the narrator says this several times), but is more intimately attuned to nature. Then he finds it again in the ""Child,"" a feral child the narrator takes in. The Child can mimic animal sounds, and the narrator realizes that is a deeper form of poetry, one that depends on empathy. (This is contrasted with the narrator's satiric and hypereloquent poetry.)2. It's also an allegory of Australia. There are three worlds in the book: Ovid's scintillating life in Rome; his simple, superstitious life in Tomis; and ""the last reality,"" his life in Asia, beyond the Ister (i.e., north of the Danube), with the feral child. I imagine I'm hardly the first one to say this, but Rome is like England, a distant dream of soft overfed, overindulgent people devoid of belief but rich in ""dazzling lierary display""; Tomis is like Australia, a wholly new world, surrounded by nature, with only the faintest echoes of culture; and the child (and the Asian grasslands) is like an Aborigine, intimately at home in nature, naturally happy, fundamentally Other. The narrator has to cross painfully from Rome to Tomis, but he accepts it and learns its language. Later he crosses joyfully from Tomis to Asia. (If this seems unlikely, consider Malouf's Remembering Babylon, about a white boy taken in by Aborigines. The England/Australia/Aboriginal triad recurs there.)In a brief note Malouf says he was interesed in how Ovid might have escaped ""skepticisim"" and found belief. So the book is an allegory of religion as well. And it's also a Bildungsroman, with a mystical circle of life built into it.

""Strange, that I remember only the mornings. Or maybe it was all a single morning, all those high school years -- dark, chill runny-nosed morning, shock of school uniform starch against the skin.""This instantly conjures any number of 20th c. English writers (not Americans): I thought of Waugh, Greene, Barnes, and especially of Ishiguro. The carefully and yet apparently effortlessly chosen adjectives and images speak to a certain ideal of writing from a colonial past. I didn't think of Patrick White, for example, or any number of mid-century American writers. Yet in the next few pages Nam Le tells us he and his high school friend argued about Rilke, Rimbaud, Tennyson, Blake, and Hopkins. Aside from a bit of the last nothing of them remains, and more to the point there's no mention of any number of other people who were argued about in the early 1990s, including in high schools -- Acker, Perec, Roubaud, Wallace, so many others. It seems as if Nam Le grew up from an adolescence thinking of romantics into an adulthood thinking of conservative modernists.He makes a case early on for Malouf's difference, how he doesn't fit the transparently nationalist agenda of the authors who were then set as required texts. But then that shifts to an impassioned defense of the canon, as a way of introducing Malouf.""Like Malouf, I'm a student of Western philosophy. I honor the Western approaches of intrinsic skepticism, self-critical inquiry, uncertainty. I hew, as hard as I can, to epistemic humility.""Fair enough, I might have thought as I read those first two sentences, because they could mean, or lead to, practically anything. But that third sentence is not humble. It's a literary brag. And who, exactly, hews? Waugh, Greene, Barnes, and Ishiguro, for example. Then he mentions Shakespeare and Socrates, and remarks ""Is it not possible to acknowledge their worth, critique the context that begat them, and then go out of our way -- out of our skin -- to find, encourage, and value works by and about all those people who all this time have been systematically 'othered'?""The seriousness of his defense of Shakespeare and Socrates (made of straw here, or something even flimsier) may have made him a bit self-conscious, because the word ""begat"" is weirdly imported from the King James Bible to help make the case -- and then just afterward the sentence veers into the hortatory and formal with ""and then go iout of our way...""The next sentences are:""All this feels rudimentary. Unremarkable. But in our shared, splintering moment, nothing can be said to go without saying. Basic things beg belaboring.""The one-word sentence is suddenly chummy, vernacular. And the Gertrude Stein echo in ""nothing can be said to go without saying,"" as well as the alliterative last sentence, are bids for modernist syntactical profundity.I think this is horrible writing. It's sycophantic to the former colonial power, and it vamps, not only for Malouf but for the famous British dead. I would have written ""fairly horrible,"" but then I would have fallen into the same temptation to ascend to literature by carelessly revealing signs of my educated poise, my ability to move effortlessly from the biblical to the chummy. I'll apologize in advance to the Goodreads and other readers who may have found this. If you are looking for an excellent book introducing some Australian modernists, may I recommend ""The Burning Library"" by Geordie Williamson, a really excellent newspaper critic (turned publisher)?

Raffel's prose also has echoes of McCarthy and Proulx, but it is if anything more carefully tended even than theirs. The sometimes very short chapters have been published in a range of literary magazines, and they bear the imprint of North American MFA programs. Every line wants to show evidence that it has been seriously and tirelessly pondered. Sometimes it's possible to guess at three, four, or more cliches that have been avoided in order to find the better word. Many lines have been condensed nearly to some irreducible imagist point. (The first of many acknowledgments at the beginning is to Gordon Lish.) This is from the opening page:""The sight of her, the aunt thought: wan unironed sister in the light. The hand a fleshy visor. Useless. To have traveled like this, with the heat and with the child, in the festering light, no bags but bags, the aunt observed..."" (p. 5)The book continues with this density for a hundred pages, which seem, at the speed of reading, to be 300 or more. Some drawbacks of this sort of writing:1. Inevitably, if every line is interrogated, there will be moments of excessive, and therefore distracting invention. For me the first was on the second page, where the unnamed aunt's sister is said to have ""a bra strap dingy as unrinsed teeth."" That qualifier must have been Raffel's eighth or ninth try at an adjective, and it's good. Bras are rinsed, and can have the color of dirty teeth, but the simile is so wrought that it's mainly distracting.2. Inevitably, there will be moments of over-writing. On the same page there's this (the aunt is trying to get her sister and child on their way home):""'Shall we?' she said. 'Shall we hasten?' she said, and her sister--a touch, a breast, a way of moving, Mama to the child, Elise her name--said yes."" (p. 4)""Elise her name"" reminds me of the intentionally awkward grandiosity of the less successful stories by Proulx, McCarthy, and others. It's supposed to sound at once modernist (in its inventiveness) and pioneering or rural, or perhaps even mythic and faux-Homeric. But who talked like that, exactly?3. This sort of abbreviated qualifying phrase, together with the aspiration to conjure some indefinite past or timeless present (with echoes, here, of Steinbeck as well as Hemingway) lends itself to poetic repetitions. These can be obtrusive. For instance ""That it was not kept up is not open to question,"" or ""The child appeared to be looking at the aunt with what appeared to the aunt to be a fever in the eyes."" (p. 6) These repetitions aren't from ancient tragedy or epic: they are knowing, hyper-eloquent, MFA-quality decisions, and therefore mannerisms.These sorts of problems might not be visible, or at least not bothersome, if the writing occasionally relaxed into other modes. But it doesn't. It seems that for Raffel--maybe as she understands Lish, Volk, Gary Lutz, Ben Marcus, and a dozen others she thanks--really good prose needs to survive a ferocious interrogation. That is certainly often true, but it should not appear to be true in every paragraph on every page. It feels as if Raffel is fighting a doubly losing battle: to avoid every cliche (while unhappily creating new ones all along the way), and to rise to Faulkner's level of craft by sharpening it to 21st century razorwire precision (but can a practice now almost a hundred years old be answered or even honored by late academic prose?). I think of Raffel as a disease of the contemporary literary magazine and MFA culture: this is daunting, if your purpose is to write an entire novel without nodding or even blinking. It's unfortunate the prose has no other speeds, no other levels of awareness and care. And for me, it's unfortunate that all that labor has been expended on old-fashioned scenes and ideas....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,not set,"May 24, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1616125.Carrying_the_Body

The first purpose is reasonable for North American readers; the second is ridiculous. The book is hermetic, desperately unhappy, relentless, disconsolate, dissociative, and by turns realistic, mythic, and allegorical. Those should all be signs that a brief explanation won't be helpful. This is how Mark Anderson summarizes the book's reception in the afterword:""To those familiar with her poetry, 'Malina' seems the continuation in narrative of the problems and images informing the lyrical work of the 1950s. To a new generation of feminist readers (who had little patience with what they saw as her hermetic, aestheticist poetry) 'Malina' and the other unfinished novels of the 'Death Styles' cycle have come to stand for a radically 'other Bachmann,' the critic of patriarchal capitalist society where women are systematically denied a voice and language of their own. To historians familiar with the art and philosophy of Hapsburg Vienna, the novel represents a masterly synthesis of a distinctly Austrian tradition, one that reached it apogee at the turn of the century in the work of Freud, Musil, Roth, Schoenberg, Wittgenstein, Hofmannsthal and Kraus. Finally, to contemporary German writers as diverse as Christa Wolf, Thomas Bernhard and Peter Handke ot stands as an inspirational example for their own work."" (pp. 239-40)Note that only one of these three, the one attributed to ""feminist readers,"" is an interpretation of the text itself. Many of the s on Amazon and Goodreads are similarly concerned with gender roles. The translation seems to be read as a memoir, autobiography, or trauma narrative. (A good exception to this is ""Life? Or Thearer?,"" a  by Jennifer Krasinski in ""Bookforum,"" Sept./Oct./Nov. 2019, p. 31.) One er on Goodreads puts it this way:""The generation Bachmann describes has made female victimhood an art form. It grated on my nerves because I have been fighting my whole life both against the male attitude of condescension and property and the female passive voice of pleasurable suffering. 'Look at me, I am killed by male dominance! Don't I look pretty in all my indignation?'"" (""Lisa"" on Goodreads, 2018)But Bachmann was much stranger than the pugilist advocate of women's rights imagined by online ers. Readings like these are misguided because they project later desires for empowerment onto a text that is determinedly closed to meliorist narratives. The novel continues to be taken as a prelude to some feminism, but ""Malina"" does not imply any such future or hope. It isn't about ""disempowerment,"" ""gender roles,"" or ""the lasting impact of child abuse in adult life"" (Sarah Porter on Amazon). Those are things the novel can only be about when it is read for use-value by a 21st century audience accustomed to trauma narratives and self-help books. ""Malina"" itself does not want to be saved: its narrator knows that the air we all breathe is poison. Chapter 2 is full of scenes of violence, incest, rape, and murder, mostly centered on a father figure, but as Peter Filkins wrote in the ""New York Times,"" the narrator""...realizes that the menace of her dreams is 'not my father. It's my murderer.' The distinction is important. For though Bachmann is clearly concerned with patriarchal power and the ravages of family violence inflicted upon women, she also sees such issues as inextricably bound up with the violence done to both genders in the flawed, if not fatal, workings of society and history, as well as the violence we do to and by words because we find it impossible to give full expression to such outrage.""Language itself, for Bachmann, is a form of violence, a ""disease,"" an ""expression of insanity."" (The first quotation is Filkins's; the second is Bachmann's.) Nor will it do to say that the two men in the narrator's life, Ivan and Malina, are absent or manipulative. Ivan, one of the two male characters, cannot love anyone but his children, even though the unnamed narrator declares her love for him; but it is not at all clear that their miscommunication is a picture of conventional gender roles; and the third character, Malina, is too strange, and too nearly allegorical, to be counted as an independent character at all. (Anderson thinks Malina is part of the narrator, and that he's modeled on the Jungian anima. There is some support for this in an interview with Bachmann.)The narrator herself does sometimes fit the model of trauma narratives: she is in continuous crisis; she cries, she shakes, she smokes, drinks, takes painkillers, can't sleep or write. And yet she doesn't communicate any better than the male characters. This isn't feminist advocacy; this is a world in which people try as best they can to remain minimally human.In Bachmann's mind, the poisons of language are personal in a way they aren't for Paul Celan. There is an extended allegory of language and writing on pp. 156-61, where the narrator tells the story of Otto Kranetizer, a postal worker accused of hoarding unopened letters in his apartment.""...in every profession [i.e., including writing] there must be at least one man who lives in deep doubt and comes into a conflict. Mail delivery [the profession of a writer] in particular would seem to require a latent angest, a seismographic recording of emotional tremors which is otherwise accepted only in the higher and highest professions [later described as professors of philosophy and science], as if the mail couldn't have its own crisis, no Thinking-Wanting-Being for it [Denken-Wollen-Sein]"" (p. 159, 253 in the original; see also Surika Simon, ""Mail-Orders: The Fiction of Writing in Postmodern Culture"")This is as close to Kafka as anyone in postwar fiction: it's an extended allegory of artistic work, as in ""Josephine the Singer"" or ""The Hunger Artist,"" and it is infused with anxiety, anger, and fear. What poisons the narrator in ""Malina"" is a different from what poisons words in Celan.Readings of ""Malina"" that take their bearing from contemporary diary-novels, trauma narratives, memoirs, self-help books, or feminist theories, draw on a simplified and domesticated sense of the book. This novel is a tremendous achievement: it is deeply experimental, to the point of continuously undermining its supposedly secure three-act form (blithely announced at the beginning and elaborated by optimistic critics); it is unsure of the relation between allegory, dream, and history; and its story (involving the narrator's death, while living, and her transformation into her spectral alter-ego) is darker than anything that a realist, political, or historical reading could use or comprehend. Postscript 1, on metafictionI'll just close with two smaller points. First, ""Malina"" is a forerunner of the current interest in minimally fictional novels, made popular by Ben Lerner. At one point Ivan discovers notes for a manuscript the narrator intends to write called ""Todesarten"" (""Arts of Death"" or 'Death Styles""), which is the name of the trilogy of books Bachmann contemplated (""Malina"" is the only one she finished before she burned to death in her apartment in Rome) on the ways people die while living -- through relationships, by institutions and politics, by language itself. Ivan counsels the narrator to write a happy book instead. ""Malina"" is not that book, but the coincidence of the name of the book occurring in the book is parallel to Lerner's ""10:04"" and other novels. Writing the thinnest possible veneer of fiction on an experimental, non-linear narrative is one of several things Bachmann was experimenting with in the late 1960's. It would be interesting if the contemporary moment could acknowledge its belatedness.Postscript 2, on humorI'd also like to register that ""Malina"" has some very funny pages. I cringe when ers say this sort of thing, because I usually don't agree. Bachmann's humor comes from a desperate fear and hatred of people in general, a kind of acidic combination of Kafka and Bernhard. Here is her suggestion for how to write back to someone who blithely wishes you a happy birthday (as so many social media sites do these days):""Dear...You wish me... best wishes for my birthday. Permit me to tell you how shocked I was precisely today. To be sure I have no doubt as to your tact, since I had the honor of meeting you some years ago... However you are alluding to a day, perhaps even a specific hour and an irrevocable moment, which must have been a most private matter for my mother, my father too, as we may assume for the sake of propriety. Naturally nothing in particular was shared with me about this day, I just had to memorize a date which I have to write down on every registration form in every city, in every country, even if I'm only passing through. But I stopped passing through countries a long time ago..."" (p. 90)....more",Notes are private!,0,28,1,not set,not set,"May 17, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/265987.Malina

One character, Joachim, is telling another, Samuel, about Joyce's book. The opening lines describe my own engagement with the book, which has gone on now for nearly thirty years.""So then I read Joyce,” Joachim told me, ""not Ulysses, for heaven’s sake, but Finnegans Wake, I read that book all day most days for months, and then some days most months for years. I covered each page in notes, I read his letters, I bought books and books about the book, I read introductions, summaries, annotations, concordances, and indices, I read the pages he translated into French and Italian, I read his first scribbled ideas, really you can’t read them, but I read them, they are just pages of words, like ‘floods reveal,’ ‘why bridge things,’ ‘winding roads,’ ‘swollen stream,’ ‘spudfed pigs,’ ‘angel in the house,’ ‘thought himself sick,’ ‘doubtful points,’ ‘a dark spirit came in,’ ‘what answer did you get,’ ‘dear little girl in Boston, you fill a big hole in my heart,’ ‘amber route,’ ‘lying spirit in heaven / spirit lying in heaven,’ ‘pyjamas redden the bed,’ ‘deafness from a damp pillow,’ ‘not even churches are sacred,’ ‘glegg,’ ‘mental nerve,’ ‘gossipaceous,’ ‘inkpot upset foretold,’ ‘gloompourers,’ ‘wail of wind,’ ‘drip of noise,’ ‘better betray with pleasure,’ ‘scowl,’ ‘maniac,’ ‘semi demented,’ ‘deadened walls,’ ‘inspissated obscurities,’ ‘longueurs,’ ‘border on insane,’ ‘dark clouds and mud,’ ‘mouthless streams,’ ‘vertical rivers,’ ‘melodious cave,’ ‘where he ended his life.’ I read his drafts and typescripts, I read the Buffalo notebooks, those are notes he made when he was nearly blind, they look like they were written by a bear with a crayon. I read his proofs and galleys, I looked up every single one of his thousands of made-up words, ‘ournhisn,’ ‘dororrhea,’ ‘hogpew,’ ‘sossad,’ ‘henayearn,’ ‘pappap poppopcuddle,’ ‘commonknounest,’ ‘speleostoical,’ ‘inflorflorence,’ ‘megageg,’ ‘soswhitchoverswetch,’ ‘conflingent,’ ‘antiproresurrectionism,’ ‘dumpsydiddle,’ ‘ragingoo,’ ‘bombossities,’ I studied every single one of those invented words, they’re are supposed to be jokes, or not exactly jokes, but more like little chuckles, or delights, or just amusements, although many of them are puzzles, and in general they are meant to be entertainments, they are supposed to be brief moments of levity, or no, not levity, that’s an old-fashioned word, they are wee delights or mischievous pleasantries or drolleries or bonbons or whatever, you can tell he thought his invented words are infused with infectious glee. I did not laugh even once. That book has everything I am afraid of. It is written for no one, Samuel, because no one can ever sit back, after months and years reading and studying and annotating, after years and months struggling through the swarms of squeaking scholars, no one can ever sit back, close the back cover with a satisfying snap, and say, Okay, I get that. Finnegans Wake is everything I fear, it is an enormous mistake the size of an entire country, the size of a third of Joyce’s life. The book is only six hundred pages, that is half of Burton or a sixth of Proust, but it took Joyce seventeen years to write. It would be as if I had stopped writing when I got to page six hundred, and then gone back to the beginning and put the pages into a typewriter and typed over them, and did that over and again for seventeen years, until I had six hundred pages of thick black text with only a few legible words surviving among the language detritus and throngs of palimpsestic puns. The first drafts the Finnegans Wake are easy enough to read. They are as clear as you would expect from any ill-mannered modernist writer. But Joyce kept going back, pestering his sentences, scratching and pecking at them, inserting Danish words, Irish words, Serbo-Croatian words, medieval Latin words, pulling apart perfectly good lines and inserting the names of Babylonian gods, Siberian rivers, or Byzantine patriarchs, returning again and again, like a hyena at a carcass, it pulls off a strip of gristle and lopes off, but in a minute it’s back, slobbering for one more scrap. He asphyxiated his English with x’s and q’s from Basque, Albanian, and Chinese, he tied his own writing in knots, he twisted it hard by the wrists, and they were his own wrists he was twisting, I mean he wrote the book to begin with, and then he teased and tortured it, he crushed words into each other, he muddled, muddied, and meddled until his story was gasping for breath, until there was no air or light left in it and it was nearly extinct. The lines are beautiful, I admit that, but so is an old loaf of bread with a flower of bright pink mould, it’s not edible, it’s just not edible. ‘For we, we have taken our sheet upon her stones where we have hanged our hearts in her trees; and we list, as she bibs us, by the waters of babalong,’ I love that, I admit it, but it is primped. He patted poked and fiddled with his book, he rubbed and fondled it, he spat and polished it until it was coated in language bacteria. There is a character in the book, Shem, he’s a writer. He writes all the time, and he never finishes, just like Joyce. When Shem writes it’s like Joyce writing his book. There’s a page where Shem is sitting in his squalid apartment and he runs out of paper and ink. He shits into his hands, puts the shit in a bowl, pisses into the bowl, mixes up a black concoction, bakes it, dries it, and uses it as ink. He writes all over his own body, turning himself black, writing and writing until he records all of human history, just like the book Finnegans Wake. It is a soiled and blackened book, supposedly comic but actually not funny at all.”“No, not especially funny.”“So,” Joachim continued, “I spent several years reading, and I learned that the world’s longest and most complicated books are also the most nearly hopeless books. That is what I discovered. They are the most despairing, the most nearly insane, they are the closest to insanity. Joyce knew his book was written in shit, it was spoiled and getting worse and yet he kept going for seventeen years, plugging up the last beams of light, making it deliciously fetid. He knew what it means to labor by yourself, over the same manuscript, as your eyes get worse and your daughter’s insanity deepens and your s stay bad and your life spills out. He describes the reek of Shem’s apartment, stains on the floor and walls, bowl of shit ink, heaps of dirty underwear, discolored curtains, dried ejaculations, dregs of wine, gleet, that’s an unbelievable word to find in a book like Finnegans Wake, but there it is. Supposedly Shem is working on a letter, but really of course he is writing the book Finnegans Wake. Joyce says Shem explains things with a meticulousness that borders on the insane, just like Joyce, he never grasps the beauty of restraint, neither does Joyce, the balance of his mind was disturbed, well obviously, he hides in his book like a field mouse in a nest of colored ribbons, a sweet idea, he has immovable doubts about the sense of the whole, how could he not, or the sense of the strange words that run, wander, march, halt, walk, or stumble along the barriers of the lines, those too, he must have doubted each and every one and also all of them at once. Shem calls his writing a flood, a jungle, a relic, a ruin, a scrape, a crust, a heap of steaming refuse, a thicket, an avalanche. He looks at his book as a stranger and wonders who wrote it. That is not just a sentence to me, Samuel, I understand what it means. No one can have an experiences like that and be happy. If anyone laughs at something in Finnegans Wake they are forgetting why its author needed so desperately to laugh, how he needed hundreds and endless thousands of those little laughs, how each laugh was like a drowning man gulping another lungful of seawater. The book is everything I am afraid of, it is the diary of a man who becomes compost.”“Thanks, I’ll skip it.”...more",Notes are private!,0,23,2,not setnot set,not setnot set,"Feb 21, 2019",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11013.Finnegans_Wake

Perhaps it's true, as the Paris Review says, that the Nocilla trilogy has ""catapulted"" Mallo ""to the forefront of his generation"" (Twitter line for the essay by Thomas Bunstead, Feb. 4, 2019), but in that case nearly any ""injection"" of the novel with ""a large dose of Robert Smithson... Situationism... Dadaism... poetry... science... appropriation (collage and quotes and cut-and-paste)... technology (often anachronistic)... images (almost always pixelated), and comic books"" would have done the same.First (A) some remarks on the book's use of photographs, drawings, a graphic novel, and an associated video. I read this book in connection with the writingwithimages project, because it has so many visual elements. After that, more negative things: (B) the book's construction, and (C) its really surprising sexism.(This  is of the new English translation, put out by Fitzcarraldo Editions. I also want to be clear that Fitzcarraldo Editions are a spectacular press, and the translation here strikes me as pitch perfect.)(A) The visual elementsThis third and final volume of the Nocilla trilogy has three parts: ""I. Automatic Search Engine,"" ""II. Automatic Engine,"" and ""III. Engine Parts."" I think it may be truer to the reading experience to divide it in six:1. ""Automatic Search Engine,"" which is an 80-page run-on sentence. (Not a single sentence, as I wrote about Mathias Enard's Crossing the Zone. Not incidentally, both are translated in Fitzcarraldo Editions, and Enard has contributed to the tidal swells of praise of the Nocilla trilogy.)2. ""Automatic Engine,"" which is 44 numbered sections, interrupted by3. Eight pages of photographs, with words that have supposedly been typed on them.4. The first part of ""Engine Parts,"" which is set in monospace type, as if it has been typed.5. The second part of ""Engine Parts,"" which is a self-contained graphic novel.6. There is also a video project, named in the book (in ""Notes and Credits,"" two pages after the end of the novel). It is on the author's website and on Vimeo.I put it this way because these visual interruptions are more important, in the reading experience, than the three titled parts. Images are crucial in the book and yet they are extremely carelessly done. To justify that I need to make three myopic criticisms.A single image, of a page of the narrator's notebook, appears by itself on p. 84. There are several other references to the notebook, but no other illustrations, even though there are other passages that could make good use of reproductions, such as the measurements of the prison on pp. 105-108. The picture in question is the plan of a campsite. Inexplicably, names of the parts of the campsite are printed (not drawn) on the sketch; apparently readers aren't meant to ask themselves how that happened.The Eight pages of photographs are introduced in the narrative just preceding them (pp. 127-29): they are pictures the narrator took and then printed out and put into his typewriter. But they're clearly pictures that have been scanned and lettered in an image processing app: the text is white on black, and too neat to be a typewriter. Again readers are not expected to be looking that closely.The short graphic novel at the end of the book has tiny print -- too small to read comfortably -- indicating it was drawn much larger, and that the reduction wasn't anticipated.These are small points, but they go to a systemic issue: Fernandez Mallo expects readers to think mainly about his text, and to look only carelessly and quickly at his images. That is why it can make sense to divide the book in three parts, despite the surprising and anomalous presence of photographs and a graphic novel.(B) The narrativeThere's a good summary of the major parts of this book on Goodreads, written by Paul Fulcher. However I can't agree that the combination of elements ""adds up to a wonderful mix."" After ""Automatic Search Engine,"" the 80-page run-on sentence, the book is exceptionally carelessly assembled. ""Automatic Search Engine"" owes something to Bernhard, Beckett, Enard, and others; it's seamless and tightly recursive. The following narrative of numbered sections, ""Automatic Engine,"" follows suit in a more fragmented manner. All this is ruminative, self-reflective, and largely plotless, in the manner of any number of postmodern writers, including Krasznahorkai and Vila-Matas (who appears in the graphic novel).But the book suddenly veers aside on p. 118, when it is revealed that the owner of a hotel has the same name as the author. From that moment onward, it reads like genre fiction. Sometimes it's like detective fiction (the narrator searches the hotel), or crime fiction (the narrator knifes his namesake), or Poe (the hotel become mysterious and sinister), or even King (roots from the other side of the Earth push up through the garden). I don't mind collages of manners and influences, but these are not managed allusions. The pages feel improvised, and they come across as a failure of imagination. It takes concentration and a steady purpose to write 80 pages of continuous monologue. It's relatively easy to make up new mysteries and inexplicable events every couple pages. I don't think this is postmodern collage at all; I think it's a lapse in energy and resources. The short graphic novel isn't the fascinating turn into the visual world that it might have been: it's simply pasted on. The book is badly constructed, and it doesn't represent our contemporary digital age, which is infinitely more aware of the visual and of different media. (C) The sexismI have difficulty understanding why the s I've seen don't mention the book's endemic sexism. The narrator has a female companion through most of the book. At one point he says she's brilliant, and that she says great things, but she's only quoted three or four times, and most of those sentences include the word ""fuck."" The narrator spends his days writing (he's working on the novel we're reading), but we have almost no idea what she does all day except swim and smoke. When the narrator spends time with people, we're told she doesn't speak. We're told over and over -- all the way to the very end of the novel -- that she bought a bikini with daisies on the breasts.

There's an exceptionally large flag near where I live, and I've stood under it, on a suitably sunny breezy afternoon, just to admire the way it moves. Large slanting undulations work their way down from the pole to the free end of the flag, like ocean swells except that they're in rolls, like carpets. At the same time small ripples move down the flag, crossing the large waves, appearing over their round crests and disappearing into their shadowed troughs. The huge sheet of fabric moves slowly, with the irregular regularity of ocean waves. It is mesmerizing and consistently beautiful: as long as I stand there, the flag undulates peacably. It is never startling. There are infinite variations in the folding and flowing fabric. Eventually, I get tired of its sameness, and I wish the wind would pick up, and the flag would start crackling, or it'd tear, or be struck by lightning. Its reliable beauty bores me, and I move on.Each new encounter between the narrator and someone she meets develops smoothly through a series of insights, developing our understanding of both characters. The narrator's acquaintances are all thoughtful people. Most of them listen well, and many pause to consider what he narrator says about them. We're never left out of these conversations: if a character says something a little brash or ill-considered, a few pages later we'll hear that the narrator considers what she's heard to be a little brash or ill-considered. The metaphors that the characters use to illuminate their experiences are well considered and illuminating, and they remain in mind for a few pages; and then, just as we may be forgetting them, they're recalled or echoed, and gradually the insights gain in density and texture, like the colors woven into a tapestry. Just as there are moments when the narrator and the characters become more aware of themselves, before dipping back into more ordinary states of less reflective action, so there are moments when the text itself tells us what it is doing, but simply, without metafictional trumpeting: for example when it is said of a minor character that ""he saw the tendency to fictionalise our own experiences as positively dangerous, because it convinced us that human life had some kind of design"" and that ""a story might merely be a series of events we believe ourselves to be involved in""--a sentiment that is countradicted on every page of the book, where design is superimposed on apparent disorder. (p. 137) And there is even a sentence that presents the entire book as a study--it's implied that the nearly undescribed narrator is represented, in outline, by the people she meets:--but this is done so deftly and quickly that most ers miss it, or imagine it's not to be taken as a way of thinking about the book. (p. 239)This kind of writing (which I have been palely imitating) owes more to Proust than James, and there are echoes in ""Outline"" of other storytellers from Charlotte Bronte to Chekhov and Maugham. The untroubled narrative surface is a beautiful way to convey the texture of our partial understandings of one another, the undependability of insight, the tentative nature of introspection, and the endless pleasures of negotiating other people's minds. It is also old-fashioned. It is the moment of literature before modernism, which was before existentialism, which was before postmodernism, which was before the new novel, Oulipo, conceptual writing... before everything produced in the last eighty-odd years. I just can't agree with critics who find Cusk's writing new--for example Julie Myerson, in ""The Guardian,"" who finds ""Outline"" ""one of the oddest, most breathtakingly original and unsettling novels"" she's read (Sept. 7, 2014). Nor can I find a way to agree with the dozens of s I read on Goodreads (Out of 2,000! Who reads those?), which propose Cusk has new insights into character, or that she finds new ""depths"" or ""philosophic insights."" What is of its time is Cusk's refusal of the usual roles of woman (especially regarding motherhood) and women writers; that's what most ers spend time on. (A good example is Patricia Lockwood in ""The London Review of Books,"" May 2018.) But if I'm not interested in reading to discover solutions to those questions, then what remains is the more general question of self-understanding and how it is represented, and in that case, ""Outline"" is a carefully controlled aesthetization of experience. It's a book writers as different as Acker, Dostoevsky, Amis, and Houellebecq might well call timid, instead of ""confident,"" ""self-assured,"" ""poised,"" or the other adjectives ers use to describe the steadiness of the narrator's gaze.If I was young, I might read more Rachel Cusk. But the pleasure of being reassured that there are people like her who can think carefully and confidently about uncertainty, and can express that thinking in polite and artistic prose, is outweighed by my interest in seeing what else writing and thinking can do....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,not set,"Jan 13, 2019",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/21400742-outline

I recommend getting an early-edition hardcover, because the dust flap has an affecting picture of Handke. He would have been thirty. He looks up with a helpless expression, his mouth slightly open. Bright lights reflect off his thick glasses. He has a sparse moustache and a Beatles haircut. He looks completely lost. I don't think that photo is on the internet, but it's been painted (badly) for the cover of ""Three By Peter Handke,"" which you can see on this site.""Sorrow Beyond Dreams"" is about Handke's mother's suicide. As Maggie Nelson says when she recommends it in her own book ""The Red Parts,"" there's a window of time after a tragedy in which the pain can appear as writing. Write too soon, and the result will be opaque. Leave it too long, and it will be cold. Handke announces, sometimes succeeds, and repeatedly loses the sense of how his prose might work for a reader. By comparison ""The Red Parts,"" which has its own awareness of pain, is as clinical as ""In Cold Blood.""The first half of this book is about Handke's mother's family, beginning with her grandfather. It paints a picture of impoverished German Catholic life before and after the war. Poverty was ""clean"" (as opposed to ""squalor,"" which was not common), orderly, and quiet (pp. 38-40).""In this rural, Catholic environment, any suggestion that a woman might have a life of her own was a impertinence: disapproving looks, until shame, first acted out in fun, became real and frightened away the most elementary feelings. Even in joy, a 'woman's blush,' because joy was something to be ashamed of; in sadness, she turned red rather than pale and instead of bursting into tears broke out in sweat."" [p. 20]These often brilliant sociological observations are sometimes abstract or general, but then they veer back into the specific and personal. Some passages attribute attitudes to ""people"" (as in this quotation); others generalize (""no one had anything to say about himself,"" p. 33); some use the general or default masculine gender (""being a type relieved the human molecule of his humiliating loneliness,"" p. 26); others use the second-person pronoun (""this consolation... simply swallowed you up,"" p. 34): but from all these subject positions they fall, often suddenly, into Handke's mother's life:""... You no longer had eyes for anything. 'Curiosity' ceased to be a human characteristic and became a womanish vice.""But my mother was curious by nature and had no consoling fetishes..."" [p. 34]The sudden ""my mother"" produces a shock, because we've been invited to read ""mother"" in the ""you"" of the page leading up to this passage. It's as if the narrator's mind had wandered, for self-preservation, away from its subject. This veering between voices happens in Handke's other books, but then it appears as a poetic trope. Here it's evidence of the narrator's wounded sense of control.These changes of register are parallel to the way that other family members slip in and out of the book. I'm not sure if a reader could reliably count how many siblings Handke had (it seems like three brothers and a sister), but the reason for that uncertainty is their wavering presence in the narrator's mind. Yet this isn't a narrative in which the son is close to the mother: sometimes the mother seems to be entirely by herself (p. 36), and there are only a few pages in which the son seems to be close to her.About halfway through the book, a reader may begin to wonder when the sociological, religious, and economic observations will give way to the story of the mother's suicide. This starts to happen around p. 43. On p. 49, the prose turns again, very suddenly. It is one of the most effective such moments I know in literature. This is the passage when everything sociological turns to everything psychological:""And then the always identical objects all about her, in always the same places! She tried to be untidy, but her daily puttings-away had become too automatic. If only she could die! ... [p. 49]Then the narrative moves away again, and the next page presents a list of physical symptoms the mother developed. It sounds at first as if Handke's mother died by suicide because she could not bear the symptoms of a neurological condition, but if that were to be true, why spend half the book desribing an ordinary unhappy life in a rural Catholic town? This question persists. On p. 55 she is diagnosed with a nervous breakdown, but it seems she may actually be suffering from dementia or Alzheimer's. The narrator doesn't decide the issue -- he doesn't even raise it -- and so the purpose of the book's first half remains unresolved. There are also excellent passages on writing, in which the narrator pauses to assess what he is attempting to do. On p. 66, he says ""It is not true that writing has helped me."" A reader might expect that's because the writing isn't cathartic, or it opens more questions than it resolves, or it reopens wounds, or it fails to deepen undersanding -- but the reason writing hasn't helped is that the narrator still experiences night terrors. Terror is what writing is supposed to help: an amazing idea, which illuminates the relative calm of the first half of the book.The world is full of memoirs and narratives of trauma, but I don't know any that try so hard to create suffering as writing....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,not set,not set,"Dec 07, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/24482.A_Sorrow_Beyond_Dreams

And I normally wouldn't criticize a novelist for not being informed about some matter of fact: that seldom matters, in fiction or in imaginative writing in general. But this book is simply misinformed. Badly informed.It opens in a promising way: Aira says ""the spell of Duchamp"" ruined his ambitions to be ""a poet, am essayist,"" to win the Nobel Prize, and ""to be Arthur Rimbaud"" if time permitted. Duchamp supposedly turned him away from books and toward a career of writing ""the footnotes."" (pp. 14-15) But then the essay turns earnest and expository. He claims good art ""flees"" from reproduction, and that ""Artforum"" and other publications are visually vacant because of it. This is simply too simple. Artists have wanted many things other than fleeing reproducibility, and ""Artforum"" has other reasons to be visually vacant. (pp. 16-21)There's a wonderful section, or chapter, on Poussin's custom of making wax models of the figures in his paintings. ""The painted picture at the end,"" Aira says, ""is merely the visible testament to the mad solitary machine"" that includes the diorama he built, the wax he modeled, the little figures he handled. (p. 24) That's true, and it's contemporary art criticism.But that's it in terms of interesting or original observations. Aira re-invents wheels over and over in the course of the essay. The opening pages on reproducibility get Krauss wrong. After he quotes Mario Praz, of all people, on Poussin, he mentions Mraz along with Daniel Arasse! (p. 25) And then, a couple of pages later, Arthur Danto along with Krauss! I know why this happens; I can imagine his reading, and what's been translated and taught in Spanish. Danto in particular has become a source for postmodernism around the world. It's also telling of a Latin American perspective that he pairs Duchamp and Dali--that couldn't be done in writing on contemporary art in North America or Europe. (pp. 41-42) There isn't anything wrong with making odd couples of scholars or artists, except that it betrays light reading and doesn't invite people who have read more. There isn't a reading of postmodernism in which Krauss and Danto simply belong together.Most of the short essay (it's only 35 pages in English) is speculation on all sorts of things that have been well covered in the scholarship: reproducibility, the phenomenon of ""isms,"" contemporaneity. I would have loved it if Aira had said more about how, exactly, Duchamp ruined him and made him spend his career writing ""footnotes."" Or if he'd interpolated any of the hundreds of autobiographical details from his other books. Or if he'd said something quirky or unexpected or at least new. This essay will unfortunately have an effect on my reading of his books in future. I know, now, what kind of education he has in modernism and postmodernism, and what counts for him as innovative.

He has little energy or daring, and he is easily mortified (Kafka's characters come to mind as comparisons). Several times in the book Solstad asks -- in the authorial voice, as metafictional asides -- why the book is centered on such a person; but those are rhetorical questions, because the novel is an experiment in an empty center. Singer is necessarily an unreliable narrator because there are people in his life who feel things strongly and have wider interests and concerns; he doesn't quite register them. But the novel isn't driven by the difficulties that unreliable narrators can present: we don't really need to figure out the characters that Singer can't, or won't, understand. It's a matter of trying to construct a novel around an absence. T. Singer shows how difficult it can be to stop readers from thinking too much about what the narrator gets wrong, and what sorts of people his friends and relatives really are.The novel also demonstrates that it's not easy to create real blankness. Singer's character isn't as blank as Bartleby; we get to know him, and once we're a couple of dozen pages in, we recognize his preoccupations. He worries, for example, that when he's invited to a dinner with people he only knows slightly, that he'll be able to choose a chair that isn't hemmed in by people, so he won't bother them when he has to excuse himself to go to the bathroom. He isn't a blank at all, despite the author's apostrophes, and his enumerable qualities turn out to be good ones: patience, flexibility, social aptitude, consistency, affability, and a limited introspection. A third problem with an absent central character is that his actions inevitably imply character. Solstad doesn't consistently present or control his character's absence. The last forty pages are full of pathos about Singer's relationship with his stepdaughter. At first she has no friends, since her mother has died and they've moved to Oslo. He can't figure out how to fix that, and he's enormously relieved when he comes home one day and hears his stepdaughter playing with another girl. These forty or so pages create strong sympathy for the character, but in the book's first half I think readers wouldn't feel anything stronger than affection or bemusement. A couple of questionsThere's a crucial page at the end of the book which raises questions I can't answer. I set them out here in case someone who has read the original might help. Singer is in his apartment with his daughter and her friends:""Surrounded by spirited young ladies, with all their sweetness, we find ourselves together with Singer in a novel tht is like a big black hole. Why is Singer the main character in this novel?"" [p. 219]This is well put, and like Solstad's other metanarrative moments, nicely judged in tone and rhetorical address. However I don't understand what comes just before it:""By the way, in every novel there is a big black hole, which is universal in its blackness, and this novel has now reached that point.""Is this intended to mean that no character can be fully known, so every novel is built around a vacuum? That seems implausible in the novel's own logic, because we've been told and shown that Singer has a singular absence of motivation, self-knowledge, empathy, and so forth. Why write a novel about such a person if everyone is like that? I also don't understand a line that comes later on the same page:""I wish I could have said something that Singer wouldn't be able to ponder... my language ceases when Singer's pondering ceases.""These are two different things, logically speaking: they contradict one another. In addition, the first sentence is clearly wrong on its own terms, because the narrator has told us many things Singer doesn't ponder.

It's a late work, and it's been praised very highly for its social satire. (It was apparently the object of a lawsuit by one of the main characters, who is depicted as an alcoholic composer who has failed to live up to his early claims about himself.)The narrator, who speaks as the author, despises everyone he meets at an ""artistic dinner"" that occupies the entire book. In a brief  of the English translation in the New York Times in 1988, Mark Anderson noted that ""the narrator's own credibility is constantly undermined by the anxious excessiveness of his attacks, which one gradually comes to see as being aimed as much at himself and his own fear of death as at the guests."" This is too little, for two reasons: the ""realization"" shouldn't be gradual, because it is explicit; and it shouldn't undermine the narrator's ""credibility"" because he himself turns the invective against himself a number of times, most importantly when he says of one of the characters that he realizes he had abandoned her, and not the other way around--exactly opposite to what he thinks about another character at the end of the book. We are to understand that the narrator is conflicted, in the current way of putting things, and that is why he has to run home, at the end, and write everything down immediately--before he becomes either more or less lucid. That balance is nicely done, but it is undermined by several traits that I read as naked or poorly articulated versions of writing strategies that are much more effective in other books:--In other books Bernhard, the author and narrator-as-author, keeps his distance from actual people he knew, providing crucial breathing room for his invectives, rants, and polemics, which are at their best when they are free to make the broadest possible gestures.--In other books that same concatenation of narrative voices keeps clear of actual cultural details, which again lets the invective grow and spread without limit. ""Woodcutters"" names many actual artists--Webern, Ibsen, Strindberg--and even individual works of art. In doing so it pinches off the metastasizing hatred that flowers so wonderfully when its object is generalized. (As Wittgenstein is in other books; here, one of the characters has ""the complete Wittgenstein"" in a bag.)--In other books, the narrator is not so narrowly Bernhard himself. Because he is himself here, the many passages in which people talk to him--especially about his own writing--have to be truncated or muted. Several times people turn to him but don't speak, and several other times he doesn't answer. He's supposedly known as a fiction writer, and has talent, but no one talks to him about it, and he doesn't tell anyone about it--even though the kind of fiction he was actually writing was exactly what he puts in the mouths of everyone around him. Bernhard solves this problem in the first half of the novel by planting the narrator in a dark corner, where he sits in a wingback chair unnoticed, making his acid observations. But that can't last forever, and later he's seated between the host and the guest of honor, and yet no one talks to him. To accept this would be to accept an unexplained gap between the realism of the dinner party and the conceit of an invisible guest, and nothing in the narrative itself addresses or solves it. The result is that the narrator seems to be outlandishly egocentric, despite his intermittent self-accusations: his work is simply too large to find a place in the story that's being told here--a story that involves friends he's had for most of his life.For me, this is the book Bernhard should have written when he was young, before he learned how to generalize, how to expand, how to distance, how to relinquish realism. But it also shows, in retrospect, a weakness of some earlier books: they avoid the trope of narrator-as-author, even when they seem to have solved it....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,not set,"Sep 15, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/92576.Woodcutters

Why It's Best to Say Cesar Aira Does Not Write BooksI had been reading Aira's novels as they were translated, but I stopped a couple of years ago. ""The Linden Tree"" is unusual, and now I need to use the present perfect progressive instead of the past perfect progressive: I have been reading Aira, I might still read Aira. It's difficult to get the tense right because Aira's novels inspire a kind of wavering devotion. I have decided that what wavers is my interest in the books as units.His short novels are famously improvisational and unstructured, so finishing one isn't quite like finishing a normally structured novel: you may feel the book ended on page twenty, or that you've just read a fragment. Both can be true. All hundred or so of Aira's books can be imagined as a single book, although that's more an abstraction than an idea that could make sense in detail. And every one of his books continuously begs the question of why it keeps going, why it doesn't wrap up, why the author thinks the new material he's just introduced fits with what came before.1 The two main ways of reading AiraThese questions are part of the experience of reading Aira. There is a generous interpretation available, which many of his ers adopt: it's said he practices a variant of magic realism (or, more accurately, surrealism), so that every unexpected anecdote or image is to be understood as expressive. In this reading, Aira's accomplishment is his mixture of realism and surrealism (or biography and dream, or history and fantasy). It's also said that Aira's accomplishment is his version of modernist stream of consciousness writing. He calls his method ""la huída hacia adelante,"" or ""the constant flight forward."" As Alena Graedon put it in ""The New Yorker,"" ""Roughly, this means that he writes without rewriting, inventing as he goes"" (January 27, 2017). In this reading every turn in subject matter is best seen as an expression of the author's inimitable imagination. These are unhelpful diagnoses because they make it impossible to criticize any of Aira's narrative decisions. If every unexpected juxtaposition of images is surrealist, then any narrative assemblage can be expressive. If every surprising turn in the storyline is a reflection of the author's vivid fantasy, then none can be criticized for being less authentic.In fact, I imagine people stop reading Aira because his narratives can get tiresome or uninteresting. He veers unpredictably, but the veering itself is predictable. These are ways of registering that neither the surrealism nor the stream-of-consciousness is working. He has achieved some wonderful things by writing the way he does, without planning and without revising, but he has also produced a body of work that is either immune from criticism or in jeopardy of being ignored.""The Linden Tree"" is unusual in that it's autobiographical. As ers have noted, it begins with a story about the undependability of the narrator's memory. He could check part of the memory by visiting the town where he grew up, but he can't be bothered. (He's too ""unscientific."") Besides, he says, the subject of his memory--a linden tree--has been cut down (pp. 4-5). On the other hand, his entire life has been a series of ""multicolored distractions"" from the memory (p. 7). One er of the English translation picked up on this and proposed it as the book's theme: the unreliability and crucial importance of memory.But the book isn't about the tree. At the end the narrator returns to the linden tree, but that's just a sop to narrative closure. I can't imagine a reading in which those closing pages are satisfying: they don't address or explain what's happened in the 80 pages in between. It's difficult for me to imagine that Aira thought much about what he was doing at the end, except finishing ""The Linden Tree"" to get on with the next novel: otherwise he would have had his narrator talk about how ineffectual the last few pages are.It's useful that ""The Linden Tree"" presents itself as an autobiographical text, because it brings out the importance and place of themes like the retrieval of memory. His other books, as far as I know, are presented as novels, so their themes and theories don't need to drive the narratives. But the ideas of memory that open and close ""The Linden Tree"" don't explain what happens in ""The Linden Tree"" in the way, for example, that Proust's narrator's claims about memory in the opening of his novel resonate all the way to the end.2 An alternative criterionSo what characteristics of Aira could keep me reading? For me those would be the moments when the narrator, and implied author, struggle to make sense.Aira's essay ""Cecil Taylor,"" in English in ""Bomb"" magazine (February 13, 2015) provides an interesting parallel. The piece begins with a story about a prostitute. After a couple of paragraphs Aira introduces Taylor. He notes:""The story of the prostitute who distracted the cat wasn’t necessary in itself, which doesn’t mean that the virtual series of all stories is unnecessary as a whole. The story of Cecil Taylor calls for the illustrative mode of the fable; the details are interchangeable, and atmosphere would seem to be out of place."" This is the sort of general reasoning that critics use to praise Aira's novels. The majority of ""Cecil Taylor"" is an account of a number of Taylor's early failures, embellished but all plausible. The essay is serious and devout about Taylor, and although Aira doesn't say he's been misunderstood in the same ways, it's clear throughout that Taylor's long decades of partial fame have been on Aira's mind. In another place Aira writes:""An artist’s biography is hard to distinguish from the trials of its writing: it’s not simply a matter of representing representation (anyone could do that) but of creating unbearable situations in thought.""That idea is much more in line with my own interests, but ""unbearable situations"" and ""trials""--which I understand not as narrative situations but as paradoxical, impossible, or implausible lines of reasoning--are not so much the norm in Aira's writing as entertaining, eccentric, and fortuitous images and thoughts. Here is an example of a passage that has more to do with ""unbearable situations"" than with ""the illustrative mode of the fable."" Early in ""The Linden Tree"" Aira is talking about his father, who was an incompetent electrician:""My father's continual trips all over town on his bicycle were a kind of allegory of Electricity's invisible flight to the farthest corners... But if you think about it, everything is allegory. One thing signifies another, even the fact that I have ended up becoming a writer and composing this true account."" [p. 24]Of course it's not true that ""if you think about it, everything is allegory,"" but the logical leap barely registers because right away it's clear that Aira is mainly interested in linking his father's profession to his own. It's also patently untrue that everything in the book is ""true."" There are a number of episodes that couldn't have happened as he describes them, and many more than couldn't have been experienced as he describes them, because they happened to a young boy. So the passing assertion that the account is true reads as a trick: he doesn't want us to think too much about it, and he presumably doesn't want to think about it too much himself. (That would be too ""scientific."")The passage continues:""To follow the prompts of allegory, which also works by remote control, I too could be practicing a trade for which I am quite unqualified, manipulating objects--memories, for example--of which I know and understand nothing, in a state of utter puzzlement. But that doesn't alter the reality of the facts: my father was an elecrician and I am a writer. These are real allegories.""That last sentence, I think, doesn't make sense. The penultimate sentence does (he is a writer), but it doesn't have anything to do with his story or with allegory. Aira often writes himself into these corners: he theorizes a lot, but he also loses interest in his theories, doesn't link them together, and lets himself happily be led into stories that don't fit any theories. It's normal to lose the thread of your own thought, to propose a theory and then get confused about it, or to launch into a new subject in hopes that it will reveal why it's pertinent. Few people think in a linear way or keep to a single level of abstraction or concreteness. The many passages in Aira's books that simply enact or exemplify this daily incoherence are sometimes entertaining but in the end uninteresting.What keeps me reading is passages like the one I quoted, where the narrator is struggling to figure out what makes sense, and how. And this means I won't be reading books by Aira, but I'll be reading in books for certain passages. It's not that I've given up on what he is doing, it's that I understand that by its nature it isn't a project that results in books....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,not set,"Jul 16, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/35407614-the-linden-tree

What makes Bernhard so compulsively readable are his uncontrolled compulsions--hatred, misanthropy, disappointment, a perennially renewable feeling of outrage at the primitive, evil, selfish, filthy, animal-like characteristics of his fellow Austrians. The endlessness of his outrage is parallel to other authors' endlessnesses, for example Beckett's existential horror, or Swift's revulsion about bodies. And whatever is endless and can also be narrated needs not to have an ending.Bernhard's ""Gargoyles"" is his best in this regard because it is almost bewilderlingly poorly structured: it is built around an unexpected monologue that ends, not because the speaker falls silent, but because the book has a last page.""Yes"" is a typical--by which I mean hypnotically self-involved and rigorously negative--Bernhard novel until page 121 in the English translation, because that is when we learn why a certain Swiss person bought a property for himself and his partner in the worst possible place (a sodden cold meadow that gets no sun and is only accessible through a cemetery): he wanted revenge on his partner of forty years. Then, a couple of pages later, we learn how the partner, a Persian woman, comes to understand the narrator's desperate state (he is a ""failed"" person, and suicidal), and she rejects him. And then she goes to live in the unfinished house the Swiss man had started to build for them. And then she stops eating. And then she kills herself.Should I have done the usual thing and put ""spoiler alert"" at the top of these notes? (I know that on Goodreads people can do that even without the author of the  agreeing to it.) I don't think so. Bernhard novels are structured in such a way that they do not have ""plots"" with ""suspense"" or ""endings."" Their entire point, in that regard, is the hopelessness of the desire for endings or solutions, for finality, for what's now called closure. They are driven by a narrator--an implied author--who knows that endings cannot be anything more than fictions, and who struggles, in each book and between books, to understand what writing might be when it does not end. This is ostensively the case in much of Bernhard's fiction, and it is said by the narrator early on in ""Yes"": it's necessary, he says, to keep trying to accomplish something even though you know you cannot finish and if you do finish what you have accomplished will be a failure:""In the knowledge that nothing at all is certain and that nothing is perfect, we should, even with the greatest uncertainty and with the greatest doubts, begin and continue to do what we have determined to do.... Just as we wake every day and have to begin and continue what we have determined to do, that is to continue existing, so we must begin and continue such an enterprise..."" [p. 35]The best of Bernhard's work enacts this cannibalistic despair in spectacular fashion. This book fails to enact it, which means, in Bernhard's own logic, that it actually ends: it has a plot, which has a resolution (in fact, multiple resolutions, as if it protests too much about its own closure). And therefore, in a way that is entirely inverted from the normal understanding, it has events that can be called spoilers. And yet: if your reading is at all spoiled by what I wrote in the third paragraph, you are entirely misreading Bernhard: you're hoping that at his best he is one of the Austrian bourgeois that he hated so poisonously--and in this book, right at the end, he nearly is.As a postscript I might add that the reason this book is driven toward such neat resolutions is its author's resolution to write directly about his thoughts of suicide: a subject that is always among the most difficult to put into fiction....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Jul 10, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/92572.Yes

(Explained on the eponymous website.)This book is bats, which is to say it's wonderful. It is an invented ""romance"" about a race of ""Sea-Serpents,"" which the author, writing in 1850, apparently believes may well exist. (The book has been said to prefigure Moby-Dick, but I don't see the point of that parallel. There are however echoes of Poe.)The Sea-Serpent, who is the book's tragic hero, eats some people, holds a great underwater feast, is invited to Harvard, and then is shot, blinded, and stuffed.It's written mostly in prose, with lots of songs interpolated, but the prose is actually doggerel:""Out on the sea, put on the sea, the snake is swimming, happy and free; he's left Cape Ann with every sense bent on reaching Cambridge by commencement.""That's the Sea-Serpent, who has been invited to speak at the commencement ceremony at Harvard on account of his excellent knowledge of ichthyology! The story begins demurely, with a boosting party out singing songs. They get peremptorily eaten. Notes and apparatusIn contrast to the relentless rhyming prose, the book has twenty-two pages of endnotes and a forty page appendix that includes a letter from the naturalist Louis Agassiz to the author, which I think must be genuine. (Agassiz, once reknowned, has recently been critiqued for his racist beliefs, such as the idea that the Book of Genesis is only about white people.) The appendix cites and discusses the leviathan in the Bible, among other sources. The notes are a different matter. ""Bats"" isn't quite the right word. Maybe daft. They combine some apparently real research with notes like this:""It is surprising to find on what intimate terms the hotel keepers are with the Sea-Serpent."" (N. 12, P. 128)The book's craziness comes mainly from this mixture of serious research, reminiscent of Edgar Allen Poe in stories like ""Descent into the Maelstrom,"" and loony rhyming prose.IllustrationsThe facsimile I have has six: two added by the small press that reprinted the book; two in the notes, apparently taken from earlier literature; and two original prints. Those two are placed very well. The first appears exactly when the boosting party is attacked, and the second when the serpent is killed.

Garreta is a member of Oulipo, and I understood from s that the book is experimental in an Oulipean sense. The s noted that she begins by setting out an Oulipean constraint, and then doesn't consistently follow it, which is an Oulipean trait. Her subject is all the women she has loved or desired, and one of her self-imposed constraints is that she'll write about a different woman each day for the course of the project. She opens with an ""Ante Scriptum,"" which begins with the dictum--common in poststructuralism, metafiction, and the Oulipo--that the project of writing is to ""rid yourself of your self,"" meaning to demonstrate, in as many ""intricate constructions"" as possible, that the notion of the narrator is a fiction, and that the implied author is doubly so, that no self can be sleuthed behind the text. All these are commonplace beginnings.What annoyed me was the way she positions herself (by which I mean both the author as she presents herself, and the implied author who can be deduced from the book without its metafictional frame) and her readers on that first page. She adopts a mock condescension:""You [i.e., I] don't have the heart to tell them [the ""few readers""] that no subject ever expresses itself in any narration. And besides, they would refuse to believe this terrifying bit of news--we're still punch drunk on our little selves."" (p. 3)Notionally, the readers still posit Anne Garréta behind the texts signed in her name, and are still ""drunk"" enough on their vanities to go on desiring stories of desire. Bravely, she volunteers to put herself right in the center of the practices in which she has no belief:""So you [i.e., I] have resolved... to pretend to step out onto the slippery slope that seems so natural these days and to subject yourself [myself, and my readers] to the discipline of confessional writing... You will play at a very old game that has become the hobbyhorse of a modernity balking at radical disenchantment: confession..."" (pp. 3-4)This is annoying because the pose here is that the author/narrator has entirely subscribed to ""radical disenchantment,"" but she's going to ""play"" with the idea of narrating her desires, as if desires were the key to ""our subjectivity,"" as if the narrator in the text that follows actually existed as a subject, not to mention as a projection of the named author. But this has to be entirely wrong. No reader I know, possibly excepting AI readers, is so thoroughly ""disenchanted"" that they do not see narrators as subjectivities, that they don't see representations of desire as attempts to elucidate subjectivity, that they don't understand narrators as intricately implicated with their authors. I like conceptual poetry, even after the fall of American conceptualism, but I do not fit the portrait Garréta paints so glibly and condescendingly. For me, a first page like this one puts the author in question (and therefore also the narrator). I don't believe Garréta believes in the kind of disenchantment she claims. The truth has to be closer to what some ers have noted: this is a book about love and desire, and its degrees of fictionalization or constraint are not relevant to that fact. The reason Garréta sets rules for herself is to ""play,"" as she says, but not in the way she intends it in the line I quoted. She's not ""playing"" by reconceptualizing old-fashioned narratives of desire as ""intricate constructions."" She's writing old-fashioned narratives of desire slightly deformed by playfully ""intricate constructions.""I wrote all that before I read past the bottom of the second page. I thought it was important to register my absolute non-assent with regard to the opening voice of the book, and my possibly irreparable alienation from the narrative voice that the text s lightheartely and ""playfully"" proposes. I was an alienated reader from the outset.*Now I've read the entire book: twelve stories about desire, love, and love affairs; and a ""Post Scriptum"" in which the author again speaks for herself.The ""Ante Scriptum"" continues with a surprisingly long list of self-imposed rules. In my enumeration:1. ""Not one day without a woman"" (that is: each day she'll write about one love affair)2. Strict fidelity the ""the unwinding of memory"" (no artificial composition)3. Five hours per day, ""no more, no less""4. Seven days a week5. Written in the order in which they come to mind6. No pen (the book ends by acknowledging the Apple Macintosh)7. No drafts or notebooks8. No other rules, nothing other than memory9. No fiction (""nor will you reconstruct [events] as they might have happened,"" p. 5)The twelve stories (""Nights"": ten women, a girl, and a Pontiac Grand Am, which she loves because its name reminds her of ""grande ame"" and ""grande dame"") are well observed, nicely composed, and wholly conventional. It is difficult to imagine a reader who could remain faithful to the ""Ante Scriptum"" while reading about seductions, drinking, and nightclubs. The only traces of the ""Ante Scriptum"" are the anonymized titles (for example ""B*,"" ""D*"") and the square-bracketed number at the end of each ""Night.""But my annoyance returned in full force in the ""Post Scriptum,"" not because it begins by excusing the author's lapses from her various rules (that is obvious early on, and it's announced on the back cover), and not because she admits at least one of the twelve stories is a fiction (that does have consequences for how the book is read, as she notes), but because she returns to her idea of avoiding the fiction of subjectivity and ""the idolatry of desire"" and spends the last five pages on an unironic defense of her unavoidable complicity in the ""empire"" of desire. It turns out she remains serious about writing differently, not falling for the fiction of fiction's veracity or psychological truth, not being duped by the production of subjectivity -- and yet she thinks that the two framing essays are enough to call the twelve ""Nights"" into question. Regarding this most important rule, the essays have nothing to say to a reading of the ""Nights.""What lack of self-awareness, what hypnosis brought on by a lifetime of literary theory, what confidence bolstered by uncritical praise, combined to produce this raw juxtaposition of poststructural theory and perfectly ordinary storytelling?...more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,"Apr 10, 2024",not set,"May 06, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/31944688-not-one-day

In a  of A Million Windows in the ""New York Times,"" June 17, 2016, James McNamara sums up Murnane's theory of fiction this way:""The Australian novelist Gerald Murnane has become known for works of difficult genius, and his latest will only burnish that reputation. An exploration of the mind and of literary creation, it is a book of intricate construction and vast intellectual scope.Moving between fiction, philosophy and literary theory, A Million Windows investigates and demonstrates the aesthetic of what Murnane calls 'true fiction,' which faithfully records the narrator’s 'invisible world' of the mind. This is distinct from artifice, where the writer consciously creates, and realism, where the reader is prompted to think of characters and places as actually existing. Rather, 'true fiction' conceives of an invisible metaphysical plane that extends infinitely forward, backward, even sideways, into every possible temporal, topical and spatial dimension. In it are autonomous 'fictional personages' (characters), whose existence the writer 'learns of' rather than creates.""This is as succinct and accurate a theory as I have read, and I think it's substantially correct. It's helpful, reading Murnane, to keep three terms in mind: 1. ""True fiction"" is about the narrator's (and the author's) mind. (Exactly how it's about the mind is another question.)2. ""Self-referential"" fiction (what McNamara calls ""artifice"") occurs when narrators posture in front of their readers and ""wonder aloud, as it were, what fates to assign to various characters,"" as in Tristram Shandy. (p. 34)3. ""Film"" (Murnane's preferred term) or ""realism"" (McNamara's term) occurs when the narrator and author wish to present a fictional world as real.Murnane's idea of fiction isn't any more intricate than McNamara's summary provided that a reader doesn't try to follow Murnane's arguments. McNamara goes on to say A Million Windows ""performs the theory it advances,"" but the book isn't just an example of its concerns: even more than a fiction, it is an investigation. Murnane has described his books, which are marketed as fiction, as ""detailed reports"" of the contents of his mind at the time of writing. (""The Still-Breathing Author,"" in Sydney Review of Books, February 6, 2018.) The narrator's voice is consistently affectless and grammatically precise. The book asks to be understood, not just ""marveled at"" as a sign of ""genius"" or ""intellectual power and originality"" (paraphrasing McNamara). McNamara's three-point summary would be an adequate conceptual schema for reading Murnane, except that the three positions are exposited in an exceptionally unclear, inconsistent, irrational manner. These difficulties do not occur at the level of the fictional stories in the book, which are more or less continuous and ultimately traditional in affect, enabling readers to find their way through the book, and to experience its stories as expressive and moving. The problem is that the book itself--its language, its address, its grammatical precision--gives no sign that the passages on narrative theory are to be skimmed or taken as signs of a poetic evocation of the complexity of memory. On the contrary, those passages give every sign that they are to be understood and evaluated.The questions I have about Murnane's fiction require an unusual amount of explication. I recognize the fact that spending 800 words on two sentences, as I am about to do in section 1--without even getting near the book's main topics--puts me way off to one side of the bell curve of reader's responses. Either ers and readers are reading too loosely, or my response is as nearly pathological as Murnane's own bedroom full of filing cabinets, which are so well described in Mark Binelli's wonderful piece in the New York Times (tinyurl.com/yd9bf98m).It's possible to agree with Will Heyward's feeling that ""beneath the immaculate surface of his formal, outmoded sentences runs a dark current of hopelessly compressed—hopeless, in that is otherwise inexpressible, and seemingly irrevocable—emotion"" and at the same time feel Heyward's reading is entirely too loose and poetic. Reading Murnane, Heyward writes,""The world can seem... as a maze of as yet unmade phenomenal connections. Navigating this maze, and realizing the connections within it, are part of his preoccupation with the act of writing. In writing, these connections are both invented and discovered. A single, remote phrase might rise to a series of responses, which then, like fractals, multiply again."" [Heyward, in ""Music and Literature,"" tinyurl.com/ydcg2ywn]Fractals aren't the right analogy for Murnane's distinctions, because nothing in Murnane disappears from sight into infinite complexity: everything is carefully named. It's also not enough to note that the book's title comes from ""The Portrait of a Lady,"" and conjures fiction's house of a million rooms, or even to cite, as Heyward does, Murnane saying ""I would like to be able to write a text, or create a text, so complicated that I would get lost in it."" It's not enough because the book itself asks to be read slowly and carefully. And I disagree absolutely with Heyward's conclusion: ""Given the elliptical and awkward nature of Murnane’s writing,"" he says, ""an easy mistake is to strain to understand him, but his writing is a visual proposition."" That is like a  of a physics textbook that proposes readers needn't worry about the equations, because physics is to be ""marveled at"" and praised for its ""intellectual power and originality."" If those qualities are true, it's because physics has arguments worth attending to--even if some aren't true and others are mistaken.1Here is an example. The pages where Murnane's narrator distinguishes his book from ""self-referential fiction"" open with a description of the phenomenon, and close a page later with the narrator's first negative judgment about ""self-referential fiction."" The narrator notes that Tristram Shandy, ""some of the fiction of Anthony Trollope,"" ""much of the fiction of Thomas Hardy,"" and Italo Calvino's If on a Winter's Night a Traveller oppose ""writer and reader... as the players on either side of a chessboard."" He then says:""Even the undiscerning reader of this fiction of mine should have understood by now that I, the narrator, would dread to feel that we were separated even by these sentences."" (p. 33)This is both unexpected and apparently poorly aimed as a rejoinder against self-reference in fiction. I might have expected Murnane's first-person narrator to say that the manner in which he makes reference to his fiction differs from the theatrical model in Tristram Shandy. Or that he did not find the staging of a contest between reader and author to be persuasive. Instead we're given an unusual and emotional declaration: he would ""dread"" to be separated from his reader ""even by these sentences."" Of course he is separated by exactly those sentences, so the sentence itself cannot be the end of the matter--and more important, we have been given no particular reason to think the narrator wants to be close to us (I am echoing the ""we"" in the passage). It's as if the implied author has suddenly realized why he doesn't like what he calls ""self-referential fiction.""(It's an entirely separate question whether we can believe that Murnane himself was unaware of the entire movement of postnmodern metafiction beyond Calvino, and whether he knew that it doesn't rely on opposing ""writer and reader""--whether he realized other people had been experimenting with different kinds of self-awareness not at all unlike his own. Elsewhere in this book, the narrator becomes suddenly coy about author's names, pretending--how else can we interpret it?--to have forgotten the name of Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Of course the narrator's and the author's minds are full of the names of books beyond Henry James and Thomasd Hardy.)This passage I quoted is only one paragraph from a three-page section on the difference between A Million Windows and ""self-referential fiction."" The following pages just make things even more obscure. At the conclusion he says he's already explained himself, but ""for the sake of the undiscerning reader, I shall repeat that I am the narrator of this work and not the author."" (p. 35) This is a common and reasonable position for anyone interested in narration, and when I read it I expected he wuld continue by saying that as the narrator, he cannot play the games of ""self-reference"" that Sterne or Calvino play. But instead he says this:""In the matter of my fate, so to call it, I am no more able to exercise choice than is any narrator of any [text]..."" (p. 35)Surely this doesn't address the question. It's evident narrators don't have control and so can't play games of the sort Murnane's narrator is imagining. But that has nothing to do with self-referentiality.2What matters most in terms of understanding is what Murnane's narrator means by ""true fiction."" I won't even begin to give arguments as I've done above. Instead I'll just note two salient markers.(Before I do that, it's ineresting to try to coordinate Murnane's theories about his ""true fiction,"" or ""reports,"" with narrative theory. There's a passage in Gerard Genette's Fiction and Diction that is apposite. It's a footnote, in which Genette is talking about relations between Narrator (N), Author (A), and Character (C). If A = N = C, that's autobiography. The footnote describes a kind of narrative that fits Murnane's very well. ""A narrative that betrayed its own fictionality in every sentence,"" Genette writes, ""by an expression of the sort 'Let us imagine that...'... would be perfectly 'serious' in enunciation and would be covered by the formula A = N."" (p. 70 n. 1) That's interesting because in Murnane, the author is assumed not to be the narrator, except in his interviews, when he speaks easily about his ""fictions"" being ""reports."" Genette would have to say: for the Narrator, A doesn't equal N; for the Author, A = N.) First, regarding the narrator's (and implied author's) control of the distance between the events he recounts and the narrator who recounts those events. Murnane's narrator's distance from his ""fictional characters"" is variable and unstable. I said this in my notes on Barley Patch. In A Million Windows the narrator tends to slip downard, in the direction of what he calls ""film,"" from a starting point that is as abstract and metafictional as he can make it. These slips, I think, are not premeditated, and not wholly in Murnane's control.A typical section or paragraph might begin like this:""If ever he had asked himself, during all the years since, how a person might feel on seeming to recognize as a version of himself or herself some or another personage in a work of fiction..."" (p. 83)A half-page later these many qualifications are no longer present:""Sometimes, in later years, he supposed that... the answer quoted should have shamed and humiliated him...""The hypothetical, atemporal, ungendered character becomes becomes a generalized, temporalized narrator, who becomes a fictionalized character, who becomes a memory of the narrator's, who becomes a memory of the implied author's.A Million Windows, like Barley Patch, contains a central story: in this case, it's about a woman; in Barley Patch it's about the narrator's parents. Enframing and infiltrating those stories are metafictional hypotheticals. In both books Murnane (the implied author) can't seem to control the degree of separation. It's an expressive quality, this slippage: it's part of the book's interest and pathos, but there is no sign in the narrative that it is intended.3Regarding the narrator's (and implied author's) theories about the ontology--the mode of being--of his ""fictional characters."" As McNamara says, Murnane is concerned with ""autonomous 'fictional personages' (characters), whose existence the writer 'learns of' rather than creates."" Yet Murnane's narrator (and by implication Murnane, since this phenomenon repeats across several books) has a self-contradictory, or at least a very counter-intuitive, theory about the nature of fictional characters. At one point about halfway through the book he rehearses his complaint that ers and critics always discuss characters ""as though they are persons living in the world."" (p. 94) He says he approves of something Evelyn Waugh said: he had never ""entertained the least interest in why characters behaved as they did."" This, it seems, is an anti-realist position, which wants to let fictional characters behave in any number of ways that people don't. Waugh, Murnane's narrator says, ""felt no obligation to try to read the minds of his creatures.""So far so good. But Murnane has a theory, both in A Million Windows and in Barley Patch, that characters in fiction can be understood as leading their own lives. In Barley Patch he also imagines characters living ""in"" the worlds of specific fictions even though the authors don't name them. (And he fails to consistently distinguish those two possibilities.) The sense in which such ""fictional characters"" (or characters that are ""potentially"" available for fictions) are alive without intentionality is entirely obscure. I think the best way to understand this is as a theory ruined by its author's intensely held and mutually incompatible desires: to write about fiction in such a way that it becomes ""true"" to its author's experience of writing about fiction, and at the same time true to its author's experience of reading fiction.*At the moment I can't do better than that. Mark Binelli's New York Times essay reveals the spectacular compulsive complexity of Murnane's personal archive, and it should be a warning against readings that reduce his books to expressive narratives of memory embedded in vaguely understood theories of fiction.For me, Murnane's books fail to construct reliable theory, and the theory fails to prevent the narrators from telling the very human, ""realist"" stories of love and memory that are at their core. Together those two failures produce texts that are expressive in ways no other author has achieved. Beckett, Calvino, Perec, Stein, and other experimental modernists are consistent and controlled by comparison. Murnane's are complex failures of authorial intention and control, and they produce genuinely interesting writing that appears to be literature....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,not set,"Jul 27, 2023","Apr 16, 2018",,Paperback with flaps,view (with text),/book/show/28542495-a-million-windows

(I imagine their choice puzzled some academics: there are many qualified people, who know the literature better than Cole.) ""Blind Spot"" is the kind of book that can only be produced by an author with popular appeal: it's 330-pages, all-color, with heavy coated stock and a cloth cover with an embossed tipped-in front cover image. Yet the text is more like an artist's book than a popular novel: it has no continuous narrative, and it's full of allusions. Most of the book has photos on the right and brief texts on the left, and each text is titled with the name of the place where the photo was taken. (There is also a map at the end of the book, and a two-page Postscript explaining how the author likes to travel.)The narrator doesn't describe why or how he travels, which makes him seem much as he actually is: the privileged recipient of invitations ""to literary festivals and to teaching programs,"" as he says in the Postscript. In the book, the narrator is simply a wandering observer of a number of cultures, superficially like the narrator of Sebald's books. But Cole's wanderings aren't directed like Sebald's were: he isn't circling around specific cultural memories. Instead he samples various atrocities and genocides as he goes (Balinese, First Nation, German, Syrian, even Swiss). When he's not commenting on historical events, the narrator usually wants to tell us about his own photographs. On a number of pages we're told what to look at--effectively, we're told why the photos are good. There are several sequences of text/image pairings that work as self-contained lectures, in which the narrator tells us how to notice things in his images (for example, pp. 64-71). These passages are unintentionally teacherly, for example this text, which faces an image of tables in a restaurant in Ferrara, with a panoramic painting of Ferrara on the wall:""Only later did I see what was at stake. I had assumed that the image was merely saying something about the unsteady boundary between the real and the painted... But obvious as it was, I didn't see it until I saw it: the way the table on the left announced a phantom cityscape of its own, in homage to the old city of Ferrara, grouped glasses for towers, porcelain houses..."" [p. 128]It doesn't make the prose natural or conversational to pretend the narrator didn't see the virtue of his own photograph, and then to tell us about it. As a writerly device, this doesn't work, because it brings us out of the narration and into a lecture hall, where Cole, just offstage, uses a red laser pointer to show us the interest of his art.Images that are not accompanied by historical facts, allusions to classic texts and artworks, or ekphrastic inventories, are explained by texts about dreams, memories, Christian themes, and a miscellany of travel ancedotes. Despite this variety the photographs are nearly always formal compositions of depopulated corners of cities, or people seen from behind: Cole's is a common contemporary photographic practice.Unlike Sebald, Cole is just learning Western history and art, and it shows. In the Postscript he undertook research ""as an art historian in training."" His references are commonplaces of the art historical literature. Siri Hustvedt, who wrote a rambling poetic introduction to the book, lists ""Caravaggio, Duerer, Degas""; there's also, for example, a text and image pairing inspired by Carel Fabritius's goldfinch. Cole's allusions are common, and often both pretentious and precious. Here is the text about Fabritius, called ""Tripoli,"" in its entirety:""The date to remember is 1654. He paints 'The Goldfinch' that year. The color harmonies are cool, the wall is as full of subtle character as a face. His life is like a brief and beautiful bridge. He studies with Rembrandt in Amsterdam. He teaches Vermeer in Delft.""I am walking in the narrow alley between the castle of the Crusaders and the busy souk. There are children wild in the alley. There is a bird on the wall. It is him, Carel Fabritius. The bird suggests it (though this bird is a bulbul) but it is the wall that confirms it. Suddenly the gunbowder depot explodes. Fabritius is killed, and most of his paintings are lost to history. But not all is lost. The bridge has been built and it has been crossed, the bridge from shadow into light. He is not yet thirty-three years old."" [p. 20]The next-to-last line is an allusion to a cliche of art history, that Fabritius put light into Rembrandt's dark interiors, paving the way for Vermeer. It's also meant, I think, to resonate with the book's recurrent Christological themes. Fabritius's studio was near the Delft gunpowder storage facility. Cole's idea is to let Fabritius's story and his most famous painting (recently re-popularized in Donna Tartt's ""Goldfinch"") echo in his photograph of a bird in a cage hung on a scarred plaster wall. The photo itself is unremarkable; the wall could be an artwork by Tapies or Villegle or any one of hundreds of recent photographers who have fetishished the overlooked textures of cities. The birdcage only contributes another cliche.What's worst about this is the way Cole twists his prose to avoid the appearance of lecturing. ""The date to remember is 1654"" is both teacherly and artificially literary. ""Blind Spot"" is full of pretentious allusions--Homer's catalogue of ships, an Ara Pacis style relief, the Divine Comedy, Ondaatje, Alkman (as Hustvedt notes). These allusions are settled uneasily into Cole's high-art prose, as if they were treasures brought up from a shipwreck. This is the opposite of Sebald's allusions, which are much more informed and more naturally spoken. Sebald is not uneasy about showing off his knowledge, because he is comfortable in what he knows. His history is woven into his concerns: Cole's is ""research."" He drops names: a picture of a detail of a map reminds him of something ""Elizabeth Bishop, Luigi Ghirri, and Italo Calvino have in common"" (p. 24). What he retrieves from his allusions is often thin: in one photo, ""the city is shorn of all superfluity and reduced to its essentials, as in a play by Beckett"" (p. 226). Given that Sebald's recurring center of interest, the black hole that keeps drawing him back in time, is the Holocaust, it is especially trite that Cole doesn't develop the title of his own book: it isn't until p. 80 that we learn that his retina was detached, making him temporarily blind in one eye; and it isn't until the very last line of the Postscript that he thinks to tell us that ""To look is to see only a fraction of what one is looking at. Even in the most vigilant eye, there is a blind spot. What is missing?"" (p. 325).More successful pairings""Blind Spot"" can be read for individual text/image pairings, because some are very inventive. ""Lagos,"" pp. 48-49, pairs a one-paragraph story about how the narrator's mother once forced him to stop striking out what he was trying to write, resulting in a clean page of ""elegant-looking writing,"" with a brief second paragraph about the narrator's fascination with the white spaces around Cy Twombly's scribbles, and a photo (taken in Lagos), of a mirror or pane of wind glass resting one some newspapers in someone's a back yard. The slant rhymes of clean pages, blank margins, and empty reflections works well. The same dynamics, with similar imagery and a text on Swiss politics, can be found on pp. 12-13.The pairings that work best, I think, are the ones where the text doesn't try for literary tone, doesn't try to instruct us about how to see photographs, and doesn't propose one-to-one correspondences between historical events and the everyday objects that are taken to allegorize them. Cole will be a better writer if he can give up his repertorial habits (as in novels like ""Every Day Is For the Thief,"" about his return to Lagos and its politics), his art-historical ambitions, and his emulation of Europeans like Sebald. His photographs aren't often remarkable by themselves, but sometimes he finds things to say that glance off them, producing the kind of back-and-forth reading and looking that really illuminates both the writing and the images....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,not set,"Mar 18, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/32937914-blind-spot

The narrator thinks aboutProblems Putting Performance Art Stills into a NovelThis is a brief book with a number of blank pages and seven photographs. The narrator thinks about a sister she never knew (the sister died the day she was born). The narrator imagines her sister by thinking about white objects (snow, lace, paper, ice). The prose poems average about a half-page each, so the book is full of white spaces.  Two different comments: first on the book's images, then on its narrative.1. The imagesTerry Pitts has written a  of the book on his blog ""Vertigo."" He contributes some interesting information about the book's images:""In The White Book, the seven black-and-white images, plus the one on the cover, each show a woman in a room that appears to be completely white. These haunting images are from a performance that Han Kang did, which was filmed by Choi Jin-hyuk and exhibited at a gallery space in Seoul after the publication of the Korean edition of The White Book (흰 Hŭin or The Elegy of Whiteness). In several images she is holding objects that are white or presenting them to the camera for the reader to view. In others, we see only her silhouetted shape bending or in movement.... Perhaps the images and text seem so integrated because Choi Jin-hyuk’s photographs reiterate what we read in the text and do so at the same heightened aesthetic level of Han Kang’s text.... Curiously, the original Korean edition used different images by a different photographer, Cha Mi-hye, whose color photographs depicted “sparse frames of snowfields, water and sunlight,” according to the Korean Herald."" (On sebald.wordpress.com; search ""Han Kang's 'The White Book'."")I haven't seen the original yet, and I'll amend this  when I have. However I'm not as positive as Pitts is regarding the images chosen for the English translation. Readers aren't told they're from a performance done after the Korean edition was published, but it's clear they're stills from an art performance. I find them unexceptional: I have seen many, many photographs of performers in white cubes kneeling and looking at white objects. The fact that they're clearly artifacts of the artworld is at odds with the narrative and the narrator's life, which has little to do with the artworld. Readers are perhaps supposed to overlook the performance-art feel of the photos: but how is that possible?The images are also problematic because they're not connected very closely to the narrative, and it's not clear why they aren't. The narrative is mainly very imagistic, and the images, as it were, don't keep up: they're generic. They're grey, as Pitts notes, partly because of the exigencies of publishing, but largely because they are indifferent as photographs: they could have been much more carefully done. As it is, they're anemic, unfocused on the narrative, and too conventional. It would have been better to have carefully composed and printed photographs that closely respond the often brittle and icy images in the text. The effect of the entire is precious and largely artificial. (See Adam Mars-Jones's excellent , ""Leaves Sprouting on Her Body,"" in London Review of Books, April 5, 2018. Mars-Jones puts ""the White Book"" in context of Han Kang's two previous--and more powerful--books, ""The Vegetarian"" and ""Human Acts."")2. The narrativeThe narrator has moved out of Korea and is living in a European city which had been bombed in WWII. (It was a curious decision not to name the city, which can only be Warsaw: Han Kang must have been imagining Korean readers for whom the details of WWII might be a bit hazy.) She is haunted by the memory of a baby sister who had died. Midway through the book she imagines the sister as living, and describes some of her experiences. At the end of the book the narrator abandons that conceit and returns to the fact that her sister did not survive. (A note about the pronouns: I'm assuming the narrator is a woman, because the author is; but I don't think there's anything in the English translation to unambiguously determine the narrator's gender, and it doesn't matter for the story. I also don't know if the Korean original makes the narrator's gender clear. If a reader can clear this up, I'll modify these notes.)For this structure to work, it would be necessary to continuously acknowledge that the sister's experiences are actually the narrator's, and that she's just imagining what her sister's life might have been. Han Kang loses track of this. Some passages that come shortly after the narrator decides to imagine her life are abstract, imagistic, or general enough so that it's possible to see them as the narrator's frail attempts to imagine a person she's never seen. But then come pages with very specific stories, which are clearly the narrator's own, but attributed to her sister (p. 89). That wouldn't be an issue if it weren't for the fact that the author apparently does not expect us to think that the narrator actually had these experiences. The narrative voice is also unstable in ways that the author does not control when it comes to the pages that recount what actually happened to her sister. The principal pages (pp. 125-6) are really very affecting, much more so than the surrounding pages. There is a sudden drop from the traumatic realism of pp. 125-6 to the following pages, which return to the book's usual meditations on ice, lace, snow, and other white things. (Some of these are well observed, and I appreciate that they are intended to have a purity and emptiness that mirror the narrator's mourning; but the majority come across rather empty and textureless.) Han Kang could have made the prose poems into reflections on the narrator's incapacity to understand, or think too directly, about the day his sister died. Or he could have introduced passages of equal emotional strength into the prose poems. As it is, ""The White Book"" reads as an incomplete act of mourning: the narrator is haunted by things she knows, or imagines, about her sister's death, and those things really are terribly: but the best way she knows to respond is by writing thinly textured imagistic prose poems about white objects. And last: there's a very strange page, p. 137, on which we're told that after her sister died, her mother had a son, who also died on the day he was born. When I came to that page I assumed the narrator had withheld that information because it was more traumatic than the death of her sister. But it's apparently the opposite, because her brother isn't mented again. The narrator first says that if he hadn't been born, her mother would have died by suicide. But then the second paragraph on the page tells us that if her sister had lived, the narrator might not have. That doesn't follow, and doesn't even make sense: it seems the narrator wants to say that either her sister lived, or she did, one or the other: the equation is poetic, but it isn't reasonable and it contradicts what's said in the paragraph just before. The page is undigested: it may have been Han Kang's intention to create a poetic balance between the narrator's life and her sister's, but it is not at all clear why she needed to introduce the second baby's death, or why she thought the either/or equation makes sense. I can't guess, because I am not given any further information: and so, from that page to the end, I am especially unhappy to be taken back into the world of anemic imagistic poems about white objects. If this were a student work I would have recommended another year of writing, in order to let the intense pathos of the few pages on the sister's death, and the sudden unmediated mention of the brother's death, seep into the range of experiments in describing white objects -- an exercise that is nearly as conventional and artificial as the performance art piece that the book implicitly documents....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,not set,"Feb 25, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/36294380-the-white-book

His work is a lesson in how treacherous it is to keep Kafka too much in mind while you're writing. He often substitutes atmosphere for both ideas and structure, and he apparently feels that lugubrious, dark, ""intolerable, cold, sad, bleak, and deadly"" landscapes he conjures are both naturally and sufficiently expressive of his often vague but persistent ideas about melancholy and memory, which are themselves derivative of prewar European fiction. Here I complain briefly about a half-dozen stories in the collection, and then, under number (2), quote one of the essays in its entirety and complain about it at length.1.The first piece, ""Wandering-Standing,"" is a pastiche of one of Kafka's parables or Beckett's scenes, with too many ideas, each one a cliche. (The man torn in two directions, holding a heavy suitcase in each hand.)The second, ""On Velocity,"" is about a man who tries to walk faster than the Earth spins, in order to escape from thought itself, ""because the Earth is thought."" First he walks West, which is wrong, because he's just subtracting a little from Earth's rotation; then East, which works; and finally he walks, because he realizes it doesn't matter if he runs or not. The problem is that these three decisions are very simple. I was ahead of him on each one, reading fast to see how long it would take Krasznahorkai's narrator to get to the inevitable conclusion. It's not good to have the reader's thoughts ahead of the narrator's when the theme of the piece is moving thought faster than the Earth. (Note this is not an intended irony.)The third, ""He Wants to Forget,"" toys weakly with existentialism: ""weakly"" because it glances off ideas better developed in existentialist literature.The fourth, ""How Lovely,"" is feeble-minded, in the sense that he doesn't think through his own premise, which is a conference on the idea of area, which is in turn predicated on the non-existence and yet pervasive necessity of area (space). This could be developed (I think of Cesar Aira here, who could have made it into another literary conference), but here it isn't.Fifth: ""At the Latest, in Turin"": this is a simple answer to Thomas Mann's reading of the story of Nietzsche's collapse (that the philosopher of the amoral succumbed to moral feeling). It's nearly a three-page philosophy essay, but it's bogged down by irrelevant literary metaphors (""by now we are gliding among the buoys that mark the harbor..."" etc.).Seventh is ""Universal Theseus,"" which is cast as a lecture series. The first one recapitulates the story of the arrival of a sinister caravan, told in ""The Melancholy of Resistance."" The moral here is necessarily simpler than in that book: Krasznahorkai actually draws a conclusion (""melancholy is the most enigmatic of attractions"") and proposes three sources of melancholy (pp. 39-40), which are not problematic in the context of a ten-page essay. This ruins part of ""The Melancholy of Resistance"" in retrospect, because it reveals a simple idea underneath the long novel.2.Reviewers have singled out a one-page essay called ""Not on the Heraclitean Path"" for special praise. It is just two sentences in John Bakti's translation:""NOT ON THE HERACLEITEAN PATH""Memory is the art of forgetting. ""It doesn’t deal with reality, reality is not what engages it, it has no substantial relation whatsoever to that inexpressible, infinite complexity that is reality itself, in the same way and to the same extent that we ourselves are unable to reach the point where we can catch even a glimpse of this indescribable, infinite complexity (for reality and glimpsing it are one and the same); so the rememberer covers the same distance to the past about to be evoked as that covered when this past had been present, thereby revealing that there had never been a connection to reality, and this connection had never been desired, since regardless of the horror or beauty that the memory evokes, the rememberer always works starting from the essence of the image about to be evoked, an essence that has no reality, and not even starting from a mistake, for he fails to recall reality not by making a mistake, but because he handles what is complex in the loosest and most arbitrary manner, by infinitely simplifying the infinitely complex to arrive at something relative to which he has a certain distance, and this is how memory is sweet, this is how memory is dazzling, and this is how memory comes to be heartrending and enchanting, for here you stand, in the midst of an in nite and inconceivable complexity, you stand here utterly dumbfounded, helpless, clueless, and lost, holding the infinite simplicity of the memory in your hand—plus of course the devastating tenderness of melancholy, for you sense, as you hold this memory, that its reality lies somewhere in the heartless, sober, ice-cold distance."" (p. 95)For examples of ers' praise of this see Joslyn Allen in Chronic Bibliophilia or Nicky Loomis in the Los Angeles Review of Books; both also quote the essay in its entirety. Loomis's praise is typical in the way she sets Krasznahorkai against the Attention Deficit Disorder of contemporary screen addiction: ""So here goes 'Not on the Heraclitean Path' in its entirety,"" she writes. ""I encourage you to read Krasznahorkai with no distraction. If you are on a train, do not look out the window mid-sentence. If you are on your computer, do not check your email. Do not take a bite of a sandwich. Ignore loved ones. And for god’s sake, turn off the news.""It is a beautifully paced sentence in English. But surely it isn't churlish to note that in crucial ways it doesn't make sense. The opening short sentence, for example, is not argued in the second long sentence: forgetting is not what is at stake, according to that longer sentence. The title, too, doesn't apply because the second sentence is about arriving at ""a certain distance"" from life, not re-arriving at the same destinations, as in Heraclitus's fragment. Krasznahorkai says ""the rememberer covers the same distance to the past about to be evoked as that covered when this past had been present."" It's a clear trope, but it doesn't make sense in the logic of the essay itself. Why should the distance be the same? If ""there had never been a connection to reality"" in the initial experience, how could there have been a sense of traveling toward an essence that was in anyway comparable to what Proust would have called ""voluntary memory""? As Nabokov's Van Veen would have said in ""Ada, Or Ardor,"" the texture of time has been advanced over the mechanics of memory. Even if we accept this, as the ongoing motion of the sentence requires, it doesn't make sense to then assert that ""this connection had never been desired."" It had, by the logic of the remaining half of the sentence. I really don't want to sound like one of those carping ultra-rationalists who populate the TLS Letters to the Editor: I only want to say that the two sentences themselves ask to be read as a series of reasoned ideas. They're structured that way. Nothing in the text itself suggests that the text is only, or even largely, a formal gesture or an attempt to evoke ideas by assembling evocative non-logical parts. ""Not on the Heraclitean Path"" is a schematic philosophy, like most of the essays in this collection, like most of Krasznahorkai I've read, and as such it needs to stop relying on its prosody for free passes into a realm of supposed poetry....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,not set,"Feb 17, 2018",,,view (with text),/book/show/37811752-the-world-goes-on

""A Clockwork Orange"" is probably the best known. Matthiessen's ""Far Tortuga"" is one of the best. I read this book as a point of comparison to recent attempts by Mike McCormack, Eimear McBride, and others, to create new forms of English grammar in fiction, and it seems to me that the idea of reworking grammar goes back to modernist experiments by Stein, Joyce, and others, that didn't always have to do with dialects.The Scottish writer James Kelman was often spoken of as an heir to Kafka (in s as far back as 1994, and probably before); he has written a number of books experimenting with Scots and English, as a way of expressing power struggles. ""Translated Accounts"" may be his most radical attempt to have unconventional English represent colonial and institutional violence and injustice. The book is 54 short chapters of eyewitness accounts, which the reader is meant to take as a dossier of atrocities, each of them translated from unnamed languages. Most of the testimonials are in one of several kinds of nonstandard English:1. Texts that seem to be translated with the help of a machine (these days that would be Google). As one critic puts it: ""... commonly, sentences are ungrammatical, misleading, and feature strange pasted-in pieces of vocabulary, suggesting a misused dictionary or computing resource: ‘Our attention now may be drawn to situations inter as between owner of the vicious dog leaping the garden gate that has bitten the skinny little child.’"" (Sally Mapstone,  titled ""Common Sense,"" LRB)2. Texts that seem to be recovered from corrupted digital files. All the s I've read mention one chapter in particular, in which a violent event is recorded in fragments, because the text keeps being interrupted by code fragments: ""and its laughingand andto the guest in our country ̌ ̌ ̌ ̌ ̌ ̌ ̌ ̌ ̌ ̌ ̌ ̌ ̌ ̌ ̌ ̌ ̌ ̌ ̌ ̌ ̌ ̌Summaryinformationhatlanguageor@...."" and so on (p. 30).3. Texts where the ""translations"" ""have been modified by someone of a more senior office,"" as Kelman says in his Preface. 4. Texts translated by persons not ""native to the tongue"" -- as he also says in the Preface.I think it might be possible to add to this list, but these are the basic categories. The problem with the novel, I think, isn't its lack of direction or ""plot"" (as some ers said), or its hedging about actual histories, but its management of these ""translations.""The fact that modes of ""translation"" (invented idioms) vary from one chapter to the next, while the number of witnesses also varies (readers cannot be sure how many people's accounts are transcribed in the book) means that readers will pay special attention to style in order to deduce the identities of the narrators. For that reason it matters that the strategies are not consistent, or consistently believable as translations. Mapstone noted that sometimes Scots (specifically Glaswegian) sneaks in even though Kelman apparently didn't intend it. There are also chapters that fall into a literary style emulating translation, in which Kelman's own (literary) voice can be heard: ""Yes she offered herself to me. I never heard her laughter. She was a girl. Her laughter. She would have laughed, who does not laugh. I would have walked with her and our lips could not meet."" (p. 157)Many other passages, however, register Kelman's inconsistent and, I think, inexperienced sense of what a bad translation is.""Authoritys and other powers show ignorance of a crucial tautology that may be formulated if roughly, having sense as follows, we have been selected be virtue of our merits, these merits are worthy selection criteria. Further, that these merits, being specific, are of universal application. Upon selection power is/was taken from them [democratically-elected governments, dutiful-appointed]."" (p. 154)If I read this slowly and attentively, I have problems. Why is ""authorities"" misspelled? It is presumably a translator's error, or a transcriber's, and so I am on the alert for similar misspellings. If the translator is partly illiterate, that will have certain predictable consequences. The main portion of this paragraph is eloquent in an institutional mode, but under what circumstances could a long, well-formed sentence of this kind be interrupted by an ungrammatical phrase (""having sense as follows"")? If the original text was competent institutional speech in its original language, and it was translated by a person who knew enough of about administrative speech to capture phrases such as ""ignorance of a crucial tautology,"" then how could a phrase like ""having sense as follows"" end up in the transcript? The square-bracketed interpolation raises a similar question: it clarifies the antecedent (""them"") in an elaborate and technical fashion, but it has a mistake (""dutiful-appointed"").

These stories are in a mode that's been common since Barthelme and other first-generation postmodernists, and especially since McSweeney's: it's as if writing needs to show that it is sharply self-aware at all moments; the author can't let a sentence go by without tweaking it to demonstrate his awareness of the contemporary quandary of writing, which can never be sufficiently distanced and ironic, and which seems always to be about to collapse into the naively fictional. Because this strategy is applied to nearly every sentence (it's as if a lapse in energy would ruin everything), the opening of the first story is enough to conjure it. I'll quote sentence by sentence so I can provide the sorts of comments a reader might ponder as she reads:""What interests me most is that Schaumann, the state executioner, bred mice.""The first four words: it begins informally, apparently. But this informality is studied, and the reader should appreciate that fact. An executioner who breeds mice: the double surprise implies it wouldn't have been enough -- not surreal enough, not imaginative enough -- if it had been either mice or an executioner. The double surprise is a signal of the signal strength, to use the kind of self-reflective punning metaphor Davies enjoys.""In his spare time.""The second sentence is a second sign of the story's apparent informality, but once again it's actually carefully chosen, in this case to balance the longer first sentence and to underscore the informality, among other things.""Sirens, ozone, exhaust are all words I might use to entice you into thinking yourself interested in the scene at Sing Sing where Schaumann, of whom you'll hear quite a bit more, was dispatching such and such a killer on a day, let's say, in spring.""First three words: the narrator's telling us that he's not telling us, not quite at least. This isn't a naive realist story. ""To entice you"": means this is going to be a monologue between the narrator and each reader, imagined individually, and that it's going to be in the conditional mood, because the narrator knows us well enough to go ahead and write his description, but he won't, because we're the kind of reader who wouldn't put up with anything so straightforward. ""Let's say"": same. ""In spring"": emphasizing the narrator's familiarity with us, in that he knows what sorts of things don't interest us -- such as precise meteorological descriptions.In general I find varieties of ""McSweeney's"" prose hard to take. I don't find them funny, first of all, even though I realize that ideal readers often do. This kind of prose can be entertaining, but only in an exhausting way, and I don't usually know why I need to be exhausted. As I read I tend to think less about the way the narrative's going, or the narrator's or implied author's proposed forms of self-awareness, or his positioning himself among his predecessors, but instead about concepts like the precious, the coy, the arch, the fey. From my point of view it isn't funny or amusing, for example, to read this halfway through the opening story:""Sorry, did I say that Schaumann didn't equate his mice and his prisoners? But you know I can't be trusted. I come from a broken home.""2.My unsympathetic and impatient perspective prevents me from being an adequate reader of much of this kind of relentlessly self-aware North American style postmodern writing. However there is one very interesting story, or essay, in this collection: ""Kurt Vonnegut and the Great Bordellos of the Danube Delta.""It is a sort of manifesto of the impossibility of teaching fiction, or (the same thing) of knowing what fiction is. As such it rivals anything that's appeared on the subject since Ben Lerner's novels, the discussions around Knausgaard (of which the best so far is Toril Moi's essay, online), or Shields's ""Reality Hunger.""The story (or essay) opens with a half-page story fragment in italics. The narrator then wonders what he's got, and how he might use it. He decides to transcribe and comment on Kurt Vonnegut's eight rules for writing fiction from ""Bagombo Snuff Box."" Davies's narrator is nonplussed by Vonnegut's instructions, and he treats them as if they made no sense. These pages are still arch, coy, wilfully dense, obstinately ironically obtuse about Vonnegut's simpler senses of fiction. Davies's narrator pretends not to know what characters, plots, and such things are. But then, near the end of his comments to Vonnegut's third rule, ""Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water,"" after remarking on a story he'd heard about someone who wants to go blind, Daniels has his baffled narrator say this:""... I don't see how words want, or what words want. I know, however, that I do want to read a story that wants me to want to go blind. I want to root for a story [""rooting"" is another of Vonnegut's desiderata, which the narrator affects to not understand] that wants me to want something I could not possibly want."" [p. 87]This is sincere, suddenly. Similar moments are scattered through the story:""Unbelievable that fiction, still, to teachers of fiction, is a dollhouse in which to stage-manage suffering effigies."" [p. 94]And he then presents a series of questions, boldfaced like Vonnegut's, as his response:""1. Is it an aid to the writing of fiction to be told to think or not think a certain way about the writing of fiction?""""3. Is it an aid to the writing of fiction to be told to read everything, or to read certain things, or to avoid reading certain things, or to avoid reading at all?""He then remarks that ""it may be accurate"" to describe fiction ""as essentially a form of attention, attention specifically to language, attention to the 'absent friends' we can make believe that this language describes."" (p. 96).It's a spectacular list of six questions, all very serious. If I read it as a sketch for a critique of teaching, it's as pessimistic and corrosive as some ideas I explored in relation to visual art in ""Why Art Cannot be Taught."" It would be an effective manifesto against teaching.There are more conclusions and also insights about the failure of people who teach fiction to understand fiction (p. 97, third paragraph). And then, suddenly, disappointingly, he returns to his jokes and ornaments (p. 97, penultimate paragraph). And before he ends he quotes, unironically and without criticism, a passage from Murnane about putting sentences together. What makes all this more convincing than Lerner's multiple poses and proposals regarding the veneer of fiction is the suddenness of the drop to straightforward statement and the anxious scramble back into character(s).This is a really wonderful essay (or story), with the Zeitgeist packed into it. It's the sudden veering from dizzying precipices of irony and self-awareness, down into really refreshing but apparently dangerous depths of conviction, that makes it good....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Feb 10, 2018",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28633750-the-knack-of-doing

But ""A Long Way From Home"" is explicitly aboutThe Mess Made by Mixing Politics and StorytellingI usually do not read novels to learn about the world. But ""A Long Way From Home"" is explicitly about some truths of Aboriginal life and history. Carey gave several energetic interviews (one I heard on Irish radio in January 2018), speaking about how he had finally found a way to write about the obliviousness of his fellow White Australians. The book has been heralded as a brave and honest attempt to think what it was like -- and still is like -- for White Australians to continue not to notice what has been done to Aboriginal culture.The entire first half of the book has nothing to do with that subject. There are in my count three very brief mentions of Aborigines in the first 161 pages of the book. Five pages later one of the narrators finds the skull of an Aboriginal child who has been murdered, and cries. Two pages after that (p. 168) is the first mention of racism.As the book goes on, we are instructed on Aboriginal life, history, and culture. We're told about their antipathy to maps in a set-piece that allows Carey to say some very general things about Aboriginal sense of the land. We're told about forcible relocation, we're given names and documents (including A.P. Elkin, the assimilationist), we're told about Ted Strehlow's underlying racism, about rapes and homicides by White ranchers and policemen, about the reasons fences disrupt Aboriginal life. For all this to work the obliviousness of the White characters has to be complete. When an Aborigine man finds that one of the characters has kept the infant's skull, he walks off in shock and anger, and the narrator muses, ""Who knew this was personal to him?"" (p. 217) When characters learn the truth, we're told so: ""And of course I had finally seen that all Aboriginal culture was based on country,"" one character says, ""they were exiles, denied the meaning of their lives."" (p. 299)When a novel aims so directly at confession, reparation, and education, I try to imagine its ideal reader. In this case that is depressing exercise, especially if I'm imagining an ideal Australian reader. I am sad to think that Carey probably judged this well enough, and there will be Australians who feel this novel taught them something, opened their eyes to something. To the extent that is true, it points to an obliviousness much deeper than anything that can be usefully addressed by a novel as superficial and abbreviated about its subject as this one is.- - -But I don't read to find out about people, ethnicities, nationalities, or history. As a novel, this is weak. Carey fills the book with his kind of manic, kaleidoscopic narrative, whose principal strategies seem to be: never slow down, and pack each short paragraph with as much detail as possible. The relentless present of the narratives is repeatedly momentarily stalled by moments in past retrospective mood: ""I didn't realize then that...."" but those moments fleeting, like touches on the brakes. The narrators who think these thoughts plunge immediately back into their present. This breakneck pace also runs across narrators: the book alternates chapters told from several points of view, but there's one style, one voice, one mood, even one way of making jokes and allusions, for all the characters. For me, the chapters putatively narrated by different people are obtrusively similar, as if Carey was intentionally writing against the basic advice of any writing workshop. (If you change narrators, change tone, change detail... change something.)As in any 350 page novel by an experienced writer, there are moments that are quite good. For me the book's center is the (female) narrator's sense of her husband, whom she loves and admires, but who is hopelessly dependent on his sadistic father. When his father dies, he cries, because ""there was nowhere left to hide his relentless secret love."" (p. 178) More could be said about that part of the narrative, but that would misrepresent a novel that is fundamentally not under its author's control. Carey wanted to write a serious, brave, well-researched novel about some Aboriginal experiences and about Australia's history, but he ended up with a book about a mid-century family in Melbourne, a famous road race, and a sprinkling of supposedly deeply revealing facts about Aboriginal culture. Maybe in the end this is what is interesting about ""A Long Way From Home"": not its history, not its facts, not the road race, not the principal characters, but the fact that even after a lifetime of writing novels, it can prove to be impossible to control the text. There are many ways this novel could have regained control: the first half, in which Aborigines aren't mentioned, could have dramatized and dwelled on that absence; the first half could have been cut, in order to spend time on one of Carey's original ideas (as he said in an interview), the race around the continent; the factual material on Aboriginal cultures could have been radically expanded, as William Vollmann has done; or it could have been truncated, so that the book lectured less and hinted at more. But it isn't any of those things: it's the mess it was in the author's mind....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Feb 03, 2018",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/34950025-a-long-way-from-home

They're quite different, except that McCormack and McBride are -- very promisingly! -- reviving the modernist crafted, agrammatical sentence.Baume's book raises different issues. Critics didn't like the fact that every couple of pages the narrator inserts a paragraph that begins like this:""Works about Lostness, I test myself: Stanley Brouwn, This way brouwn, 1960-64.""There follows, usually, a brief paragraph describing the work. Most are conceptual and performance pieces from the 1960s through the 1980s. The narrator is out of art school, and is trying to keep her world in order by referring her feelings (""Lostness,"" here, but always something capitalized) to artworks she's learned about.There are dozens of these, maybe close to a hundred. Reviewers found this irritating, even boastful. I don't, for two reasons, one general and the other specific to this book. First, specialized information in any form should never be taken as a sign of the author's genius, research, knowledge, etc. The common reflex for ers is to jump out of the narrative and express admiration for the author's mastery of specialized material. In fiction, any information is part of the narrative. The narrator, in this book, has recently been to art school, so it's plausible these things are in her mind, and if it wasn't -- if, for example, she was going on about quantum physics -- that should equally well have nothing to do with the author.Second, these interpolations function as allegories of the events in the narrative, so they are not all equal (and therefore, potentially, all equally annoying or intrusive). Sometimes the narrator clarifies what she's been feeling, and other times she ends up more lost than before: and this fits her unstable state of mind.It's an interesting strategy, repeatedly interpolating an unexpected kind of information or description. It breaks the narrator's consciousness in two apparently very dissimilar parts: one contains her entire life, her memories, her love of her grandmother who has recently died, her social awkwardness, her eating issues, her identification with dead animals; and the other contains a series of brief, factual descriptions of artworks from the past half century. It's the imbalance that's interesting, and as the novel proceeds the difference lessens. The allegories provided by the artworks (especially, for me, ones by Tehching Hsieh) expand, so they appear much larger than the narrator's life, and her life shrinks (especially, for me, when she identifies with a dying slug and a shed full of moths), so it appears local and even solipsistic.I think his strategy could be expanded, radically. I could imagine a version of this book in which the allegories are continued at length, or individual allegories are repeated, or the narrator returns to them and mulls over the connections, or the descriptions are made much more ""irritating,"" specialized, and full of theory and criticism -- all this while her own life continues to contract, to a badger, to a hedgehog, to a moth, to a slug.

It isn't the kind of book I usually read: even though it was written in the 1970s, it is in the line of H.P. Lovecraft: it conjures its terrors with set-pieces (a strange old woman's narration, a zealously guarded vault full of moldy papers, streets with inexplicable happenings, special radio recordings of incomprehensible voices, solitary witnesses to horrific events, and so forth). Readers are supposed to be drawn in by those prefaces and invitations. I find myself thinking about the author, who experiences fright as something that happens only when it appears, supposedly unexpectedly, after a series of curtain-raisings and changes of scene. de Maria works hard to prepare us for moments of horror that are, in the end, often pre-ordained by the scenes he's staged for us. There are only a few real surprises, and they have to do with rude or obscene episodes that seem out of place in the machinery of fin-de-siecle storytelling: a woman who is constipated and wants a massage; an old man who advertises for young girls. The rest is familiar from early 20th century fantasy and genre fiction, comics, and movies. It's entirely appropriate that de Maria chose a picture by Felicien Rops for his cover (here reproduced in negative, I suppose to make it look more frightening).However, there is a good reason to read this book: it's a wonderful snapshot of Turin, and specifically a certain moment in the 1970s, when there were threats of terrorism. The book is ""out of time,"" but the idea of threat is everywhere. Turin is conjured through its public sculpture; the statues are named and brought into the story. You could use the book as a Baedecker: you'd go from one piazza to the next, looking at the statues everyone overlooks, pondering their pervasive effect on people's thoughts. de Maria was serious about the city and its statues; he even has a character in the novel read Musil's piece on the invisibility of monuments from ""Posthumous Papers of a Living Author.""(And yet -- for a much better novel of a haunted city, try Alfred Kubin's ""The Other Side."" Kubin's visual art was of a piece with de Maria's imagination -- and his choice of Rops -- but Kubin's book is full of the sort of the less predictable, endless strangeness we now associate with Kafka.)...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Jan 08, 2018",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30285138-the-twenty-days-of-turin

The book has two or three long set pieces: a party, during which hymns are sung; an extended Boccaccian fantasy about seven people who one slept on the narrator's antique bed; and an inventory of the house.The problem here is that set-pieces, especially in a narrative structure that will by its own definition be looking for coherence and thematic continuity, need to be magnetic: they need to work to pull the novel together (or to provide proof it is fragmented).

A Complex Confusion of Fiction, Nonfiction, and RevelationI'm studying this as part of my project of reading long, complex texts (see notes on Burton's ""Anatomy of Melancholy,"" Szentkuthy's ""Prae,"" Nabokov's notes on ""Eugene Onegin""). Dick's ""exegesis"" of several irrational, mystical or revelatory experiences he had in February and March 1974 occupied him for the remainder of his life; this is a 940-page excerpt from 8,000 pages of notes.The book has received some simplistic s. Charles Platt said it wasn't as important as Dick's writing, that Dick was often drunk when he was writing, and that he had a sense of humor about it -- a reckless summary judgment about a project that occupied its author for eight years. (Platt, ""The Voices in Philip K. Dick's Head,"" New York Times, December 16, 2011.)For me the remarkable property of this archive is the way Dick, the fiction writer, came to think of his own texts as sources to help explain his experiences. At various points between 1974 and his death (when he was still at work on the ""Exegesis""), novels like A Scanner Darkly went from science fiction to documentation, and the way they did so is not clear in the ""Exegesis"" itself -- it seems to have been tenuous and often invisible to the writer himself.1. How fiction becomes archiveAt one point, Dick says ""my writing casts doubt on the fact of... knowing actual reality because our minds have been fucked over."" He doesn't mean this as a literary critic: he means it literally, as if his fiction had become science or serious theology. A line later, he says that ""Flow My Tears, The Policeman Said"" provides ""some evidence"" that ""the real situation"" (of people) is ""prison-like,"" while other novels ""point to"" a ""supernatural salvific interventive power."" This is all consistent, but then he says ""The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch"" ""seems to say"" that an ""evil magician deity is in control of our worlds and heads."" (p. 406). That ""seems to say"" is uncanny: it might mean the novel's narrative ""could be read as implying"" such a deity, or it might mean the novel may be evidence of such a deity in the world. A few lines later there's the one-word sentence ""Strange,"" and then then there's this:""Does this book [A Scanner Darkly], then, seem to say, 'Maybe portions of the others are literally real, too?' The author does not now pretend to be writing fiction..."" [p. 407]It's an astounding conflation of fiction with documentation, and of the published fiction author with ""the author"" of the ""Exegesis."" Much of the book proceeds this way. At one point Dick writes that the indications are that his ""novels are literally true,"" but at the same time, he thinks, they may be more autobiographies than fiction, and in fact they may even be ""appeals for help"" (p. 412). Readers of ""Exegesis"" have naturally stressed the otherworldly nature of Dick's experiences in 1974, but if I subtract the strangeness of those experiences, his seriousness about his own output, and his investment in understanding its truths, would be strikingly similar to many other authors, from Freud to Proust.The theology, ontology, and eschatology Dick works out make an almost perfect match with the commonest elements of his novels: a higher power has descended into creation, disguised itself, and then forgotten its own action and its disguise, but it has left a clue or a sign for itself that will remind it, sometimes imperfectly and with consequences, of its origins. Sometimes that plot is repeated, Russian-doll fashion; sometimes the power is alien, sometimes corporate. But the fundamental strategy that puts the plots in motion is the immersion, or appearance, of the hero in a world where he does not belong, where he is shielded, for a time, from his real nature. Weirdly -- but what isn't weird here? -- Dick never seems to realize the outlines of this story are the Christian story of the incarnation (for example, p. 413). One of the folders of the manuscript suddenly presents portions of the novel ""VALIS."" Pamela Jackson says the surprise cuts ""like a knife."" ""Where did this voice come from?"" she asks. ""The novel gives us... a self-reflection by the author on his own hyperbolic... imagination,"" and after some pages Dick regains his voice and continues his exegesis (p. 451). This is doubly odd given that readers of the novel ""VALIS"" have remarked on the entanglement of the implied author (Dick) and the principal character (Fat). On the one hand, fiction intrudes into nonfiction as evidence; on the other hand, autobiography intrudes into fiction as literary device: an amazing mirrored confusion and conflation, exactly the sort of plot device in Dick's other fictions.2. The commentators' problemsThis edition of ""Exegesis"" is a little like a Talmud in that it has footnotes by a number of scholars who are identified only by their initials. Among them are a philosopher, a scientist turned cultural critic, and three theologians. (Platt, ""The Voices in Philip K. Dick's Head."")Simon Critchley keeps Dick at a safe distance, commenting only on his indebtedness to Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, and others (eg, notes on pp. 496, 547). Kate Hayles contributes a couple of acute footnotes on Dick's manner of reasoning, which reminded me of Ermanno Bencivenga's attempts to reconstruct what counted, for St. Anselm, as logic (see Hayles's notes on pp. 232, 475), but for the most part her notes propose links between Dick's ideas and late 20th century science (pp. 673, 683, 694, 708, 710). The dozen or so scholars who contributed footnotes are all on the horns of the dilemma: how fully is it possible to read the ""Exegesis""? Can it be read as anything more than an expressive diary? Can it be read as a theological inquiry? As a revelation about time and space (as Dick experienced it, at least when he wasn't doubting himself)? Literary criticism is especially helpless on this point, as the widely divergent footnotes suggest.3. A possible parallelDick's persistence in decoding his mystical experiences has precedents, for example, in Jakob Boehme, who wrote a number of books to interpret visions he had in 1610 and afterward. (Dick only knew Boehme from an encyclopedia entry, which he read ""by mistake""; p. 286.) In a very different sense, memoirists have used their own writings as documents; Proust's narrator uses some of his early attempts at prose fiction as evidence of his childhood -- but that's a wholly different matter than re-experiencing one's earlier prose as an ""intricate and unconscious precursor"" of one's visions. (Jonathan Lethem and Pamela Jackson, ""Introduction,"" p. xiii.) It is probably impossible for anyone who has read Dick's novels as fiction to re-read them as archives of revelation; but in another sense what Dick does in ""Exegesis"" is entirely comprehensible, because fictions are certainly commonly unconscious or inadvertent articulations of their authors' beliefs. In that sense ""Exegesis"" is a reading of fiction for real-world truths, no different in that regard than ordinary political, social, or economic reading of literature. (And there's even a tempting parallel to the weirdness of Dick's readings in Graham Harman's book on H.P. Lovecraft.) And yet Dick's book really is something different, because it does not read his fiction as evidence of real-world truths, but as documents of real-world truths: not as fiction from which we might learn about the world, but as archival material reporting directly on that world. I wonder if the closest parallel to ""Exegesis"" is Schreber's Memoirs of My Mental Illness, in which a skilled judge argues that even though he is psychotic he deserves to be released from his asylum. But even there, the situation is simpler: Schreber was writing an autobiographical document, not a novel, and even though he recognized some of the things he said would not be taken as real by any of his readers, he did not present them as fictions; and he was not vexed by indecision over whether or not they might ever be taken that way....more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,not set,Aug 2023,"Dec 10, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10887550-the-exegesis-of-philip-k-dick

Novels are complex in time and structure, and influences can be masked by masses of detail. ""Compass"" is at first intermittently, then forgivably, but finally overwhelmingly and depressingly indebted to W.G. Sebald. Enard has Sebald's penchant for travel in Europe, and he loves weaving histories of places and people together. He has Sebald's sweet melancholy, and Sebald's nostalgia mixed with pain.But there is a signal difference: Enard is insufferable. He is a snob in two specific senses: he wants to enlighten his readers, and he wants them to know how much he knows. On pp. 109-11, Enard's narrator, Ritter, tells us how Beethoven gave the premiere of his own Moonlight Sonata, Op. 27 no. 2 at a time when he was starting to go deaf; it has been recorded that his piano was out of tune, and he didn't realize it. A woman he loved was in the audience. Enard wants to say that the concert always reminds him of the ""shame and embarrassment of all declarations of love that fall flat."" It's a nice illustration, potentially, but to get to that point Enard needs to tell us who was present at the concert: Antoine and Therese Apponyi, the hosts, later friends, Enard notes, with Liszt, Lamartine, ""the scandalous"" George Sand, Balzac, Hugo, Metternich, Talleyrand (and that leads him to mention Napoleon, Goethe, Hafez, Schubert, Mendelssohn, Louis XVIII, Louis-Philippe, and Chateaubriand), the orientalist Joseph Hammer-Purgstall (not yet von Hammer-Purgstall), Chopin, Rueckert, and Mowlana Jalal ad-Din Rumi.This doesn't add atmosphere or content, really, and it doesn't help Enard make his point about embarrassed love. It is name-dropping. More often, Enard doesn't name-drop: he really does love all his 19th century historical figures, but unfortunately his love leads him to want his readers to know as much as possible. And for me, that recurring pedagogic impulse makes the book unbearable. I often thought that his ideal reader was a combination of a young, curious European academic, avid reader, or book er, eager to learn more about Europe's relation to the Orient, and Sebald himself, whom I imagine Enard wanting to correct -- I picture Enard becoming annoyed at Sebald's persistent bias toward western and central Europe, and his obliviousness about eastern Europe, the Balkans, or the Middle East. My copy of ""Compass"" has many pages marked ""lecturing Sebald.""A sign that Enard's real interest is educating ideal readers of both types is the thinness of the novel's framing devices. The narrator is in love, and stories about his fellow scholar Sarah are threaded through the book. He is also ill with an unspecified disease, and he keeps thinking of that as well. But neither of those become much more than devices. The mentions of his disease are especially unconvincing because they come up so often, and to so little effect. Clearly Enard considered them useful strategies to keep the narrative afloat -- they are excuses and frames for the hundreds of historical, political, musical, literary, and linguistic stories he wants to tell.All this becomes especially difficult to tolerate when his two ideal readers (the educable and somewhat star-struck younger reader or newspaper book er, and Sebald himself) cannot be combined in a general mode of address -- when it becomes clear that he wants to say one sort of thing to Sebald (and other older, more knowledgeable readers) and another to ers (and other younger and less well-informed readers).An example from early on in the book: on p. 29, he is thinking about Mahler's ""Kindertotenlieder."" First he feels he needs to tell us the title in English (French in the original):""...and now I have Mahler and his 'Kindertotenlieder' in my head, songs for dead children...""and then he needs to tell us about Mahler's daughter:""...composed by a man who held his own dead daughter in his arms in Maiernigg in Carinthia three years after composing them...""This is potted, or condensed, history: and who, exactly, is it for? If a reader knows Mahler, she knows the Kindertotenlieder, and if she knows them, she knows they are for dead children. I guess that almost everyone who knows Mahler knows his daughter died, even if only a few would know about Maiernigg, or that it's in Carinthia (the latter is important elsewhere in ""Compass""). So on the one hand there's an imaginary reader who knows Mahler, and doesn't need to have this all rehearsed; on the other there's a reader who doesn't know Mahler, for whom this is a somewhat startling but essentially inexpressive or opaque passage. The former is ""Sebald,"" and the latter is the younger reader I've been imagining. Somewhere in between is their composite: a reader who knows something about Mahler, so that the mention of ""Kindertotenlieder"" strikes a chord, and yet somehow doesn't know about Mahler's daughter, or hasn't thought about how the ""horrible dimension"" of the songs ""wouldn't be understood until long after"" Mahler's death in 1911.Contrast this uneasy sense of a reader with the end of the same paragraph:""...these 'Kindertotenlieder' are set to poems by Rueckert, the first great German Orientalist poet along with Goethe..."" (p. 30)I imagine not many people who know Mahler will know this, or appreciate the song cycle's place in the history of Orientalism: but in that case this sentence strikes a clearly pedantic tone. It's instructional, and now the reader knows better than before.Enard can't stop himself from dropping hints that he knows a lot about these subjects. He does it through his narrator, Ritter, but those passages come across clearly as claims about his own knowledge. (I have been taken to task for mistaking Ritter for Enard: but the structure of the text permits the inference of an implied author, because the rhetorical position of the narrator when he tells us how much he knows is different from the rhetorical position accorded to the narrator when he tosses and turns in his bed.) Enard, then, has Ritter muse about just how much knowledge he has of the performance history of Beethoven, for example, and the entire of ""Compass"" is scattered with ideas for books Ritter (which is to say, Enard) might write. Farther down on p. 30, Ritter muses that ""as a teenager"" ""Kindertotenlieder"" ""was the only piece by Mahler I could bear"": a thought that also serves to remind us that it's not just the narrator who knows his Mahler backwards and forwards.I don't mean to imply that these problems of tone and address could be easily solved. Many ers loved this book; of the s I have read only Stephen Poole in the ""Guardian"" has some of the reservations I have. (He wishes Enard was ""less determined to demonstrate the pleasures of erudition."") I found material that I can use when I teach Orientalism and its critiques in my own classes. The problem is not in the stories themselves, it's their uneasy imbrication into a novel. Enard wants to tell these stories, and it is not easy to know how to set them up, how to make them seem to be naturally lodged in Ritter's stream of consciousness, how to avoid interpolating explanations that Ritter would never bother to give himself. And yet that is exactly what Sebald manages to do, and that's why I think of Enard as a pedagogue, if not a snob, in a way Sebald never is.I have two more complaints.First regarding Enard's range of historical reference. His narrator is fascinated by the 19th century, which is the author's prerogative. But to the extent that Ritter speaks for Enard, it is unfortunate that his interest drops off so rapidly when it comes to art, music, architecture, and literature of the last hundred years. Ritter's mind is at home with Liszt, Chopin, and Beethoven, and although he mentions Part, Schoenberg, and others, they really aren't part of his imagination. Enard, the implied author, is old fashioned. He studies Orientalism, and he offers some correctives not only to the Occidentalism of Sebald, but to the prejudices and limitations of academic Orientalists. But he himself is embedded in the 19th century: an especially dire condition given that the debates about Orientalism that enable Enard's discontents are themselves late 20th century developments, and they go with a very different culture. Intellectually, Enard offers critiques of Eurocentrism that were initially enabled by Edward Said and developed in the very large literature following his work; but culturally and emotionally, Enard's world is the exact one that perpetrated all the Orientalist prejudices and projections that even the first wave of Orientalist scholarship in the 1970s clearly rejected.Second, and last, regarding the images. Because I am making a special study of novels with images, I was intrigued to see photographs scattered through the text. But they are also disappointing. The first two are exactly apposite to the book's themes: they are pictures of open two-page spreads from Balzac's ""La Peau de chagrin."" The first edition has Arabic on the page, a first, as Enard says, in European literature (although I wonder about Renaissance texts: doesn't the Hypnerotomachia poliphili have Arabic?). The second omits the Arabic script. The two images fit the book's themes: they're texts, they're 19th, they're literary, they have to do with translation, and they are framed, in the novel, by a text within the text. But it's a squandered opportunity. I waited another 12 pages for the next images, and during those pages I was wondering: how did those images get into the text? Did Ritter supposedly have a copy machine? A camera? I was taken out of the narrative as I began to wonder about why Enard didn't think a reader might wonder about such things. And then, 12 pages later, on p. 102, Enard has Ritter introduce the third image with a deictic gesture that might well have made Sebald laugh: ""Oh look,"" he writes, ""in this article Sarah reproduces the engraving..."" and viola, there's the engraving on the next page....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,not set,"Aug 13, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/30347698-compass

There is a tradition according to which Burton belongs with Milton and Shakespeare in the 17th century canon. I haven't been able to discover the origins of this judgment (I suspect someone like Harold Bloom) but it seems wholly appropriate. Even though Burton's book is nominally what is now called nonfiction, it is an act of imagination comparable to Milton and Shakespeare. If it's read as a first-person text, and not a 17th century medical treatise, it can sound to 21st century ears as a memoir, or a ""theory-text,"" or a kind of ""essay-novel"" in the tradition of Musil. (Autobiographical voicing is intermittent throughout; see for example 1.2.2.6, 1.4.1.) In other words: there is no reason not to include it in the roster of indispensable English writing. I have interrupted these notes with three parentheses: on editions of the book, on the frontispiece, and on postmodern literary criticism of Burton. I thank Victoria Musvik and others for helpful responses to a version of this text posted on social media, summer 2017.)(The first parenthesis: the NYRB edition pictured here is not a good one to read. The print is small and the margins are clipped. After a lot of searching I found the Tudor Publishing edition edited by Dell and Jordan-Smith, printed in 1927, in hardcover. I bought a copy for only $10. It's well printed and easy to read; it's 1,000 pages long, so it's bulky but not difficult to hold. There are also editions with Burton's extensive Latin intact, but unless you are fluent in Latin, those are only impediments; Burton did not imagine his Latin guarded his text against anyone -- except in one passage, where he makes fun of scholars by putting a page in Latin, pretending they couldn't read it. There is also the multi-volume Cambridge Press edition, which is madly expensive, and not at all necessary unless you're interested in looking up Burton's sources, almost all of which were also written in Latin.)Perhaps an initial thing to say about the book is that it cannot be read without laughing, and that the comedy is unintended. It's an inevitable effect of the three centuries that have passed since the book was written. It's absolutely full of outlandish, crazy, unbelievable anecdotes and odd usages of English. Yet the book is as prodigious as Shakespeare or Milton when it comes to striking ideas and writing, and I annotated nearly every one of my edition's 1,000 pages. Most of those passages are also inadvertently funny, but that doesn't make them less fascinsting. To cure rabies, it's only necessary to go to a bath and picture a dog in the bath: the conceit (why would a dog bathe?) is enough to overcome the insanity of rabies (1.2.6.1). A good cure for farting is to put a bellows ""into a clyster pipe"" and pump the wind out (2.5.3.2). Horse leeches are good for hemorrhoids (2.4.3). These days people can hardly be bled, but it was once possible to take ""six pounds of blood"" and people wouldn't mind (1.2.1.4).The language and ideas are often stupendous. At one point he argues that it is no harm to be a stranger who travels and has no home, and he gives a list of things that are strangers to one another, including rain, which is ""a stranger to the earth"" (2.3.4). Later he remarks that the ground ""covets"" showers, because it loves them (3.1.1.2). He has a barely controlled fascination with stagnant water, which is expressed dozens of times in the book, each time with a different poetry:""The worst... is a thick, cloudy, misty, foggy air, or such as comes from fens, moorish grounds, lakes, muckhills, draughts, sinks, where any carcasses or carrion lies, or from whence any stinking fulsome smell comes"" [1.2.2.5]And he is of course wonderful in his repeated conjurings of different kinds of melancholics:""...little by little... Melancholy, this feral friend, is drawn on, & as far as it reaches its branches toward the heavens, so far does it plunge its roots to the depths beneath; it was not so delicious at first, as now it is bitter and harsh: a cankered soul macerated with cares and discontents, a being tired of life, impatience, agony, inconstancy, irresolution, precipitate... into unspeakable miseries. They cannot endure company, light, or life itself... Their bodies are lean and dried up, withered, ugly, their looks harsh, very dull, and their souls tormented, as they are more or less intangled..."" [1.3.1.4]It would be possible to go on quoting until I'd quoted most of the book: the same is true of Milton or Shakespeare. For me, however, the principal interest of the book for me is its structure. Burton offers a ""Synopsis"" at the start of each of the book's three ""Partitions"" (parts). The Synopsis is in the form of an outline organized in bracketed paragraphs { { {. If the three Synopses were printed all together, in a reasonable font size, they might be 10 feet long. He divides each of his Partitions into Sections, each Section into Members, each Member into Subsections, and in the text, each Subsection has a number and a title (some fairly long). (Second parenthesis: it is worth remarking that the famous frontispiece is a simple-minded and inaccurate synopsis: I studied it as a student, because it's the book's only visual element, but it doesn't begin to approach the text's concerns. It is difficult to sustain interest in the frontispiece if you are engaging the entire text: claims made about the frontispiece tend to lose force in the course of actual reading. ""The Anatomy of Melancholy,"" like ""Finnegans Wake,"" has attracted a scholarship of readers who have not worked their way through the entire text: in Burton's case the ""tell"" is a reliance on the frontispiece.)This is daunting enough, but the interest comes in the fact that these Synopses do not make logical sense. In a rationally organized table of contents, each division (here, for example, each Section) would be equal to each other Section. But in Burton's Synopsis, some Sections are subheadings of other Sections. The entire organization is a chaos, and it is therefore impossible to use as a guide in reading: instead a reader is at the mercy of Burton's often unconvincing synopses and introductions.Ruth Fox's book is a brilliant untangling of Burton's sense of reason and logic: it belongs in the tradition of Empson in that every sentence counts, and the book is argued from first to last. In that sense it's a sort of antidote to Burton: slim, well-organized, nothing superfluous. She makes the fascinating point that in the Third Partition on Love-melancholy, the last of the book's three parts, Burton inverts his own system of organization. Here is part of her analysis:""...the logic of the first two Partitions is one of cause an effect, of action and reaction, so that Partition I states the thesis--definition, causes, symptoms, and prognostics--of the disease, while Partition II--under its single topic, cure--provides the antithesis to all of the topics of I. In I and II the three kinds of 'definite' melancholy are treated as subtopics of the cause-cure analysis.... But in Partition III he changes the base of his analysis, using now as his major organizational scheme not the logic of thesis and antithesis, but that of division... To put it another way, the roman numerals of the outline of Partitions I and II become the arabic numerals in the outline of Partition III."" [pp. 124-25]The entire structure and logic of the outline is inverted: subheading become headings.The Synopses are an important example of the way the book is continuously getting away from Burton. Fox concludes: ""Burton's book sets out to cure melancholy, and does so by being an ordered form of disorder, an answer to imperfection which contains imperfection but defines it by art."" (pp. 271-72) (Third, longest parenthesis: the scholarship on the three Synopses to the book's three Partitions tends to stress their dysfunctional elaboration; see for example David Renaker, ""Robert Burton and Ramist Method,"" Renaissance Quarterly 24 (1971). Angus Gowland, in ""Rhetorical Structure and Function in The Anatomy of Melancholy,"" Rhetorica 19 (2001), accuses Renaker and Fox of being ""unfamiliar with Renaissance presentational techniques,"" but that's unfair because Fox doesn't simply argue that the Synopses are dysfunctional; she proposes specific ways in which they can be read. Gowland says in several places that other scholars are anachronistic or uninformed (including Stanley Fish), but his accusations are symptomatic, because his own analysis is strongly anachronistic in its imputation of a postmodern sensibility to Burton. Gowland conjures Burton as an author who is mainly concerned with ""self-consciously"" (p. 22) inverting rhetorical devices in order to produce a complex text, making medicine ""subject to an uncertainty"" that ""undermines its scientific status"" (p. 33), and subverting ""conventional relationships between author, text and reader"" (p. 16). All these, in my reading, are projections onto 17th century material (cp. also p. 22). It's not that the rhetorical concerns of the late Renaissance cannot be found in Burton's text: it's that the author was not out to produce an object of complex interest for scholarly study. He was trying, sometimes desperately, to solve problems for himself. He was struggling to make sense, and rhetorical intricacy came in tow. Producing a Burton who was fascinated with complexity makes the desperation of the text invisible, and renders its truth claims as textual effects. But I'll leave that issue, because it's a criticism as old as objections to the sophists.)There are more issues of logical order and argument in this book than any other I know, including Wittgenstein's ""Tractatus"" (thinking of its numbering system, which Wittgenstein only briefly explained) or Musil's endless novel (thinking of the overflow of the novel into the essay, and vice versa). Burton tries desperately hard, in as many ways as he can, to control his subject, but melancholy keeps spreading: in one passage, everyone is a melancholic and ""no mortal man is free"" from it (1.2.3.1); in another, melancholy and madness are nearly equated; in another, all of melancholy is a fault of love. The fact that Burton probably died by suicide necessarily haunts all readings of this book. In the book, suicide comes up several times (see for example 1.4.1), but most especially toward the end, where he speaks of despair. For him that is a special condition, particularly hard to bear, because the person who experiences it suffers from a partial, and therefore faulty, understanding of god. He may be able to reason very well, in fact better than anyone around him, and that makes his condition especially intractable. One woman ""rose from her bed, and out of the window broke her neck into the street"" (3.2.4.5). Another, a lawyer from Padua, out-argued his doctors, making the case ""against himself, and so he desperately died"" (3.2.4.4). ""The Anatomy of Melancholy"" is a labyrinth that shifts and changes as it is read. (For Fox, this organic, unfinished quality is what makes it, paradoxically, able to present itself as art, and therefore as a cure.) As a document of a fierce struggle against solitude, despair, unreason, confusion, depression, and suicide, it has no rival....more",Notes are private!,0,31,1,not set,not set,"Aug 03, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/557658.The_Anatomy_of_Melancholy

It is about the lives of several French mathematicians, and the author herself is a mathematician. The book is divided into eleven Roman-numbered chapters, each of which takes a different form: diary, myth, dossier, chronology, etc. After chapter XI there is a ""Supernumerary Chapter,"" dated 2009-2013, in which Audin herself lists some of the book's sources (including Dante, Berlioz, Beckett, and dozens of others), and gives the chapter that contains material from each, even though it is often impossible to say how the source material appears in the chapters. The ""Supernumerary Chapter"" includes all the place names mentioned in the book, in alphabetical order, even though that information is impossible to use. The book ends with an Index of Proper Names, just as in many older nonfiction books.The translator, Christiana Hills, appends a brief essay that mentions, in passing, that she read most of the books mentioned in the ""Supernumerary Chapter"" and did extensive research on the geography, biography, and chronology of the book, but she doesn't say how any of that helped the translation, or might affect the reader's experience. (The translation is a stupendous achievement, and it's great that Deep Vellum Publishing took it on.)The central non-mathematical, non-Oulipian theme of the novel is the distance between the nominally unpolitical world of mathematics and the atrocities and horrors of both World Wars. Some of the mathematicians in the novel were in the resistance in WWII; some were collaborators; one was Jewish; another horribly wounded in WWI. There are intrigues and politically motivated actions of various kinds, but despite it all, the mathematics proceeds.I disapprove of the way the novel excludes the actual language of the one discourse it privileges the most, mathematics. I'll expand on that in the last section. The first sections here are about the two principal ways readers have approached this novel.1. Reading the book as politics and historyIt is possible to read this as primarily a book about the identities and lives of people compromised by war. In France, Audin is known for refusing the Legion of Honor because, she said, Sarkozy failed to answer a letter she wrote asking for information about her own father's disappearance (he was a well-known mathematician). A  by John Taylor in Boston's Art Fuse describes the novel along these lines, as a matter of politics and identities:""[Audin's] spirited Oulipian gambits stand out and may irritate some readers. They keep the emotions from building up and making this novel thoroughly gripping. Feeling is in shards, as it were... a strong point is being made: what matters is not emotional connection, but rather gathering scattered bits of fact, piecing some of the puzzle back together, and restoring the identities and thus the full-blooded faces of those whom the Nazis sought to efface.""2. Reading the book as a structural accomplishmentIt is also possible to read the book more as a structural puzzle. Felix Hass does this in a  in Bookslut:""You cannot read Audin's masterfully written book as you would any other work of fiction. Rather, you need to approach it as you might a book of science or mathematics. You underline, you comment, you take notes. In a mathematical proof, you might try to fill in a technical step that was left to the reader by the text itself. With 'One Hundred Twenty-One Days,' you want to capture detail mentioned about seemingly unimportant characters, to serve as cross-references when they are broken out as heroes of a new chapter, which, on first glance, might strike you as an entirely new book.... So, at the end, it is not a man's rebellion against or another man's complacency with fascist oppression, nor is it a triple homicide committed by a third or the combined mathematical genius of all three that lends itself as the focal point of Audin's novel. Rather, she wants us to see that it is a young woman's love, her '121 days of happiness' which is truly remarkable, 'the fabric of history.' Audin lets her fictitious author put this theory forward in one of her last pages and underlines it by her choice of title. Still, it remains difficult to see the importance of this love episode, which is laid out in merely one of her eleven chapters.""In this sort of reading the book becomes a puzzle that is solved: the vicissitudes of history and politics are less important, or more fragmentary, than a moment of love. The reading isn't satisfying, for at least three reasons: as Hass says, it isn't convincing given the book's complexity; Oulipo isn't about solving mysteries but demonstrating their ""potential""; and it doesn't account for the results of mathematics itself, which is held apart from history throughout the book. 3. Combining both strategies of readingOther s I've seen do not decide between these two. Michael Orthofer's  in The Complete Review hedges the issues raised by these two kinds of readings. He says the book ""can't easily be reduced to a 'story about' some-(or many) things,"" but those things are what interest him, and in the end the book is a ""puzzle."" Another inconclusive  is Karl Wolff's in The New York Journal of Books; he concludes by asking ""What is storytelling, if not a futile grasp to interpret the accumulated detritus, ephemera, the junk of civilization?"" -- a question that is not specific to this book. According to John Russell Clark, in The Kenyon Review ""the novel’s implicit view of history"" is that ""it is vastly more complex than any single point-of-view, or any one narrative (or, shit, any fifty narratives, 121 narratives) could ever come close to grasping."" But again this observation doesn't account for this particular book: it could be said of any complex book on twentieth-century politics. A reasonable conclusion might be that this book -- and by extension other Oulipo texts -- creates a frame of mind in which the novel's content and its structure may or may not work, together with a kind of critical exhaustion that prompts readers not to press the connection.In theory, I think the two strategies of reading could be combined, but I haven't seen a  that does so. Perhaps there's a dissertation in the making on the subject. Hills, the translator, notes that she used Google maps, Pinterest, and other sources to try to elucidate the book's metafictional sources: much more could be done in that vein, and it might be possible to work on the very Oulipian problem of justifying the exact form, in all its artificiality and constraints, as an optimal solution to expressing the book's real-world themes.4. Representing mathematicsA  by Corine Tachtiris in World Literature Today notes that ""With powerful effect, Audin demonstrates that math can be both poetic and political."" I don't agree with this because mathematics is actually not present in the book. A book as vertiginously complex as this one, with a full range of Oulipo-style research, constrained writing, appropriated styles, multiple chronologies, and extremely densely allusive prose, should be able to present mathematics more fully. Instead we get hackneyed gestures in the direction of mathematical beauty: a character muses that pi is exquisitely beautiful; there's a chapter on numbers that includes a dozen mathematical constants without explanation; and there are hints of genius throughout. But why should mathematics be reduced to those ""Beautiful Mind"" kinds of evocations? There are many ways to show the significance of constants like the square root of two, e, and pi, without requiring advanced mathematics or even trigonometry. There are continued fractions, infinite series, analogies and illustrations of all sorts. This is also a book of extraordinary literary complexity. Many passages in it are not wholly comprehensible because they depend on texts (as in the ""Supernumerary Chapter"") that provide structure, content, allusion, and wordplay without actually revealing themselves. Why, then, not include actual equations? If readers are temporarily but repeatedly lost by the book's allusions and its collage of literary styles, why shouldn't they be temporarily blocked by the presence of ""illegible"" equations? What is Oulipo if not the presentation of ""inert,"" unexpected, illegible, ""inexpressive,"" appropriated, rule-bound material in the body of fiction? Why not complement the ""technical"" apparatus of the novel with actual mathematics (or chemistry, or engineering, or any other ""technical"" discourse)? Why should an Oulipo project -- or any other demanding, experimental, complex work of fiction -- restrict itself to literary discourse?Just to be clear about my concern: I wouldn't count books like Richard Powers's as examples of novels that incorporate science or mathematics. Like most literary novelists interested in science, Powers conjures the science in nontechnical language. Examples of experimental writing that include science are Christian Bok's Crystallography and Xenotext. David Foster Wallace almost showed it was possible in his book on infinity: it isn't fiction, but his language is the same as in his novels and stories. So my question here has to do with a reluctance, on the part of some writers, to cross from what the classicist Wesley Trimpi, in a book called Muses of One Mind, called ""literary"" to ""geometric"" discourse. I do not see a reason why readers shouldn't be challenged in all possible ways, using all possible strategies....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,May 2017,"Aug 13, 2023","May 14, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/26196054-one-hundred-twenty-one-days

The book's themes are potentially complex (it's about suicide, abandonment, love, fidelity, and memory) and it struck me as odd that a complicated structure, like a novel, can seem to become a matter of simple problems. This essay is more about that problem than about Paula's novel. First I'll rehearse my difficulties with the novel, then I'll explain why it seems to be significant that novels often fail in many ways, even though s tend to focus just one or two themes.A word about the word ""failure."" I am not talking, in this essay, about the author's intentions or reader's expectations. Many novels, hopefully most, succeed for their authors and readers. ""Failure"" is the ordinary condition of average art in any medium: it denotes the fact that the majority of novels aren't remembered for long, and don't participate in the conversations about what might count as ambitious or challenging novels in the 21st century. There's more on ""failure,"" ""average"" art, and other subjects in this essay on visual art: ow.ly/iVrh30bxbds. I am interested in what can be done with the novel when it's written, and read, in full awareness of precedents from modernism to the present. ""Fail"" could be put in scare quotes as a reminder that it doesn't mean a novel isn't rewarding, entrancing, or moving--and it certainly doesn't mean a novel isn't successful--but rather that it does not respond to the last hundred years of novels, so it is not a part of the conversation about what novels can be.I'd like to thank Andrei Molotiu, who read a first draft of this and pointed out that my lists of things that cause novels to ""fail"" sound prescriptive, as if I have a ready-made list of things novels should avoid. All I can say is this isn't a fixed list. It shifts and changes with each book. Each novel proposes implicit norms, practices, and theories of form and content as it goes along, and a reader will notice when it diverges from those parameters. For example, a novel might depict a character as amnesiac, and then recount an episode in which she remembers things perfectly; that kind of diversion requires an acknowledgment: the narrator needs to explain it, or the novel needs to provide a logic that makes sense of it. Otherwise readers will doubt first the character, then the narrator, and then the implied author. Most novels don't have that sort of obvious continuity problem, but all novels have unevennesses and inconsistencies. They are what I am responding to in Paula's novel: she proposes the novel is about suicide, but pays unaccountably uneven attention to that theme. In the second part of this essay, ""failures"" are meant in the same way: they are things novelists establish and then lose track of, or lose control over. None of the items in my lists in the second part of this essay are necessarily problems: they become so when they are not acknowledged in the structure of the novels that create them. This means even a deeply inconsistent novel, one that has most of the ""failures"" I list, can be successful: ""Naked Lunch"" is an example, because lack of consistency is built into its structure. Conversely, very careful and consistent novels can be failures: Agatha Christie is a good example for me, because her books are perfectly uniformly logically constructed, with none of the ""failures"" I list here, and for me that is a large part of the reason that her books are not interesting as novels.One last thing: the translation of ""August"" is exceptional, nearly flawless. Here is just one example from hundreds. ""So I ask him, then, if he gets away a lot like this; do you get away a lot like this?"" That semicolon is a wonderful solution to a difficult problem of voicing.1. Criticism of ""August""The novel suffers most from an inability to imagine things other than the main story, which concerns a woman who struggles to decide how she feels about an ex-boyfriend she's encountered on a trip out of town. That narrative is well written, and wouldn't have raised any issues for me, if it weren't for the fact that she encounters her ex-boyfriend on a visit to Esquel (a town in the southwest of Argentina) where she had gone to stay with the parents of a friend of hers who had died by suicide. The parents exhume their daughter's body, have it cremated, and scatter the ashes, and she stays in her dead friend's room. The friend who has died is addressed throughout in the second person, which is an effective strategy at least in the English translation. This has potential, but five major subjects are missing:(a) We don't get a sense that the narrator understands how the parents feel, and therefore (b) We don't believe the author has had any close experience of parents who have lost a child. (c) We are barely told anything about the dead person's sister, who also visits. (d) Until late in the book, we know almost nothing about the narrator's own mother, who abandoned her as a child, and who she thought was dead. (Even after we're told, we still don't see any reflection of the mother's actions on her daughter—the book's narrator—which is bizarre given that the entire book is about commitment.) (e) We are never told how to imagine the narrator's relationship with the woman who died. It's as if the person who died was just an idea, not a person the narrator actually knew.These are the principal gaps in the narrator's imagination when it comes to the theme of suicide. The implied author appears as a person who has known people who have died by suicide, but she does not seem to have experienced other people's reactions to suicide, and she does not seem to have thought much about what parents feel. She comes across as young, perhaps a teenager: the scenes of attraction, doubt, drinking, and travel are the most persuasive. Given that the novel is about suicide, the narrator's lack of engagement with survivors (and herself, because she thought her mother had died by suicide), and the implied author's apparent obliviousness to her own lack of imagination about those characters, leaves gaps in the narrative. The logic of the novel calls for more meditations on suicide, done in different ways.I can imagine a new chapter for each of the friend's parents, whose grief is nearly invisible in the book; more material on the narrator's own mother, who abandoned her; a meditation on the narrator's awareness of her similarity to her mother, which isn't developed and almost seems not to have been noticed by the narrator or the author; a chapter on the narrator's father, who comes across as absurdly affable and forgiving given that his wife left him and their children; and above all, more material on the friend who died: not in order to solve her absence, but to let us know the narrator has spent time thinking about it. All we hear about that is that she likes one of her former friend's CD's, her cat, and her leather jacket.These criticisms are matters of gaps in the narrator's and the implied author's imaginations. August ""fails"" in this sense: it proposes subjects and ways of thinking about them, and then it diverges from those ways, without accounting for its reasons. The book is mainly a love story, with several serious narratives of suicide and abandonment standing in the wings.2. Why it is important that novels ""fail"" in many waysI think a reasonable starting point in considering the criticism of modern and contemporary novels is that a typical novel fails. Revies typically mention one or two things that seem infelicitous or unconvincing, but as readers know, that doesn't tally with the experience of reading.  Novels ordinarily fail continuously and repeatedly, dozens or hundreds of times over the course of a reading, and the variety of the sources of failure testifies to the richness and complexity of the genre. If novels failed for just a couple of reasons—the way scientific theories can fail, for example, just by being falsified—they wouldn't be as challenging, and it wouldn't be as important to be as ambitious as possible both in reading and in writing them.For example, it could be said that August doesn't cohere. The reason why lack of unity or coherence is a common verdict is not simply that unity is an elusive goal, but because there are so many sources of incoherence, so many ways that a novel can be at odds with itself, undermine itself—and some of those are expected in modern and postmodern fiction. A writer can abuse a trusting reader, disabuse a generous one, undermine their own logic of time and narrative, stray from depictions of character, lose inertia, or lose track of voice, tone, mood, affect, realism or naturalism, idiom, or style. It is the proliferation of pitfalls that makes novels so interesting, not the single fault (lack of coherence, in this example) that might emerge in a . ""Coherence"" is, after all, is a kind of covering term: a simplification brought on by a reader's exhaustion and their attempt to keep the whole in mind. (A good theorist of this problem is William Empson.)This may sound abstract, but it is only a way of putting a common reader's experience: when you begin a novel, after the initial pages (during which it's normal to suspend judgment, and try to attend to the form of the text or the author's intentions), it is common to encounter different kinds of infelicities one after another: obtrusive digressions or ellipses, surprising and apparently uncontrolled lacunae, shifts in tense, solecisms, inappropriate asides, unwarranted assumptions about the reader's interests or knowledge, unnoticed borrowings, clichés, uncontrolled shifts from tragedy to satire or comedy, a million sorts of awkwardnesses, a tone that lapses, unintentional narrative discontinuities, failures of depiction, lags and douleurs, unconvincing details. Unless you note these one after another, producing a kind of endless and unreadable microcriticism, they will begin to coalesce in your mind, and form into groups. As you move on toward the end of the book, even simplified lists of reservations may become too long to remember. At the same time, if the author is living and might read the , it may seem unhelpful to articulate more than one or two principal problems with the book: novels are so deeply woven into their authors' ways of thinking that it seldom helps to  issues one by one. (Teachers in MFA writing programs have to wrestle with that sort of problem: readers and ers usually don't.) Only the most patient and skillful ers, like Adam Mars-Jones, can conjure more than a few of a novel's distinct problems, and even then it takes many pages to do so. And after you've finished reading, all these unclassifiable and heterogeneous moments of failure might all coalesce into an impression of the novel's coherence or lack of it.But just because s simplify and condense readers' reactions doesn't mean that those simplified judgments are adequate. What matters in novels is the number of ways they fail, the bewildering and entangled and multidimensional ways that novels fail continuously, on every page. That matters because it is the clearest evidence that modern and contemporary novels can actually in some meaningful way contain thought....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,"Apr 10, 2024",not set,"May 06, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/34724292-august

This isn't just because the narrative is a hostage situation. The desire permeates the implied author's choices and descriptions. It matters that the hostages are as comfortable as possible: one has a tiny pillow, another loosens her hair, a third rests on her husband's shoulder. They all get bathroom breaks. This interest in comforting, consoling, and assuaging extends to inanimate objects. One character worries about pipes in his house, even though he doesn't own it. The narrator (who is near-omniscient, but ""focalized,"" as Genette says, on a number of characters) even tells us that the wonderful carpet is safely cushioned by a pad, so it won't be unduly worn by all the gunmen and hostages.There's an equally consistent and heartfelt need to tell readers how mesmerizing, how sheerly beautiful, women can be. An opera singer hypnotizes one character after another. A servant's beauty makes a man forget his pain. Intimacy and quiet are important; people whisper to one another nearly inaudibly in Spanish, French, and Japanese. The opera singer's voice is heavenly, to everyone with ears, which means almost everyone worth describing.At first -- around page 20 -- I thought that this authorial nursing would make it impossible for anyone in the novel to suffer or die, but then -- 10 or so pages later, and so very early in the book -- I realized that one of the author's principal purposes in writing is to provide a glow of reassurance over everything and everyone, to illuminate life with an aura of maternal love. What a strange purpose for a novelist. It isn't exactly sentiment, although it is often very sentimental: it's more a kind of unassuaged need to show that things and places as well as people can be nurturing and nourishing, good for you to contemplate.This desire feels like it was once an anxiety, before the author began to write, and that she healed herself by writing. It's as if the calm and warmth of the prose need to be continuously renewed by narrative. If I read through the narrative, as it were, to the anxious state of mind that I imagine might have impelled it, then I'm interested; but I am not convinced by an author who wants to console me at every minute: it's like being in the company of an overly solicitous, determinedly optimistic nurse.(This is not a complete . I only made it to page 89. So much reassurance: by p. 81 there is a death, but we're told in many ways it was for love, and then we're told how that love was reciprocated, not only by one person, but by an entire crowd of people, who somehow understood what was happening even though they spoke a variety of languages; and we, the readers, are reassured that everyone appreciated and was inspired by the love they witnessed.)All this made me wonder what the opposites of ""Bel Canto"" might be. ""Bel Canto"" consoles and cares about every doubt or anxiety a reader might have; what books disregard their readers' doubts? One of Patchett's opposites would be Beckett, who can sometimes want to tell us over and over that things are hopeless. Or writers like Houellebecq, Capote, or Ellis, who often want to remove consolation. Those names come to mind because they are authors who set out, in a way, to do the opposite of what Patchett does. The norm would be narrative that sometimes consoles but typically doesn't, that sometimes shows how people care and are cared for, but generally doesn't. If, as a reader, you don't feel any special pleasure in being continuously reassured, or if you find, as I do, that this continuous solicitous care, the relentless comforting, raise questions about the person who needs to administer that care, then this book may seem less calming than disturbing....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Mar 01, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5826.Bel_Canto

He has been read by any number of critics, including Fred Jameson, as a sign of postmodernism and the digital age; and he has been taken as a kind of cyberworld version of Nostradamus, full of predictions about our future. The implied author of ""The Peripheral"" is clearly engaged in both activities; the book is full of thought experiments about plausible or perfected technologies, and there are some extended meditations on the possible future courses of the world, climate, economics, and culture. I am not interested in fiction as litmus test or predictor of culture, and that's one reason I don't read much science fiction, fantasy, or genre fiction. But I think there's another, more interesting issue here: it occurs to me there's a sense in which projects like ""The Peripheral"" are made possible by a certain reading of literary fiction that could be described as a misunderstanding. 1. WritingGibson is a very good writer, by literary-fiction standards. Most every sentence is crafted. There are only a few passages that can be read at speed, just in order to get a sense of the story: most of the book needs to be read slowly because of what he's doing to language. His observations, dialogue, descriptions, and metaphors are often thoughtful and persuasive. He describes Tasmanian tigers as ""carnivorous kangaroos, in wolf outfits with Cubist stripes"" (p. 392). There's plenty of sharp-edged writing.At the same time, however, he seems to feel as if serious writing can often best be achieved by neologisms. Inventive language -- I am thinking of anyone from Flaubert to Eimear McBride -- defamiliarizes. Gibson's does too, but mainly by inventing things that don't exist. ""The Peripheral"" is full of imagined sorts of fashions and fabrics, tattoos that move, walls that are transformed by nanobots, teleportation of all sorts, out-of-body states, future weapons, future gardening with biogenic trees, several different kinds of remotely operated surgical devices, new kinds of encryption involving invented languages... it's a long list. Those are the things that make the language interesting, more than choices of trope or syntax. ""Her hair white as the crown Macon had printed in Fabbit"" is a good enough example (p. 222). It refers to a teleportation ""crown"" that had been 3-D printed by a company named Fabbit; the sentence is typical of the way Gibson avoids ordinary description, but leans on imagined things and neologisms.2. AffectIf I try to imagine this book without the specifics of its plot -- which means subtracting all the hundreds of references to peripherals, sigils, imagined technologies, and time travel -- and ask myself what feelings, what desires or anxieties, drive the plot, then I come to two things in particular:(a) A fear of the present. No character in this book wants to live in the present (with the telling exception of some romantic moments in moonlight, which are after all about wishing for an impossible ideal). The writing itself doesn't want to be in the present, and there's an ongoing effort to open a space between the writing and every experience we know. Here is an example. A ""sigil,"" in the book, is a kind of logo or icon that appears in a person's visual field and can be expanded into a ""video feed"" or even into an immersive virtual reality. Gibson often describes sigils the way a person might describe a logo. ""An unfamiliar sigil appeared,"" he writes, ""a sort of impacted spiral, tribal blackwork"" (p. 236). Here he's working hard, like an author of literary fiction, to defamiliarize. An ""impacted spiral"" is an interesting thing to try to picture, and a reader may have to look up ""blackwork"" to understand what he's conjuring. Imagining both the ""impacted spiral"" and the blackwork as an icon adds a layer of imaginative work. The cumulative effect of sentences like this (which amount to maybe half the sentences in the book) is to make it seem that the author feels it's necessary to work continuously to produce even an incremental distance from the present. At the same time the work is fragile, because it's superficial (here he's only adjusting our notions of what an icon might look like). It's as if he feels he needs to pry open a space between the present and the place he wishes to be, as if it constantly needs to be renewed, because the fragile invented future is in danger of collapsing back onto the unbearable present. (b) A desire to disappear. Characters in ""The Peripheral"" nearly always prefer dream states, projections, out-of-body experiences, time travel, medication, and dissociative experiences to living where they are. The book must have hundreds of examples of things that help people disappear: robots they can inhabit, toys they can wheel around by remote control, game worlds they can enter, Matrix-style teleportation comas they can enter, walls they can walk through, stand-ins they can program, cars and clothing that can be cloaked, cosplay zones populated with avatars and cyborgs, invisible tables in restaurants (eg, pp. 227-8). The characters are ostensibly driven by the fairly complex plot, but affectively, in terms of their desires, they all want to vanish. As I read, I often thought of the author, as opposed to his narrative: to write a book like this, I thought, a person needs to want to disappear. The language of ""The Peripheral"" is a concerted attempt to ""cloak"" ordinary writing in a veneer of micro-metaphors, translucent to ordinary meaning but safe from it. The technology described in the book is an equally forceful attempt to picture ways that machines might help us dissolve some of our bodily mass and material into a foam of biogenic digital projections. The plot, too, can be understood this way, because it turns on time travel, and there are people in both the ""present"" (our near future) and ""future"" (seventy years farther on) who want to disappear, both within their own times, and within the ""present""; and the plot is arranged in such a way that there are uncountable ""presents,"" which diverge even as we read. What could be more comforting to someone who wants not to be present?In a sense this is what's meant by ""escapism"" in popular fiction and film, except that here it is not only a matter of an invented world, transparently described, but of the act of writing, in a literary sense, put to the same purpose. In the end, I don't mind the anxious ongoing invention of neologisms, technologies, and time-travel plots. But it is a misunderstanding to think that language itself can't be interesting unless it is injected with nanobots of unfamiliarity. That's one reason I won't be reading any more Gibson -- or, I think, any more genre fiction. The other tunnels under that first one: it's that the desire to escape, to vanish into time or the cyberworld is itself uninteresting because it is relentless and uninterrogated. It's the lack of reflection on the desire itself that puts this book outside the conversations of modernism and postmodernism....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Feb 25, 2017","Feb 25, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/20821159-the-peripheral

Actual aphorisms by Lichtenberg are in the text and in the margins, always identified by number:""[J 1842] I must write in order to learn to appreciate on my own the extent of the chaos within me."" (p. 76, margin)The body text presents itself as a narrative about the life and reception of Lichtenberg. Most chapters are written by an unnamed narrator; a couple, headed ""Lichtenberg speaks,"" are presented as if written by Lichtenberg.1. Why the book is not an historical novelIn Michael Orthofer's words, the book is""difficult to categorize. Dalkey Archive Press (accurately) presents the English translation as 'Fiction' (in its 'French Literature Series'), but its Dewey class identification number (838.609) will lead dutiful librarians to shelve it somewhere in Goethe's vicinity, on the historical literature shelves; the Library of Congress classification (PT2423.L4 Z91313) puts it similarly deep in German-literature territory, rather than in the contemporary French literature section -- subject-matter apparently prevailing over form."" (from The Complete Review, www.complete-.com)But it is hardly true, as Orthofer concludes, that ""the picture of Lichtenberg readers are left with is likely a more complete one of the man and his work than can be found in any traditional (or other fictional) biography."" And it's hardly the case that the material is ""mined to its very ends."" Lichtenberg published five books and a number of essays in his lifetime, and almost none of that is in Senges's book, with the exception of some traces of Lichtenberg's text on Hogarth. Lichtenberg's science is alluded to many times, but also basically not described. Senges used a French translation of the aphorisms, and he seems to have very little interest in Lichtenberg's science or his other interests. It's not a book to read if you're hoping to learn about Lichtenberg. ""Fiction"" is the correct classification.Most of the novel is a succession of stories, all invented, about people who tried to assemble the fragments in his ""Waste Books,"" believing they were the remains of a ""Grand Novel."" Senges imagines two centuries' worth of work, a study center, and a half-dozen indvidual scholars (Leonid Pliachine, Zoltan Kiforgat, Christina Walser, Mary Mulligan), and he tells us at length about their theories. Those scholars and their hypothetical books are the real characters in ""Fragments of Lichtenberg.""2. Fragment and whole in ""Fragments of Lichtenberg""I was hoping, I suppose, for a meditation on the difference between Lichtenberg's notes (he did not call them aphorisms) and the clearly encyclopedic ambitions of Senges's narrative. But Senges has a simple notion of both the aphorism that prevents any real engagement. He only quotes about 200 of Lichtenberg's thousands of notes. There are about 10,000 in all (see the German Wikipedia for Sudelbücher), and according to the translator, Senges used a French translation that has about 2,000. They range from sentence fragments to longer notes, but Senge prefers them all the same size, about the length of the one I quoted.The conceit of the book is that Lichtenbergians thought that they were the remains of an enormous novel, and in particular that Lichtenberg had burned the novel, leaving only 1/10 of it in the form of his notes, which he then collected. (It's ridiculously improbable, given that almost none of the notes read as fragments of a novel -- there's no dialogue, for example, and no characters -- and that Lichtenberg himself kept his notebooks, one for each letter of the alphabet, so he would have had to write a novel, burn it, collect the fragments, and assemble them into supposedly chronological notebooks.)That conceit permits Senges to imagine books that Lichtenberg might have written, and it allows him to tell, in a fragmented way, the stories of Lichtenberg's self-appointed editors over the centuries. In other words many of the 150 or so short chapters in ""Fragments of Lichtenberg"" are themselves fragments of about a half-dozen stories about the scholars. But that sort of fragmentation is really only division and rearrangement: it isn't a cutting, across the grain of grammar and sense, as in the best of Lichtenberg's aphorisms. Senges has one of his characters propose that Lichtenberg's fragments are like islands in an archipelago, and the oceanic spaces between are the lost texts: it's a metaphor very much in line with the original Sudelbücher, but not at all in line with ""Fragments of Lichtenberg,"" which is continuous and uniformly expressive and comprehensible despite its 150 chapters. (p. 65) The narrative runs in a fluid, fluent fashion, without any letup, for all of the book's 500 pages, and the result is a strong contrast between the dense, obdurate quotations from Lichtenberg and the author's watery prose. Here is an example among hundreds. Two of Lichtenberg's fragments are insert in a sentence that runs blithely on past them:""...the foreheads of the Lichtenbergians are all nicely wrinkled: between [Lichtenberg's aphorism] 'One of our ancestors must have read the forbidden book' [D 339] and [his aphorism] 'Flies have mated in the hollow of my ear' [L 555], there might [have originally have been] a hundred and twenty pages of shipwreck, capture, and salvation, filled with duels and stampedes, a pastor's monologue, and the complaints of a chambermaid..."" (p. 45)Senges can't help himself: he needs to list every Baroque possibility he can, and the result is a cavalcade of supposedly learned, superficially ""encyclopedic"" information. But the happy torrent of Senges's references is at stark odds with the weirdness and seriousness of Lichtenberg's thoughts. Aphorisms are embedded in this book like ugly spiders frozen in floods of amber. ""Fragments of Lichtenberg"" evades the more interesting problem of the disjunction between Lichtenberg's 10,000 unattachable, irrecuperable fragments, and Senges's superficially fragmented but actually quite well-ordered book. As I read I went through a phase of skipping ahead to read Lichtenberg (his fragments are always in italics in the translation, and often in the margins), because I was getting less and less from Senges's prose, but I was always rewarded by the strangeness of Lichtenberg's thoughts. It only makes matters worse that Senges sometimes ends his brief chapters with lines that he must think function like aphorisms. A chapter called ""Lichtenberg speaks"" (one of several in his voice) ends: ""in fact, sometimes it's my hump that does the dictating."" (Lichtenberg was hunch-backed.) (p. 71). That pales next to the Lichtenberg aphorism that's quoted in the margin of the facing page:""[L 972] I believe that man is ultimately so free that his right to be what he believes himself to be cannot be disputed.""What an amazing compression of ironies, so distant from Senges's simple paraphrase of Lichtenberg's thoughts on his deformity. At one point Senges quotes Lichtenberg's fragment B 232: ""Imagination and fantasy must be used with caution, like any corrosive substance."" (p. 381) It seems Senges did not notice this implicit indictment of his own project: despite every attempt to let his imagination and fantasy run on, he has produced a book that is not ""corrosive"" at all. It's oblivious, often, to the acid in its subject's heart, to the willfulness that resulted in 10,000 ""notes"" that could never be synthesized, to the attraction Lichtenberg felt toward things that do not fit, that do not exist in endless chains of trite Baroque associations (shipwrecks, pastors, chambermaids).I don't see this as a book on Lichtenberg. I also don't see it as a book on the contrast between encyclopedic excess and aphoristic taciturnity -- except inadvertently, in the continuous contrast between Lichtenberg's sharp insights and Senges's fluvial prose. Senges knows that Lichtenberg's fragments are just that -- pieces, not taken from an original whole, and not likely to be united into a coherent whole -- but his prose flows blithely on around the amazing aphorisms, for hundreds of pages, as if a 21st-century kind of encyclopedism can frame and even nourish texts that are alien to it at every point. *(Incidentally, a lot of what passes as erudite allusions is, I think, more the result of Google searches. Internet-style scholarship abounds, for instance when the narrator happens to remember the sequence of pieces in a suite [""the intoxication of the prelude-allemande-courante-minuet-gigue variety""] or the number of blades in a Swiss Army knife [twenty-seven]. [p. 291]) Nor is there much engagement with the actual complexity of the real Baroque encyclopedias, which are rebarbatively intricate in comparison to the flow of stories in this book. Burton's ""Anatomy of Melancholy"" is mentioned in passing, and so is Pierre Bayle. But actual Baroque encyclopedias are as distant from Senges's encyclopedism as he is distant from Lichtenberg. This is a firmly 21st century book, not in the sense that it has something new to say about part and whole, fragment and long form, but rather in the sense that it knows its 18th century through the internet.)...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Feb 11, 2017","Feb 11, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/21563520-fragments-of-lichtenberg

Ilya writes in a kind of rough and wild colloquial speech; Yakov writes measured, 19th-century style prose. Yakov also writes rhymed verses; and there are also chapters in a different voice, which Sokolov, in an NPR interview, has identified as his own voice. The book alternates chapters by Ilya, by Yakov, and chapters of Yakov's poems. I read the poems and prose by Yakov, but I couldn't stand the chapters by Ilya: they are ruined, I think, by a bad translation. More on that in the third section.1. Precedents""Between Dog and Wolf"" is touted everywhere as the Russian ""Finnegans Wake."" The Columbia University Press website quotes it this way: ""Intricate and rewarding—a Russian Finnegans Wake."" It turns out this isn't a , but a one-line ""In Short"" notice which reads, in its entirety, ""Sasha Sokolov’s classic Between Dog and Wolf (Columbia University) is intricate and rewarding—a Russian Finnegans Wake."" Such is the depth and detail of contemporary ing! In fact the parallel with ""Finnegans Wake"" doesn't help. The chapters written by Ilya come from a long line of inventive pseudo-patois, a tradition that includes Faulkner and Peter Matthiessen's wonderful ""Far Tortuga."" The alternating prose and poems by Yakov are rich with allusions to Russian literature and culture, and one of their inevitable points of reference is ""Eugene Onegin""--which also fits because Nabokov, who once praised Sokolov, wrote 4 volumes of commentary on Pushkin's ""novel."" (I have a  of that elsewhere on Goodreads and Librarything.) ""Finnegans Wake"" shares as much with ""Between Dog and Wolf"" as it does with Arno Schmidt or Marianne Fritz, which is to say very little.The Yakov character writes a kind of surreal, associative prose, which is reminiscent of Peter Handke's meditations on landscape. I think its ultimate model is Rilke or Trakl, in their hallucinatory poetic imagery, and in their twisting and folding of time and place. Yakov's poetry is reminiscent of a number of models, from ""Eugene Onegin"" to folk songs and ballads, and poets like Rimbaud and Verlaine.2. PhilosophyIn terms of the history of novels and of philosophy, ""Between Dog and Wolf"" has a deep romanticism, mingled with a modernist interest in words and writing. Yakov expresses the romanticism especially clearly:""Waters are splashing,Flow by themselvesTo reach their goal;The years are passing,And we ourselvesJust live, that's all."" [p. 143]Or:""Why did I, the hunter-ragpicker,On the face of existence a blemish, a scab...Compose all these Notes at this river's springAnd floated [sic] them down in a hurry?Such a meaningless loss of candles and ink...How annoying: All these years irretrievably lost,Playing, singing, and having much fun;You gaze in the tumbler--and you're just a ghost.Alas, things look bad, you are done."" [p. 230]Or again, even more ecstatically, in the mode of Joyce:""Lonely and lone among all the lone and lonely who are countless, burn, burn brightly--there, at the cobblestone highway; here, at the crossroads of turnouts, and at the dead end, where the burdock grows. Burn with white light, sinless flower, burn, bitter, burn, timid, burn, enchanting. Burn for Yakov..."" [p. 180]Yakov's prose chapters are the centerpiece of the book's modernism or postmodernism, because of what they do to time and place. The narrator's monologues fold back and forth through time, suffering from ""symptoms of terminal temporal disease that distorted the natural flow of events and years, the flow of being, the course of the flow"" (p. 176). Yakov's thoughts are swamped by unexpected links: not only Rilkean tropes and unexpected analogies, but constructions like ""at first--just once; later--occasionally and then--constantly,"" and ""when and whether, and if, and wherever, and while--then, therefore, and consequently"" (pp. 174-75). For me these chapters are the heart of the book, because they articulate the narrators' (in the plural) sense of the sfumato of time, signaled in the book's title (which refers to the end of twilight, when it's not possible to tell a dog from a wolf) and in the setting (which is full of imagery of rivers, seasons, and time passing).3. TranslationStylistic contrasts are the engine of the book, and I can imagine that in Russian it might be a powerful experience. But in English it is seriously hampered, even crippled, by poor translation choices.The translator, Alexander Boguslawski, says the NPR interview (January 28, 2017) that when he first found the novel his English wasn't good enough to translate it. Actually what he says is ""But what was the problem, you know, that I read it very early, and my English wasn't good enough."" Given, it's a radio interview, and no one is perfectly spoken on radio, but the Russian-English expression ""what was the problem"" is a warning sign. May I suggest that when it comes to idioms, his English still isn't good enough?In the chapters written in Sokolov's voice, and in Yakov's voice, and to some extent in the poetry, the translation isn't an insuperable obstacle: I can usually tell what tone or idiom Sokolov was aiming at. But the chapters presented as written by Ilya are nearly unreadable. Here is the first line of the book:""The moonth's clear, no catchin up with the dates, the year's current."" The translator's notes at the end of the book gloss ""moonths"" this way:""Moonth: The Russian expressaion ""mesiats iasen"" has two meanings: the moon is bright, and the month is clear. To signal this duality, and the importance of wordplays throughout the novel, ""moon"" and ""month"" are combined into one word here. Such a combination resembles similar constructions created by the narrator and, at the same time, indicates the derivation of the word ""month"" in many languages (including Russian and English) from the word ""mooon."" [p. 231]I think this is wholly misguided. It's bad reasoning: ""moonth"" sounds stupid (as if the narrator is stupid, which is partly the case), and it sounds a bit drunken. It doesn't conjure the philosophic and linguistic meanings Boguslawski thinks, especially because as Ilya's narrative goes on, there are no parallels to it. It is extremely difficult to translate dialect, because every choice of an un-grammatical or local usage will conjure a particular ethnicity, period, or place in a native reader's mind. A translator can't just pick and choose different usages assuming they all coalesce into a new pidgin or patois. If you're going to invent a way of speaking, it's necessary to be consistent, and to have a pitch-perfect ear, as in ""Clockwork Orange""; otherwise it's necessary to pick one ethnicity, time, or place, and just let it represent the speech in the original text. Chapters written by Ilya are, I think, absolutely unreadable:""Wherever they'd settle me, I didn't mind bein down and out, didn't seriously hanker after a family, and made ends meet by askin folks for help in proportion to their means and possibilities. About that I remain remorseful, havin chosen for this purpose a co-op of individuals named after A. Sharpenhauer."" [p. 1]This is typical in its obtrusive invented abbreviated word endings (always lacking apostrophes, even though they are conventional, and even though contractions and possessives retain apostrophes). Ilya is wildly inventive and imaginative, and has a large vocabulary (and sly references to all sorts of figures in history, including Schopenhauer), so his supposedly hokey grammar rings consistently false. I have no idea what Sokolov's original sounds like: but I can't believe it raises this sort of distracting problem.I should note that there's a more sympathetic take on the translation by Josh Billings, ""Monsters of Translation: On Arno Schmidt and Sasha Sokolov,"" Los Angeles Review of Books, December 26, 2016), although he also ends with misgivings:""whereas the inhabitants of Sokolov’s book can throw their language like a fishing line at the world and have it stick every time, the English reader of Between Dog and Wolf watches his own hook frequently bob up empty. This is especially true of the long sections written in verse, which swim past us meaning something (probably many things), but with an imperviousness that makes us understand why Sokolov’s book was considered untranslatable for so many years. It is not, of course — Boguslawski has proven this (and in two languages, no less: he spent 10 years producing a Polish version). And yet something essential eludes us, not because we can’t see it, but because it isn’t there. Where is it then? In the original? Presumably — although who knows.""4. The novel's place in historyThe comparison with ""Finnegans Wake"" is right in the sense that this book belongs in the 1920s and 1930s: it is a late-romantic, post-symbolist, first-generation modernist experiment in voices and language. It isn't securely postmodern, although it is in a sense post-Gombrowicz and post-Schmidt....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Jan 30, 2017","Jan 30, 2017",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/33095752-between-dog-wolf

(A Review for Writers)Why bother writing a book like this? That's what I asked myself as I read this, thinking not as a reader but as writer. I bought this book because s suggested it dealt with a number of themes I'm trying to manage in the novel I'm writing: an elderly narrator remembers his life imperfectly; the people he has known all say, in one way or another, that he has never understood them; he's shocked into semi-awareness of his state by a letter he'd written years ago and conveniently forgotten; there are meditations on whether life, and people, progress or remain static.The book is ""brilliant,"" in the loose way that word tends to be used in book ing. Barnes is master of English / British public school nuances. The characters are given to subtle counterfactuals, conditionals, the subjunctive, multiple qualifications, evasions, feints, and coynesses, and when they're forthright they immediately doubt themselves and the people to whom they're speaking. Ironies pile on misdirections and misunderstandings. I don't find that sort of thing entertaining -- in order to take pleasure in it, I think you'd have to see yourself in it -- but I do appreciate it. And yet the wrigglings of imperfect understanding seem to be there mostly for the fun of writing them, and only secondarily to support the narrative about the delusions of the main character.And the book is ""brilliant"" in its structure: it feels plotted in advance, like Ian McEwan's novels. I felt all the time as if a novel, for the author, is a project: one finds one's theme; one concocts a twisted, imbricated, temporally folded structure; one writes from the first page to the last. Needless to say that may not have been the process of writing, but it feels that way: like a professional job, well done. As if Barnes needs, for his English audience, to display a virtuosity parallel to that of a scientist or an engineer: each to his metier. But what sense does it make to write about a disastrous life, inadequately understood and minimally controlled, lived by a narrator who has to fumble his way to a minimal understanding of his relationships, in a form that presents itself as utterly professionally controlled?And there's a ""brilliant"" ending, which makes the book dramatic. But why go in for improbable plot twists (for example, an inherited diary that is only seen in the form of one ripped-put, photocopied page -- how often does that happen?) when the story is about everyone's utterly ordinary, nearly inevitable loss of control over memory and age? Why spice things up with puzzles and oddities? It's as if the story itself wouldn't be of interest if if didn't have Hollywood-style surprises. (There's even a website where someone attempts to figure out some of the book's complexities -- see the  on www.ratracerefuge.com.)My feeling, as a writer, is that this book is the product of a professional novelist, who feels he needs to produce books at reasonable intervals in order to keep his career going. But these subjects -- the loss of control over our own sense of ourselves, the sense that we invent our own histories, that we don't really know the people we love -- are so interesting and complex that there is little point in dressing them up as brilliant writing. ""The Sense of an Ending"" is larded with philosophical prose-poems, aphorisms, Wittgensteinian fragments, Stoic proposals: the author collects them like corals and gemstones. (I even read Frank Kermode's excellent ""Sense of an Ending"" in preparation for this book: there's no relation except for the desire to produce theory.) Any one page of this book could be twenty or a hundred pages, or simply another book, in the hands of writers more reflective than Barnes. Some of the ideas in the book are potentially seriously corrosive of sense and meaning: but the novel itself, in its brilliance, insists that they are ornaments to prose. In terms of the history of the novel, ""The Sense of an Ending"" adds nothing: not that every book can, and not that every author must try, but that if you aren't trying then you are producing entertainment. Barnes is ten years older than me: time to try to do something other than continue the traditions of the mid-twentieth century English fiction....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,not set,"Jan 27, 2017","Jan 27, 2017",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/10746542-the-sense-of-an-ending

(Oulipo was started the year this book was published, but Butor was not a member.) The book is pervaded with self-awareness: the narrator sets out to chronicle what is taught in every classroom of a Lycee, and the grammar, prosody, and structure of the novel follow his self-imposed task. On the face of it, that is compatible with Oulipean constraints, but there is no authorial self-awareness here (the author does not appear), only narrative self-awareness. The result of the obsessive and hopeless attempt at chronicling every student and every classroom is endless juxtapositions of fragments of dialogue, which are in effect surreal; but the narrator (and the implied author) take no special pleasure in the unpredictable and meaningless sequences of unrelated facts, the way a surrealist might.(At one point Butor's own voice leaks into the text, when the narrator says that just as it's impossible to represent the Earth on a map without distorting it, ""it is impossible to represent reality in speech without a certain kind of distortion."" That isn't something the narrator (a geography and history teacher) would normally be expected to say, and he then adds, in parentheses: ""(this latter, obviously, I didn't tell you in class, it's an idea that came to me as I was writing""). The ""me"" and ""I"" in that last clause are clearly the author, not the narrator. This is the sort of thing that Oulipeans would find obtrusive, because it breaks the fourth wall and in effect changes the novel's game: but it apparently didn't bother Butor. Maybe he thought he got away with it, that he didn't make his readers think of him.)Here is a sample, which also shows the layout, in which paragraphs break in the middle of sentences:"" I had just drawn a diagram on the board to explain the time zones, how it is midnight a the antipodes when it is noon in Paris, and it was when I turned around that I saw the furtive movement of that hand, of that arm hiding itself behind Michel Daval's shoulder, which itself was half concealed by that of Francis Hutter in the first row, who was looking at his book open to an illustration on this same subject, comparing his diagram with mine, making an obvious effort to understand, then looked at the face of the clock I was pointing at while explaining that an hour corresponded on the clock face to thirty degrees, but that if the twenty-four hours of the day were put there as sometimes happens, and not only half of them as is customary, then each one of them would occupy exactly fifteen degrees, like each of the zones on this great clock which is the earth. And during the English class, Alain Mouron went on examining this diagram that had remained on the blackboard, the circle representing the terrstrial equator, another, smaller circle underneath, then the sun surrounded by its beams, one of them longer than the rest, ending in an arrow with the word noon, and at the top the word midnight almost at the edge of the board. At his left, on the other side of the window, between two branches..."" [pp. 38-9]This sort of description, which leaps between subjects, times, and places, and keeps up a level of detail that continuously flaunts its boring endlessness, is at first like Perec's ""Life: A User's Manual"" or the opening of Robbe-Grillet's ""Jealousy."" But this isn't systematic, plotted encyclopedism like Perec's, or psychologicaly inflected myopic inspection as in Robbe-Grillet. It's the narrator's ""project,"" which he proposes as a gift to his nephew, who is also one of his students.Reading ""Degrees"" is like seeing poststructuralism just at the moment it was born, fitfully conscious for the first time. The book is calculated in the sense that it's plotted -- I imagine Butor may have had hundreds of cards, and perhaps a cork board pinned with notes -- but not in the sense that it believes expressiveness comes only from disruptions in the expected narrative.The narrator's attempt to list every student and every class in the eleventh grade doesn't work: naturally, because it would be many times the size of this book; but also unexpectedly, because the author is not fully in control of his own project. I will consider just three points: whether Butor expected readers to keep count of all the characters; what counted for him as a complete description; and how he describes the narrator's reasons for doing such an exhausting and unrewarding thing in the first place.1. How closely did Butor expect his readers to follow his narrative?In the first few pages it seems Butor toyed with the idea of what would soon become a sort of Oulipean extravagance: he makes nearly impossible demands on the reader's memory and attention. Here is part of a sentence whose subject is a student named Limours:"" Sitting in front of you, in the first row, Limours casually arranges on his desk his spiral-bound notebook... [skipping two lines] he too a pupil, this year, of one of his uncles, Monsieur Bailly, who at this moment is making his seniors on the floor above read Keats's sonnet ""On First Looking into Chapman's Homer"" (Chapman: 1559-1634): 'Then felt I like some watcher of the skies When a new planet swims into his ken; Or like stout Cortez.' (Cortez, or Cortes: 1485-1547), 'when with eagle eyes 'he star'd at the Pacific--and all his men Look'd at each other with a wild surmise-- Silent, upon a peak in Darien.' (Darien: southernmost part of the isthmus of Panama), a first cousin of both Monsieur Mouron, father of Alain Mouron who is in this class, and of Madame Daval, mother of Michel Daval sitting to your right, who is leaning over to ask you for a blotter, because his ink bottle, badly corked, has begun to leak all over his hands."" [p. 10]I tried at first to keep notes, and I think Butor expected that response. It is not clear to me when he thought his more diligent readers would give up taking notes, because there is no clear division between the resolute ot optimistic systematicity of the opening fifty or hundred pages and the hopeless systematicity in the book's final hundred and fifty pages, when the narrator is broken by his impossible task. In later constrained writing it can be clearer when a reader is expected to pay close attention, and when it's best just to be carried along by the flow of facts that cannot ever be tallied.2. Incomplete descriptionsThe narrator interrupts his chronicle a dozen or so times in order to tell us how exhausting it was, and to describe his purpose and update us on his progress. In one such passage he says his notes are ""a literal description, without any intervention on the part of my imagination, a simple account of precise facts..."" (p. 46). Note that ""literal"" doesn't mean ""complete,"" but it isn't clear what counts as adequate.I was repeatedly struck, in a way that I think Butor did not anticipate, by lapses in the supposedly complete descriptions. The game as we're given it in the first dozen pages is more or less this: we'll be told the names and families of every student and teacher in the Lycee, and we'll be given samples of what is said in every classroom. The passage I transcribed at the beginning is an example of the upper limit of detail: the diagram in question is conjured well enough so a reader can picture it. The second passage, with the quotations from Keats, is normative throughout the book: we're given couplets or single lines, just enough to conjure the subjects of each class. This brief kind of evocation is consonant with the narrator's purpose--he intends to give his nephew a mnemonic that he can read in later years.The problem is that Butor doesn't seem to have thought out exactly how these longer descriptions might work with the briefer ones. At one point the narrator draws a sextant on the board--and that's all we're told. We can't picture it, or imagine how he discussed it (p. 33). On the same page we get the commonplace about how the globe can't be projected onto a plane without distortion. Other times we get summaries of talking points:""(the various stone ages, the invention of pottery, the discovery of metals, all those tremendous obscure migrations...)"" [p. 36]Apparently Butor didn't want to put Greek letters into his book, but that decision doesn't make sense, because Greek is the subject of one of the classes. As a result students are sometimes said to write ""in Greek characters"" (p. 42). The narrator skips things he knows, but he also skips things other teachers say when he doesn't know their subjects. He quotes Italian, but little German, and he has almost no interest in the science or gym teachers. Only one or two passages have any math, and it is the simplest algebra, without context (p. 100).The result is a cross-section of the Lycee that is a portrait of the narrator's interests, exactly opposite to one of his stated purposes. (Later in the book there are two more narrators, but oddly their interests and expertises coincide with the principal narrator's.)3. What is the narrator's purpose?The account the narrator is building is therefore not ""complete,"" but ""literal."" He says at one point that he has tried ""to rely as much as possible on what I know with certainty"" (p. 46). He wants to avoid ""irremediable doubt"" (p. 67) and be ""serious"" (p. 55). So the project is about facts and about the possibility of avoiding ""imagination."" (Although later the narrator admits he has needed to make ""a great imaginative effort"" to write his book, p. 104.)It remains unclear why the narrator cares only for ""facts."" He notes that the families of students and teachers form three groups (p. 54): but why should he care about that? Why should just this collection of ""facts,"" some abbreviated, and other less so, some entirely absent, constitute an adequate description? He says that in order for his book to make sense to his nephew, it needs to be written ""in a certain order and according to certain forms and systems"" (p. 72). One of those ""systems,"" it turns out, is the ""system of triads"" (p. 101). But why should triads be a ""system,"" and why are ""systems"" necessary at all? There are other ""systems,"" and at one point the narrator ponders whether he'll have to adopt entirely different ones (pp. 101-2). But that doesn't explain the need for systematicity itself. The narrator says events and people have to be ""situated"": but why? And why is the complex, run-on grammar and kaleidoscopic temporality of the book an optimal sort of ""situating"" (p. 78)? The narrator says his book is to help his nephew ""realize what you yourself have been... where you come from, in other words where you are going,"" and in that sense ""Degrees"" is a compulsive biography in the line of Flaubert. At one point the narrator proposes a wider purpose for his book: ""I am writing up [these notes] in your behalf,"" he says, ""and in behalf of your classmates too, less directly, and--through you and them--in behalf of all those who were or will have been eleventh-grade students and even--I think I have to go this far--in behalf of everyone who has any relation with people who have gone through eleventh grade..."" [p. 87]This hardly makes sense. If he'd ended by saying ""in behalf of everyone who has tried to remember a day, or a year, of their life in full detail,"" that might have made sense. By implication he is also saying ""in behalf of myself, to keep myself sane."" As it stands this passage is anomalous, illogical (it contradicts the entire rest of the book, which is just for the nephew), and unconvincing. It is the book's most interesting line....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Jun 15, 2023","Jan 23, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/272021.Degrees

In fact, Wallace says, it's built like a Sierpinski gasket (more commonly called a Sierpinski triangle). As far as I know, no one has followed up on that; there's even a book out from Bloomsbury on form in Infinite Jest (2017) that devotes only half of one paragraph to Wallace's claim. I assume the structure is not legible in the published version because of the ""mercy cuts,"" as Wallace put it elsewhere, but the fundamental idea is very interesting: small things are blown up to large ones, and vice versa, and the structure is recursive, enclosing near-copies of structures within each other, potentially without end. That is one model for the structure of a long novel. I've looked, but I haven't found any studies of structures of the maximalist postwar novel, except David Letzler's interesting 2017 book ""The Cruft of Fiction"" (perhaps symptomatically, Letzler has left academia). Yet a study of large-scale form would be hlepful for anyone interested in understanding what counts as whole, coherent, or complete in works by Schmidt, Vollmann, Barth, Gaddis, and other long-form writers. (Barth is perhaps especially pertinent to Dixon, because the two of them ran the writing program at Johns Hopkins.) Stephen Dixon's Frog (1991) is interesting in this context, because it is fractal in a different sense than Infinite Jest. Dixon is a compulsive writer and publisher, and his vita looks like a tabulation of all the literary journals publishing in English in the last forty years. He's said somewhere that he had about 46 publications and half that many publishers, because he'd be dropped as soon as the second book failed to sell. Most of his output is short fiction, and a fair percentage of that is very short, nearly flash fiction. His novels, with Frog perhaps the most interesting, are studies in the aggregation of short forms into long ones. Frog is 769 pages long, and divided into 21 chapters. Most of those are short, on the order of 15 pages. ""Frog's Mom"" is a novella at 110 pages, and ""Frog Fragments"" a full-size novel at 220 pages. As William Ferguson says, ""It is as if the central character, Howard Tetch, represented several versions of what one man might be – a portrait that includes not only his physical attributes but the host of possibilities that swarm around his life like bees around a flower... The most startling of these stories is ""Frog Made Free,"" in which the four members of the Tetch family mysteriously find themselves in a cattle car on their way to a Nazi death camp. (Auschwitz's infamous motto, ""Arbeit Macht Frei,"" is ironically echoed in the title.) We know from other stories – or we think we know – that the Tetch family belongs not to the Holocaust years but to later decades, yet nothing in the text indicates that this episode is a nightmare from which Howard might conceivably awaken. Such a daring imposition of characters on the past recalls one of the fundamental aims of fiction: in the midst of particularities, to be in some way suprapersonal, historic, truer than any individual truth could be."" [William Ferguson, ""Which Version Do You Prefer?,"" New York Times, September 4, 1994.] Dixon's style is telegraphic, abbreviated, compulsive, informal, breathless, concise in grammar and excessive in the permission he gives himself to run on. The basic strategy of Frog is the entertainment of possible alternate stories and futures. In one chapter, the main character imagines what would happen if he went downstairs to investigate a noise; the chapter explores dozens of alternatives, one after another with no segues. In other chapters he thinks about his sister, his wife, and his brother, and their fates and paths through life. Even brief chapters ramify into dozens of stories, all plausible the moment they're told. Sometimes the truth of a death or an illness emerges as the chapter progresses, and in that case the multiple stories carry a heavy burden of pathos, as we're invited to think of the narrator's sad helpless rehearsal of alternate pasts. Other times the multiple possibilities aren't resolved, and readers get a less focused sense of the narrator's frantic mental state. Frog is nineteen entirely separable short stories, a novel, and a novella, under one cover. The nineteen short stories are mostly self-contained. Some are as tightly composed as his free-standing short stories. I think Dixon wrote his way toward ""Frog Fragments,"" because it contains echoes and repetitions of some earlier chapters; but most chapters are potentially independent. On the face of it, then, Frog isn't coherent, and in fact it's ostentatiously disunified. But the endlessly multiplied branching narratives in each chapter produce a fractal effect: the chapters divide into dozens or hundreds of parts, and they are in turn aggregated into the whole of Frog. Because the stories ramify, the ramified chapters are less incoherent. It's an interesting model for a large novel. Dixon himself has talked about the structure of his novels, but he has a perhaps unhelpfully laissez-faire way of thinking about form. About Frog, he said: ""I wrote the first draft of the first story (chapter?) in it in Prague – it's called ""Frog in Prague"" – and I finished it in Maine, summer, '85, and continued to write stories with Frog in it, and then the stories got longer and I had novella-length and novel-length stories, and that's how it was written. I never know how long a work is going to be when I start it, and I rarely know where it's going to go and what the structure of the work will be."" (Sean Carroll, interview in Bookslut, December 2010.) It's a separate question how well this works. Dixon has had an unusual number of negative s. According to Vince Pissarro, ""The run-on sentences, the rapid-fire but mundane stream of consciousness, the apparently frank but merely amphetamined dialogue that goes back and forth and back and forth within page after page of unbroken paragraphs that stretch as far as the eye can see: these devices are no longer energized by an author who has anything fresh to say... Exchanges like [that] are too easily achieved – too easily typed, even – and they're not challenging to the reader or to Dixon himself."" [Vince Passaro, ""S.A.S.E,"" New York Times, May 16, 1999.] But this kind of criticism is too simple, and so is the complaint – common on Amazon and Goodreads – about Dixon's formlessness and endlessness. His narrators are compulsive, and so is the implied author, who writes at speed. His signature style, which omits particles, verbs, punctuation, and prepositions, is a direct effect of his frantic frame of mind: Write! Think! Publish! Don't stop! And when that frame of mind is applied to the dissolution of memories, as it is in Frog, the result can be intensely expressive. It has the irritability of some Alzheimer's patients, and the everyday anxiety of any middle-aged person trying to make sense of her unraveling life....more",Notes are private!,0,24,1,not set,"Jan 11, 2017","Jan 11, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/132298.Frog

In the clearest cases, the constraint is simple and known to the reader, as in the Oulipean lipogram. In other instances, the constraints are multiple or private, and they lead the reader to puzzle over the text, deducing its departures from some normative path.Since so much experimental writing is constrained in some way, it's interesting to ask what happens when the writing fails to follow its own rules. Alejandro Zambra's ""Multiple Choice"" is a good example. In a note at the end of the novel, Zambra says he modeled it on the Chilean Academic Verbal Aptitude Test for 1993, which was clearly modeled on North American scholastic aptitude tests from the 1950s onward. In translation, the book presents itself as a reasonable facsimile of the SAT I took years ago.The novel starts with a half-title page: ""I. Excluded TermIn exercises 1 through 24, mark the answer that corresponds to the word whose meaning has no relation to either the heading or the other words listed.""The next page begins:""1. MULTIPLEA) manifoldB) numerousC) untoldD) fiveE) two""Except for the playful similarity of D) and E), this question is fairly standard. I began, for fun, with a pencil, marking my text as I went. (The final page of the novel is the answer sheet, with the open circles meant to be filled in with those soft pencils they used to distribute.)The first sign that there won't always be right answers is on p. 5:""8. BEARA) endureB) tolerateC) abideD) pandaE) kangaroo""This is, I thought, too obvious a marker that the novel won't be answerable, because it plays too simple-mindedly on the two meanings of ""bear."" On the next page there is this:""10. COPYA) cutB) pasteC) cutD) pasteE) undo""This has a correct answer, by the test's logic, but the first four choices make it obvious that something else is at stake. Since this is a novel, I concluder Zambra wants readers to assume that he is introducing a metanarrative here: the narrator's voice will appear in this novel in the form of playful interventions within the aptitude test form itself. This strategy develops for several pages.But soon another kind of question appears:""16. PROTECTA) care forB) cover forC) dote onD) watch overE) book after.""Again there is a correct answer (B), but it points in a different direction: it feels like ""Multiple Choice"" is going to have a plot, and it's going to turn on betrayal, care, or fidelity. Let me call the first kind of metanarrative question, the one in question #10, ""Playing with texts"" (PWT). This second sort of question could be called ""Playing with plots"" (PWP). A third sort of question seems to speak for the narrator's mood:""21. SPAREA) timeB) roomC) changeD) tireE) life.""Let me call this one ""Playing with existentialism"" (PWE). There are questions of this sort throughout, which use surprise choices to convey a sense of existential randomness or general blackness. Part one of the book's five parts ends with several more PWP questions, in which loyalty and fidelity are again at stake.A reader can use these three kinds of questions to go most of the way through the book. Here is one more example, from Part two, where you're supposed to pick the best order of the sentences:""27. A CHILD1. You dream that you lose a child.2. You wake up.3. You cry.4. You lose a child.5. You cry.A) 1-2-4-3-5B) 1-2-3-5-4C) 2-3-4-5-1D) 3-4-5-1-2E) 4-5-3-1-2""There is no reason to work at this one as a test-taker has to, because it is an example of PWP and PWE. Once questions like this begin to appear, readers like me who were trying to see how far they'd get pretending they were students may put their pencils down. Questions like these are signs to the reader that they don't need to think like students. But what, exactly, does the achievement-test form contribute once a reader stops searching for optimal answers?The book's title suggests that readers should think of life's multiple choices, but only a small percentage of the questions in the book actually lead to branching narratives. Perhaps, then, it matters that the novel is a test, because several stories in the book -- the stories get longer as the book goes on -- have to do with cheating. But I think cheating is only a convenient theme, not the book's central concern, which is more like regret and reconciliation. What, then, is contributed by questions that do not ask to be read as questions? Let me call questions like the one I just quoted ""No reason to play"" (NRP). They become the predominant sort of question, and it reaches the point where the final ten or twenty questions in the book are just pastiches of actual achievement test sorts of questions, and add very little to what is already apparent in the texts themselves.In short -- and I am abbreviating an entire book full of my notes -- PWT becomes PWE and PWP as readers begin to care more about nascent plots and narrator's concerns than with the test, and finally the test form itself becomes a superficial style, because there's No reason to play, NRP. About halfway through, I noticed that it seemed Zambra was dividing his time between thinking up entertaining new forms of questions and answers (PWT) and hinting at the narrator's life. The two purposes divided: the constrained writing began to be a constraint, or at least an irrelevance, to the author's interest in constructing stories about his narrator's life. The jokes got more obvious, there were more uninteresting choices, and even some false notes (as when the ""fucking voice faker"" suddenly appears, p. 52).The novel doesn't fail because it fails to follow its constraints. (It does follow them, all the way to the last page.) It fails because the narrator, and by implication the author, becomes interested in things that do not require the constraints. And as I watch the implied author's attention divide in that way, between the increasingly superficial game of the test and the increasingly compelling stories of the narrator's failures, I find myself losing interest in the book, because the glue between those is what makes constrained writing work -- at least in this case. ...more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Jan 09, 2017","Jan 09, 2017",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28588315-multiple-choice

Technically, that isn't right, because the novella is actually a string of run-on sentences, with ordinary sentences embedded in them. Grammatically correct long sentences are rare in fiction. (See the remarks on Enard's ""The Zone."") This form is looser and, I think, less interesting than a single long sentence (as in Raymond Roussel's ""New Impressions of Africa"") or a genuine analocuthon (as in late Thomas Bernhard). In the novella, a philosopher sits at a bar and recounts a trip he made to Extremadura, Spain, and to Alburquerque, the near-namesake of the city in New Mexico. The philosopher was invited to Spain in order to write about anything he might choose, and he ends up investigating the shootings of the last eight wolves in the region, in the 1980s and 1990s. He is given an unlimited budget and a translator, and he's driven around so he can interview people. All along he keeps saying, to the bartender, that he has said everything he can, that his thinking life is over, that even accepting the invitation was a sham, that he cannot write anything. In the end the killings of the last two wolves coincide with the end of his story, and -- as a reader will have surmised from the first couple of pages -- he ends up back in the bar, without having written anything.It's all a common literary conceit: the unwritten text, the unspoken account, actually told, but not to an attentive hearer, or one who will retell the story, or write it down. (The bartender is represented, implausibly, as sometimes falling asleep.) The last of the wolves is the last of his thoughts; his wandering in Extremadura is his meandering mind made real, and so forth.The story is simply not ambitious enough. If Krasznahorkai had more energy or commitment, he would have explained why it isn't a paradox that the philosopher actually has told a story, and in fact it's the story we're reading. The philosopher didn't write it down, but the author did. How, in the logic of the novella, does a person supposedly at the end of this thinking life manage to write -- really, to toss off -- a seventy-page novella? Of course there are thoughts in his head: we know, because we read them page after page. To make this more ambitious, more consistent, and more challenging, Krasznahorkai could have written out the philosopher's incapacity on the page, showing us what it was like for the to be unable to think. The philosopher chooses to investigate the killing of the wolves because he remembers reading something about it, and in fact he made a note of it. That is interesting, but it isn't explained: but in a deeper version of this story, we could be told that he is perplexed by his choice of that article, and curious about his own interests and motives in finding it. That could be a sign of his ongoing inability to sort out his own motivations and thoughts. And while he is on the pursuit, he could do more than simply record what he sees and hears: he could wonder if he is being coherent in his intentions, or faithful to whatever remnants of intentions he may have. By his own account, after all he can no longer think philosophically: but we're never told what that means, exactly, and what could it mean other than an incapacity for rational thought? And how could such an incapacity not vex or even torture the person who thinks he suffers from it? And how could he not wonder, at every moment, what he is understanding and what he isn't?""The Last Wolf"" is unambitious because it makes a very big claim about its narrator's incapacity: a claim that should not just exhaust him, as it does, but either perplex him -- given his apparent ability to continue to think and reason -- or paralyze him with doubt and fear -- given the apparently irrational nature of his investigation. A better model is Beckett's ""Ill Seen Ill Said,"" where there's a claim about the narrator's incapacity, and it corrodes and infects the entire fabric of representation. Here it's just a claim, and the narrator goes on reasonably happily with his life, ""incapacitated"" only by an unaccountable inability to notice that by telling the bartender everything he has, in fact, written the story he claims he couldn't write....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Nov 22, 2016","Nov 22, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/29082608-the-last-wolf-herman

They usually ask to be read as snatches of overheard dialogue. The book is therefore a puzzle in reading, and a reader needs to find a strategy of reading that will make sense of the whole, or of Eaves's idea of fragmentation. Here are three strategies of reading, each one of which, I think, doesn't work and has to be partly or wholly set aside as the reading progresses. In the end, I think the book raises interesting questions about what counts as a fragment, either at the scale of a page-long portion of text, or at the scale of the book itself.1. The short sections actually tie together, and the book is an elaborate puzzle.Nicholas Lezard, in ""The Guardian,"" said ""for a while I thought I was going to have to keep track"" of the voices, ""that there was an underlying order making this a very complex work indeed... but after a while I decided, as I suspect you will, to sit back and let it all wash over me instead"" (Feb. 11, 2014). I did the same, but after about 30 pages (a quarter of the book) I realized I wasn't usually supposed to be identifying individual voices. But Eaves puts in several teases -- recurring contexts, recurring names -- so it takes a while before a reader can be reasonably sure this is not a puzzle on the order of Jennifer Egan's ""A Visit from the Goon Squad."" It isn't clear why Eaves doesn't make it obvious whether or not this is a puzzle: some sections do connect, some speakers do repeat, so the invitation to read carefully and figure out the connections is itself repeated, until the reader finally sees that it isn't necessary. I do not understand that decision, unless he wanted simply to tease and distract his readers: an interest that does not fit well with the book's content.2. The book proposes something about the disconnection and fragmentation of modern life.Once it's clear that the book is not merely interwoven stories, or rather that few of them are interwoven, and that the book isn't a single plot entangled in separate sections, the question becomes the resonance or disparity between the sections. Is this, then, a book more about dissociation, about the alienation of speakers from one another? Is it an Oulipean effort to describe a single place or time? Or possibly just the remnants of other projects that might have cohered? For me, these sorts of questions began to predominate around the halfway mark, because I was thinking more of the assembly of disparate sections than of the connections between sections. The problem with this reading, for me, is that it makes the book trivial: there is no special accomplishment in demonstrating the disconnection of life by presenting disconnected pieces of it.3. The book is a cross-section of contemporary society.A third possibility is that the book is an ethnographic or social commentary, and that Eaves's choice of topics for his speakers is itself the central point of the book. A fair amount of ""The Absent Therapist"" is about the condition of modern society: it has lots of politics, and an entire chapter (one-fifth of the book) on the US; there are also ruminations on inequality, artificial intelligence, and other scientific and philosophic topics. The book's title also points that way. Yet the book can't be mainly an attempt at a snapshot of contemporary life, because many sections are about people's private lives, misunderstandings, arguments, and the stuff of everyday conversation.4. The sections themselves.What I'm left with is a meditation on the sections themselves, their unity or lack of it, their differences and resonances. What matters, in the end, is how Eaves thinks of the idea of the excerpt, the section, the fragment. The plurality of sections in this book -- there are on the order of 150 of them, more than one per page -- are self-contained, polished short stories, more like flash fiction or prose poems than fragments of overheard dialogue. Very few of them end unexpectedly, as overheard conversations tend to do. Most, and especially the longer ones, give the impression of being very carefully and patiently crafted so they could work as free-standing microfiction. One example will have to do. Here is a section, in full, from p. 108:""There were once two contestants in the final of a TV game show and the winner sportingly shared his prize with the runner-up -- a dramatic gesture the audience loved. I happened to know the winner's boyfriend, who watched events unfold at home with mounting horror. He was in debt and could have done with more of that money. He didn't dispute the winner's right to do with it as he pleased. He just couldn't imagine behaving like that himself. They had a row. It wasn't the money that split them. It was something the boyfriend let slip, in his cups, about the winner's start in life, which the winner didn't much like.""There are eight sentences here. Every one reverses or surprises. The last one has a surprise (""the winner's start in life"") which is itself modified by the qualifier ""much."" The paragraph compresses as many nuances, changes of tack, and subtleties as it can. It is very carefully and skilfully done, and so are many, or most, of the sections in this book.But that brings me to the point: why write a book of disconnected parts, when each one of those parts is itself a model of coherence and unity? It would have been more consistent if the sections were actually fragments, or else parts of an incomplete whole, as in Perec's ""Attempt at Exhausting a Place in Paris."" Eaves's book implies that the world is disconnected, disharmonious, and fragmentary, but that harmony and even unity exist in small units everywhere. It is, I think, too easy an idea. If the world is disconnected, either in the way it appears here, then individual moments of it can probably not be imagined as lapidary, aesthetically pleasing objects. (I prefer Markson's ""Wittgenstein's Mistress"" as a model of a world in fragments.) Another way to put this would be to say Eaves's book does not have fragments, in the Romantic sense (from Novalis), but unities.(The opposite of this book would be an enormous novel in which the individual scenes are seldom complete or unified, things unravel, events and characters and ideas become vertiginously complex and fragmentary, and yet the prose continues uninterrupted: something like ""Infinite Jest."")...more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,"Nov 15, 2016","Nov 15, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/20797992-the-absent-therapist

The opening pages are bound to be surprising, because there is not yet enough text to judge what she's up to. It works, as several of the hundreds of ers on Goodreads have noted, in the passage on anal sex, because it's unusual to see that subject treated to so many changes of viewpoint (pp. 7-8). But it does not work for the majority of the book. Like any author, Zink has a limited repertoire of strategies for producing unexpected turns of voice, mood, and image. Her commonest strategy is to write a few sentences with a more or less consistent viewpoint, and then draw a conclusion that is unexpectedly skewed. For example this passage, which follows on the death of the narrator's pet bird Rudi:""When Rudi died, Stephen stopped raising his eyes above the horizontal. He stopped going out at night or to the marsh [for bird watching]. He read every word of the newspaper, offering lengthy, cogent commentary on the financial news as if he had been asked to join the president's council of economic advisers. He enlightened me on the relations between oil-producing and -consuming states as if he were grooming me for a position on his staff. His personal interests were subrogated to those of the mass media, and he began to seem like a nearly normal person."" [p. 45]Note that the third and fourth sentences are structurally similar to one another. In Zink's prose, whenever two or more sentences reinforce one another, it's a setup. The end of the last sentence I've quoted here is the kind of reversal that would serve as a satisfying end to a chapter in a novel by, say, Henry James (especially given the Jamesian nuance ""nearly""). But Zink's sense of surprise demands successive reversals. The next sentences (there is no paragraph break) are:""He stopped shaking. He never got excited. When he went to bed his face turned into a slack, unhappy mask and he never looked at me before he closed his eyes.""So the narrator's newly politicized and oddly bureaucratically minded husband turns out to be unhappy, listless, and unaffectionate. At this point the reader is being asked to hope the narrator can cure her husband of his strange mourning over the dead bird: perhaps, it's implied, she can revive his interest in her. Then Zink provides another turn:""Stephen's grief humanized him. I began to fall in love.""This kind of double or triple surprise could function well if it were used once or twice in a novel, but it is one of Zink's principal strategies for keeping the reader's attention. Viewpoints and conclusions shift with a regularity that sometimes makes them into tics, turning a reader's thoughts to the author instead of the narrator. An even simpler strategy for holding the apparently easily bored reader's attention is changing subjects, images, and viewpoints as rapidly as possible. In this passage the narrator is looking out at Berne, Switzerland:""Berne lived turned in on itself. But it wasn't self-sufficient; it was more like a tumor with blood vessels to supply everything it needed: capital, expats, immigrants, stone, cement, paper, ink, clay, paint. No, not a tumor. A flower with roots stretching to the horizon, sucking in nutrients, but not just a single flower: a bed of mixed perennials. A flower meadow where butterflies could lay eggs and die in peace, knowing their caterpillars would not be ground to pulp by the flowers. Continuity of an aesthetic that had become an aesthetic of continuity. That was Berne. I leaned against the city wall and Elvis kissed me..."" [pp. 17-18]First Berne is compared to a tumor, but the simile overspills itself, ending as a list of things that aren't related to the image. But that doesn't matter because the narrator cancels the metaphor, and tries the image of a flower; but in the next sentence that metaphor metastasizes into a meadow. Then comes the lovely but empty abstraction about aesthetics (how is it related to the flower metaphor?), and a blank assertion of the image's veracity (""That was Berne."").It's always possible to argue that kaleidoscopic writing like this expresses the narrator's state of mind, but that is inevitably the case. The question is whether or not the author is in possession of other kinds of writing she can use to express other feelings, other situations.I wouldn't argue that every novel needs to have a variety of paces (Bernhard and Beckett would be ready counterexamples), or that it is never a good idea to try to keep the reader's attention at every moment, line by line and image by image. Examples of books that do just that include, for me, the Joyce of Finnegans Wake; most of Mark Leyner; and much of Georges Perec. But Joyce also orchestrates changes in tone, voice, mood, and affect in different sections of the book; Leyner's anxiety about losing his reader's attention is his theme, fully acknowledged and made both ironic and pathetic; and Perec's strangeness is the result of self-imposed constraints, which themselves become objects of interest.Here there is only the relentless drive to produce entertaining turns of phrase, striking images, clever tropes, and surprising reversals at all times, on every page and in every paragraph, with as little filler as possible, for the entire duration of the novel.

The full version is on Library thing, at www.librarything.com/work/23165847/re.... I will post updates and corrections there.]I have just become one of only a few people, I think, who have read all four volumes of Nabokov's translation and notes on Pushkin's Eugene Onegin. Nabokov's edition has been notorious from the moment it appeared in 1964, both because it provides 1,200 pages of commentary for a slim 220 page novel, and because Nabokov insists on translating with literal fidelity, even when the results are awkward, archaic, or otherwise arguably unpoetic.I read these four volumes as attentively as possible given that I don't know Russian. That means I didn't read the Russian facsimile of Pushkin's poem that is reproduced in vol. 4, and I skipped the few untranslated transliterations. But I read Nabokov's glosses on alliteration, his systems of transliteration, his 80-page study of Pushkin's Abyssinian ancestor, and even the quixotic 100-page ""Notes on Prosody."" I did all this because I'm interested in footnotes, and especially in excessive footnotes. (Next I hope to read Pierre Bayle's Dictionary in its entirety.) Nabokov's practice in regard to footnotes is usually associated with Pale Fire, and there are also footnotes in his entomological publications, which have been collected and reprinted. But the notes in those texts can't compare with the outlandish and apparently endlessly compulsive footnotes in his four-volume edition of Eugene Onegin. I remark on several topics here, and afterward I draw a general conclusion with the help of Edmund Wilson's .What counts as boredom? When are explanations complete?It is interesting to contemplate what counted as boring for a person willing to spend thousands of hours in libraries and in correspondence (this was well before the internet), assembling 1,200 pages of footnotes. At one point he says ""the boredom of reading through the English, German, Polish, etc., translations... was too great even to be contemplated"" (vol. 2, p. 102), but he did read the other translations, and he often compares them to his own.Did he think of his activity as perverse? Possibly, at times. For example, he compiles every mention of the river that runs through Onegin's estate; it takes him four pages. At the end he notes that Pushkin ""took a perverse pleasure, it would seem, in finding various elegant Russian versions"" of the 'eaux-et-forets' cliche"" (vol. 2, p. 203). A line later we're told ""it would be pedantic to list the innumerable examples of this 'shady wood-murmuring brook' symbiosis in western European poetry."" Fair enough, but also unbelievable enough, after four pages inventorying Pushkin's brook, followed by the insinuation that Pushkin was ""perverse"" where he, Nabokov, wasn't. There are a number of other such lists in the commentary; they are seldom dry and therefore boring, though of course some are, like the bare list of allusions to winter (vol. 2, p. 473). Overall there are remarkably few typically bibliophilic indulgences, like his complaint that a catalog of arms, issued by the Bulletin of the Public Museums of Milwaukee in 1928, misspells the name of a pistol manufacturer (vol. 3, p. 39).Edmund Wilson thinks Nabokov's Eugene Onegin shows ""the Nabokov who bores and fatigues by overaccumulation,"" which ""contrasts with the authentic Nabokov and with the poet he is trying to illuminate."" But are they so different, or different at all? And is ""boring"" right here? (""Fatiguing,"" maybe.) Nabokov also warns himself against becoming ""didactic"" like some commentators, and he praises ""professional matters"" (vol. 1, p. 48). All those terms could benefit from a closer reading. In short: boredom, adequacy, didacticism, fatigue, and professionalism are all potentially intriguing traits. I find the 1,200 pages as interesting and energizing, in their different way, as 1,200 pages assembled from Pale Fire, Lolita, Pnin, and whatever other books would have to be strapped together to comprise an equivalent bulk.PrecisionThere is also the trademark precision of observation, especially when it comes to flashing lights. Of the ""rainbows"" cast on snow by the light of horsedrawn coaches (One : XXVII : 9, in Nabokov's numbering of Eugene Onegin) he remarks: ""My own fifty-year-old remembrance is not so much of prismatic colors cast upon snowdrifts by the two lateral lanterns of a brougham as of iridescent spicules around blurry street lights coming through its frost-foliated windows and breaking along the rim of the glass"" (vol. 2, p. 110). Notice he is correcting Pushkin: the rainbows don't form on the snow, you see them through the coaches' windows; and they aren't rainbows, they're ""spicules""; and note, Pushkin, that they break up along the rims of the glass--a detail you might have remembered, and which would have prompted you to be a bit more accurate.HistoriographyScattered in these 1,200 pages is a wonderful essay on romanticism and neoclassicism, worthy of Arthur Lovejoy. Nabokov is good on passions (vol. 2, p. 256), and the ""achromatic detail"" of eighteenth-century nature poetry (vol. 2, p. 286), and there is a self-contained essay on the eleven (!) kinds of romanticism Pushkin would have recognized (vol. 3, pp. 32-37).CriticismReviewers have noted that Nabokov tends often to give his own opinions about sources, even if they're not important or well-known authors, and even if Pushkin's opinion of them may have been quite different. ""There are readers,"" he says, ""who prefer Pushkin's Scene from Faust (1825) to the whole of Goethe's Faust, in which they distinguish a queer strain of triviality impairing the pounding of its profundities"" (vol. 2, pp. 235-36). Rousseau's ""Julie"" was ""total trash,"" and his mind was ""morbid, intricate, and at the same time rather naive"" (vol. 2, pp. 339-40). Virgil was ""overrated,"" and his Eclogues are ""stale imitations of the idyls of Theocritus"" (vol. 2, p. 322). (Hard to disagree with that, but I'm not out to add my own prejudices to Nabokov's.) He prefers Leibniz to Voltaire (vol. 3, p. 30), and he often calls Chateaubriand a writer ""of genius""; he also likes Senancour, and seems consistently irritated by Rousseau.Not all these are one liners. There is for example a trenchant, even poignant, two-page long assessment of the poet Evgeniy Baratinski. Nabokov thinks he is a case of a poet suspended between minor and major. ""His elegies are keyed to the precise point where the languor of the heart and the pang of thought meet in a would-be burst of music; but a remote door seems to shut quietly, the poem ceases to vibrate (though its words may still linger) at the precise moment that we are about to surrender to it"" (vol. 2, p. 380). There is also a wonderful three-page biography of a critic named Vilgelm Kuechelbeker (vol. 2, pp. 445-48).It's fascinating how little Nabokov praises Eugene Onegin: maybe a half-dozen times, but certainly less than the number of times he criticizes passages and entire chapters. Part of the reason is that what Nabokov treasures most is exactly what he cannot ever explain satisfactorily: ""the only Russian element of importance,"" which is ""Pushkin's language, undulating and flashing through verse melodies the likes of which had never been known before"" (vol. 1, pp. 7-8). This passage is the crucial ending of his brief ""Description of the Text,"" and it ends with the motto: ""there is no delight without the detail"": there are 1,200 pages of delight here, but none is total, because none is entirely in Russian.As Wilson says in his , Nabokov expends a lot of energy thinking about how Pushkin composed his novel in verse; Nabokov often mentions evidence that Pushkin hadn't made up his mind, at a given point, where he might go. In all this, Nabokov's concern is the accomplishment of the whole novel, which has coherence, unity, and symmetry: it's an unusual way of writing about art, and one of the book's most memorable contributions. It's of a piece with Nabokov's admiration for the way Pushkin puts himself into the poem, along with some of his real-life friends, and even has his (real) friends entertain his fictional ones, all without breaking the poem's fabric. But none of this is my subject here. (See, for example, vol. 1, pp. 15-16, 19; for an ""admission."" p. 44.)A last note on criticism: there are just a few, very subtle and evanescent, moments in which Nabokov acknowledges, implies, or can be read as admitting, that Pushkin is the greater artist. One of the most curious, because it's indirect, is the notes on the crucial scene in which Onegin kills Lenski in a duel. The first image we get of Lenski falling compares him to a snowball rolling down a slope. Nabokov patiently shows this is a cliche, not invented by Pushkin (vol. 3, p. 52). But then he goes on to say that the list of metaphors that then follows (Six : XXXI : 10-14) is an intentional parody of Lenski's poetic style: this seems improbable, simply because it would be so distracting if readers were to think of it. But it makes perverse sense as Nabokov's sincere attempt to defend his poet against more, and worse, cliches. And then--as if that wasn't enough--Nabokov claims Pushkin's final description of Lenski dead, as an empty house (One: XXII : 9) is showing off against Lenski's poetry! I'd like to read these two pages of commentary in a Bloomian way--as the agon of one writer against another, always thinking of writing--except that I think Nabokov probably experienced these pages as the most sincere flattery of a superior artist.Wilson's Edmund Wilson's , in the New York Review of Books, must count as one of the world's best book s (July 15, 1965). It is as clever as Gore Vidal in its tail-biting insincere self-deprecation, mingled with genuine friendship. And it is fearless: Wilson corrects Nabokov on his knowledge of his own language. But the  isn't just myopic philology. Midway through, Wilson makes a single devastating point: Wilson says Nabokov didn't understand the character Onegin:""Mr. Nabokov’s most serious failure, however—to try to get all my negatives out of the way—is one of interpretation. He has missed a fundamental point in the central situation. He finds himself unable to account for Evgeni Onegin’s behavior in first giving offense to Lensky by flirting with Olga at the ball and then, when Lensky challenges him to a duel, instead of managing a reconciliation, not merely accepting the challenge, but deliberately shooting first and to kill. Nabokov says that the latter act is 'quite out of character.' He does not seem to be aware that Onegin, among his other qualities, is, in his translator’s favorite one ­syllable adjective, decidedly злой—that is, nasty, méchant.""I think this is exactly right, and it is a masterstroke to place it in the middle of a generally quibbly . Because I had never read Eugene Onegin before, I was the ideal reader of this passage; when I read the , I had just finished Nabokov's four volumes, and suddenly several dozen of Nabokov's comments fell into place. He just couldn't see that part of Onegin's character. Here is an example, from many, of the kind of gloss that shows this lack. Nabokov is commenting on the word ""inconsistencies,"" from One : LX : 6, in which Pushkin closes his first chapter by acknowledging ""inconsistencies"" in Onegin's character. Nabokov:""Hardly an allusion to chronological flaws; perhaps a reference to Onegin's dual nature--dry and romantic, chilly and ardent, superficial and penetrating"" (vol. 2, p. 215; for other misunderstandings see vol. 3, p. 16, vol. 3, p. 62, and also vol. 3, p. 40).This just isn't quite enough, and Wilson's comment throws it into strong relief.Sadly, Nabokov's reply, and Wilson's reply to him, are uncharacteristic, petty, and uninteresting (New York Review of Books, August 26, 1965). But the two squabbled throughout their friendship, and there is a very catty passage in the commentary in which Nabokov reproduces a translation of Wilson's, which he says is ""good,"" but lards it with italicized words, which he calls ""a few minor inexactitudes"" (vol. 2, p. 474). It's not the squabbling that makes Wilson's  so excellent, it's the balance between scrapping and large-scale assessments, not least his verdict that Nabokov's Eugene Onegin is of a piece with everything else of Nabokov's after his exile. It expresses ""the situation, comic and pathetic, full of embarrassment and misunderstanding of the exile who cannot return, and one aspect of this is the case of the man who, like Nabokov, is torn between the culture he has left behind and that to which he is trying to adapt himself."" Nabokov sees Pushkin from a distance, and that must be especially painful. It drives--that's the implication--even the most extreme performances of compulsive research. Even 1,200 pages of commentary, in all its microscopic kaleidoscopic telescopic excess, is not enough to convey the pathos of perpetual dislocation....more",Notes are private!,0,23,1,not set,"Sep 19, 2016","Sep 19, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/797342.Eugene_Onegin

A Different Model of How to Attach Politics to LiteratureLike others of Bolano's books, Night in Chile is a concerted fusion of two worlds: the society of writers and poets (their parties, their conversations, their lifestyles), and the society of political control (in this case Pinochet's generals and his repressive regime). The narrator in Night in Chile is haunted by his complicity: he actually tutored Pinochet in Marx, and he went to parties at houses in which, as he later learned, people were being tortured and killed.What's interesting here, for me, is how easy it is to imagine either of these by itself. Bolano is always full of anecdotes about writers--this novel could have been a memoir--and he can fill literally hundreds of pages with the names of Latin American writers and poets. In this novel there are just two scenes in which politics intersects the narrator's life, but they're enough to suggest a separate novel--a thriller--in which the narrator is not a writer, but still has the same experiences. This is not the most common way to put politics into fiction, and it feels at once utterly committed and wholly artificial. As if the commitment to write was a promise to write politics and literature, but the impetus to write was to immerse readers in the author's literary world. 2. What it Means to Write a Novel After Novels Have EndedBolano's books are written in continuous narratives streams, which change direction unexpectedly. His stories are capacious enough to welcome any number of inclusions, asides, and diversions. Sometimes complete short stories are embedded in narratives; other times stories break off suddenly, as if the narrator forgot them or the author hadn't decided where they might go. By Night in Chile is 130 pages long and has only two paragraphs, one of which is a single line. 2666 has several novellas, some page-long stories, some series and sequences, and a number of repeated motifs, and yet it doesn't have a comprehensible overall structure like, say, Ulysses or even Gravity's Rainbow. I'm aware of four explanations for this:1. Some people who praise Bolano tend to say that his intentionally collagist narratives are designed that way to match his subjects. Discursive, wandering, associative writing, so the argument goes, is artful, and is only designed to appear improvised or insouciant about form. I'm not convinced of that (as I wrote about ""2666"" on Goodreads).2. There is another argument that Bolano's books best imagined as counterfeits of stream of consciousness, but again this seems insufficient: not just because not all his narratives represent people thinking or speaking, but because his novels all have plots, with beginnings, endings, discrete episodes, flashbacks, and all the apparatus of fiction.3. A third argument, especially in relation to 2666, is that the book was finished in haste. That may be partly true, but it would not explain Bolano's other books.4. I'd like to try to articulate another kind of explanation. Here's how I ended a brief  of ""Amulet"" on Goodreads: The authorial voice, and in this case also the narrator's voice, are presented as if they are talking. It's as if this is what happens in a writer's mind when he or she is contemplating the craft and social world of novel writing, before it's time to settle down and write. This would explain an odd effect in Bolano: when you encounter a passage that is beautifully written, it seems somehow out of place, as if it's something that should only happen in the novels that Bolano's characters are forever discussing. Or to put it another way: it is as if novel writing is no longer possible, and the only way forward for the novel is rumination about the novel. (The full context here is here.]My  sparked a short but interesting discussion about Bolano's style. A reader named Milo commented ""I like to think of Bolano's work as a kind of fulfillment of what Borges talks about in one of his introductions: 'the madness of composing vast books, of setting out in 500 pages an idea that can be perfectly related orally in five minutes. The better way to go about it is to pretend that those books already exist, and offer a summary, a commentary on them.'""I like the idea that Bolano's fiction is extended commentary on fiction -- which, in the telling, often comes so close to the fiction itself that it's indistinguishable, because a rehearsal has to be as close to the performance as possible. For me this goes with the idea that Bolano writes with an imagined speaking voice, not a writing voice: it's a monologue, sometimes inner, sometimes as if spoken, about literature.But then comes a difficult point. I still think 2666 and other fictions are loosely assembled. Am I to accept all such looseness as an effect of the rehearsal, or of the speaking voice? At what point can I hold the author accountable for the form of the book? How can I not find myself thinking: is every sudden transition or overly long passage or unnoticed resonance expressive? Aren't there passages that could benefit from closer attention, even in an author who writes as he speaks, and thinks as he writes? Or, on the other hand: aren't there passages where a writerly style, apparently produced without the idea of transcribing thought or speech, feels obtrusive?When I posted this on Facebook, I got an interesting response from Fernando Velasquez Pomar. He pointed out that a broken, apparently sometimes careless, almost-spoken style ""is precisely the point with the priest/critic, an extremely artificial person whose thoughts come as half-written and, in the end, ponderous."" This is an excellent point, and the narrator is also feeling guilty, or at least cloudily complicit. But I'd still wonder why the same way of writing fits very different narrators, for example in ""2666.""Bolano's prose is very much like a representation of thinking about writing, or pondering writing about novels and poetry. There is a tension, never acknowledged but always present, between the structured narratives that provide the novels' framework, and the wandering thoughts of the narrators. It wasn't possible for Bolano to write about this in the novels, because they are examples of what happens when a person cannot (will not) produce the narrative itself, but only the idea of it....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Aug 29, 2016","Aug 29, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/63031.By_Night_in_Chile

Reviewers routinely remark on the differences between it and her earlier, more experimental novels. What matters, I think, is what it reveals about the psychology of the narrators in the other books: their forms of attention and their preferred subjects. Those traits are hers aside from her concerns with linguistics or the postmodern novel (as in Thru), and also aside from the chosen subjects and narratives of those earlier books.Brooke-Rose's narrator (at first implicitly, later more carelessly and openly, the author herself) is full of the concerns that can be found in other books written during the authors' last years. She complains, as Gaddis, Howard Brodkey, and many others have, about the specifics of her medical condition, her burning feet, her fluctuating blood pressure, her strategies for keeping her balance. Not all of this is specific to this book: she has often had an intense preoccupation with the observable and describable quirks of the body and its appearances. The confusing double reflection that sometimes appears in a car's rear-view mirror, which recurs throughout the novel Thru, is an example: it's a minute, exacting physical description of a particular part of the body (eyes and eyebrows).This sort of attention seems empirically exacting, and I think she wants it taken that way; but it is better described as compulsively machinic: it's closer to an autistic presentation than a realist novelist's delight in detail. She thinks of the body as a sort of machine, susceptible to exacting perspectival and formal description: our bodies are humorous, quirky things, comprised of detachable parts and pieces, each of which needs to be put into precise prose. There is little, in Brooke-Rose, of the body's gestalt, its motion or elegance: rather it's a construction of pieces, an ultimately unpleasant, tenuously constructed machine.The narrator (author) like to report on conversations and encounters from a certain distance, as if the author and narrator wasn't fully present. When she's fully present -- when the texture and objects of conversation return -- it's often a matter of facts and figures. She is interested in verifiable information, reports, summaries, things that she can use to solve questions she has, or things that fill in details she hadn't known. Other than that she's skeptical of friends and their motives and uses, and in general she keeps away from people in different ways, sometimes by simply cutting them off.I'm trying, in the compass of a few paragraphs, to sketch a picture of Brooke-Rose the author, as well as her narrators: like her other novels, Life, End of is dry because it is skeptical of human contact; scientific because it fears everything inexact, including emotions; and cold or unpersuaded when it comes to the body. She thrives on theories, texts, references, links, lists, catalogs, inquiries, problems and solutions, puzzles. She loves dissecting, listing, analyzing, diagramming, parsing. (This is especially clear in Thru, which revels in, and supposedly critiques, some French poststructuralist theory.) That personality drives her work, and gives it both its power and its obstinate love of fragmentation.Nathan ""N.R."" Gaddis's  on Goodreads has the following lines, riffing on Brooke-Rose's repeated use of ""T.F.,"" meaning True Friend, and ""O.P.,"" which might mean Other People, or Opinionated People:""Opinion People with their talking over and on top of. Who’s crotchety here? You probably know all the crotchety old men with all their crotchety old books, their last books. I know that Gaddis guy did one. Collapsing and decaying. It comes. Just let me tell you, Life, End of has its rights but more it has its obligation upon you, True Friend, Reader. Sympathy, empathy? Gelassenheit, better.""Gelassenheit, usually translated ""releasement,"" is one of the late Heidegger's invented words. It means, roughly, the capacity to let people and things exist in their mode of being. Personally, I don't find much of Heidegger's nearly mystical, abstract acceptance in Life, End of: I find anger and dissatisfaction, tempered by physical and mental inability. There is, often, a lack of both sympathy and empathy, but it's because the narrator's at the end of her tether, not because she finds a way to accept what is....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Jul 28, 2016","Jul 28, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/826661.Life_End_of

See the s of those two for balance with this.]This book is a series of short paragraphs, some a single word, few more than five lines. The paragraphs are separated by double spaces, so the book looks like poetry, or Wittgenstein's Tractatus, or Rochefoucauld.There are, principally, two kinds of entries: miscellaneous notes about artists (mainly novelists, some poets, virtually all North American or European); and author's notes about a novel he's thinking about writing. This second kind of note divides the author into at least three voices:1. Markson, the real author, insofar as we glimpse him2. Reader, the principal narrator, who thinks or writes ""Reader's Block."" He's called Reader because he's spent his life reading, and his mind is filled with thoughts about novelists.3. Protagonist, the character in the novel that Reader is contemplating writing.In the second kind of note, Reader imagines a Protagonist who lives next to a cemetery, near a beach, in winter, with no friends. It seems there wouldn't ever be much of a story there: it's quite Beckettish in its stasis and emptiness. As ""Reader's Block"" proceeds, a contrast develops between these notes and the ones about novelists. The desultory notes about Protagonist's empty life, to which he's been driven by a lack of events, people, and meaning in his actual life, begin to seem terminally vague, uninteresting, lacking in imagination (always the cemetery, always the beach), and, for me, bathetic. They seem unintentionally more sentimental and self-indulgent than they may have been intended: I have the impression Markson thought of them as desolate, existential in the Beckett mold, with a paralysis brought on by Reader's inability to energize his imagination, which had been ruined by the ""clutter"" of anecdotes about novelists from his lifetime of reading. But the notes come across slightly differently--more as a reliance on a uniform kind of desolation, a weakness the author prefers to ascribe to a mind ruined by reading.These Reader's notes on his unwritten novel have potential: in a couple of places he imagines characters, and then effectively drops them, and those moments can be as poignant as the deaths of characters in more developed narratives. But Markson doesn't play on that theme. He seems not to really notice it.On the other hand, the notes about authors are consistently interesting. I think they cannot be imagined simply as ""clutter"" (p. 42), because they come in three or four quite distinct varieties, which indicate different directions of Reader's mind:1. Notes about artists' deaths, about oblivion, about the ways writers are forgotten:""Fragonard died completely forgotten.""Nicolas de Stael committed suicide."" (p. 84).This first sort of note presents itself as Reader's probable fate, and it fits with Protagonist's fate, since he's pictured as a former author whose books have been forgotten.2. Notes about genius, aspiration, and fame:""Carlyle's Sartor Resartus was damningly abused by ers. Once he became famous he had it reissued. And included the s as an appendix.""A very pretty poem, Mr. Pope. But you must not call is Homer."" (p. 45).This second kind of note is often about authors misappreciating other authors:""Nothing odd will do long; Tristram Shandy did not last.Said Johnson.""Who also determined that time was too precious to be wasted on Fielding."" (pp. 161-62)From this second kind of note we have the impression of a different Reader, one who is aggrieved, and especially misses the praise of his fellow writers. A pettier and scrappier writer than the one who collected the first kind of note.3. Notes on the surprisingly unethical or immoral behavior of otherwise good or interesting artists: notes on infidelity, cruelty, incest, and so forth. In this third category I include the standard-format refrain, throughout the book, in the form ""X was an anti-Semite,"" with X varying from the usual suspects (Heigedder, De Man, Wagner, Celine) to less common examples. This third category is pettier yet than the second, and indicates another side to Reader: he's sour and righteous as well as wounded and envious.4... This listing could be multiplied: there seem to be several Readers here, who are more or less sympathetic characters, more or less reconciled to fate and oblivion. In my reading there is one other principal sort of note: the one that marks the passage of time: writers who were exact contemporaries, although they don't seem so or although they never met (Melville and Whitman); writers who lived unexpectly long lives, or brief ones; writers who are separated much further in time than we may have thought. These notes are, for me, the most sustaining: they stretch and compress time in ways that fit the author's sense of his impending oblivion. One of the longest notes in the entire book, and one of the few which clearly identifies Markson with Reader, is this one:""Lorenzo Ghiberti devoted twenty-eight years to the East Door of the Florence Bapistry. Michelangelo would say it could have served as the entrance to Paradise.Five hundred years later, Reader would stand staring where five of the door's ten panels lay heaped in the muck after having been wrenched away in the Great Flood of November 4, 1966. The night before."" (p. 56)It's not clear in the typesetting of the book whether that last sentence is a separate paragraph: I hope it was.In short, in sum: this is a book about a ruined career, and the author's impending death, but it's also about two ruined minds: the Reader's mind is ""cluttered"" so it can no longer work as it should; and at the same time Markson's mind is ""cluttered"" by unresolved and I think partly unnoticed conflicts between his ambition, his jealousy, and his acceptance of the end of his own life and his own writing.- - -Appendix: on reading ""Reader's Block"" after GoogleI wonder if we may have lost the ability to read this novel now that we have Google. I am not the ideal reader of ""Reader's Block,"" but I'm not too far off either. On any given page there will be one or two references I don't get, and the temptation is to look them up. That's clearly not Markson's intention. Google has made it seem as if allusions are things that are to be solved, as if lacunae in memory or knowledge can be filled in by a couple minutes on a search engine. Markson wants his many allusions to authors to resonate: he clearly didn't expect people would try to look them up, and he also didn't expect readers for whom too many of these would be puzzles. He isn't showing off his erudition, bemoaning the decline of literacy, or advocating for a good classical education. He's simply inventorying his own mind, and searching for allusions on Google is absolutely not an appropriate response to the book. And yet. We have Google, and now that I've finished the book I'm going to permit myself to look up some of the many lines I don't recognize. They're tantalizing:""Quel giorno piu non vi leggemmo avante."" (p. 102)""Que no quiero verla!"" (p. 46)""The day is past, and yet I saw no sun,And now I live, and now my life is done."" (p. 106)""Thesmophoriazusae."" (p. 180)""Was willst du, fremder Mensch?"" (p. 180)""O lente, lente currite, noctis equi!"" (p. 156)I have deferred looking up these and others until I finished reading, because I know that my encounter with these texts will be fresh, and incomplete -- lacking the context of the full books or poems from which they're taken -- and that in Markson's novel allusions are retrospective and ruminative, signs of a sense of culture that just can't be solved by Google....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,not set,"Jul 23, 2016","Jul 22, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/195607.Reader_s_Block

AHandke as a Late RomanticHere are some thoughts on ""The Long Way Around,"" the first and longest of a trilogy of short novels titled Slow Homecoming. Although the novels are short, their language--especially in ""The Long Way Around"" is dense, and they read slowly in English or German. In this respect ""The Long Way Around"" feels more like a 350-page novel than a 150-page novel.The narrator of ""The Long Way Around,"" who is called Sorger (an allegorical name, meaning something like ""Person Who Cares""), defines himself largely through his interactions with the Arctic landscape. Handke's prose here is full of tropes of subjectivity, woven into tropes of landscape: it owes the most, I think, to Rilke, but also to Trakl and other modernist nature poets. Sorger, however, claims he isn't working in the Romantic tradition: ""He did not believe in his science as a kind of nature religion; on the contrary, his always 'measured' practice of his profession... was at the same time an exercise in trusting the world, for the measured quality of his technical manipulations but also his personal, everyday movements resided in his constant attempt at meditation..."" (p. 8 in the Collier edition of Manheim's translation)A reader might wonder at this point what ""measuring"" is, and what ""technical manipulations"" might be, but at least it's clear that Sorger mixes nonscientific ideas like ""trusting"" (and ""caring,"" as in his name) with possibly scientific ones. A page later Handke tells us ""Sorger never ceased to regard the linguistic formulas of his science as a hoax"": science, Sorger thinks, is only about ""description and nomenclature,"" and he is after something less ""dubious."" The ""measured"" practice turns out to be drawing, and the process of drawing turns out to be empathetic consonance with the landscape. According to Benjamin Kunkel, Sorger's ""patient and reverent bestowal of attention... resembles geology"" (from his introduction to the NYRB edition, quoted from the n+1 site). But this resemblance is so distant that it doesn't really help: Leonardo's landscape drawings, which have also been analyzed as proto-geology, are closer to geology than Sorger's nearly abstract ""search for forms."" Sometimes Sorger doesn't even need to draw to achieve his identification with landscape:""For a moment he had felt the strength to propel his whole self into the bright horizon and there dissolve forever into the undifferentiated unity of sky and earth"" (p. 16) Still, ""he preferred drawing to photography, because it was only through drawing that he came to understand the landscape in all its forms"" (p. 29). This study of forms, which emerge slowly for him, through the act of meditative drawing, is more from Humboldt than Hermann Weyl: it's a 19th century species of imagination, not a 20th century one. In every landscape, Sorger says, ""consciousness gradually creates its own configurations""; the mind needs time ""to form ties with it,"" so that ""characteristic forms reveal themselves"" (pp. 71, 72)--all straight out of Humboldt, 150 years before Handke wrote ""The Long Way Around."" Superimposed on this first-generation Romanticism is late Romanticism, as in Rilke and Trakl, which is especially evident in the coils of self-awareness, in which all natural processes are also processes of self-understanding, and in which interpretation--as in conventional natural science--is to be avoided in favor of ""the pure, unexplained description"" of ""forms"" (p. 72). (The second novella in the book, ""Mont Sainte-Victoire,"" has elements of phenomenology, because the Cezanne literature is so infused by Merleau-Ponty's essay, but those elements are overlaid on a foundation of Romanticism--as they are, often, in art historical scholarship which presents itself as phenomenological but is perhaps more deeply Romantic in its first instincts. But that's a subject for another essay.)In what sense, then, is ""The Long Way Around"" a postwar (read: modernist or postmodernist) fiction? It seems better understood as one of the last gasps of late Romanticism, in which poetry can only be recovered by the most convoluted writing, the densest and most introspective images, the strongest vigilance against cliches. It has just the slightest touches of postwar sensibility, for example when Sorger concludes that the best he's doing is ""not betraying"" the world, and creating a ""science of peace"": an ironic ambition given Handke's later career.Appendix: a note on Handke's politicsSince politics is what as stifled Handke's career, it's interesting that ""The Long Way Around"" is weirdly coy about its location. For the first fifty pages it's impossible to tell if Sorger is in the Siberian or North American arctic. He calls the natives ""Indians,"" which is not correct for either continent. He sleeps with an ""Indian"" woman and gives her a ""pet name"" (p. 17). She laughs at the ""inconceivable notion that there might be another continent"" (p. 19): an outrageous European fantasy of isolation. Together they speak a language foreign to both of them: it could be Russian or English. Manheim says Sorger sees ""elk "" (p. 16) but that's either Handke's or Manheim's error, because it eventually turns out he's been in Alaska. When we're finally given enough information to conclude Sorger's been in Alaska, it's done in a crazily coy way. The narrator flies down to a place on the Pacific coast, ""in a different time zone (two hour later)."" This is inaccurate -- it would be one hour later -- but it makes the location unambiguous. He makes brief references to ""a nation,"" and finally to the United States (p. 62). All this is in service of Sorger's (and Handke's )attempt to lose himself in a place without history, culture, or a name. It's intensive myth-making, and really unnecessary when it comes to what Sorger actually does in the Arctic community (drawing, sleeping with the ""Indian"" woman)....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Jul 17, 2016","Jul 17, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/27894.Slow_Homecoming

In the event Moore decided not to write a third volume. (In its place will be publishing a collection of his essays, called My Back Pages: Reviews and Essays.) In the end, the points that interest me have to do with what a third volume of The Novel, covering 1800 to the present, might have looked like.In preparing for these remarks I read volume 2, The Novel: An Alternative History, 1600-1800 (2013), skimmed volume 1, The Novel: An Alternative History, Beginnings to 1600 (2010), and read at least ten s of both books. The reception of the first two volumes of The Novel is marked by several leitmotifs, which I think are unhelpful in the sense that they distract from a deeper and more intriguing theme. Among the ers’ concerns:1. The Novel is inclusive; Moore doesn’t want to limit the novel to a bourgeois or romantic invention. For most ers, that’s salutary; for some, it’s anathema, and for a few, it’s true but not original. I can’t quite see the stakes here: as E.H. Gombrich once said, it’s hard to know exactly what the point of definitions is, if not to defend territory.2. The Novel is anti-religious, and for some readers that has meant it’s seriously flawed. Moore doesn’t like A Pilgrim’s Progress, and he offers a strong but focused interpretation of Don Quixote, in which the novel’s hero is simply insane, and the book is a veiled allegory of the psychosis of “people of the book.” Don Quixote insists on the veracity of books of chivalry, just as religious fundamentalists insist on the truth of the Bible or Qur’an. Moore suggests Cervantes was hinting at this, and that it’s the book’s salient feature. But given that Moore is offering An Alternative History and not A Comprehensive History, I can’t see how it makes sense to chastise him for not seeing virtues in religious novels.3. The Novel is erudite, so everyone says: but that is a mobile category, and not often useful in criticism. Diderot, one of the novelists described in The Novel, was far more “erudite” than some of the minor novelists Moore s, whose books are filled with arcane histories. Canetti was more “erudite” than Musil, but how exactly does that count in either author’s favor? Nabokov’s Eugene Onegin is “erudite” (I am reading it now: I’d like to be one of the few who has read every note), but that erudition produced a monstrosity. There are also always standards according to which erudition is ignorance. For some Chinese scholars, this won’t be an erudite book. For example there’s little about the history of the reception of Cao Xueqin in Chinese letters; that’s as if Moore had read Joyce but nothing about Joyce. This isn’t to say there aren’t surprising displays of reading in The Novel; my favorite is a footnote that gives a list of novels with indices, starting with Laurent Bordelon’s History of the Ridiculous Extravagances of Monsieur Oufle, and going on from Richardson to Nabokov, Julian Rios, Malcom Bradbury, Milorad Pavic, and a dozen others. But noting this sort of erudition isn’t a useful way to characterize The Novel’s contribution, except in that Moore is very much drawn to the specific version of “learned wit” and erudition he finds in Gaddis. (For this see the illuminating passage on Monsieur Oufle, whose “learned wit” is however motivated not by Moore’s own interest in experimental writing--see the fifth point, below--but by Oufle’s anti-religious polemic.)4. The Novel doesn’t find much use for literary criticism or literary theory. The book “holds no brief for theory, or literary criticism in general” in the words of Roger Boylan (Boston Review). This is generally the case, although Todorov and many other critics make appearances. It would be a flaw if Moore were engaged in the debates that have emerged in literary theory. He doesn’t use De Man’s sense of romanticism isn’t noted in these two volumes, but it’s also not at stake. Like any critic, Moore deploys his own judgments, and if that cuts him off from other people’s conversations, it can also make his own arguments cleaner and clearer. Michael Orthofer of The Complete Review is similar in this regard: he has championed Arno Schmidt, but he hasn’t included any academic work on Schmidt, which he finds less than useful. In my field--art history, theory, and criticism--these traits would simple mark Moore’s book as an essay in criticism rather than history, and the question would be for whom this alternative (critical) history was written.(Incidentally, this is a different issue than the one William Vollmann raised by objecting to the time Moore spends summarizing plots: I agree with Moore’s response, namely that it’s time well spent when readers don’t know the novels in question.)5. The Novel is partial because Moore is interested in “style”--that is, language--and not real-world politics, or society. As Moore said in an interview: “The reason some of us consider Ulysses the greatest novel ever written is not because it has a gripping story, lovable characters, or unique insights into the human situation, but because it is the most elaborate rhetorical performance ever mounted, making wider and more masterful use of all the forms and techniques of prose than any other novel."" The Novel’s most contentious  was by Denis Donoghue, who said Moore prefers “long, difficult novels that ask to be read, he thinks, as stylish performances: he approaches them in the same spirit as that of watching a ballet or a figure-skating competition.” I think most ers have sided with Moore’s interests. As Jeff Bursey put it in a  in Quarterly Conversation, novels have in fact often been about things “far from portraying the real world”; for over “two and a half millennia” they’ve been about “grandiose conceits, lengthy sentences, and intricate structures.” This fifth concern is closer to mine, but the ers are still, I think, off-topic, partly because Moore shows plenty of interest in plot and reference, but mainly because, as I wrote regarding the second point, Moore doesn’t claim to be representing the entire history of novels with an equal hand: this is a critical history.These five preoccupations of the critics all miss something I think is more interesting. I’ll call it the shape of history that’s implicit in The Novel. The shape is formed by the comparisons that Moore employs to explain unfamiliar texts. Most ers have observed the surprising links he proposes between his authors (writing before 1800) and Gaddis, Pynchon, Wallace, and others. There are many examples. An episode in Novalis’s Heinrich von Ofterdingen is described as “Pynchonesque telluro-mysticism”; Voltaire’s “complex metafictions” are said to “resemble those of Borges, Barth, and Coover”; Dong Yue’s Tower of the Myriad Mirrors is said to anticipate “Carroll, Freud, Kafka, Joyce, and Borges”; Wu Jingzi’s The Scholars has “a modernist feel” that prompts Moore to compare it to Gaddis’s J R; Diderot’s Jacques the Fatalist gives us a world “characterized by what Pynchon calls ‘anti-paranoia, where nothing is connected to anything’.” I haven’t made a full account, but I think Gaddis, Pynchon, and Wallace are the central pivots.Such links are usually taken either as welcome insights into premodern authors (that is, as discoveries), or else as evidence that the “experimental novel” has been around long before Gaddis’s generation. I think both those conclusions are consonant with Moore’s intentions, but they miss the effect of such parallels on The Novel’s implicit shape of history. At the risk of being too systematic, let me take each of these interpretations in turn. 1. The idea that the parallels are discoveries. Jeff Bursey, writing for Music & Literature, notes that Moore “can look down the road and pick out descendants from this or that author (e.g., linking Goethe with David Foster Wallace).” Or again: “Young Werther/David Foster Wallace: the unexpected parallel is perfect, and unforgettable.” But this makes it sound as if the comparison is simply an insight, and it implies that all that’s happening in such passages is that Moore is discovering genealogies for Wallace. More is at stake, I think. First it needs to be said that Moore is following a modernist and postmodernist tradition in searching for antecedents to the apparent newness of 20th century fiction. One that I have studied is the link that’s been said to exist between Arno Schmidt’s Zettels Traum, Joyce’s Finnegans Wake, and Johann Fischart, the 16th century author of an “untranslatable” novel known as the Geschichtsklitterung that is full of portmanteau words. An academic approach to such lineages would see them as “origin myths”: Fischart isn’t like Joyce or Schmidt, but it has seemed important to provide both modern authors with deeper roots. So when Moore is praised for finding links “between linguistic innovators of the Renaissance like Colonna and Rabelais and modern ones like James Joyce and Germany’s own Arno Schmidt,” the question, for an historiographer--by which I mean someone, like me, who is interested in how historical narratives are constructed--is why it seems interesting to propose such lineages. I don’t think Moore is often motivated by a desire to provide deeper lineages for authors of his or recent generations; in The Novel it’s more the opposite: it’s a desire to record moments of recognition in earlier works. But the historiographic question mark should still be there: where does that desire come from? And for whom is it persuasive?2. The idea that the parallels show the “experimental novel” has been around long before postmodernism. Boylan and others say Moore’s book “unearths evidence” that “‘experimental’ fiction has been around as long as storytelling itself” (Boston Review), and Moore says “experimental” means “to depart from the norm and try something new” (2010 interview for Porter Square Books), making many of the books he s “experimental”--but for me this doesn’t fully the question of what counts as “experimental” fiction. (I want also to note in passing that the claim that “‘experimental’ fiction has been around as long as storytelling itself” is different from the claim that novels have always been experimental, at least up to the bourgeois novel and the contemporary reaction against “experimental” prose: the latter would be much more difficult to argue.) In my reading, “experimental” is understood in The Novel as a combination of at least four things: writing that goes against the norm; writing that explores form rather than pouring content into familiar molds; writing that experiments, self-consciously, with the novel; writing that is excessive in length, density of allusions, or logical complexity; and writing that is done with attention to the “style” rather than the content. (“Style” in quotation marks because it’s another complex word, in Empson’s sense.) Because it’s amalgamated from several potentially disparate elements, “experimental” is difficult to characterize. In art history and theory, anti-experimentalists like Franzen could be called antimodernist, which could ally them with nationalist literatures; people like Donoghue are a different sort of anti-experimentalist; in art and music theory they could be called modernists or late romantics. In the end, what counts as “experimental” in The Novel is writing that’s similar to the two or three generations from Finnegans Wake to Gaddis, Barth, Pynchon, Vollmann, and Wallace, and so it has an historical specificity that tempers some of its apparently transhistorical traits. In The Novel, the general answer to the question of why it is of interest to link Goethe to Wallace, or give Finnegans Wake a genealogy that reaches back to Geschichtsklitterung, is that it’s important to show that novels have always been experimental. But if “experimental” is taken in the historically specific sense I’ve sketched, then what’s actually happening is a reading of novels from any number of cultures and periods in terms of postwar American fiction. If I put it this way, it sounds at once narrower and less convincing than the way it’s put in The Novel, or the way The Novel has been received. Certainly comparisons like the one between The Sorrows of Young Werther and David Foster Wallace are among the most obviously non-academic traits of The Novel: an academic historian of the novel would resist such a comparison. If you were an academic historian, and that comparison occurred to you, you’d probably want to ask yourself what misunderstanding of history had led you to link two such disparate figures; you’d probably interrogate your understanding of Goethe in order to recover his otherness, his distance from the present, his distinct character and difference, and you would never commit your comparison to print.  Yet I think that Moore’s unexpected comparisons are actually a tremendous strength, for at least three reasons. First, they’re honest. Second, they belong to the realm of criticism rather than history. In comparative literature there is virtually no criticism that involves judgment; “criticism” denotes a more circumspect and nonjudgmental engagement. Third, and most important to me, Moore’s comparisons register an awareness of literary history as a subject that is only visible when it is related to the present. Such a sense of history remains a minority interest in art history and music history. In my field I think of Keith Moxey, Michael Holly, and Mieke Bal; in music history, I think of the magnificently self-centered history of modern music written by Richard Taruskin. The overwhelming majority of historians of art and music repress the present as a condition for historical awareness: that is, they don’t write about the conditions of their own interest in historical periods, or if they do, they detach those conditions from their historical writing.This brings me, at last, to the notion of the shape of history. The history of the novel has a particular shape in Moore’s books. Entirely aside from whatever erudition he might be said to have, his survey of the world’s novels proceeds across a remarkably level field: the chapters are divided mainly by languages, and sometimes by cultures or nations, and each is, in theory, as interesting as another. The field of history is like a plain, dotted with castles or villages representing achievements such as Don Quixote or The Tale of Genji. (My topographic metaphor is taken partly from La Mancha, and partly from 15th century Italian paintings of plains dotted with hill towns.) But sometime in the middle of the 20th century, especially in America, that field rises into foothills and then higher peaks. History has a shape. Moore looks down at the plain, across it, and into the distance as far as China, Greece, and Rome.This kind of topological “distortion” is in fact the condition of the sense of any historical account, as Moxey and others have argued so well, but it is usually ignored or denied. This isn’t a perfect metaphor, in that novels from distant parts of the landscape can at least partly be “seen” from close up; but it captures the perspectival view that informs The Novel. What interests me here is how volume 3, if he had decided to write it, could have worked with that shape. When the terms of your interpretation are implicitly general (the “experimental” novel as a form that has always existed; the ideas of “style,” complexity, self-reflexivity, and allusion understood as things that have always been of interest), it can be difficult to describe your own generation. In art history and music history, this is the problem of the intersection of historical and critical writing. The problem is egregiously and traditionally confused in literary studies because of the expression “literary criticism,” which implies all writing about novels of the past is already criticism, despite the fact that scholars present themselves as historians. The problem is easier to see, if not to solve, in art history, because art historians know that it is conceptually problematic to write art histories of contemporary art. If there had been a third volume it might not have been able to present itself in the way volumes 1 and 2 do--as a critically motivated history of the novel. Volume 3, I think, would have had to be more a project of advocacy, and would have needed to revisit terms such as “experimental,” “style,” and “displays of linguistic prowess” (that’s Boylan again). Those terms will necessarily lose some of their proposed trans-historical reach. If Gaddis, Pynchon, Wallace, and others are the writers we steer by (thinking of Wallace’s comment about the “25% of Pynchon”), then who do we steer by when we’re thinking about Gaddis, Pynchon, and Wallace?Moore's purposes in searching for ""experimental"" novels in different cultures and languages is to challenge the idea that the novel has only recently become experimental, and to suggest that the novel didn't arise as a self-description of the bourgeoisie in the 18th century. I think both are salutary goals. What interests me is what happens to ""experimental"" in these contexts. If being experimental means mainly trying new forms, then it might lose its descriptive power for some postwar writers (it may seem too general). On the other hand, if being experimental means working with Sierpinski triangles (as David Foster Wallace once said he did), then ""experimental"" might be more historically specific. I tend toward the latter sense of ""experimental,"" in which it's a postwar phenomenon mainly confined to English, French, and German literature; but it's also the case that such an understanding of ""experimental"" requires claims of a deeper genealogy: hence the curious place allotted to history, which becomes at once distant and immediately present. ...more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Jul 16, 2016","Jul 16, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/17158246-the-novel

But Vila-Matas has a tendency to slide into self-regarding, unchallenging, self-fulfilling meditations on writing, the writer's life, writer's careers, and the life of books, where all that matters is a kind of pale poetry of authors and reputations. The slide is steep enough in ""Dublinesque,"" which is a preposterously, inexcusably hermetically sealed version of literary Ireland consisting only of Vila-Matas's own personal pantheon of mostly older Irish authors. There's nothing of the current Irish literary scene in that book, and of course nothing at all of the texture and sounds of the country itself. Vila-Matas is as far sunken in his literary universe, as padded and cocooned by his world of writers, as Borges or Bellows became in later life. (I have longer and more annoyed s of Vila-Matas's books elsewhere on this site.)The slide away from ""real life"" is a theme in this book. The author, who presents himself as the narrator, is fascinated with Sophie Calle's ""wall novels,"" and in particular with her idea, proposed to Paul Auster, that he write a novel she would then act out. ""For years,"" Vila-Matas says, he has been ""speculating on the relationship between life and literature, rummaging around for a technique to go beyond them, especially beyond literature"" (p. 73), and that would be believable, if it weren't for the fact that ""beyond literature"" doesn't mean anything more than pallid looks at possible real-world interruptions. Vila-Matas writes an aestheticized, safe, anemic sort of poetry in which literature and writers take the place of things, places, and people, and quotations and allusions speak placidly and soothingly among themselves. It's all very ""elegant,"" as he says at the decisive moment at the end of this book (p. 88).A sign of how deeply things are sunken here is that it would never occur to Vila-Matas that a reader might think his relentless recourse to writers is laughable. In section 3, the narrator is describing a woman who is posing as a private detective. A potential customer comes in and asks the woman to find her ex-husband. He was, she tells the detective, ""a famous young writer"" (p. 9). (A writer, of course, what else?) A few lines later, we learn the writer had published his ""fifth novel... in which he had staged his own disappearance."" I doubt I'd be wrong if I said that Vila-Matas would never expect a reader -- like me! -- might write in the margin: Oh, for God's sake! I don't have a problem imagining a kind of reader for whom this book is a pleasure.

The practice has fallen out of use for obvious reasons -- it has no articulated relation with historical meaning, and it is detached from politics, identity, and context -- but it is implicitly a strong presence in the teaching of art and art history, because it helps determine which artists are taught. The same happens in music and literature.In practical terms, a second-rank artist is one that doesn't need to be taught or included in a textbook. Such an artist can be pushed out of the curriculum because of lack of space or time. In line with connoisseurial practices, such choices aren't reasoned: they're just made. It can be difficult, therefore, to know why certain artists, writers, or composers aren't in a given textbook or seminar. For me, Nicholson Baker is a good example of the issue. He is, in my reading, a strongly, clearly second-rank author, by which I mean if I had to choose between teaching him and teaching Pynchon, Updike, DeLillo, or Wallace to represent the 1980 and 1990s, I'd reluctantly have to omit Baker. Of course this sounds horrible, but it is the sort of decision that's made every day in classrooms and by editors, and it's hardly a slight to say of Baker that he's solidly second-rank: he'll be there, in every larger anthology and history.What is it, then, that makes his second-rank status so clear? For me the entire notion of rankings comes up when I am distracted, in my reading, by thinking of the influences that shaped the author's work. (Same for music and visual art.) Baker's influencesBaker's wonderful book ""U and I"" gives the most eloquent possible testimony to his permanent state of infatuation with Updike, and to his equally affectionate, but oddly distanced, relation to Nabokov. Both authors are guiding spirits in ""Room Temperature"" in the literal sense of that expression: I can sometimes see Baker's sense of them guiding his choices of words and turns of phrase. Updike is certainly the inspiration for ""Room Temperature's"" fidelity to the most commonplace subjects (the book is about the narrator bottle-feeding his infant daughter).Other voices also speak over Baker's shoulder: DeLillo, Pynchon, Barthelme, and further afield Dickinson, Hopkins, Wordsworth, even Tennyson. For me the most intriguing one -- even though I'm fairly certain this wouldn't have occurred to Baker as he wrote -- is Raymond Roussel, especially the ""New Impressions of Africa."" Baker's trope of choice is the simile, and his rhetorical device of choice is the anaphora (formulas repeated clause by clause). He strings together similes: this is like this, and like this, and like this. Roussel's poem is the most drastic text I know in this regard: it's pathologically committed to endless, apparently disconnected comparisons. Roussel is present with uncanny exactitude in passages like this, which describes the shape of his baby daughter's nostril:""The Bug's nostril had the innocent perfection of a Cheerio... a tiny dry clean salty ring, so small, with the odd but functional smallness of the tires on passenger planes, or of the smooth rim around the pistil of the brass pump head you fitted over a tire's stem valve to inflate it...""And this passage, describing the sound Bug's nostril makes when the air was released:""...like the sound strong dogs made as they strained at leashes... or the faint, high, sonar-like suffix of sound that the expensive kind of textured rubber balls added to the prosaic bounce of external impact on concrete..."" (p. 39).All this is compulsively detailed and improbable, like Roussel, and despite its faithful attachment to the products of American manufacturing from the 1950s to the 1980s, it's also persistently faintly surreal. Proust is another presence in ""Room Temperature."" It may be especially difficult to say useful things about Proust's influence, because it has diffused so widely; he can seem to be present whenever a narrator is deliberate and meditative. But some of Baker's sentences and pages are almost formulaic rehearsals. Here is an especially clear (and successful) one:""Possibly because I had been hit with the romance of negative spaces so early, I had turned against it, and become impatient with art historical discussions in college that drew attention to the painted light between tree trunks as opposed to the real trunks themselves, and with the overemphasis in science classes on 'paradigm shifts' to the detriment of 'normal science'; but it felt good years later to come back around, as you almost always did eventually, to acquiescing to the partial truth of some overhyped observation--and I was pleased to have returned to an appreciation of negative space not by leafing through a book of Klimt's landscapes or by reading about William James's 'intention of saying a thing,' but by recognizing that it was more truthful to downplay the scribble and focus on the hand-slide in my wife's record of our life."" (pp. 20-21)Proustian formulae: beginning with a conditional; proceeding with two clauses describing a past condition; moving on, past a semicolon, with a reversal or new insight, followed by an abstract formulation (""the partial truth of some overhyped observation""); then onward through several clauses of examples, themselves harmoniously arranged but surprising and insightful in their combinations; and ending with something on the specific, present-tense experience of the narrator. (In this case, about listening to his wife writing a diary.)These are exact mirrorings, not transformations. The only un-Proustian thing about the sentence I quoted may be the American colloquial ""as you almost always did eventually."" And the only un-Roussellian thing about Baker's lists is the fact that Baker is sane, so they terminate eventually.Similes and AutismReviewers have liked to say that Baker's similes provoke a ""smile of recognition"" (that's from an endorsement on the back cover of my copy), and they do, especially for me: he and I are very close in age, and we spent time in the same parts of the States. I am in that respect his ideal reader, because I recognize every description and allusion in the entire book, from stacked checkers to Bic pen ads to individual diagrams in Time-Life books, and including even a science display he describes in Philadelphia, now long gone. But ""recognition"" doesn't make me especially happy, and I think I seldom smiled. For me, his allusions and similes are at their best when their precision forces their ordinariness into surrealism, or when they build to unexpected insights rather than connecting dots I hadn't seen were linked. But they don't seem often to do either.Most of the time his preferred similes are to mechanical operations. I'm sure I'm not the first to say there's an autism about Baker's work. It's a mild autism, as they say: manifesting in a preference for mechanical operations. The most interesting autistic-spectrum quality, however, is the way Baker's narrator is always wondering what his wife Patty thinks of things. A general incapacity to understand people's feelings, coupled with an interest in experimenting to find out what people feel, is also part of autism, and it is happily on display throughout the book, most prominently when she saves some inspection papers he found in a pocket, and makes a mobile out of them to entertain Bug. ""She'd saved them! She'd made permanent use of them!"" -- has special resonance if it's thought of as part of the narrator's ongoing experiments. (p. 15) From this perspective, too, the many similes and the recognition (the safety) they elicit are like millions of madeleines: they answer Proust's fetishism with a democratic nostalgia, which is nevertheless autistic in its potentially endlessness. Everything, eventually, will become an object of nostalgia: speaking of the latches that still close tray tables on airlines, he writes: ""I felt pity and shame for American plane engineers who had failed to see that thirty years of improvements in the on/off switch, the suitcase closure, the cassette ejection system, the umbrella lock, the calculator button.. were demanding that we dig deeper and find some subtler sort of click or even a clickless but convincing thumplet."" (p. 46)The best passage in the book, for me, is one toward the end in which he wonders why he makes a certain breathing sound when he smiles in bed, but not when he's up, and he suddenly concludes with an insight that he prints all in italics. It's homey, ordinary, and domestic, like everything else in the book, but it's also a bit fanatical, a little touched, and that's what makes it different than the many hundreds of other comparisons out of which the thought of the book is painstakingly constructed:""No, the explanation had to be that smiles became more audible only at bedtime because toothpaste altered the chemical characteristics of one's saliva in such a way that encouraged an unusually loud, sticky effervescence along the gum line.""

Even with a large font and judicious line spacing, it doesn't quite make 100 pages. A really excellent Afterword by Joseph Tabbi makes it 113 pages. Agape Agape is a monologue, in broken grammar and logic, by a dying man. He thinks of his unfinished book on the history of the player piano, and he fights the effects of his medication and his illness. The theme is the relentless mechanization of the imagination and art.I read this because it's been noted that Gaddis read Bernhard late in his life, and this book is said to show Bernhard's influence. My initial interest was to see whether the rant -- by which I mean Benhard's endless, relentless, compulsive monologues -- could be the object of emulation. What can be emulated from an excess of formless bile?I imagine Bernhard would have secretly admired the philosophic and historical complaints here, and would have nastily disparaged Gaddis's lingering worship of high culture and the erudition that makes it possible. I also picture him disparaging the formal tricks Gaddis uses to produce his stream of consciousness: he changes subject in the middle of a phrase, he breaks clauses with apostrophes, and in general tinkers with the form of writing instead of letting his anger and unhappiness ruin his grammar. The closing page of Agape Agape is moving, but not because of its echoes of Bernhard; it sounds like wisdom literature, well in control of the painful idea it wants to communicate. A rant, I think, can't be emulated. Not because it proceeds from some unstoppable dissatisfaction, but because a rant, in Bernhard, is a kind of writing that happens when everything is torn down, so whatever's left needs to fight for air. The narrator in this book is not in control of his body or the sequence of his thoughts, but the author is.This question about rants can be made more complex by including The Recognitions and JR, which may show what extended monologues were for Gaddis before his encounter with Bernhard. (I don't know when Gaddis read Bernhard.) There the looseness of the writing is decisive. I don't feel I need to define or elaborate this because it has been impeccably laid bare in Adam Mars-Jones's , ""There Isn’t Any Inside!,"" London Review of Books, 23 September 2021. The point I take from Mars-Jones is that Gaddis permitted his writing to be voluminous and often careless, imagining that volume produced mimetic advance for fiction. But the obliviousness about the connection between form and content makes the long passages, set-pieces, and monologues in those earlier books appear as the products of a lack of oversight rather than vitriol or despair. So that's another thing that can't be emulated in Bernhard.*PostscriptThis book cannot be read without some homework. It's important, at the least, to know:1. Agape (Christian love) agape (ruined) is Gaddis's formula for the loss of imaginative freedom, and it matters that the Christian agape is a love between brothers: for Gaddis, the author, if not for the narrator, real acts of imagination and art happen in friendship, in love. Joseph Tabbi has useful biographical information about this, regarding Gaddis's friendship with Martin Dworkin.2. One of this book's, and Gaddis's, central texts is a verse by Michelangelo. In the original:O Dio, o Dio, o Dio,Chi m'a tolto a ma stessoCh'a me fusse piu pressoO piu di me potessi, che poss'io?In Creighton Gilbert's translation:O Heaven, Heaven, Heaven!Who's robbed me of myselfWho's closer to myselfOr can do more with me than I ever can? [p. 113 n. 8]In Gaddis's translation (extracted from the prose in which he places it, p. 94):O Dio, o Dio, o Dio... Who nearer to me Or more mighty... than I tore me away from myself... what can I do?It's crucial, as Tabbi points out, that ""o Dio"" remains in Italian, so it can rhyme with ""odium"" (this is in Gaddis's text, p. 95). 3. It's also useful to reread Tolstoy's ""Kreutzer Sonata"" to recall the ambivalent hold of music; even though music freely played (as opposed to mechanically reproduced on a player piano) is this book's theme, music itself is not an unambiguous synecdoche for all the arts, or even for good art....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,not set,"May 29, 2016","May 29, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28441.Agap_Agape

""Die Notizien"" is his central work; it is 900 pages long and still untranslated. I read this to get a sense of him, but it seems to be a singular piece, by which he can't be judged. Steiner's judgment, which is widely repeated on the internet, is that Hohl is ""one of the secret masters of twentieth century prose... a voyeur into the nuances and tremors of sensibility. Hohl experienced physical and psychological phenomena as interminably fragmented. with disenchanted scruple, he fitted these fragments into a language-mosaic of exceptional lucidity"" He wrote, according to Steiner, ""from a literal underground, from a cellarage or below street level-cavern in Geneva.

Its descriptions of mountain phenomena -- seracs, couloirs, a Bergschrund -- are patient, rational, even architectonic, and its characterizations of the two mountaineers are spare and schematic.It's hard to see how this is a modernist's text: it could have been written by Georg Simmel or even Adalbert Stifter, and its roots go back to Buechner's ""Lenz.""

Volume 1 is available in English; it is 750 pages long, and the Hungarian original is 1,225 pages. (See ""A Comedy of Ideas: Miklós Szentkuthy, Prae,"" 1981, posted on Hungarian Literature Online.) The entire book in English will be as long as Finnegans Wake or half of Proust.The translation of Prae was not widely ed; I will take as my point of departure a  by Ágnes Orzóy, in The Quarterly Conversation (March 16, 2015). Orzóy suggests four principal meanings. I summarize them here, in order from less to more convincing:1. Prae slows reading. ""One needs to slow down, and then slow down even more, to read his sentences. In this sense, reading Szentkuthy in our speedy age is untimely but therapeutic: like a long walk in a forest or by the sea, it reminds us that we should live more slowly and attentively."" This, however, doesn't seem like a description that's specific to Prae: it could apply as well to late Joyce, to some Beckett, to all of Celan, even to Nabokov.2. Prae changes perception of the world. ""There is another way in which reading Prae is a peculiar experience. After working her way through those endless pages about a thousand ways of perceiving a gesture, a wrinkle in a dress, a habit, or an idea, the reader finds herself resonating with landscapes and works of art in completely new ways.... reading Prae can be compared to training, say, for a martial art—while training, you sometimes feel that all you do is scream and sweat and kick and jump, but it eventually leads to an altered consciousness.... Prae is not only a preparation for writing but also... for living."" This, I think, is critical nonsense: any strong work changes how we see.3. ""One way to characterise Prae,"" Orzóy writes, ""is as the enactment of perception and artistic expression. Life is viewed as an endless series of masks and metamorphoses,"" but ""as things metamorphose... they become even more themselves... plus something else that has an even more powerful... existence,"" and that surplus is ""artistic expression—form—if not the principle of life itself."" 4. ""Prae... is also about inexpressibility"" and things that are unrepresentable. ""And it is precisely this unrepresentability that Prae tackles, while admitting that... behind the words—behind Szentkuthy’s hyperintelligent and hypersensitive prolixity—the cantus firmus... is 'No Word,' that is, inexpressibility."" These last two are right, I think, but what matters is how they work in any given passage; otherwise they are the sorts of straightforward philosophic claims that Prae itself continuously elaborates, undermines, and dissolves into its more complex ongoing meditations. Here I will suggest how a close reading might alter these last two conclusions.The entire book is dense with breathless philosophizing. Most pages are taken up with analyses of phenomena, feelings, and ideas, and many pages contain theories, often structured as two-, three-, and four-part analyses. Szentkuthy had recently read Heidegger and psychoanalysis, and his text shows a wide, if diffuse, awareness of Kantian tradition, Platonism, Romanticism, medieval and classical philosophy, contemporaneous psychology, some recent physics (Schroedinger), and modernist fiction, including Proust and Joyce.Szentkuthy's analyses are sometimes perceptive, and I suspect that is what leads readers like Orzóy to praise his insight. But many more are opaque, mainly because the range of metaphors and allusions is at once vague and too extravagant to make sense. Let me quote an example at some length to give a sense of this. It is the opening of a section titled ""The three relations of substance and day-to-day reality: close kinship, barely touching, absolute otherness"" (p. 194). The opening paragraphs set out those three relations, one after another, as in a philosophic essay:""...the first step was the 'truth' grade, at which at which object and its essence were together like the Laocoon Group, where the extremities of the suffering and strangled man are the serpents that squeeze him to death: the state of identity poisoning.""The second step, when the 'substance' is merely reflected on the object and sometimes brushes it: the object endeavors to work its essence out of itself, but in the end it gets no more than a coquettish tongue lashing from its essence: the essence does not infiltrate the pores of the object like bacilli, that would push it into a deadly 'substancitis,' but nibble a bit of it here and there, or keep dropping in strange little puzzle case-endings.""Finally, the third step, a logical culmination of 'identity': in other words, the alterity grade: when the essence is still not airy enough, even in momentary silhouette shape it is still an excessive mimicry of the object, then it hatches out of the empty space of materiality like a foreign lining that appears on turning a glove inside out (the birth of Venus emerging from the sea is in point of fact a similar kind of lining-disclosure: the reverse of the blind sea brought to public attention), a second-degree nothing hatching from a first-degree nothing that humiliates the first as a crude 'something'; otherness, which is alone capable of meeting the requirements of 'spirituality' (geometry, not ethos), of absurd ethereality; the least common point between object and substance induces thickening, and thus an exacerbation, which cannot happen with the therapy of otherness...""It is possible to read this, and all of Prae, as what would have to be called a kind of poetry: that is, you'd read for the images and the rhetoric more than the sense. But that is not what Szentkuthy expected. He's in earnest when he exposits his theories, and serious when he analyzes perception, imagination, and conceptualization. He wants readers to follow his thought. But if I do -- if I read this passage carefully, for example, trying to extract his claims -- I am stopped by the looseness of his metaphors. He chooses his metaphors quickly, and they don't always make sense even when his meaning can be deduced. In some cases, like ""strange little puzzle case-endings,"" he has something in mind but doesn't bother to expand on it. In other cases, such as the ""blind sea brought to public attention,"" he's just writing too quickly to make good sense. Presumably what he meant here was ""unseen ocean made visible."" In yet other cases, like the notion that essence ""hatches out of the empty space of materiality like a foreign lining,"" he's just writing carelessly. Linings don't hatch, and they aren't foreign.(A parenthesis on the visual: these same issues extend to Szentkuthy's use of visual images. It's often unpleasant to visualize them because they are so carelessly chosen and evoked. In the opening pages, for example, there is a sunflower, a ""Venetian ship"" in the moonlight, an ellipse, and some radiating lines. His images are schematic and ugly, even though he doesn't mean them to be: he tends to favor simple visual images, but he doesn't think visually, so the images are crude, cliched, and harsh in comparison to his kaleidoscopic conceptualizations.)If Szentkuthy were a student of mine, and this was presented as nonfiction or philosophy, I'd mark up every sentence. In order to write philosophy he would have needed both a line-by-line editor and a censor. But this is fiction, so the question is how to understand 700 pages (with many more to come) of pseudo-logical pseudo-reasoning, when the author himself, and the narrator, both clearly ask readers to understand the text not only as poetry, but also as argument. What drives the narrator in Prae is a desire to understand, but he is continuously frustrated not only by his own hyper-vigilant introspection and doubt, but also by his skittishness, his inability to settle down to consider one thing at a time. Prae is a novel of wheel-spinning, frantic, anxious, delirious (in Dali's sense of that word) conceptualizing. Its affect is vertiginous instability: the rug is pulled out from under the narrator's feet by his own restlessness. There is an urgency that drives him on, so he repeatedly forgets his own insights and pushes on, and past, other insights, like a man stumbling on a treadmill. The theory of the modernist novelAn endorsement by a writer named Pal Nagy, printed in the inside pages of the book (and I'm guessing translated expressly for this edition), claims ""virtually all of the problems of the old and the 20th century experimental novel can be found"" in Prae. Certainly it's possible to read Prae as a hypertrophied, often monstrous, outgrowth of several tendencies of the modernist novel. If Walser, Gombrowicz, and Musil are intensely introspective, then Szentkuthy is crazily intensely introspective. If Musil, Proust, and others exemplify a moment in which the novel felt it had to be reconciled with the essay form, then Szentkuthy's book is the last gasping breaths of both the essay and the narrative. Plot is almost completely absent here: it's nearly strangled by the compulsive thinking. And if structural and linguistic complexity and extravagant length are necessities for the novel, as in Finnegans Wake or Arno Schmidt, then Szentkuthy is the author who works the hardest to come up with a new species of complexity and a new endlessness.But the book is careless in its elaborations. For me, the most compelling part of the book is Chapter 1, which sets out the narrator's attempts to construct a novel. The entire book opens with an outline, in three parts (A, B, C), with several subdivisions, intended to support the production of a ""supra-fictional stratum"" that includes both an ""'object'-novel"" (""that is the ontological branch"") and a ""hyperaction'-novel"" (that is the mania for fictiveness""): in other words, a contemporary novel that has both essayism and narrative. This is Musil's problematic, and Proust's, and in Prae it is introduced in the most extravagant imaginable fashion: the first 44 pages of the novel are an extended, systematic elaboration of the outline on the first page, as the narrator struggles, and of course fails, to establish a ground for his novel, which of course never quite takes place. The chapter is outrageously complicated -- it's hard to hold in mind while you read, which is why Szentkuthy provides the outline -- and it's improbable, because it all turns on the narrator's distaste for his girlfriend's reaction to a hat in a store window. In addition it's preposterously abstract, because it is an elaboration of the impossible conditions of the ineffectual conceptualization of a project, the modernist novel, which wouldn't even be enabled even if the meditations would possibly ever be finished or make sense or be useful.This is not the same as the issue he works with Towards the One and Only Metaphor (1935), where ""the ontological branch"" becomes a matter of ""biological"" experiments, even thought it is still contrasted against a ""pathology of consciousness,"" ""self-analytical, and overscrupulous."" The ""pathology"" is more focused, in ""Towards the One and Only Metaphor,"" on language, because Szentkuthy is thinking more of Joyce's Work in Progress; and the ""ontological"" tends toward Szentkuthy's own biological and scientific or scientistic interests and his own theories of ""Baroque"" or ""Hellenistic-rococo"" writing. As László Németh pointed out, Prae's affinities lie more with Kantian critique than Proust or Musil. (This is in Rainer Hanshe's essay, ""Entering the World Stage: Miklós Szentkuthy's Ars Poetica""; Hanshe is founder of Contra Mundum, which published the English translation of Prae.) But Szentkuthy's affinities with Kantian critique, with what he thought of as the Baroque, or with modernist science, are his own idiosyncratic choices, and Joyce's Work in Progress was of interest because it was unassimilable. The problematic of Szentkuthy's generation, and the reason Prae is still of interest, is more general, and it is well set out in the opening chapter: it's the impossible meeting of essayism (whatever its subject) and endlessly refined, knowingly ""pathological"" thoughtfulness.I hope every novelist and historian of the modern and contemporary novel reads the opening 44 pages of Prae: they are the best example of the impassable swamps that lie in wait for any writer who still wrestles with the problems Proust, Musil, and Szentkuthy first experienced. Not much of this problematic has been solved: the novel remains ""unwritten,"" ""unwritable,"" a ""novel in parenthesis,"" a ""meta-novel,"" an ""anti-novel"": those are all Szentkuthy's formulations, written a hundred years ago....more",Notes are private!,2,24,1,not set,"May 15, 2016","May 15, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4132048-prae

These material interests of contemporary scholarship are anticipated in A.R. Ammons's ""Tape for the Turn of the Year,"" which was written on a single roll of adding machine tape. As far as I can tell (I haven't called Cornell, which has the original reel), there is no scan of the tape, and no facsimile edition. The book transcribes the tape, so we don't see Ammons's original monospace typewriter font, and we can only imagine the edges of the paper reel on both sides of the irregularly formatted text. Here is a typical passage. The passage uses three different indents, so it proceeds stepwise down the page. 1:26 pm:  I feel a little shivery : the cold's making-- forgive me--headway : but I just had a baked ham sandwich, glass of milk & coffee, that to be transformed into whatever ammunition it can :  after this, this long poem, I hope I can do short rich hard lyrics : lines that can incubate slowly then fall into symmetrical tangles : lines that can be gone over (and over) till they sing with  pre-established rightness :  here, I plug on : whatever the Muse gives, I release [p. 143] The overly wide margins in the book erase the constraints Ammons gave himself, and the pages cut the spool, as he knew they would. He writes intermittently about the roll itself: he watches it unfurling day by day, and tells us how he re-rolls the typed portion in an ashtray. He might have heard about Kerouac's On the Road scroll, done in the 1950s, and it is just possible he knew about some of the early Fluxus experiments; but my guess is he didn't know either. His points of reference were writers such as William Carlos Williams, Robert Lowell, Allen Ginsberg, Walt Whitman, and Robert Penn Warren. (He worked at Cornell University, where I had classes with him in the 1970s. He was one of the first winners of the MacArthur ""genius"" grant, and when a reporter asked him what he'd do with the money, he said he'd buy himself a new typewriter.)It may never have occurred to Ammons to publish a facsimile of his adding machine tape in monospace font with the edges of the tape made explicitly visible. He did have an interest in painting, and exhibited several times, but as I imagine it he wouldn't have thought that an image of the typewriter's embossed imprint, or even the red margins signalling the end of the tape is approaching (which he mentions several times; the red margins would have been visible at the center of the coiled tape roll as he worked) would have served any purpose except distracting readers from his voice. On the other hand, as the reader is reminded on every page, the project has a certain duration, requires specific arrangements (he unspools the tape at one point in order to take it with him on a trip out of town), and constrains each thought and line between its invisible margins. Tape for the Turn of the Year has an interesting awareness of its material reality, unlike the literalism of today's theories, where writers from Anne Carson to Garth Risk Hallberg make use of high resolution color scans to display as much as they can of the original manuscript's texture and presence. When Ammons asks himself   why do I need to throw this structure against the flow which I cannot stop? is there something unyielding in me that can't accept the passing away of days [p. 87]he doesn't mean the ""structure"" of the tape, its spools, his typewriter. He means the structure formed by their constraints, as they are represented in the book. That is a moderate, ambitious, and sensible alternative to today's insistence on the stuff itself, its mass, its materiality.Two other writers Ammons probably didn't know are Arno Schmidt and Marianne Fritz. Fritz was a half generation younger, but she rejected computers, and Schmidt died just before desktop publishing became possible. Schmidt and Fritz created enormous collages of full-size sheets they fed through their typewriters, making ponderous, enormous books. Schmidt, at least, was indifferent to the possibility of typesetting his work, perhaps because it didn't seem feasible. (His gigantic book Zettel's Traum was typeset after his death.) It's wonderful to think of Ammons, the oblivious American, working away only a few years later on his narrow, simple adding machine tape, as if he was self-consciously rejecting the imponderable European maximalist tradition. In many ways, that's exactly what he was doing: I remember him typing up Yeats's ""Leda and the Swan"" in a poetry class, just to show us how leaden and artificial it was. The mimeographed copy he distributed was nearly ruined by his many mistakes in typing, which seemed to be the result of an Oedipal struggle just to type Yeats's words. As a poem, Tape for the Turn of the Year feels as though it rides the first wave of postmodernism. It seems nearly unedited (we don't see strikethroughs or white-outs, if there were any) and it includes all sorts of unpolished thoughts, including elephant jokes (I haven't heard those since I was a child) and space- or time-filling observations, which he excuses by invoking the absence of the Muse. It also has flights of invention, and a wonderful, in the end entirely winning, mode of address to the reader: ""reader, we've been thru / a lot together : / who are you?"" (p. 200). It's as memorable a high-wire act today as it was when I first read it, when Ammons was younger than I am now....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"May 14, 2016","May 14, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/384104.Tape_for_the_Turn_of_the_Year

Each book tends to raises a different problem, so the titles are a way of keeping those in order.That first paragraph is written in emulation of the narrator in Mathews's book. He has recently had a nervous breakdown, and is heading for another. He decides to control his experiences by keeping a journal, and as the narrative progresses the journal becomes more and more elaborate. I bought this book because I am interested in the idea of writing a novel that becomes stranger as it goes along, until eventually -- in the version of this idea that the Norwegian novelist Thure Erik Lund recounted to Karl-Ove Knausgaard -- the novel itself teaches the reader an entirely new language. In Lund's metaphor, the language is Chinese, and the book becomes so complex, and at the same time so compelling, that by the end the reader finds herself reading in Chinese. (I heard this story from Knausgaard in April 2016, and I posted the pertinent information on Facebook on April 29, including interviews in which Knausgaard has retold this story of Lund's.)""The Journalist"" is partly such a book. The narrator becomes increasingly agitated when he is off his medications, and he calms himself by starting a journal. The journal becomes ""Chinese"" when he has the idea of inventing categories for his entries. At first he classifies all entries ""A"" for public and ""B"" for subjective or private. Then he divides both A and B into I and II -- I for for events that involve other people, and II for those that concern only himself. Then he divides each of those subdivisions into two parts, and then each of those subdivisions into two or three parts (pp. 84-85). From that point on, the diary -- the text of this novel -- is indented, to make room for the narrator's classifications of each thought, which run along the left margin: B II/a.1, A I,II, and so forth. For the first half of ""The Journalist,"" the diary is not presented as a model for the novel, but only as a diary. There is a passage in which the narrator's description of his project has an uncanny resemblance to one of Knausgaard's ways of talking about ""My Struggle"":""I know I'm not Plato, or even Boethius, not Diderot or Maganoff either. I haven't got profundity or clout, nothing but a devotion to the truth. So is my activity the pursuit of truth? It's a pursuit of the truth, a laborious, pedestrian, accumulative one, and not less than that. Not profundity but extensiveness (I escaped the lure of scope): establishing bounds as broad as I can imagine them, extending them day after day, and within them honestly gathering all I find."" [p. 185](Perhaps this would fit Knausgaard better if ""ambition"" were substituted for ""the truth."") But the diary concept works less well as the novel progresses. Increasingly, the narrator's project is an allegory of all fiction writing, especially when he reflects on the fact that it is an entirely solitary enterprise (p. 153), and also when he notes that he devotes ""more time, thought, and passion to it than to anything else"" (p. 191). The diary is less effectively proposed as an allegory of all fiction writing when the narrator has a fantasy that an editor might be interested in publishing the diary (p. 206); this isn't a convincing move on Mathews's part, because it makes a reader think of the author and his career, rather than the narrator, who is a generalized figure for a writer. In theory, then, this could be an example of a Chinese novel in Lund's sense. One reason it isn't is that a reader of Mathews's book skips by the narrator's obsessive annotations. For the most part the narrator's diary runs continuously on past the annotations, making it unnecessary to learn, read, or remember them. (In the allegory: you can read this book without learning Chinese.) At one point the narrator decides to write an index, and he does, but we never see it, providing an additional reason not to learn the new language. He also thinks of turning his journal into a journal about writing (a ""Journal of the Journal,"" p. 195), but again we don't see the results of that notion.The closest the book comes to Lund's, and Knausgaard's, interest is on p. 191, when the narrator ponders his ramifying classification system:""I imagine duplicating each existing category with its journalistic parallel: the first records an event, while the second records the even of its recording -- for every A I/b.2b, a J (for Journal): A I/b.2b (or it could be in quotation marks, A I/b.2b, and ""A I/b.2b""). I know that won't work. Consider this question: how can I include what happens when I write about A I/b.2b (what is happening around me, what I may be thinking, what my body is feeling, what is experienced by whatever one calls the soul -- the self? the selves? the shelves?)? If I put a duplicating frame around my old system, then I would have to make a frame for the frame, to include what was happening while I make the frame, to include what was happening while I made the frame, and then another frame for that -- a discouragingly infinite regression: not only A I/b.2b and J: A I/b.2b but J:J:A I/b.2b and J:J:J:A I/b.2b (or A I/b.2b, ""A I/b.2b,"" """"A I.b.2""""...). [p. 191]This is actually readable, and it is close to ""Chinese."" But it is the only passage of its kind. The book ends with a disjointed series of plot summaries, tying up the narrator's paranoid fantasies, making the entire book uncharacteristically, and unnecessarily, neat. I would rather have been compelled to read Chinese, all the way to the end, even if it remained, or even became, increasingly difficult, unrewarding, and incomprehensible. I agree with Lund and Knausgaard: there is something compelling in that model of a novel....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"May 10, 2016","May 10, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/397955.The_Journalist

Four related topics:Words and images in relation to the conceptual projectThis is a fascinating project from the point of view of images and writing. Four related topics:Words and images in relation to the conceptual project. This book is “an introduction” to the “conceptual groundwork” of a real-life project, which is a poem encoded in DNA in a bacterium, and another poem that is produced when that poem is read and translated by the bacterium’s cells into a protein. Presumably those actual poems, or the sum total of genetically modified bacteria, comprise “Book 2.” In this sense the images in The Xenotext are motivated differently from those in Crystallography. Both are “aesthetic” projects (the word Bök uses), but The Xenotext is explicitly an introduction to something that exists elsewhere, outside of books and even of human agency. That gives the images in The Xenotext a significance that images don’t have in any other work of fiction that I know: they point to real-world correlates in the way that scientific images ordinarily do.Questions of design. The graphics in The Xenotext are also more crafted, more polished and well-presented, than those in Crystallography. Their professionalism is partly an artifact of the professional chemist’s software that produces them: the ribbon diagrams and charge envelopes on pp. 105-12 are straight from the professional software. (Bök advertises that they were drawn with a supercomputer, but the graphics themselves, without the computing tasks he set, are routinely drawn on personal computers.) In other cases he has chosen fonts, line strengths, and spacing to make diagrams that are both professional-looking and designed. The result is that the QR codes and Conway’s “Life” game cells match well with the diagrams of amino acids (pp. 117, 118), which match well with the star chart that ends the book (p. 147). In Crystallography, some images seemed done on Bök’s own personal computer, others were collaged, and still others were photographed from 18th and 19th century sources (or from the internet). There is no such heterogeneity here. I mention this because the uniformity and care of the images in The Xenotext brings real, professional science into the book in a way that the poetic text does not. There is real genetics and laboratory work behind The Xenotext, but the poems and prose are highly inflected by Bök’s poetics. The images, by default, are what remain to represent genetic science. (There are minor exceptions, such as the chemical formulae in footnotes on pp. 118-37.) So both in terms of the book’s conceptual (and post-human) project as “living poetry,” and also in terms of the book’s design, the illustrations work as signifiers of science.The dialogic relation of images, diagrams, text. Throughout this Writing with Images project, I’ve been interested in the possibility that visual material might request or require the same amount of attention as text, so images would not function only as illustrations, examples, or ornaments, but would drive, inform, and otherwise direct the reading (This is theorized in Chapter 5.) Very few writers do this, Sebald and other prominent examples includes. The Xenotext comes the closest of any of the texts I’ve seen to accomplishing such an equality of images, diagrams, and writing.One part of the book in particular creates an unusual sequence of reading, in which an attentive reader, who cares about sense and not only expression, will have to turn back and forth repeatedly, from image to text and back. “The March of the Nucleotides” illustrates how a gene can be written as a poem, and used to produce a protein. Bök begins with a poem, constrained so it makes a spiral pattern, like DNA, and incorporates words that end in the conventional abbreviations for nucleotides (A, C, G, T). A plausible reading order here is:(1) background (p. 154), (2) description (p. 98), (3) diagram of the gene (p. 81), (4) diagram of the nucleotide molecule (p. 99; this is the least helpful or pertinent), (5) the poem itself (pp. 100-2), (6) the codons that produce the amino acids (p. 103), (7) the computer-generated images of the resulting protein (pp. 105-8), together with (8) their key (p. 104).Of these pages, only three are text. Four are colored printouts, two are line drawings, and four are formatted text. It’s the most complete integration of images and text I know, provided a reader is trying actively to follow the transcription process. If not, it probably disintegrates by stages into a reading of the poem and a glance at the other pages.The book’s style and tone. I’ll conclude with some thoughts on the book’s style, because they impinge on the question of constrained writing. It isn’t possible, I think, to agree with ers who say things like “his poems echo the strains of the ancients,” or “already these poems feel eternal, as if they’ve been with us since Virgil, since Homer.” The poetry is intentionally cosmic, portentous, and grandiose. Much is written in what Quintilian and Cicero called the “grand” and “ornate” style. But it isn’t at all simply “ancient” or “heroic” in the unironic manner of Virgil or Homer. “Colony Collapse Disorder,” which translates Virgil’s fourth Goergic are especially clearly the product of an early 21st century writer, especially because of the mixture of the stock of 18th century English poetry (“swales” and “swains” and locutions like “he hath leave to cross”), Swinburnean or Coleridgean excesses (“quenching,” “grieving,” “fountainous battlements,” and “distraught cries” from “damsels”), and contemporary jargon (especially including genetics). The opening section, “The Late Heavy Bombardment,” is a bombardment of stentorian, portentous, hyperbolic archaisms. (“What dire seed must these onslaughts have scattered, like shrapnel, across your cremated badlands”–sentences like that read like a comic book version of Geoffrey Hill.) Both sections are voiced with a combination of fin-de-siecle bombast and postmodern hyperornamentation, and if parts aren’t laughable then you might consider how you’re reading Virgil and Homer, or for that matter how seriously you’re taking the equally cosmic speeches put in the mouths of Marvell characters in movies. (I mean you’re likely not laughing as much as you should at the cosmic speeches of characters like the Silver Surfer.)(The Virgil material in particular is a curious addition to the book. I haven’t yet read a  that attempts to explain it. Bök suggests Virgil “guided a poet” (Dante!) in the way that he, Bök, guides the reader; he also mentions that a line from the second Georgic was the first to be encoded into the DNA of a plant; and he says in several ways that the fourth Georgic is about absolution and redemption for sending things like bees, and more broadly Nature, “to Hell.” But none of those would seem to justify the inclusion of an eccentric translation of the entire of the fourth Georgic. The insistent demands placed on a reader by the bizarre translation resonate in a curious way with the demands produced by the “poetic primer” of genetics. Both will be difficult for most readers, especially those who haven’t read the fourth Georgic, or don’t remember their college genetics. The disconnected parallel–a long text by a Roman author, and a long series of “primers” of genetics–reminds me of Derrida’s “clanging,” in Glas, between Hegel and Genet: they just don’t belong together, and yet there they are.)All that is saved from being fairly unremittingly unintentionally humorous by being constrained in many ways. There are at least three kinds of constraints:(1) Those provided by the conventional labeling in biochemistry: words beginning with “O,” for example, when it is necessary to signify Oxygen; or words ending in A, T, G, or C when it is necessary to signify nucleotides (pp. 100-2).(2) Those provided by poetics: the virelay, the lipogram, the acrostic, the grimoire, and so forth.(3) Those added by Bök to echo or elaborate (1) or (2): for example the limitation, in some poems, to words of exactly nine letters (pp. 86-95, 100-2). I think this self-imposed restriction, which he announces on p. 154, is intended to produce a harmony with the three-letter codons (in relation to pp. 100-2) — although of course the steps of the DNA ladder aren’t nine units across.These molecular, poetic, and aesthetic constraints produce produce a constantly unpredictable shifting series of warps that cannot easily be assigned to a single voice. The awkwardnesses warp the intended tone, as it does in the English translation of Perec’s La Disparition (A Void), which sounds sometimes like a mockery of 18th century prose, and other times like a tin-eared attempt to mimic some regional accent or creole. Those unpredictable effects are saving graces. Otherwise The Xenotext would be overrun by its author’s grandiosity. I especially like the weird repetitions he forces himself into in “The Virelay of the Amino Acids,” where he gives himself the task of writing a poem for each of the amino acids, restricting himself to words that begin with the letters of the atoms (Carbon, Nitrogen, etc.). What is weird, and effective, is that there’s no reason why the words couldn’t have been more varied (many words begin with “C” and “N”) but he chooses repetitions at the same time as he imposes repetitions on himself. The result is a language that tries to be both “grand” and “ornate” and is continuously hobbled. It is very effective, and I’m inclined to agree with Marjorie Perloff’s endorsement: “one of the most beautiful poems of our time.”The larger context of this  is here:http://writingwithimages.com/?page_id...(Scroll to the bottom section of the essay.)...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"May 06, 2016","May 06, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/25074233-the-xenotext

Mathews also offers this, as a generalization: ""The whole thing is based on misunderstanding language."" (tinyurl.com/6d2m862)""The Conversions"" is a series of short chapters, each with a story involving a puzzle. Some are descriptions of machines, exactly as in Roussel; others are translations of texts, or stories told by people the narrator visits. Each chapter is different in style, historical references, and in the kind of puzzle. Mathews is closest to Roussel when he describes machines, like the undersea clock that incorporates a miraculous acid held in place by magnets (pp. 164-71), the wasps who ""scorch"" bacteria, producing a cure for an epidemic (p. 51), or the painter's machine that supposedly produces unusual colors (p. 119-28).Mathews is more scholarly than Roussel, and he plays with Latin puns (pp. 110-18), German prose (there is a chapter in German, pp. 172-80), and French. He also knows more about some historical questions than Roussel may have, especially medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque music (there is a chapter on Orlando di Lasso). Those differences aside, much of the material in ""The Conversions"" could have been imagined by Roussel forty years before Mathews's book.Yet he is far from Roussel in two crucial particulars. First, he presents the solutions to each puzzle, or the impossibility of a solution, in each chapter, together with the puzzle. In ""Impressions of Africa,"" all the strange performances and machines are described in the first half of the book, and then ""explained"" in the second half, but the ""explanations"" prove to be as enigmatic as the expositions, and the overall ""explanation"" (that the performers are captives of the African king) doesn't come close to serving the ordinary function of an explanation, which is to dispel mystery or irrationality. But in ""The Conversions,"" each chapter concludes with the narrator's summary. Most chapters yield a small insight, and the narrator continues on to the next puzzle, as in a murder mystery. Roussel defers explanation, so that each new episode in ""Impressions of Africa,"" ""New Impressions of Africa,"" and ""Locus Solus"" accumulates a perverse and increasingly inexplicable--and for some, intolerable--opacity. Mathews writes more like an author of detective fiction, bringing readers along with partial solutions, promising clarity at the end. Second, Mathews ends by declaring the puzzle is insoluble. He does this abruptly, but there are also clues that the book as a whole will not resolve. For me, the strongest of those is the throwaway comment, toward the end of the chapter on the painter's machine, that the mechanism doesn't actually produce unusual colors for the artist, but is ""only a means of supplying him with material for the exercise of his talent"" --exactly in the way the puzzles serve the novel ""The Conversion"" rather than the truth of the narrative in ""The Conversion"" (p. 127). In the ""Paris Review"" interview, Mathews says:""The ends of my books are also designed in a way that subverts any illusion that what you have become involved in is anything but the book itself. In 'The Conversions,' as you approach the end of the book, you get to a part where the narrator doesn’t understand the last of three riddles. The whole quest falls apart. What happens next? You turn the page and are greeted with nine pages of German. This infuriated people.""This is far from Roussel, for whom it would be irrational and misguided (he might have said, more simply, wrong) to admit, in the book, that the puzzles and mysteries are only there to serve the art of fiction. It's the exact opposite: Roussel writes from the other side of the mirror, as if everything he is saying is in earnest, and the created world he presents is utterly true. That is the crucial move that ensures enigma, as Michel Foucault observed in ""Death and the Labyrinth.""So as an object lesson in the dangers of emulation, ""The Conversions"" shows that the temptation to copy or surpass the effects of a writer can miss the forest for the trees. In Roussel, the trees are fascinating and strange, but nowhere near as odd as the forest, which remains as silent and free of explanation as a real forest. In Mathews, the forest is literature, and the rules that produce his text, even if they are ""from Mars"" as Georges Perec once said, are in the service of creating compelling writing. Roussel had no idea about writing in that sense, because he was too deeply deluded....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,not set,"Apr 30, 2016","Apr 30, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/356261.The_Conversions

For some years sharply written direct narration (reported speech), using quotation marks and minimal contexts, has been associated with publications like McSweeney's and the New Yorker, and writers like Aleksandar Hemon or Richard Price. I don't know if there's been a study of this style, but it is taught in hundreds of MFA programs. Zadie Smith excels at it. It's often significant when a style doesn't have a name, because that indicates it may be taken as a natural vehicle of realism or sign of quality. Smith's dialogue is honed and alert. She's always listening to what's happening around her characters--they might be interrupted at any moment by an alarm, or a dog barking, or a neighbor. She's attentive to what doesn't need to be said. She describes contexts as minimally, telegraphically, evocatively, unexpectedly. Much of this book, and also the novel ""NW,"" is dialogue, and it seldom flags. There are vanishingly few false notes. Every sentence has to be read, nothing can be skimmed. The writing is taut, scintillating, resourceful, articulate, consistently engaging. Sentences ring true to the characters who speak them, their times, ages, places, desires. I dislike all of that. Why try so hard to keep your reader's interest, page after page? Why demonstrate brilliance, line after line? Why keep the energy fizzing, the quality topped up, the language razor-sharp? Why not let things go at different paces, go slack, run off track, wander? Why not rant for a few dozen pages, like Bernhard? Or mull indecisively, like Beckett? Or pause to describe, like Flaubert? There's a desire, in writing like Smith's, to keep the reader's admiration and attention at all costs. As if writing is a high-wire act and the crowd is incipiently bored: there has to be a cross-wind at all times or the spectators may yawn. I find myself both entertained and exhausted by Smith. As the books go on, it becomes increasingly difficult to care about her skill: I take note only when she does something especially spectacular, as in the scene in this book in which the narrator's infidelity is revealed to his wife with an exceptionally subtle expression, exceptionally subtly described. The philosopher Karsten Harries called this the ""kitsch economy"": the necessity to continuously up the voltage, to outdo previous effects, because audiences have become numb. After fifty pages, I begin to feel I have been devalued as a reader: the author apparently thinks I need to be entertained at every moment, that I have no way of taking in longueurs, no interest in diversions, little capacity for meditation. It's as if brilliance is style, rather than an ornament or strategy within a style.Smith has said, in an interview with the Paris Review, that she thinks there are more ways to be an innovative writer than carrying on the modernist experiment in writing, which she associates mainly with Joyce. She remarked that it's also innovative to bring new social configurations into novels, like the poor Londoners in ""NW"" or the mixed, transatlantic Afro-Caribbean characters in ""On Beauty."" Much of her appeal to ers and readers is her explorations of identity and ethnicity, and it is true that she finds subjects that have not yet been part of the discourse of novels. But she is wrong, I think, to equate that kind of innovation with the modernist experimentation with language. It's a category error: Joyce also had trenchant things to say about Dublin and Ireland, and Smith's new content still has to be expressed using the languages of the novel. The two sources of innovation are entwined, but one does not lead to the other. If you pretend that linguistic innovation is a thing of the past, you become oblivious to the indebtedness, possibilities, and obligations of your own linguistic practices. And there is a blind spot in her sense of her own project as a novelist, because her writing is deeply indebted to Joyce, especially the Joyce of ""Ulysses."" She uses a number of his innovations, for instance the device of having a character speak before he or she has been introduced, compelling the reader to keep going a while before the speaker's context and meaning become clear. She is, in fact, in the line that leads from Joyce to more recent writing, but she chooses, or needs, not to see her work in that way.Personally, I am not interested in Afro-Caribbean identities, or in campus novels as in David Lodge or Jane Smiley (and I'm especially not interested in depictions of my own field, art history), and so much of this book's content isn't engaging. That leaves the writing. It is breathless in its desire to capture my attention at every moment, and I find that it shrinks my sense of myself as a reader, giving me less scope to imagine or experience as I might hope. And I am baffled by the author's own idea that she isn't in the modernist tradition, that she isn't engaging possibilities of writing that began, for her, with Joyce. Surely it doesn't make sense to imagine the kind of dialogue in this book as being simply true to life, or merely beautiful, brilliant, or articulate dialogue: her style of writing has a specific history, and it echoes with the achievements of novelists of the past. But she does not imagine her work that way: apparently she thinks her skills as a writer serve her interests in politics, race, class, and identity, the way faceless servants once attended to Europeans who remained unconscious of their presence.Smith wrote a widely-read essay called ""Two Paths for the Novel"" (NYRB, November 20, 2008), contrasting Tom McCarthy's Remainder and Joseph O'Neill's Remainder. In the second paragraph of that essay she writes, of O'Neill's book:""For Netherland, our receptive pathways are so solidly established that to read this novel is to feel a powerful, somewhat dispiriting sense of recognition. It seems perfectly done—in a sense that’s the problem. It’s so precisely the image of what we have been taught to value in fiction that it throws that image into a kind of existential crisis, as the photograph gifts a nervous breakdown to the painted portrait.""I think this is a reasonable description of ""On Beauty"": if you subtract the perhaps unusual ethnic, class, social, gender, and political identities she describes, you're left with the form and presentation of a typical postwar campus novel: in its sense of dialogue it is compatible with the kind of writing I associate with McSweeney's, and it owes many of its strategies directly to Joyce, and it wouldn't be as it is without the intervening generation (Vidal, Cheever, Updike, Styron). ""Two Paths for the Novel"" critiques O'Neill for representing his characters' interiority, as opposed to McCarthy, who empties out. She also says, in David Haglund's words (New Yorker, February 27, 2015), that ""'literary language' is a kind of covering or embroidering over of tragedy."" But Smith does both these things: ""On Beauty"" is full of ""the authentic story of a self"" (Smith's words about O'Neill), epiphanies, interiority, and literary language. ""On Beauty"" is an example of the kind of writing excoriated in ""Two Paths for the Novel"": she is a postwar novelist, only intermittently interested in the genealogy she favors in her criticism (Perec, Blanchot, Ballard), only sometimes coming close to her favored values (""antihumanism, materiality, surface, entropy"" in Gideon Lewis-Kraus's words, Bookforum, February 2015). I find ""Two Paths for the Novel"" as annoying now, in 2016, as I did when it appeared: it is itself inauthentic. What is authentic is Smith's love of the people from a wide mix of backgrounds--African, African-American, Caribbean, European, English, and North American--trying to perform their increasingly problematic roles in new, often marginal, combinations of classes, incomes, places, and genders. But that is not related to the history of the novel, unless that history is nothing more than an inventory of subject matter....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,"Apr 12, 2016","Apr 12, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3679.On_Beauty

Rankine's ""Citizen"" raises different issues, and that note is also on this site. In ""Don't Let Me Be Lonely"" the use of images seems mnemonic, evidentiary, decorative, offhanded, generic, unformatted, and therefore almost always uninteresting. In order:1. Mnemonic: the many images of people Rankine describes, such as Abner Louima, Johnny Cochrane, Amadou Diallo (pp. 56-57), are given as reminders of what those people look like, to bring them briefly into the reader's imagination. There's nothing objectionable about this practice, but it isn't an interesting or necessary use of images.2. Evidentiary: those images are also evidentiary, in that they point toward the fact that Rankine's entire narrative is about real politics, real history, and by implication her real reactions. But ""evidentiary"" might be better applied to photographs that indicate the narrative is telling a true story, for example the mammogram with the lump on p. 8.(The mismatch between the ferocity of the text and what I think of as the marginalized use of images is echoed in the mismatch between the book's very extensive ""Notes"" section, which describes most of the book's references at length, and the very short ""Images"" section, which is less than a full page. The cases of Louima, Diallo, and others are documented in ""Notes,"" but often the ""Images"" file just says things like ""(c) John Lucas,"" as if there is nothing more to be asked or known about the photographs.)3. Decorative: some illustrations, such as the still of ""The Wild Bunch"" on p. 25, don't illustrate the points made in the text, and appear to be optional ornaments.4. Offhanded: for example the drawings of lips speaking on p. 40, which looks tossed-off, as if Rankine had decided she wanted an image, but not what she wanted out of the image. 5. Generic: for example the Google search bar on p. 72: it accompanies a specific idea of what might be searched, so it's too generic to be pertinent. It's not clear why a reader might want to be reminded of the general idea of a Google search.6. Unformatted: most of the images in this book seem carelessly placed on the page. Why does the text wrap around the image on p. 82, but not on p. 83? Why are the images narrower than the margins in most cases, but not in all? Why not decide those issues, especially if they might be distracting?This list could be longer. But these points are all symptoms: Rankine cares a great deal about her subject matter, but for her, in this book, images are ornaments, additions, extras, and bits of evidence. They are rarely objects of thought in their own right. The narrative seldom needs them; it's as if the narrative hardly knows what might be done with them. They never guide the story or argument. They are almost, but not quite, outside the text's imagination. (There are a few interesting uses of images in the book. I especially appreciate the repetition of the chalkboard marked ""THIS IS THE MOST MISERABLE IN MY LIFE,"" which is shown four times on pp. 17-18, accompanying a narrative about a disastrous change in the person who wrote it.)...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Mar 26, 2016","Mar 26, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/270903.Don_t_Let_Me_Be_Lonely

This author is concerned with putting what Baker calls his ""intelligence"" on the page. The topic--a young author's obsession with a famous author--doesn't really matter for this second model author. His book could have been about anything.In ""U and I,"" the first of these is nicely captured in Baker's meditations on the elusiveness of genius, the anxiety of influence, and the intemperate behaviors elicited by proximity to fame. The second is well captured by Baker's thoughts on ""intelligence,"" which he contrasts, late in the book, with ""genius.""I have a different way of thinking about these two model authors. For me, the first is fun, but trivial and trivializing. If I want depthless insecurity coupled (inevitably) with self-aggrandizement, I would rather read Salvador Dali. If I'm after a tortured imagination that bores into itself, guts itself, feeds off the guts, heals itself, and starts all over, I'd read ""Notes from the Underground."" By contrast with texts like those this is playful, and of course it's meant to be: but it's also meant to do a decent job of capturing most of what a youthful ambition and literary devotion is about.The second model author is much more interesting. There is an uncanny parallel, at times, between this book and the almost contemporaneous ""Infinite Jest."" Both are partly about pushing language so it is at once impeccably vernacular (faithful to what counts as spoken, or thought, language) and outlandishly technical (faithful to the microscopic discriminations that the authors see as their plague and their talent). Wallace was seven or eight years younger than Baker, but the authors who occupied his imagination (initially DeLillo, and then Markson and many others) were a good generation younger than the ones that concern Baker (aside from Updike, that's mainly Nabokov and James). Nevertheless the strain that both Baker and Wallace put on ordinary language is amazing. If Baker is less impressive -- and even now, three decades after Baker's book, and in this obscure venue tucked away among the thousands of anonymous internet s, I still hesitate to write this, because the narrator of ""U and I"" is so tensile with fear of criticism -- it's because his prosody has more to do with older writers, from Updike and Gass (who goes unmentioned) to White, Trilling, Wilson, and Nabokov, and finally back to James. This second author behaves himself better on the page; his periods are long and well-tempered, and so a little less of his ""intelligence"" gets out there on the page. Baker's problem is very much still current. There is no limit to this sort of search. People cite ""The Pale King"" as Wallace's knowing retreat from language fireworks, but it's an open question whether that could have been sustained, or applied to something outside of boring white-collar professions. Baker remains the best practitioner of the self-strangling virtuoso....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Mar 25, 2016","Mar 24, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/92541.U_and_I

It is said to be an ""epic,"" which opens a ""window"" onto a world many readers won't know, ""enriching"" our experience and making us more sympathetic to ""exotic"" customs and ideas. The book, in other words, functions in two ways: it's a romantic epic of a family, and it tells us about rural Brahman life in India. It's both documentary and entertainment, both socially responsible and escapist.Every once in a while there is a good reason to read a novel to learn about some unfamiliar part of the world. If I am intolerant, I can read something on the people I mistrust or dislike. If I need information that isn't available in nonfiction or documentaries, I might turn to a novel.But that is not what makes novels worth reading, writing, or thinking about, despite the fact that a high percentage of the current production of novels, up to and including writers like Zadie Smith, are meant to be ""informative"" about some part of the world. A novel is a way of recording thought, and of wrestling with the relation between thought and language. It really does not matter what the novel is about. If the novel as a form is taken seriously enough, it does not matter if it has any ""information"" about the world: Viswanathan could have made up not only her characters but everything about Brahman life.When the author is preoccupied with telling a grand romantic multi-generational tale of a family, and informing her readers about a culture they don't know, it is unlikely she is also thinking about the history of the novel, or about the most interesting things that novels might still do in 2016. ""The Toss of a Lemon"" implies a certain history of the novel, which includes 19th century English novels, Forster, Mann, Maugham, and late Romantics. If this novel was the sum total of what the 20th and 21st centuries have achieved with novels, there would have been no modernism or postmodernism, only a continuing belated romanticism, hoping continuously for a return to an impossible past. What Viswanathan really wants is mid-20th century popular romanticism, combined with an ideal precolonial authenticity.This is another book I read for the 2016 AWP meeting in Los Angeles, which turned out -- from this perspective -- to be all about novels as sources of information about the world, and very little about novels as historical practices, in which authors try to figure out what they can do with language and with their predecessors' achievements....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,"Mar 21, 2016","Mar 21, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/2694064-the-toss-of-a-lemon

It's a writing problem: I think the material does not do what she hopes it will, which is to help give her love story the grain of reality.It's tempting, in writing, to choose a body of knowledge to serve as a portable allegory for your story. ""Last Night in Montreal"" is a story about trauma and repression, and it is ornamented by a body of knowledge: the study of vanishing languages. The principal character, Eli, is writing his thesis (PhD dissertation) on the subject, and he is in love with a woman who has been vanishing her entire life: she was taken by her father from an abusive mother, and the father and daughter traveled for many years. The woman, Lilia, falls in love with Eli and takes a deep interest in his work. The book has many stories about exotic words and unusual languages.It is a common strategy to choose a corpus of knowledge and mine it for allegories and tropes. But it is seldom done well. In some books Richard Powers pulls it off wonderfully, and in others less so. You don't want to lecture the reader, and you don't want to break the suspension of disbelief by compelling your reader to ask how the author did her research. But above all it's not a good idea to parade facts as ready-made allegories.The following passage has all three faults:""Or the Australian Guugu Yimithir, a language of ferociously absolute positioning, in which there is no way to tell someone, for instance, that Lilia is standing to your left; you'd have to say, instead, 'Lilia is standing to the west of me.'"" (p. 44)This pontificates, it raises the specter of Mandel, peering into her book of vanishing languages and copying out the crazy exotic name of the language, and it presents us with yet another ready-made allegory for the difficulty Eli has in keeping, and later locating, Lilia.How to get around this? I can think of two possibilities.1. Do your research. There are a number of popular books on vanishing and dead languages, and Mandel must have some of them. But she has no professional-level literature. Her examples are often commonplace, and have a number of errors corrected in the scholarship. No one could write a PhD thesis listing 3,000 words that do not exist in other languages, because the very idea that the reason to save languages is the uniqueness and untranslatability of particular words has itself been debated in the literature since the 1940s. His topic wouldn't be approved as a thesis, because it's been done many times in popular literature. Much more interesting things are happening in the field than debates about the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, as it is called. It doesn't matter if a novel misrepresents a specialized field, or invents facts. What counts is that the real subject, comparative linguistics or ethnolinguistics, could have provided Mandel with far more interesting examples. It pays to do serious, concerted research to get inside the academic languages, so they can be brought into the novel from the inside, as if they are spoken. Eli could have talked and thought in more involved, surprising, and textured ways. If the subject was languages, grammars, lexica, and etymologies, rather than individual words, then the languages of scholarship, and the languages the scholars study, could have been woven into Eli's writing and speaking. That could have made his inner world much more complex, and, I think, more convincing. I would rather have encountered Eli's immersion in his subject (which Mandel describes as an obsessive, long-term fascination) as excerpts of an entirely new way of thinking, rather than as talking points from the popularized literature.This isn't a fault specific to this book. For me, the lack of real Chinese references in Canetti's ""Auto-da-fe"" is one of its problems. Even though he studied Asian languages, it doesn't seem to occur to Canetti that he could mention the fact that his housekeeper couldn't arrange his library in alphabetical order if she didn't read Chinese. (That is, the traditional Chinese ordering isn't alphabetical.) The fact that she does arrange his Chinese titles in alphabetical order shows that what matters to the author is the projection of erudition, and that puts a distance between reader, narrator, and implied author.2. Don't be afraid to invent. I can't be absolutely sure Mandel hasn't invented, but I recognize enough of her material to doubt she has. It isn't common to invent science or social science in a novel. Partly that's because it would be perceived as a leap into genre fiction or science fiction, but mainly because it isn't part of the imaginative project of contemporary novels to toy with science in that way. Jeffrey Eugenides said in an interview in the New York Times that he was proud of the science he'd had to learn, and it wouldn't be hard to assemble a number of such examples.But aside from the necessity of avoiding the appearance of having invented the science (which would turn the novel toward science fiction), is there a good reason not to change any of the science that goes into a novel? If everything else in a novel is invented or altered according to the novelist's wishes, why not the science? If Mandel had invented languages and words her book might have had a different texture, one less like a love story peppered with academic citations.I don't think this is an easy problem, and I don't think these two solutions cover the field. I'm still pondering other ways to work, but either or both of these could have contributed to making ""Last Night in Montreal"" more compelling....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,"Mar 08, 2016","Mar 08, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6105964-last-night-in-montreal

This book is divided in two: I have never been to Varanasi, so that half struck me as having been transferred as quickly as possible from experience to fiction, as if the details of the place would go stale if they spent too long in the author's head. The result is a kind of raw, sparkling immediacy, but the price is high: the scenes don't seen thought about, mulled over, transformed into imagination and back into prose. They seem jotted down and typed. The first part of the book, about the Venice biennale, is very familiar to me (I am an art historian). As a result I can understand all the references, and I can judge Dyer's level of engagement with, and understanding of, the art world, and I'm not interested -- and the result of that is I can read only for the idea of realistic detail; I can't be persuaded by Dyer's attempts to conjure the place or the people. As a result all the carefully gathered scenes, artworks, and characters seem to be revealed as gestures at realism, as the author's hopes of creating something that will be entrancing or persuasive. It's like looking behind the scenes at the opera, or like Barthes's ""S/Z."" What's left is the author's manipulation of his model reader's sense of anticipation, of drama, love and sex, society and career, aging and vanity... because nothing in the setting was of interest, I lost confidence in whatever interest I might have in the author's other concerns; and because I saw how he assembled elements of the biennale to make his mis-en-scene, I lost the ability to suspend disbelief in anything else in the narrative.A moral might be: if, as a novelist, you depend on veracity in travel-style writing, you need to also depend on readers' lack of knowledge of those settings. Or, to put it in a positive way, it is probably best to let the details of life sit in mind for some time, changing slowly into something that can only exist in fiction. ...more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,"Mar 04, 2016","Mar 04, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3690187-jeff-in-venice-death-in-varanasi

Mobilio notes that the book, like Lethem's earlier novels, was a mash-up of genres, in this case mixing hard-boiled detective fiction with a narrator with Tourette's, so produce an effect Mobilio thinks of as Keatonesque. Mobilio concludes:""In 'Motherless Brooklyn,' solving the crime is beside the point. If you're a mystery maven, this might bother you. Instead, this is a novel about the mysteries of consciousness, the dualism Essrog alludes to when he talks about his 'Tourette's brain' as if it were an entity apart from him. In a brief poetic interlude, he muses, 'In Tourette dreams you shed your tics . . . or your tics shed you . . . and you go with them, astonished to leave yourself behind.' Under the guise of a detective novel, Lethem has written a more piercing tale of investigation, one revealing how the mind drives on its own 'wheels within wheels.'""The book would be good if this had been true, but it isn't: like many writers and visual artists, Lethem was combining genres because he liked each of them separately, and the play of cognition and language that results provides only brief surprises and jokes, and not a fundamental rethinking of one genre by another or an undermining of one discourse's reality by the other. The same happens in music, with contemporaneous composers like Alfred Schnittke or George Rochberg. These are incomplete works, dissonant with themselves but without a sense that the author, or composer, has imagined that the interaction might produce a deeper unity, or an irreparable dissonance, or that juxtapositions themselves might itself be the results of a distracted consciousness. (For a good analysis of Schmittke along these lines, see Richard Taruskin's volume in the Oxford History of Western Music series.)In the 1980s combining genres in music (and in architecture) was a common artistic strategy, which produced ephemeral effects of surprise and gratified audiences who took pleasure in their capacity to enjoy and understand what was happening. In music especially, combinations of genres involved neo-conservative harmonies and avoided undermining sense and coherence. A good example of a more profound rethinking of the meeting of genres is Alain Robbe-Grillet's Jealousy. By comparison Lethem's juxtapositions are a kind of aestheticism: for him there's a pleasure in layering genres, because it produces a entertaining veneer of virtuosity and a frisson of unexpected, ""illicit"" combinations. (I originally wrote this around 2012; Lethem's work continues to be full of metafictions, ""intricate, ironic"" pastiches, pseudonyms, and collaged genres. Now he's on record explaining how he thinks it's incumbent on contemporary writers to use all the resources of our polyphonic age. Theo Tait's  of Lethem's The Blot in the London Review of Books, March 16, 2017, is an exemplary analysis of the shortcomings of this approach. Lethem is a minor novelist: it's not just that he misjudges the corrosive potential of pastiches, but also, more simply, that he has not found a voice outside the shifting embodiment of what he takes to be contemporary polyphony.)...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"May 15, 2023","Feb 28, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/328854.Motherless_Brooklyn

Ozeki's interest in her prose is utilitarian, by which I mean she wants it to carry a good story, keep the reader's interest, and move along at a good pace. She is seldom interested in the writing itself. The signs of this kind of writing appear on every page: brief sections, which often end in cliffhangers like ""But it was too late"" or ""Maybe I shouldn't have said anything""; descriptions that are just long enough to set a scene, as in a screenplay; grammatically simple sentences and dialogue; gestures to make sure the reader doesn't feel alienated (""I googled Marcel Proust and learned that A la recherche du temps perdu means 'In Search of lost time.' Weird, right?""). If a reader pauses to re-read a page, it's going to be because something amazing or heartbreaking or sentimental has happened, not because the description and the language were arresting.This condition of writing, in which the language is used to tell the story, is very common. It accounts for a large percentage of popular novels, and it is compatible with the current focus on identity, gender, race, political reporting, and memoir: if your interest as a novelist is telling your readers about the place you come from, your culture, or your identity, then your language should probably work as fluidly and unobtrusively as possible. Devices like footnotes and Appendices, both of which are used in Ozeki's book (she provides primers on Japanese terms, and on Schroedinger's cat), are ways of increasing the sense of reality or veracity: the exact opposite of their function in books like ""Pale Fire"" or ""Infinite Jest.""It's true that no novel is only about its writing, even though some, like William Gass's, put on a show of being about language. In the same way no novel is only about its subject. (There are several beautifully written passages in this book, like one on the body of a 104-year-old woman.) But Ozeki projects a sense of herself as a writer who wants to tell a story about life, time, Zen practices, and Japanese culture, and it seems she could do it in different media -- film, for example. I am only interested in novels that need to be written because language is at issue, and not only in footnotes explaining Japanese terms. (I am also unpersuaded by her concerns, which are the subjects of many of the other 6,000 s on this site! I'm not interested in her take on Zen, or her philosophy of time or culture, and I find her characterizations simple and sentimental.)A good book may not try to be about anything at all: the author may not be trying to tell me about her life, her country, or her beliefs. That doesn't mean it a novel can't be about all those things: it means the ""model author,"" as Eco called it, the one implied by the text, is mainly concerned with the struggle to represent thought.*I know that by posting this here, I'm apt to get some negative responses: I hope not.

Given the fact that Rankine's interest is life as an African-American woman, and especially the racism she has experienced, including all the ordinary, sometimes daily insults, condescension, unthought disrespect, half-noticed slurs, and other painful experiences, it does not immediately make sense that most of her illustrations are by well-known artists.

Carrie Mae Weems, Nick Cave, or Glenn Ligon have very different agendas and interests, and their work raises issues that are not mentioned in the text. The text's concern with everyday microaggressions and other obstacles to ordinary living isn't consistently legible in the images, which are representations of objects that have traded, sometimes for large amounts of money, in the art market.For me, the only way to read the illustrations in ""Citizen"" as apposite to the text is to think of them generically, as art, and not to notice, or to forget, the artists' different careers, intentions, and narratives. A few pictures are from the media, like the one of Caroline Wozniacki pretending to be Serena Williams (p. 36), or Hennessy Youngman (p. 23). Those fit the narrative perfectly. I wonder if a more careful selection of images, or more passages in the text meditating on the images and their meanings, might have raised the stakes for her main narrative by adding a level of reflection about what visual materials best give voice to the texts' concerns, and how the art world can be distant from everyday problems, or from publics that need convincing....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Feb 28, 2016","Feb 28, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/20613761-citizen

This is an inApproaching the Novel from OutsideI have been following Tan Lin's work for some time, and I have written on some of his books at length. This is an interesting experiment on his part, I think, because it spells out some of the aesthetic values of attention and memory, and some of the personal narratives, that have been fragmentary or abstract in the earlier work. It's a story of his visits to an aunt, and their time together watching TV.The narrative is more continuous (read: traditional) than in his other work, and the placement of images is more unobtrusive (they are alone on facing pages). There are footnotes taken from the internet, in a different font and a different format, which are reminiscent of the earlier work--more on them in a moment.For me, this book is about how Tan Lin has hoped to build descriptions of new states of attention, memory, and pleasure. Several of the ideas that fitfully emerge in the narrative about his aunt have been present in the sometimes isolated aesthetic and theoretical passages in the earlier books, but here they are embedded in a continuous meditation on his memories of his aunt, and that results in a kind of chafing between the memoir form and the philosophic or aesthetic inquiry--especially because the properties and meanings he wants to explain need to be put as surprises, apparently contradictions, and paradoxes. (My interest in this chafing comes from my curiosity about the relation between this book and his earlier books. It's also possible to read ""Insomnia and the Aunt"" as a short novel, without reference outside itself, except as autobiography. This is how Thomas Hrycyk reads it in a sympathetic  in ""Tin House,"" vol. 20 no. 2, 2018, pp. 100-102; Hryyck sees parallels between Tan Lin's family and his own, which was also unified, after a fashion, by watching TV. The only problem with this reading is that Tan Lin's work has several other dimensions, and this book reaches out to his aesthetics, his experiments, his ambient prose, and so forth. It isn't just an autobiography, and it doesn't explain the other books.)He is interested in the dispersal of attention and memory, the rewriting of boredom and time, the reimagining of packaged commercial media, and the repositioning of the self in a distributed network of mediatized messages. The resulting affect--the mood--is bemused, cool, sad in a thinly distributed way, and intermittently emotionally neutral or absent. I call all these ""minor aesthetic qualities,"" after J.L. Austin (and also after Kant, who was first to investigate them). They are becoming the objects of ordinary scholarship, for example in Sianne Ngai, so they are no longer experiences that only exist in novels and poems of noia and related experiences. In Tan Lin, they're in between, and that tension is constitutive of his project at the moment.The caalog copy was written by Patrick Durgin and approved by Tan Lin; it ends this way: ""Ostensibly about a young man's disintegrating memory of his most fascinating relative, or potentially a conceptualist take on immigrant literature, it is probably just a treatment for a prime-time event that, because no one sleeps in motels, lasts into the late night and daytime slots.""The ""ostensibly"" is a good description of the book's content; the ""probably"" names the author's ambition; and the ""probably"" is an unwarranted poetic extension of the book -- or a potential line in the book itself.B. Unresolved effects of the new narrative mode of writingThe shift from experimental bricolage or multimedia collage to more continuous narrative is not resolved. Sometimes the narrator is abruptly academic: ""If live TV is disturbingly real, canned TV for my aunt is a function of reincarnation, or maybe morphology, at once vague, causal, and novelistic"" (p. 20). He mostly writes with a calm Duchampian sort of detachment and bemusement, but that sometimes slips, for example into dire or deep pronouncements like ""somewhere in the world a TV set made my aunt disappear into the black and white wilderness that is the truth"" (p. 22). Some examples of unresolved juxtapositions or imbalances:1. All the footnotes are to web searches, and they're fragmentary and oddly formatted. That works, I think, as a nice contrast to the narrative in the text, except that some notes are fairly self-explanatory but others ask readers to go to a computer for explanation -- and there is no apparent reason why that should happen sometimes and not others. Footnote 6 begins:""Manipulating Ethnic Tradition: The Funeral Ceremony, Tourism, and... / by S. Yamashita - 1994...""You'd have to look that one up for it to make sense in context. But the note just after is immediately meaningful in context, and sufficient as it is cited. Why?2. Tan Lin has a tendency to construct sentences with two alternative images. They are usually presented in parallel, but one is opaque or unexpected and the other is consonant with the context and more or less expected. For example:""It is true that watching TV with my aunt, I experienced moods I could not find for myself, and those moods resembled a lover who has almost walked into a room or those patented colors produced by an expensive TV"" (p. 35). The first image doesn't make sense: what does it mean to say a person ""almost"" walks into a room? The second image is intentionally disconnected from the first, but makes good sense in context. I can appreciate Tan Lin's strategy here: these double-imaged sentences -- and there are many of them; they're one of his main strategies -- produce an effect of mild surrealism and also mild obscurity. But it's bothersome that he seems not to pay much attention to some of his images (why a lover? a room with what in it?), and more importantly that he seems to assume that such juxtapositions produce interesting meaning, what I call minor aesthetic qualities. But with fair frequency, the juxtapositions just seem devised in order to produce a calm, partly impenetrable philosophizing tone, and when they work that way, I think readers do not need to pay attention to the content of either image or their possible combination. I wonder if a stronger practice might be to produce careful balances of alternatives, and even to try avoiding the binary structure altogether.(There is more to be discovered about images in this book; Patrick Durgin informs me that he and Tan Lin ""collaborated on selecting images for the book and placing them in the text"" [December 2019])C. The imagesThe book's images are mainly models and pop-culture references that go with the text. They're not interesting, and they don't add much. But there is one amazing moment, right at the end, when Tan Lin describes a photo he says he took, but doesn't reproduce -- and then he writes, ""As you can see from the photo..."" (p. 50). It's a simple gesture, but it's wonderful, and I think unique in the literature. I don't know any other example, especially including Barthes's Winter Garden photograph, in which an unreproduced image is referred to conversationally as if it's present. (Patrick Durgin tells me that the photo Tan Lin supplied was labeled ""mother"": another curious potential parallel.)...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Feb 20, 2016","Feb 19, 2016",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/11326508-insomnia-and-the-aunt

When a book is said to be “relentlessly superficial,” it may be that it keeps promising depths that it does not deliver. This book is more “dependably superficial,” because we are told, by the book's style and voice, that it will not be plumbing any depths. A reader knows what kind of entertainment it offers. At the same time this is not entirely fluff, because it has a very curious and original narrative voice: the narrator speaks using the first-person plural...Here I'd say the same, except the narrative innovations are different. In ""To Rise Again,"" the plot is driven by a Doppelgaenger, who writes in the main character Paul's voice. Unfortunately this is only a plot device and not a voicing experiment. Some dialogues between Paul and Connie display a more interesting innovation. Connie speaks (she is quoted in direct narration), and then Paul reports to us in indirect narration and subjunctive voice: ""I told her, and she'd say..."" And then Connie's replies, in direct narration, are composed in such a way that we can deduce what Paul has just said. (p. 23 etc.) This might be Ferris's own invention. It works wonderfully, but it's only used four or five times in the book.I still think Ferris is a superficial writer with the capacity to invent interesting voices. I wonder what would happen if he gave up his other ambitions (to win the Man Booker, to get more endorsements from people like Sarah Jessica Parker, to be known for his commentaries on 21st century American life, to write more sharply than Baker or DFW or Saunders) in order to concentrate on a novel that does strange things to voice.(Note on this : I haven't been posting to LibraryThing or Goodreads in the last couple of years, because my reading habits have changed: I am reading and re-reading Musil, Proust, Schmidt, and some others, and I'm working on my own writing -- and posting notes on writingwithimages.com.)...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Jan 16, 2016","Jan 16, 2016",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/18453074-to-rise-again-at-a-decent-hour

(It would be good to know the history of this idea; it was in force in the reception of Kundera in the 1980s, but it probably derives from the reception of 19th century realist novels.) Point Omega is very brief, cleverly set by the designers at Picador with a large trim size and ample kerning and line spacing, so that it scrapes by at 117 pages. The book's brevity advertises its conceptual nature, and so do the opening and closing chapters (12 pages and 16 pages) describing Douglas Gordon's 24 Hour Psycho, the slowed-down video of the Hitchcock film.An idea-driven or conceptual or philosophical novel that is also brief runs a special risk, because the brevity declares that the resources of a full novel aren't needed. Point Omega has little character development, minimal psychological depth, a minumum of descriptive prose, and carefully attenuated opportunities for immersive reading. The book announces, in effect, that the author has had an idea that needs for some reason to be put as a novel—but employing fiction in such a spare way that it is only the novel's freedom of invention and narrative that matter. The opening rumination on Gordon's video introduces themes of patience, of not knowing what meaning something has, of listening and looking without judging, of being alone in reflection. Those themes reappear in both principal characters. Human connections are programmatically absent: both men are apart from their wives; the narrator doesn't quite connect with the only woman in the novel; in the end, the anonymous viewer doesn't quite connect with a woman he meets in the Museum of Modern Art. The video piece makes the experience of film unreal, and the desert setting of most of the book makes ordinary city life unreal, and both places are unreal in themselves. The book does sometimes behave like a longer, richer, less conceptually-driven novel, especially in the few passages when DeLillo takes time to describe people or places other than the video screening room or the desert. The same effect, of the possibility of a different kind of novel, also surfaces when DeLillo inserts examples of alienated experience: a woman who walks downstairs backwards (p. 32), the extinct North American camel, the age of the universe. These function as condensed or tentative allegories of the book's themes. (Critics seem to find DeLillo's descriptive writing to be exemplary: I find it intentionally abstract. Passages describing the desert, people's appearances, the house, and the video are intentionally minimal. He is not competing with traditional, realist, or late-romantic writers who show off the powers of their prose. Praising DeLillo for his evocations of desert misses what he is deliberately missing. This is flat description. Sharp edges are smoothed, and the book often reads like a translation, with generic words in place of peculiar or untranslatable words, with modifiers chosen by compromise. This is not to say DeLillo's ekphrasis of Gordon's work isn't effective: the smoothed prose is a good mimic for the textureless and nearly eventless surface of 24 Hour Psycho.) The widely distributed, apparently random moments of description and allegory seem odd or imperfectly realized, just because there could have been many more of them: it seems DeLillo thought he had to be parsimonious because his book was short, but that also means every such passage attracts attention, and its placement, length, and motivation seem less secure.Philosophically, philosophical novels are problematic because the ideas they offer can seem to be uninteresting as philosophy. In this case, the principal character has theories about how real life and existence are revealed when you attend to the low-level continuous sense that you're going to die. Point Omega proposes, in effect, that the temporal dilation of Gordon's video, and the spatial and temporal distances of the desert, can bring on that low-level awareness. In that state of mind, people become shells or tokens, their inner life inaccessible, their words unimportant, their physical existence insecure. Philosophically, that's not really news. And yet to say Point Omega ""proposes"" such-and-such a thing ""in effect"" is a way of saying it doesn't propose any such thing, even in effect, because it doesn't propose anything, because it isn't about effect—because it's a novel.(Much more on this novel, from a different perspective, on the blog 305737.blogspot.com, chapter 23.)...more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,not set,"Jul 17, 2015","Jul 17, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6595144-point-omega

In terms of content, there are good passages in the book, but the stories, and events tend to be maudlin, sentimental, and bathetic. The characters tend to be crazily fragile or horribly stubborn, wildly emotional, hopelessly thuggish, self-destructive, frozen with grief, paralyzed with inarticulacy, pickled in self-pity, rigid with rage, shredded by hopeless desires. There are murders, drownings, and hangings, but there are also terribly dysfunctional families, schizophrenics, and people with severe mental issues. Characters hurtle through the book's short chapters, displaying their tragedies, plucking at readers' heartstrings. To respond to this kind of frantic stimulation and breathless emotional stimulation, a reader would have to lack some interest in, or even some sense of, more complex characters and situations.But none of that has to do with the language, which is very interesting in its own right. Irish English (technically, ""Hiberno-English"") is full of idioms and expressions that are not in UK English or North American English. Ryan uses more than almost any author any I know, including Roddy Doyle. If you consult Wikipedia you'll find linguists distinguish ""loan words"" (mainly from the Irish language), grammar and syntax, and pronunciation. That classification doesn't include idioms, and it doesn't capture a distinction that makes a large difference for legibility for readers who do not speak Hiberno-English. I would distinguish two kinds of ""Hiberno-English"" expressions: those that require explanation for non-Irish readers, and those that seem not to. (With emphasis on the ""seem."")Examples of the first kind, which would require explanation: ""It was melting close so it was.""""He never threw a figure.""Example of the second kind, which seem not to require explanation:""His young fella seen me all right.""""They're pure solid ashamed of me.""He ""takes what money does be in my jar on the top shelf.""There is, perhaps, a third kind of expression: one so straightforward that it seems not to need an explanation and at the same time so minor, brief, or subtle that it can be difficult even for Irish speakers to explain. A good example is the first line I quoted:""It was melting close so it was.""In Ireland warm humid weather is commonly described as ""close,"" and it's easy to see ""melting close"" as a plausible poetic modifier. The last phrase, ""so it was,"" is ubiquitous in spoken Irish, so it is. People will add it to many sorts of sentences, so they will. But it isn't at all easy to say what it means, so it isn't. Linguists classify this use of ""so"" as an instance of ""reflection for emphasis,"" along with expressions like ""'tis herself that's coming now,"" but that leaves unsaid exactly what the emphasis provides. This seems to me like a good example of the insufficiency of linguistics when it comes to the study of fiction. ""It was melting close so it was"" does not mean ""It was very warm, really,"" or ""it was really very warm,"" or ""I want to stress it was very warm,"" or ""Gosh it was very warm"" or any other equivalent. It matters a lot, so it does, that even Irish people would have a very hard time explaining exactly what ""so it was"" is doing in that sentence ""It was melting close so it was."" Often enough, in my experience, it isn't grammatical emphasis at all. In this example, therefore, it wouldn't have anything to do with the weather. It would be a way of saying ""I'm feeling a bit friendly, so I'm putting things informally.""This brings me to the question of legibility and translation. All together ""The Spinning Heart"" has hundreds of Hiberno-English expressions; some pages have one or two in almost every sentence. I think that for Ryan, this is just a way of being true to the way people speak. It's the same motivation that generated Doyle's books, and for that matter it's behind much of Joyce. But unlike ""Ulysses,"" for example, there is evidence in ""The Spinning Heart"" that Ryan has not thought of his book's reception outside Ireland. There's a chapter written from the point of view of a Russian immigrant worker. He understands very little English, so he tells us. But Ryan chooses to write the chapter in perfect English, but stripped of the idioms and expressions of Hiberno-English. It is of course illogical -- not to mention improbable -- that a Russian worker who can barely understand what his foreman is telling him could write ""my fists were raw and scorched with pain,"" or ""I knew the way to a quay, on the edge of a lake of placid water."" As readers, we are supposed to experience the prose in this chapter as ethnically neutral. Of course it isn't: it's proper, non-colloquial literary English as practiced in Ireland. The logical choice, given that this book is composed of a series of chapters that are all first person, would have been to write this chapter in broken English. Ryan chose not to, and that implies that his use of idioms and other expressions through every other chapter in the book is intended make the book realistic and honest, rather than to help express individual voices and thoughts.It is not easy to see how a book as full of idioms and dialect as this one can work for foreign readers. I have been visiting Ireland long enough -- almost 25 years -- so I get almost all these Hiberno-English turns of phrase, but for non-Irish readers such a book can only be an unpredictable, uneven collection of familiar expressions and colorful, sometimes opaque expressions. Books this full of nuance are highly resistant to translation, but even within their own language they are effectively untranslatable -- or to put it differently, for an American reader this book will be partly illegible, in ways that the reader will not be able to judge. (Most readers will recognize a few Hiberno-English usages, and they will think they're getting most of the meaning: but it is in the nature of the second and third kinds of Hiberno-English, in my enumeration, that readers will not be aware what they are missing, or even, often, _that_ they are missing anything.)This gives rise to a curious paradox of legibility: a book like ""The Spinning Heart"" can be hermetic, provincial, regional or national, in a way that neither its author nor a foreign reader can understand. I think there is a theme here worth exploring for those involved in translation theory. Books in English that invest heavily in local dialect, idioms, and other ""non-standard"" usages -- for example some of Faulkner's, Matthiessen's ""Far Tortuga,"" or even ""The Palm-Wine Drinkard"" -- are usually considered adequately or even fully legible by people not native to those dialects. But if there's some truth in my notion that linguistic categories don't capture the nuances of expression in usages like ""reflection for emphasis,"" then books like this one are instances of an unusual category: a book that is untranslatable, even within its own language, because both the authors and readers unfamiliar with the dialect will assume they can understand it....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Jul 15, 2015","Jul 14, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15995144-the-spinning-heart

The narrator is a Red Cross volunteer who helps locate missing people; she ends up following a man to Pristina to see the exhumed body of his wife, missing for seven years.As the translator, Michael Mitchell, comments, the book's language is a juxtaposition of forensic information, including the Red Cross protocol for gathering information from survivors, and various kinds of poetic prose written in the second person. ""Frozen Time"" is interesting on that account, and also because it uses some Albanian words (such as hoxha, a Muslim priest, or Prishtine with an umlaut on the ""e,"" which is the Albanian spelling of Pristina). It is stark and sharply drawn: compelling as an act of witness but not as a novel. The narration is split between efficient, unadorned reportage of forensics and protocols, and the narrator's intermittently poetic but often literal-minded sense of what the bereaved man does and thinks. There is no consistent development of the narrator's own thoughts and feelings, which go in and out of focus for no clear reason. The man whose wife is missing lives in ""frozen time,"" so his feelings presumably hardly change: but in that ""hardly"" there is a lot of room for elaboration that never takes place. The feeling of being emotionally frozen gives the book its strength but also serves as an excuse to keep the book's tone battened down to a cold surface. A stronger version of this book could depict the struggle to feel--not only on the man's part, but on the narrator's. The back cover copy says she becomes ""personally involved"" with the man, but the nature of that involvement is so ferociously excluded--it is pushed out by the narrator's relentless second-parson reporting--that her interest might only be unreflective or even professional curiosity about other people's suffering. The book could also have been stronger if Kim had hinted that the narrator was drawn to suffering, pathology, or hopeless causes.

I don't remember anyoAn Early Twentieth-Century Novel with Shock AddedI may have read a dozen s of the Melrose novels, some of them quite long. I don't remember anyone mentioning what seems to me their principal characteristic in relation to the history of the novel. St Aubyn's style comes from a line of mainly English novelists, beginning in the 19th century but including Somerset Maugham, Graham Greene, and other early- and mid-20th century figures. There are differences: for example St Aubyn typically finds an arresting simile or description every sentence or so -- as if in helpless emulation of the bon mots he despises so virulently -- and doesn't normally permit unadorned dialogue or utilitarian description to continue too long until it's interrupted by an astonishing turn of phrase. In that he resembles Nabokov more than Maugham, but otherwise his emulation and perfection of an older kind of narrative is striking. He shares that kind of perfection of surface and craft with Hilary Mantel and few others.This is to say his prose presents itself as a perfected version of older traditions of narrative. His content -- which the ers emphasize -- seems different from his predecessors but really isn't: Maugham wouldn't have described rape and incest as St Aubyn does in this book, but he had his own strategies for measured shock. It's the balance, the control, that matters, no matter how ferocious the narrator's anger might be.""Never Mind"" reminds me of classical music competitions like the Chopin Piano Competition or the Tchaikovsky Competition. In those contests musicians offer astonishingly skilled, impeccably judged performances, but the music that's being played is almost always from the romantic tradition: Rachmaninoff, Prokofiev, and Medtner are among the few permissible 20th century choices. St Aubyn is like the young performers in those competitions: skilled beyond almost anyone's reach, but in a tradition that has been ending, fitfully, for the last century. Those who read him for his ""cold,"" ""shocking,"" ""clear-eyed"" ""evisceration"" of a certain upper class might also consider that those same adjectives would undoubtedly have been applied, in Maugham's generation, to the subjects he chose.

He has affinities to experimental, conceptual, hypertextual, metafictional, and other avant-garde writing, but his versions of those practices are awkward. He has the same relation to contemporary experimental fiction as Larry Rivers or David Reed had to abstraction and figuration in the 1980s, or George Rochberg or Alfred Schnittke had to postmodern music in the same decade: that is, he produces unmodulated juxtapositions of styles and modes, on the assumption that they produce new and expressive effects. Danielewski is also similar to Reed in that his books offer popular facsimiles of challenging avant-garde practices. I think this continuous partial misunderstanding of avant-gardes is true both of Danielewski's writing and his graphics. I'll say something about both, but first a note about what I am not engaging, which is what it seems most readers engage--the book's wide range of references, plots, puzzles, steganographic and other encrypted clues. I'm not interested in novels that present themselves as puzzles. It's a lack of interest I share with Naipaul, who said something of the sort in an interview when someone asked him if he read murder mysteries. I'm also largely uninterested in what is taken as erudition or breadth of reference: that sort of thing is always relative. After you've read some of what Schmidt, Sebald, Canetti, or Steiner have read, then erudition evaporates as a value, and becomes what it always is: a specific sequence of things an author knows, which are arrayed against the many things the author doesn't know. Occasionally, as in Harry Mathews, intellectual puzzles and arcane references can be of interest; but in Danielewski that possibility is squashed, for me, by the poor writing.If you are interested in Danielewski's intellectual puzzles, there are various sources: a good  in the ""Los Angeles Review of Books"" (laofbooks.org//the-unfami... a forum (forums.markzdanielewski.com/forum/the... and a discussion group (thefamiliar.wordpress.com). See also the update at the end of this .1. Writing""The Familiar"" is a combination of nine narratives -- the number evokes of the lives of a cat, which is also a ""familiar."" Various ethnicities, nationalities, trades, and classes are diligently and exhaustively represented, using clichés of places, characters, situations, and narratives. The writing is plot-driven in the way that trade paperbacks commonly are. Here is an example, from a scene with two policemen:""Long time, Oz,"" Officer Nyra Carlton bristles. And smiles. Same as when she had her clothes off. Always bristling. And smiling. ""Still think I'm a bitch?""""Well some people think I'm an asshole.""""You're kidding,"" Nyra smiles. ""Who thinks you're not an asshole?"" (p. 163)This is trade paperback writing. ""Bristles"" is a cliché. It's hackneyed to add ""And smiling."" as a separate sentence. And the line ""Same when she had her clothes off"" is from bad pulp fiction. Some readers will want to understand this as broad parody. It is intentionally broad, but it is not parody, because there is no ironic distance: the policeman ""bristling"" and imagining the woman naked are the sort of mechanisms drive the story forward. The narrator approves of his choices, he doesn't mock them. Even Tom LeClair, who has supported Danielewski for many years, wasn't entirely convinced by these chapters that ""don't always manage to defamiliarize"" (New York Times, May 22, 2015).I think Danielewski imagines that clichés of ethnicity and identity are meliorated by the interpolation of Armenian, Hebrew, Spanish, Russian, and Chinese characters. But graphical details like that merely interrupt pages of problematic narrative. The chapters with the character called jingjing, for example, are awkward in comparison to William Gibson's evocations of mixtures of Chinese and English, or even to David Mitchell's. An Armenian character is especially awkward because his thoughts are written in abbreviated pidgin English (whithout connectives, and with singular nouns and present tense verbs): but no one thinks in pidgin; that particular character would presumably think in Armenian, but speak in pidgin. It's excruciating either way. Why read chapters with characters like Oz and Nyra Carlton in them when there are writers like Richard Price?""The Familiar"" is related in interesting ways to literary fiction. In a section toward the end of ""One Rainy Day in May,"" we are introduced to one of the ""Narcons,"" which stands for ""narrative constructs."" These are entities (possibly coded software-like programs) who know everything about the characters in the book. This particular Narcon knows every detail of every movement and thought of every character, at al possible moments of their lives, even ones not described in the books. This is a sci-fi version of the omniscient narrator, and the fact that the Narcon talks to us is a sci-fi version of postmodern metanarrative. But it's awkward and naive, because it is not thematized throughout ""The Familiar"": only Narcons are aware of the narrative itself: the rest is rigorously non-self-referential and non-self-aware. Given that we're approaching 100 years of experiments with self-aware narration, this is a radical simplification of a long tradition of modernism and postmodernism. (A harsher version of some of these ideas can be found in Michael Schaub's ""Guardian""  ""The Familiar by Mark Z Danielewski  – what the font is going on?,"" 2015.)2. GraphicsDanielewski is known for the visual nature of his books, and that is what prompted me to read this. (In connection with writingwithimages.com.) But his typography and design are gauche and often poorly thought through. Some examples, divided because they're separately debatable:(a) Characters are identified by typefaces. There is a list at the end of the book, which is helpful for learning the books' characters. But if you're going to alternate typefaces, why choose such common ones? Why represent the book's main character, the girl Xanther, with Minion? (Is it a private joke, because she's something of a minion?) Why use Garamond, Imperial, Baskerville, and other common faces? It makes a small amount of sense to represent the Chinese character jingjing with a monospace font, rotis semi sans, because Chinese typefaces include monospace roman for transliterations of non-Chinese words, but other than that none of the matches make sense.(b) And why print the default fonts so large? One character, Özgür, is represented by an enormous boldface Baskerville, which makes those pages look like they're printed for people who need large print to see. The pages scream for no reason.(c) There are some effective graphic interventions, such as a series of double-page spreads in which a line about counting raindrops becomes streaks of rain, but many more that make almost no sense. Each chapter begins with a color illustration; the chapter title and an epigraph are superimposed in text boxes with black borders. The colors are bright, sometimes garish -- more like advertising or cheap science fiction than like serious graphics, photographs, or illustrations. The borders around the text boxes make them look like what they are: badly done homemade desktop publishing. Many of the images are manipulated using the simplest tools and filters: he would have been better advised to let someone else do the work for him. In this respect the graphics in ""The Familiar"" are like the awkward homemade graphics in William Gass's ""The Tunnel,"" which he once told me -- unbelievably -- were intended to be as hamfisted as the narrator's writing.(d) The upper outside corner of each page is colored, with the colors keyed to the characters and chapters. Again the colors are garish and seem randomly chosen. Danielewski either has no color sense, or he is trying to go for maximum visibility, Edward Tufte fashion.(e) The Astair and Anwar chapters make use of multiple parentheses. For example:""As might be expected with such a ridiculous (and arrogant(?) (even wince-worthy) pursuit (""Quest!"" Fabler had shouted in his office) the paper had not come easily."" (p. 121)But expressive punctuation has been done so much more expressively, so much more inventively, so much more wildly and sensitively, by Arno Schmidt. In other chapters the parentheses serve more logical purposes, for example:""Astair had no doubt (though) that when Xanther saw the dog (((might have happened already (even now?) when) she threw those gangly arms around its neck (petted it and brushed it (and later walked it and watered it and fed it))) when she named it) all Astair's doubts would join that dim..."" (p. 445)Danielewski sometimes arranges his parentheses so he can surprise readers with many parentheses closing at once, like this )?)))?).But this sort of thing has been done so much more excessively, and compulsively, by Raymond Roussel in ""New Impressions of Africa.""(f) The unintentionally hokey and gauche quality of the graphics extends to the cover design (thick laminated, with a punch-through number ""one"" and a diagonal cut flap) and even to the endorsements: on the half-title page, they are typeset to run diagonally down the page and into the gutter, as if to suggest there are many of them. Each is surrounded by a little microscript frame, reading ""praise praise praise."" But the device of running boxes is uninteresting, over-familiar, and unspecific to the subject: it is the rote application of an inappropriate, unmotivated graphic device.Update, winter 2017I won't conclude this , because there are 26 more volumes coming; the fourth has just been released. Danielewski's editor's assistant at the AWP (Association of Writers and Writing Programs) meeting in Los Angeles in 2016 told me 10 volumes are ""firmly"" under contract. Despite their bulk, these are not long novels: the editor's assistant said they're about 80,000 words each, which would make the entire series 2,080,000 words, which would put it just over Jules Romains's ""Men of Goodwill,"" the novel that tops Wikipedia's list of the world's longest novels. I wonder if that could possibly not be intentional.Update, 2022In spring 2018 Danielewski announced, on Facebook and Instagram (February 2, 2018) that ""The Familiar"" had been ""paused."" Pantheon had canceled the series at 5 volumes. He has a very active fan base, with several concurrent reading groups (including one for ""The Familiar""), and a massive Google Drive folder filled with fan-generated material (the link used to be http://goo.gl/mjQQTf).

He calls Pitol ""the greatest Spanish-language writer of our time,"" says he has a ""passion for confusing life and literature,"" and that the crucial marker of his style is the idea of ""fleeing anyone who is so dreadful as to be full of certainty.""But this book is disappointing. Pitol does confuse life and literature, or rather, he is immersed in literary imagining, and his mind is populated mainly by the names and lives of hundreds of authors. In that it's like Vila-Matas's ""Dublinesque"" and his other books. But an indifferently veiled autobiography of the author whose imagination consists entirely of other authors is not an easy subject. One thing it requires, I would think, is real engagement with the ghosts, the literary voices, the contemporaries. Vila-Matas's ""Bartleby & Co."" does that very well, because it is about paralysis, inaction, abnegation, and the lack of words. Here the names are just a cavalcade of Mexican and other authors, as in some of Bolaño's work, but without even his interest in mixing literature, imaginary stories and real politics. Pitol is safe inside his world of authors: they are a comfort to him, they're the air he breathes, they nourish his imagination. The authors he thinks of do not haunt him (as writers haunt Pessoa, Borges, Bolaño, as they bewitch ""Bartleby & Co.""). In fact the novels Pitol has read seem barely to talk to him except in generalities and stray remembered quotations that serve more as decorations than insights, and this novel's philosophic moments are mainly asides that come up when Pitol has a temporary respite from the continuous rain of thoughts about publishing, fame or its absence, literary lineages, schools, manners, communities, and histories.This is the literary life as cocoon. Sometimes the threads of an author's cocoon can be so fine, so capacious, that they seem like the air itself. The cocoon seems to disappear, and the author imagines himself in touch with the raw world itself. But this is not life, this is embalmed and becalmed and proof against any intrusion. Pitol reminds me, in that respect, of the late Bellow, so warmed by his self-regard and the praise of the friends and readers he'd chosen.The only parts of the world that intrude are clichés. The book opens with some awful pages about Venice, in which the narrator rehearses all sorts of commonplaces about the city: he knows they are episodes from the history of the city, because he's read so much fiction and poetry set in Venice: but it doesn't seem to occur to him they are all, every last one of them, comforting clichés, received knowledge, the sort of thing Bouvard and Pécuchet would have tried and abandoned, the sort of thing Pessoa or Beckett or Bernhard would never go near....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Apr 23, 2015","Apr 23, 2015",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/25164310-the-art-of-flight

Often it's scholarly as well as beautiful: Usher provides transliterations and translations, and the lists are reproduced in high-resolution photographs.

There is also Ghandi's list of social sins,Usher is also interested in lists that slightly disrupt our sense of artworks: for that there's Dickens's list of ""available names"" for characters, a list of alternatives to Rudolph (the red-nosed reindeer), and a list of Disney's alternate names for his Seven Dwarves.But lists have a much more varied history (beyond popular culture and self-help) and there is a different reason for being interested in them now that Usher does not seem to care about. The first problem is historical: what are the histories of the list? And the second is critical.1. The historical problemIt is reasonable to assume the list has diverse histories depending on its uses. A couple are represented, briefly, in ""Lists of Note."" Japanese literature might comprise one history in itself. ""The Pillow Book"" is mentioned in Usher's book, but it is largely disconnected from the majority of his entries, and from other Japanese examples such as Kenko. (Usher doesn't have a high-resolution color facsimile of an early edition, which may indicate his distance from that corpus.) Another history might include lists drawn up by Renaissance humanists. Usher has two entries by Leonardo, but he misses Leonardo's Codex Trivulzianus, which is devoted entirely to lists. Rabelais would be a principal Renaissance source and precedent.Artists' lists would be another lineage. Usher includes the Anthony Tommasini's list of favorite composers: Tommasini is a conservative classical music critic for the ""New York Times,"" and his list is not interesting, but it is an example of a vast literature of artists' lists of their favorite artists. (Roger de Piles comes to mind as a premodern instance.) Another kind of list, perhaps the most numerous, is the ""laundry list""--business lists of trades, prices, employees, food, and so on. There are ancient lists in this book, but they play a minor role and don't fit well with the many entertaining popular culture entries. Ancient lists survive in many archaeological contexts and could have been a book in their own right.And of course academics would always want to include the list Foucault attributes to ""a Chinese encyclopedia"" in ""The Order of Things"" (there is a good study of the source of the list, which leads through Borges but is still unidentified). Foucault's list stands in not only for epistemologically disordered lists, but also for surrealist juxtapositions in general.These are random thoughts: I'm not aware of any historical s of the concept of the list. There is an essay by William Gass, ""I've Got a Little List"" (thanks to Dan Weiskopf for alerting me to this; it's in ""Salmaundi,"" 1996), but I do not know any historical treatments.2. The critical problemI am more concerned with the fact that there is a different reason why a book of lists should be published today: experimental or ""conceptual"" writing is deeply involved in the concept of the list, and that is what could make a book like this timely rather than arbitrary. Usher does include one list by Georges Perec, but he seems uninterested in contemporary lists by experimental writers. The book ""Against Expression: An Anthology of Conceptual Writing"" (2011) has enough such lists in it to count as an anthology of lists in its own right. (And it might have been a more interesting book if it had included the lovely color facsimiles Usher reprints, especially because conceptual poets are often involved in typography and layout.) Here's an arbitrarily chosen, incomplete list of examples of this different kind of list:A. David Antin's ""A List of Delusions of the Insane: What They Are Afraid Of"" which begins:the policebeing poisonedbeing killedbeing alonebeing attacked in the nightbeing poorbeing followed at nightB. Charles Bernstein's ""I and The,"" a list of words in order of their frequency in English, arranged into three-word lines:I and theto that youit of aknow was uhin but isthis me aboutjust don't mywhat I'm likeC. Michael Gottlieb's ""The Dust,"" a list of things found after 9/11, which begins:UHF Tower Mast AVHF Main Antenna Bracing, SoutheastLeft Rear Wheel Assembly, RetractorRadome ArrayFirst Class Galley Convection Oven Number OneFirst Class Galley Convection Oven Number TwoThere are hundreds more lists in ""Against Expression,"" and several thousand more on the internet and published as artist's books and with small presses.I don't mean to imply lists like these form a coherent, single movement, although the editors of ""Against Expression,"" Kenny Goldsmith and Craig Dworkin, claim that they do. I think there's some basic work to be done distinguishing lists that have been made by contemporary writers with the intent of avoiding or erasing conventional writerly expressiveness (this is a claim Dworkin and Goldsmith make), and lists that have been made with the intention of recovering genuine expressiveness from the few places where it can still be found, such as dictionaries and apparently impersonal collections (this is a claim both editors also make). ""Against Expression"" is deeply self-contradictory in its aims, but it is firmly contemporary. ""Lists of Note"" is genial, beautifully done, and entertaining, but has no special claim on history or the present except for the list's intrinsic power of cutting across cultural contexts.3. Philosophical questionsPartly aside from historical genealogies and current critical questions, there could also be a philosophy of lists. Again, I don't know such a study. William Gass's essay comes close, and it's also, as usually, unremittingly poetic. One of his observations seems a nice point on which to close: ""Normally,"" he writes, ""lists are the purposeful coming together of names like starlings to their evening trees. They tend to confer equality on their members, also like starlings in their evening trees.""...more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Jan 13, 2015","Jan 13, 2015",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/23123095-lists-of-note

These remarks start with the contemporary movement, and then I turn to Queneau.1. The state of constrained writingCurrently rule-bound or constrained writing is associated with the movement broadly known as ""conceptual writing,"" which itself blends several potentially different ideals. First there's an interest in unoriginality (in not creating new work, but quoting existing texts), but that is itself historically unoriginal. It develops ideas that Perloff has associated with Walter Benjamin, but I think are better assigned to Charles Reznikoff. (Reznikoff is Goldsmith's real rival in ""New York: Capital of the Twentieth Century,"" not Benjamin.) Along with unoriginality goes a commitment to avoiding expression, affect, sentiment, emotion, or any representation of interiority or mental states; that is not original either, because it continues themes of modernism initiated by Duchamp and Dada. Both unoriginality and the movement against expression are often displayed in texts that are constrained by rules, as in Oulipo. Conceptual writing's historical unoriginality is acknowledged in Dworkin’s own history, which presents conceptual writing as a belated development inspired by 1960s conceptualism in the visual arts. I don’t find Dworkin’s genealogy convincing: conceptualism in visual arts had different goals, was pushing against different constraints, and used different strategies, and was articulated using different theories: it does not belong with conceptual, unoriginal, and anti-expressive writing done 40 years later. The literature on conceptual writing could benefit by a different intellectual lineage, and also by engaging the literature on postmodernism in music. Richard Taruskin’s account of postwar “classical” music is especially good for its description of Boulez’s attempt to avoid expression in the late 1940s. Music has gone through many of the same fascinations and denials as conceptual poetry, but several decades earlier than the conceptual art Dworkin cites. Another source that isn’t cited in the conceptual poetry literature is Stanley Cavell’s “Music Discomposed,” written in 1960 as a response to Krenek’s ""Sestina"": Cavell is good on the radical mistrust of expression, which recurs today.Conceptual writing performs its interests—in found texts, in avoiding expression, and in constraints—in an especially self-aware and systematic fashion, and that is in itself a kind of originality. In that sense conceptual writing is a typical belated avant-garde, as theorized by Peter Bürger and Hal Foster, with the attendant lack of critical purchase and complicity with the conditions of production.It has been widely said that Goldsmith’s books are more conceptual than readable. (A minority of readers have also insisted that Goldsmith’s books are compulsively readable precisely because they seem unreadable: but that shows a desire to find expression precisely where expression has ostensibly been excluded—another theme well articulated in the late 1940s in music, especially in the Darmstadt school.) What can make it interesting to read an unoriginal, intentionally ""expressionless,"" rule-bound project? One reason we read is to see the effect of the constraints: whether they are legible, or can be discovered; how they distort whatever writing they are imposed upon; whether they produce new kinds of affect. Another reason it can be interesting to read a constrained writing project is to discover exceptions, flaws, lapses, and liberties: we read for diversions from the rule. And this brings me back to Queneau's book.2. QueneauIn ""Exercises in Style"" there are a dozen or more kinds of deviations from the author’s own constraints, and those deviations are repeated so that they become themes in their own right. They are, for me, the source of interest in ""Exercises in Style,"" and the reason why Queneau is more engaging than Goldsmith or other contemporary writers. Here are a few forms of deviation in ""Exercises in Style."" (These remarks are based on the English translation, which departs from the original in unusual ways: but those departures aren’t pertinent here.)(a) The logic of individual entries sometimes fails. “Animism,” in which the story is told from the point of view of a hat, runs into trouble when “he (the hat) suddenly went and sat down.” (“He” didn’t; the man under him (the hat) sat down.) The end of that entry falls apart into ellipses: “…an extra button… on his overcoat… to tell him that… him… (the hat).”)(b) Some entries add more to the story. “Official Letter” is the first to do this: it adds two paragraphs, which feel like the start of a short story.(c) Some entries fail to do what they promise. “Logical analysis” is just a series of brief statement, which must have reminded queneau of syllogisms: “Me. / Me. / Me. That’s the third character, narrator. / Words. / Words. / Words. That’s what was said.”(d) Some entries contradict others, building up a Rashomon-style conflict. “Insistence” tells us that the bus was full “because it was 12 noon”; “Official Letter” says the bus was overloaded because the driver “had accepted an overload of several candidates.” (pp. 54, 63).(e) Some entries permit themselves brief additions at the end, and others don’t. “Ignorance” adds a surprising sentence at the end: “For instance, I remember my father was always telling me about…”(f) The “Unexpected” last sentence in the last entry is therefore not a surprise: its form is the same as the brief additions in several other entries.(g) Some entries require and display skill; others do neither. “Noble” is exceptionally skilfull, for example. “Free Verse” includes a nod to Lautréamont.(h) Some entries do several things at once: they could have been split. “Cross-examination” also has some odd verbal play that has nothing to do with cross-examining. (“it proved to be that of a slightly hypotonic paranoiac cyclothymic…”)(i) Some entries use the key concept, or title, as an excuse to invent something entirely different. “Spectral” is an entirely new project.(j) There are three basic kinds of entries: (i) Metaphors, deliberately overdone, like “Gastronomical,” “Botanical,” “Medical.” (ii) Genres of writing, such as “Noble” and “Cross-examination,” and the ode and the operetta. (iii) Classical rhetorical categories, abused. Why aren’t these the only kinds of entries? Why aren’t they ordered? How did he decide on them? These are all sources of divergence from order.(k) Some entries are based on classical rhetorical categories, but they abuse those categories. “Metathesis,” “Antiphrasis,” “Paragoge,” “Epenthesis,” and others apply the rhetorical tropes, intended for lines of poetry, to individual words. Why, then, does Queneau not similarly abuse his examples of genres of writing, or metaphors?This is, of course, an open-ended list. But it is not an infinite list, and that’s why it’s a source of interest in reading the book. “Flaws” like these—actually deliberate diversions, which the author permitted himself—are why books like ""Exercises in Style"" are engaging, and why contemporary conceptual (""unoriginal,"" anti-expressive, rule-bound) writing often isn’t. It is not necessary tosmuggle expression in by performing texts, or to permit certain kinds of expression (such as affect, as if it were separable from expression), in order to create troubled and compelling texts, the sort that reward reading as well as thinking. All that is necessary is to ruin your own rules, and to do so in a symptomatic and puzzling manner.

First, because the psychology of the first part, in particular, is so complWhat is Psychological Complexity?Why revisit ""Notes from Underground"" now? First, because the psychology of the first part, in particular, is so complex that it continues to evade readers. I know I did not understand much of what the narrator was proposing when I first read “Notes from Underground” in high school or college, and I was curious how much sense it could make to me now. In particular I wondered if it could be a model for psychological complexity in contemporary fiction.Second, it is interesting to consider a book as influential as this while thinking of at least some of the many authors that influenced it and were influenced by it. For me that very crowded field raises questions of reading: how is it possible to comprehend an authorial voice, or a narrator’s perspective, in a book that is the confluence of so many writers’ voices?1. What is psychological complexity in a novel? And how might ""Notes from Underground"" be exemplary of such complexity?I dimly recall from my first reading of “Notes from Underground” in high school or college that I couldn’t quite put myself in the narrator’s place: I couldn’t understand how he reasoned, or feel things the way he did. In part that’s a theme of the book, but the imaginary “gentlemen” who are addressed throughout do understand what the narrator is saying, even if they think his ideas are ridiculous. I remember I didn’t even understand why the “gentlemen” would laugh or object or argue (as the narrator supposes) at certain points. There were many tell-tale signs that I was not fully understanding the personality that was being presented to me.It turns out I wasn’t alone. There is still an active literature on what Dostoevsky intended, and what his principal concepts are meant to signify. I think a fair number of conscientious readers still have difficulty understanding the narrator’s psychological state and his beliefs, and in distinguishing those from the author’s. (Several recent scholars just propose the narrator is identical to the author.) “Notes from Underground” has, in this sense, an exemplary psychological complexity. It might even represent a certain limit of complexity for the novel. (In that respect it is significant that the book’s first part departs from the novel form in the direction of the political or psychological treatise, as if the novel form weren’t sufficient for the ideas.)Two remarks on the secondary literature before I continue. An example of the kind of misunderstanding I think still exists in the literature is Alina Wyman’s essay “The Specter of Freedom: ressentiment and Dostoevskij’s Notes from Underground” (Springer Verlag, online, 2007). She mentions scholars who connect the theme of resentment in “Notes from Underground” with Nietzsche’s ressentiment, but she prefers Max Scheler’s Nature of Sympathy (1954), which “sees the origin of this moral malady in the perversion of Christ’s teachings rather than in His original message, as Nietzsche does.” (Nietzsche would have hated Scheler! The very idea that ressentiment can be remade into a gateway to Christian faith, or that “the most effective preventive remedy against ressentiment” is forgiveness, go against the entire diagnosis of Christianity in Nietzsche’s account.) Wyman is interested in proposing the author of “Notes from Underground” as a Christian apologist: the text, she writes, “turns our attention to the ‘costs’ of the Christian ideal: in a world exposed to the ultimate horizon of desire through Christ, those lacking the serenity of faith may be doomed to the merciless torment of ressentiment.” But surely this is not in “Notes from Underground”: it can be read, retrospectively, back from Crime and Punishment, but that is a reading from the outside—from above ground. The narrator has both the philosophic bent of Ivan Karamazov and the ""Smerdyakovism"" of Smerdyakov in ""The Brothers Karamazov""--that is, a pointless perverse systematic evil--but little of Alyosha's redemptive spirituality. (""Smerdyakovism"" comes from an excellent piece by Kostica Bradatan, Los Angeles Review of Books, July 31, 2014.) In the earlier literature, “Notes from Underground” seems to have been itself underground. (Perhaps someone who knows the history of the reception of individual Dostoevsky texts can help me with this.) Scholars were interested in Dostoevsky’s politics and his Christianity, and “Notes from Underground” did not fit those themes. “Humility is the first and foremost virtue for Dostoevsky,” according to George Strem (Russian Review, January 1957), who only mentions “Notes from Underground” once, in passing. It makes sense that Marmeladov, in Crime and Punishment, “seeks self-debasement with an almost masochistic abandon, for it is his way of atoning… for his sins,” Strem says, but that kind of explanation wouldn’t work with “Notes from Underground.”So what constitutes psychological complexity in this text? It isn’t the anti-utopian polemic, which has been well studied; and I hope it isn’t the narrator’s tendency to claim things he’s said aren’t true, because iterated self-doubt exists much more extensively in Beckett. Complexity could be said to be the effect of the different concepts Dostoevsky has his narrator introduce, one after another, in the form of a philosophic treatise—but for me, enumerable concepts are not in themselves a source of complexity, even though they become complex when their connections begin to appear. Here are two proposals for how complexity arises.First, complexity appears when the first numbered section moves quickly through five or six propositions: the narrator is spiteful; he knows he is neither spiteful nor even embittered; he knows he cannot actually have any qualities; he asserts that “intelligent” people can never have qualities (they can never “become anything”); and finally, that nineteenth-century men “must and morally ought” to be “characterless.” Those are all different states of mind, and they are not presented as simultaneously present in the narrator’s mind: they aren’t successive insights, but views on a problem that might recur, in any order. This is the fourth of William Empson’s seven types of ambiguity: a complicated state of mind that is revealed by a number of mutually contradictory or incompatible ideas, which are not all present in the author’s mind at any one time. If the exposition here—which is typical of the first part of “Notes from Underground”—is understood as a partly randomly ordered succession of thoughts that are themselves never fully present in the narrator’s mind, then there is no possibility of fully understanding the ideas proposed in the text, and also, at the same time, no possibility of achieving an orderly partial understanding. Second, it is psychologically complex when, in the second numbered section, the narrator says he is firmly convinced that “every kind of consciousness” (including, by implication, the five or six states of awareness of spite and character in the opening numbered section) is a “disease.” That is, on the face of it, a condemnation of anything the book might contain: but before he can develop the thought, he says he will “leave it… for a minute,” and he poses a question to the reader: why is it, he wants to know, that when he is most susceptible to feeling “the sublime and beautiful” (in scare quotes in the English, as if he doubts them altogether), that he finds himself also capable of the most “ugly” thoughts and actions? A reader will want to guess the answer is spite, because that is the quality the narrator introduced in the opening section: but what makes this complex is not that spite is the wrong answer, but that the question has occurred to the narrator at all, especially just after he has made his claim about consciousness. As the section develops, it turns out that self-loathing, bitterness, and an overly intense awareness of degradation can become sources of pleasure, and that theme is the one that ends up being developed in the short novel that is part two of “Notes from Underground.” But again, that isn’t in any obvious way an answer to his question about how ugly sentiments arise from the possibility of “the sublime and beautiful,” and it isn’t clearly related to the opening idea about consciousness and disease. The ideas are all related, and it is possible just to read through this and the following sections, noting the themes and concepts: but the narrator’s way of thinking here is, I think, extremely difficult to follow. It has an illogic (really, almost a sort of dementia) that is different in kind from the themes that are being proposed, and that contrast—between ideas that are individually problematic and connections between them that are difficult to grasp—is a second source of complexity.Neither of these two sources of complexity seems to bother the scholars I have read, who are more interested in ressentiment, spite, divided consciousness (see Aileen Kelly, on Slavic Review, summer 1988), character, cleverness, cowardice, pride, boredom and ennui (section 5), laziness (section 6), perversity (section 7, for example), utopias, and so forth. The secondary literature seems mostly concerned with philosophemes, constrainable concepts, and political and religious positions. Those are all important, and to a large degree they can be extracted from the text and discussed individually. But the text itself is of another order. It is, I think, a model of psychological complexity even for the contemporary novel, and it is so for reasons like the two I have given, not for ressentiment, character, and so on. As an appendix to this sketch I want to register skepticism about another common reading, which has it that ""Notes from Underground"" is a record of endless thinking, structureless meditations, wandering directionless ideas and impressions. The more I read the book, the less I see of that. It is tightly directed by an intense desire to make sense. It's a matter of how much energy and attention a reader can bring to bear.2. How is it possible to read a book that is the confluence of so many writers' voices? Can such a book be read, or is it more a matter of listening in on simultaneous conversations?Some of the voices that echo in the book belong to philosophers. Schopenhauer is present whenever the narrator speaks about his will, blind will, the will of the masses. Nietzsche is anticipated—not only his readings of Dostoevsky, but his criticism of Schopenhauer—whenever the narrator speaks of overcoming or resentment (more on that later). This book was clearly important to Kafka: the underground man is continuously shivering, blushing, hypersensitive, insecure, haunted. I also think of Kafka when I laugh, nervously, at the outrageous self-destructive things the narrator says, especially toward the end when he uses a sequence of what might be called the world’s worst pick-up lines on a woman he ends up rejecting anyway. I don’t think Musil would have been possible without the underground man’s “characterless” life. Poe is in the background of passages about the narrator’s “cave,” and his haunted life. Freud comes to mind whenever the narrator wonders how much of his life can ever be understood, and when he speaks against reason and rationality. I hear Thomas Bernhard (I mean of course Dostoevsky’s influence on him) whenever the narrator rants and rages in unstoppable pages of prose. (“In the next room two gloomy, angry-looking persons were eating their dinners in silence…. one could hear… nasty little shrieks in French: there were ladies at the dinner. It was sickening.”) I hear Gombrowicz’s Ferdydurke in the narrator’s reminiscences of his abysmal school experiences. And then of course there are the Utopian philosophers Dostoevsky was writing against, and the Russian, English, and French contemporaries he was outdoing. James Wood proposes ""Rameau's Nephew"" as a source, and he also thinks Stendhal's Julien in ""The Red and the Black"" is a model. The list could be enormous: the book is crowded with voices.I wonder if the only way to read such a book is as a palimpsest, or as a Bakhtin-style dialogue. The very presence of so many voices, however, makes the search for the author’s voice more pressing. The tendency, I think, is for the author’s voice to be forced into a void: it appears as the opposite of all the other voices, or as the remainder when the other voices are subtracted. (I would note in passing that this problem cannot be adequately resolved by reading the book as a conversation among many writers’ and philosophers’ voices. That kind of reading gives up on the pressure the text itself has exerted on history. It would not be an echo chamber if its author’s voice had not been so strong.)For me, Dostoevsky’s voice comes out most strongly when I consider the architecture of the text. It has a famously odd structure: the first part is a philosophic treatise in a confessional mode (that anticipates, for example, Nietzsche’s later books), and the second is a short novel or a long story that appears, inevitably, to illustrate the first part. This strange double structure—philosophy undermined by a confessional voice, confessional novel undermined by philosophy—appears, by default, as Dostoevsky’s own. I also hear Dostoevsky in the entangled flow of his thoughts, which isn’t the same as any of the writers I’ve mentioned: but I am aware that if I were to write at length on that trait, my analysis would appear as the opposite of whatever models, precedents, and standards contrast against it. In my search for something that might count as Dostoevsky’s voice in “Notes from Underground,” I also think of his other novels (an unavoidable, if only partly legitimate, way of approaching the problem), and biographies such as the stupendous book by Lenid Typskin (I have remarks on that on this site). This search becomes even more of a conundrum when I realize that the problem of finding the author’s voice is very common, because it also happens in weak or average novels, written by mediocre authors whose voices are the sum total of their influences. Here, where Dostoevsky’s voice was the opposite of anything weak or undefined—it was enormously influential as a voice, and continues to be—the number of authors influenced by the book creates a facsimile of the same problem. I do not have a good answer to this second problem....more",Notes are private!,1,20,1,not set,"Jun 22, 2016","Aug 08, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/456469.Notes_from_Underground_The_Grand_Inquisitor

Period.,” posted June 29, 2011. That  is almost as off as this book.The question COWS raises (the book seems to be cited in all-caps, which is appropriate to the way it shouts its perversions and obscenities) have to do with the place of extreme subject matter in art. In visual art, it’s common for students to become interested in violent or disturbing images, such as photos of car crash victims or medical deformities, and to try to use them in their work. Often it turns out to be unexpectedly difficult to use such images simply because they are so strong. A photograph of a man with Ebola just won’t fit with a collage of other images of Africa. Artists who have tried such experiments have sometimes found they need to work hard to aestheticize the difficult images: Andres Serrano’s beautiful, nearly abstract morgue photographs are an example, and so are some of Joel-Peter Witkin’s elaborately staged, faux-antique photographs of people with various medical conditions. (The intricate aesthetization of the unusual images, as Max Kosloff pointed out years ago, is a way of counterbalancing the subject matter, and somehow making the image into art.) For a contemporary artist it shouldn’t necessarily matter that the resulting artwork is harmonious—the purpose of choosing strong images, after all, is seldom to produce a pleasing or harmonious effect—but somehow it does. Despite the aesthetics of discontinuity and collage instituted by postmodernism, despite a half-century of work done without interest in aesthetic effect, we still find that very strong images don’t work as fine art unless they are elaborately contextualized, made to work aesthetically. It’s a puzzle that we still want our art, in these cases, to be nominally harmonious and coherent. And it’s interesting that given all the pressure contemporary artists face to be avant-garde, difficult, new, politically visible, strong, or persuasive, and in general to stand out against a crazily crowded field—that given all that, it’s interesting that the very strongest images are not more commonly used.COWS is a way of thinking about that. It is not a good novel by a number of standards. It’s awkwardly constructed; its inner monologues and dialogues are seldom persuasive; it doesn’t respond to the last fifty years of fiction except in glancing allusions to some other extremist authors; and its writing is often mechanical. Stokoe doesn’t seem to have thought about the fragmented consciousness of Naked Lunch, or the ecstatic prejudices and violence of Céline. His rebellion is presented in the mold of simple fictional forms and basic narrative devices. I don’t think Stokoe is an especially good writer. But the book is more than memorable: it is, I think, entirely impossible to forget. And that is because of things that happen in it. I will mention just one: the main character breaks off his mother’s teeth, fixes his anus over her bleeding mouth, and shits, forcing her to eat. What matters in this book is extreme violence, perversity, and repulsion. I think those three shock effects (as Roland Barthes would have called them) are different. Extreme unexpected violence is repellent in one way; perversity works differently; and visceral repulsion is partly another matter. When these three are used together, the effects are disorienting partly because they are mixed in ways that are hard to separate. I think that to make headway on this problem of extreme subject matter (or images) it is necessary to distinguish these, and probably others, and consider them one by one. (Barthes distinguishes five species of photographic “shock” in Camera Lucida.) A purer version of COWS could be imagined, for example, in which nothing violent, immoral, psychotic, or perverse takes place, but the world is full of stench, slime, and opportunities for nausea. In that simpler version of COWS, it might be easier to see what kinds of narrative work would need to be done to bring the nauseating elements into dialogue with the rest of the book. I don't really have an idea how to perform such an analysis, partly because I can see how the ingredients work together to produce the book's effects, and partly because I can't enumerate the kinds of extreme subjects, acts, and descriptions. Are there more than three? Is visceral repulsion separable from moral repugnance? Is there a sexual perversity different from moral perversity? Another way to put this would be to say that COWS makes a rum mixture of a large number of important provocations: morality, ethics, sexuality, perversity, nihilism, sadism… nearly every concept I have mentioned in this , including beauty and harmony, is contested. But that observation is just another form of the puzzle I mentioned at the beginning: why, if a book manages to combine all these, is it not more or less automatically an important book?A version of this problem has been well studied in the case of de Sade, where repetition plays a central part in the creation of the pornographic effect. But it strikes me a lot more work needs to be done to understand why a book as wildly imaginative and consistently extreme as COWS can be a minor novel, one that doesn’t need to be on the must-read list of everyone interested in contemporary writing. By the same token, more thought needs to be given to visual artists like Joel-Peter Witkin to understand why they feel the need to work so hard on their extreme images in order to bring them into the domain of fine art. Why, in the 21st century, should the extremely violent, the extremely disturbing, the extremely repulsive need to be aestheticized? It has been almost forty years since the inception of the anti-aesthetic, and longer since Duchamp: we have questioned nearly every sense of unity, harmony, and coherence that once existed, not to mention every sense of beauty, decorum, and moderation. So how do we know so clearly that COWS is not an important book? ...more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,"Sep 23, 2016","Jul 30, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/815760.Cows

Even in translation it’s often funny, and there are entertaining characterizations of Georgians (they aren’t comfortable in Europe, they blush easily) and people from other nations (especially Russians, but also Chechens, Azeris, Armenians, Belarusians, Bulgarians, and Romanians). The many portraits of nations and temperaments are excellent: as soon as the narrator breathes “the aroma of Europe” (p.23) and realizes Portugal isn’t as impoverished as Georgia, he is a mass of insecurities and projections. Bugadze is candid about how people encounter and invent national temperaments, and the book is an interesting snapshot of some ideas of Europe as seen by a Georgian born in 1977.All that is a matter of entertainment. More engaging themes emerge when the book turns to literature. One of the writers, a Bulgarian, has had a story published in The New Yorker, and he has distributed copies so everyone can see what he’s done. The story is about a couple in Sofia at the time of the Second World War, and the narrator concludes that The New Yorker took the story because Bulgaria seemed fashionable at the moment, and because of the perennially fashionable theme of the Second World War.“Of course, if a woman sits at the window in your story and the year is 1939, it’s even awkward [I like that translation, “even awkward”] if she’s not planning on hiding a Jewish friend and, on the other hand, she’s not in love with a Nazi officer. But we face a dilemma here: your local readers are fed up with what foreigners find interesting in your Bulgarian stories.” (p. 143)For that matter, the narrator thinks, Georgia has had some very recent wars, and maybe that’ll help Georgia to be the flavor of the month for The New Yorker. But he’d rather write about real human stories, like the love story that propels The Literature Express. Even local politics is boring. Bugadze’s narrator imagines a reader who would say, “Give me a pure woman… and give me some romance. Give me some sex and the probing hands of a man, some rain, bullets, and blood, but keep the frigging referendum out of it!”So in The Literature Express, Bugadze has produced the book his narrator wants: it’s really about love and more or less harmless clichés of nationalities, and not about politics. For me this raises two questions, either one of which could have deepened the book:1. It seems very right to say The New Yorker publishes based largely on what are considered new or unfamiliar combinations of nations and ethnicities. But that begs the question of style. Clearly all stories that include “a pure woman,” “rain, bullets, and blood” aren’t equal, but what distinguishes them? The answer isn’t clear in The Literature Express—it would be something like passion or honesty—but from a New Yorker perspective what distinguishes a good story from one less good would be something to do with writing. To some degree that’s about the history of fiction in the last hundred years, and what counts as challenging or contemporary; and to some degree it’s the infamous house style of The New Yorker, The Paris Review, McSweeney’s, and other North American venues: but however it’s judged, style is also always what’s at stake, and that is never mentioned in The Literature Express. It’s as if writing is somehow a record of passions and temperaments, sensitivities and sensibilities. That’s ironic because this book is well written, even in translation, so Bugadze must think about these things. But his characters are oblivious of them, and that’s hard to understand given that they’re all writers. Where is discussion of style, manner, voice, skill, narrative, and the entire history of fiction?2. At the end, Bugadze makes it clear that the writers are all “mediocre.” They didn’t have any interesting or original ideas, and they were driven by the usual ambitions. The narrator is expressly included; when he emails the trip’s organizer saying he’s writing a novel about the experience, the organizer says everyone is. He also admits he missed the central love story, because he didn’t realize the woman he was pursuing was in love with someone else—so he isn’t especially skilled in narration or insight. In a crucial sentence the narrator says:“I didn’t now have anything more important to describe.” (p. 220)That’s verbatim. Is the Georgian original something like “I didn’t now have anything…” or is there another thought in the sentence, left untranslated, something like “I now knew I didn’t have anything…” It makes a difference, but either way the narrator includes himself in the general mediocrity. And that, to me, is a puzzle. Does Bugadze mean he embraces his average thoughts? The book seems indecisive, even coy, as a satire: we're to take it as the work of a man of average ideas and ambition: but then why suddenly make a point of that at the end? The turn in the last few pages to these thoughts of inevitable mediocrity makes the book hard to understand as a literary document. What, exactly, is literature here? And why is it worth pursuing? It seems national stereotypes and hapless love affairs are so distracting that they insulate the writer and his readers from other kinds of questions....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,"Jun 21, 2023","Jul 30, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/18765788-the-literature-express

Why Form and Content Should Be Connected in Constrained WritingThis book isn't simply ""in the line of writers such as Raymond Roussel, Raymond Quen1. Why Form and Content Should Be Connected in Constrained WritingThis book isn't simply ""in the line of writers such as Raymond Roussel, Raymond Queneau, Georges Perec and Harry Mathews,"" as Ashbery says in the back cover copy. That's because, unlike those authors, Abish does not try to match his stories with the constraints he gives himself. His linguistic constraints are ""terrifying and irrefutable,"" as Ashbery notes (chapters from A to Z and back to A, each one containing only a subset of letters of the alphabet), but the stories he tells are carefree and sometimes funny.I think this matters because in the Oulipo tradition, the stories that are told have some correspondence, in tone, philosophy, pointlessness, or absurdity, to the rules the authors impose on themselves. That correspondence is the glue that binds the books together: otherwise Perec and others could have simply taken existing novels or newspaper accounts (as Goldsmith and others do) and subjected them to predetermined rules. The lack of correspondence in ""Alphabetical Africa"" is its principal characteristic. After you have marveled at what he's done with his alphabetical rules and laughed at his stories, you're left wondering whether the two have collided randomly, or for surrealistic purpose, or whether, in fact, Abish never thought through the possible meanings of the lack of correspondence between his insouciant stories and his rigid rules. More on this at the end.In Perec's ""Life: A User's Guide"" the elaborately constrained writing is in close harmony with the stories of the people in the apartment building. Just as the principal character tries to make a life that will sum to nothing, so the writer's constraints produce a distorted narrative that cannot conform to ordinary novels. In Roussel, the elaborate rules (which are, in contrast to Perec's, largely unknown, despite Roussel's own book on the subject) are in intricate and hidden harmony with the acephalic, obsessive, or autistic behavior of his principal characters and his narrators. ""Alphabetical Africa"" has a sort of humor I recognize in other authors of the 1970s. He is interested in Africa's politics (""But can Alva's claims also cure Americans bombing Chad beaches. Anyhow, all concur America's angst cannot corrupt Chadians,"" p. 6), in the absurdity of the places he visits, and in the ridiculous continuation of colonial and tourist expectations, but he is insouciant about most of it. He is untroubled about mentioning that his characters take acid: they are who they are. The result is a politically invested but carefree tone that reminds me, in a different sphere, of Arlo Guthrie. He spins cliché plots about dictators, spies, and murders, and he weaves in tourist impressions and fears, all in a kind of deadpan colloquial collage. Meanwhile, each chapter in the first half of the book adds another letter, and each chapter in the second half subtracts one, and the machinery of that expansion and contraction works alongside the stories but almost never to any determinate purpose. A reader watches the first letters of many words, and also attends to the stories. The result is not a surrealist juxtaposition, because it so often seems that Abish is simply trying to write well, in spite of his own constraints. The first chapter ""M"" is not exceptional in this regard:""M""My memory isn't accurate anymore. Mentioning my memory makes me feel insecure. A few months ago Alex and Allen kidnapped a jeweler in Antibes and killed him almost inadvertently..."" Because this is chapter ""M,"" a reader will be watching for Abish to display as many m's as he can. So the second sentence here, with four m's, stands out. But the sentence immediately following serves the purpose of furthering one of his stories. So it is not clear how we are expected to attend to the alliterations. Are we to read as Oulipeans for part of one sentence, and then forget that regimen, and think instead about the plot? When ""Alphabetical Africa"" is funny, it is so in spite of these linguistic constraints. (The first chapter ""C"" is an excellent example: it's really funny, and doesn't suffer, but also doesn't gain, by being constrained to words beginning with ""a,"" ""b,"" or ""c."") Same when it's violent, or absurdist, or intentionally hackneyed.The principal expressive option here would be surrealism: the stories would be juxtaposed in unexpected and irrational ways with the language used to express them. But that does not happen often, or consistently, and sometimes it seems not to happen intentionally. In most cases, Abish's narrator seems to have one set of concerns, and his compositor another.In the end, it seemed to me that this is a lighthearted spoof about American attitudes to Africa in the 1970s, placed, for reasons I think the author himself never entirely analyzed, into the ""terrifying and irrefutable"" Procrustean frame of a linguistic game. It is an example of a book that reveals a crucial criterion for constrained writing: there needs to be a nameable connection between the linguistic constraint and whatever stories are being told. That connection can be a contrast (irrational, surrealist, or satiric) or a harmonious correspondence (between constrained lives and rule-bound writing, between partly unknowable psychologies and partly private constraints) -- but it has to be something the reader can conclude was planned and controlled, or at least observed, by the writer. *Reading this on Facebook July 2014, Andrei Molotiu noted that some Oulipo writers seem to be great ""despite"" their Oulipean interests. I might not be interested in such a writer. I think there should be a strong connection between story and constraints: it can be a contrast, dissociation, or affinity, but it has to work as a whole: otherwise it seems to me the interest of any constraint is diminished. Note the constraint in this book, by itself, isn't interesting. Anyone can invent a constraint: not everyone can write a book based on a constraint, but that's not an especially interesting goal. Relatively few people can figure out how to link or contrast the constraint to the material (story, subject matter, voice, mood).And just to be clear about the argument I'm proposing: I am not especially interested in organic, harmonious, ""coherent"" (Ruskin's word) relationships between form and content, or in the humanist or romantic traditions that require such relationships. I do find I want the relationship between form and content to be acknowledged in some manner: form and content can exhibit a radical disconnection, disharmony, incoherence, randomness, surrealism, or irrationalism; regardless of the kind of relationship, I am most engaged when the author (or the narrator, or the text) demonstrates that the problem has been considered. Abish doesn't seem to notice, or care....more",Notes are private!,0,6,1,not set,"Jul 09, 2014","Jul 09, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/989199.Alphabetical_Africa

It is shared by Murakami and several writers that Tim Parks has proposed do their writing with an eye to its translation into English. (For references see tinyurl.com/p4f6kjp) What he means is that they write intentionally simple sentences, avoiding modernist experiments with language (as in Joyce or Schmidt) and avoiding too many local references that would require special explanation. Parks's interest is the homogenization of the novel, and that interests me too: but I mention it here because such novels also bring out a property that may be overlooked in criticism.When the writing is stripped down to a useful leanness, what emerges, for me, is a growing awareness of the author's desire to tell a story. I could say ""the author's desire to simply tell a story,"" or ""an awareness of the author's desire to tell a story"": what I mean is that I find myself thinking about Murakami's guiding and even overwhelming desire to keep the reader's attention at all costs. When I am aware of that, I become suspicious that Murakami doesn't particularly care what his story is about. To some degree that's endemic of Murakami, and it's one of the reasons I don't don't read him much. (My notes on ""Sputnik Sweetheart"" on this site explain all that.) There were a number of passages in this book -- some sustained over a hundred pages of more -- when the main expressive interest of the novel was precisely the author's desire (as opposed to the narrator's desire) not to lose my attention. The book came to be about the implied author or the historical author, his work and fame, rather than anything in particular that he had to say. As the book went on -- up to the crux, where the ""stone"" is discovered -- the subjects and themes became more engrossing, and apparently more important to Murakami. But overall, what I felt when I read the book was its author's desire for my attention, and I resisted it more and more as I read, and I added that resistance to my other reservations about his work. The homogenization of the global novel as it appears in Murakami (Parks's theme), Murakami's continuous, energetic ambition to capture my interest, and the third-generation surrealism and conventional storytelling, are all reasons I'm not planning on reading any more Murakami....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Jun 13, 2014","Jun 13, 2014",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4929.Kafka_on_the_Shore

Nadja is significant in the history of psychoanalysis since it's part of Breton's reading of Freud. But psychologically it is a horror show. In the book the narrator, Breton, is married; he starts seeing Nadja, and it never occurs to him -- as a narrator, or as an author who might consider his book's structure or interest -- to say anything about how he feels about his wife, or vice versa. At one point he writes:""I go out at three with my wife and a friend; in the taxi we continue discussing Nadja, as we have been doing during lunch."" (p. 91)This is the first we've been told the narrator has mentioned Nadja to his wife, and Breton doesn't seem to be aware that readers might expect him to put some inflection on this revelation -- either that it was normal in their marriage, or that they had been arguing. A moment later he spots her:""I run, completely at random, in one of the three directions she may have taken.""Again, no mention of what his wife thinks of this behavior. And at the bottom of the same page:""This is the second consecutive day I have met her: it is apparent that she is at my mercy.""With no notation about how we're meant to understand that. When Nadja is committed to an asylum, Breton writes several pages exonerating himself for any responsibility (p. 136), hoping that Nadja doesn't think there's a difference between life outside and inside the asylum, and excoriating the psychiatric community; he then uses that as an excuse for never visiting her!""My general contempt for psychiatry, its rituals and its works, is reason enough for my not yet having dared investigate what has become of Nadja."" (p. 141)It doesn't seem to occur to him this might seem pusillanimous, or that his intellectual and abstract critique of psychiatry may appear either as heartless, or -- worse, from his point of view -- as a construction that can help release him from his love for her. (After all, if madness and sanity interpenetrate, as he insists, why not continue to love Nadja?)As a document of Breton's Surrealism, as an experiment with images, an instance of psychoanalysis, dream analysis, and clairvoyance and mysticism in Paris in 1928, and an experiment in writing with images (as I discuss on the other site), ""Nadja"" is often fascinating. But as a novel, a memoir, or any sort of reflective narrative, it's appalling.

This book has a kind of unremitting literalism in its narrative. In a nearly blank, neutral voice, the narrator tells us dozens of dates, places, and names; it's justified by the notion that this is a book written at speed in order to provide legal evidence about one of the narrator's friends. But aside from that rationale, the studiously neutral tone is increasingly difficult to understand. Auster barely uses adjectives; he doesn't pause to pick the right phrase or find the right image. His writing here is utilitarian and evidential, even when the subject is sex, love, murder, and jealousy. After fifty pages or so I realized the author (not the narrator) is driven by an overpowering desire to keep my attention, to be the one whose stories I want to hear. That grasping for my supposedly faltering attention provides the book's drive, and it seems also to explain the auhor's urge to write, no matter what the subject is. His anxiety to please and entertain pushes so hard on his imagination that it even prevents him from pausing long enough to construct metaphors, analogies, figures of speech, or other tropes that could make the writing interesting in itself. Here is one of the uncommon inerpolations of a figure of speech:""But a new element was added to the already unstable mixture of the past twenty-four hours, and it wound up producing a deadly compound, a beakerful of acid that hissed forth its dangers in a billowing profusion of smoke.""This is not the most carefully constructed metaphor. First the ""element"" is a ""compound,"" then it's a container of acid. The acid ""hisses forth"" (an overdone image, and a dramatic and clichéd qualifier), and then the ""hiss"" becomes ""smoke."" The image is confused and hard to picture, I think because he wrote at speed, and couldn't be bothered to stop and tune up his tropes. That sense of the rush to write also comes out in passages that seem never to have been re-read:""Iris was just twenty-four back then, a dazzling blond presence, six feet tall with an exquisite Scandinavian face and the deepest, merriest blue eyes to be found between heaven and hell.""In Leviathan it's as if the psychology, politics, characters, style, and mood of the novel are all arbitrary, and what really matters about writing is just the act of writing continuously, and pushing the plot forward with every sentence, as if fiction was a stalling donkey that needed continuous kicks and prods. But why am I imagined to have such a short attention span? And why should the solution be to keep turning the crank of the narrative, producing more and more of it? Why not settle in for a while and write some good sentences? And why write at all if your main driving emotion is fear of losing the reader's attention? The result is a book that hides a story about the author's own ambition under an entirely different plot.It's often said that Auster practices a literary fiction version of popular crime fiction, blending metafiction with complex narratives. I imagine people mean that his work is an interesting, literary variation on the sorts of tight, complex narratives typical of crime or genre fiction. But I wonder if it might not be better to say he uses devices of postmodernism in order to do what popular trade press authors do: build what Naipaul disparagingly called ""puzzles.""

These are comments, instead, on the book's content.The Midnight is about a bookish interest in Anglo-Irish ancestry, more than about personal loss. As Marjorie Perloff shows in her chapter on The Midnight in ""Unoriginal Genius,"" Howe's mother and her maternal great-aunt were intimately connected with Irish feminism, independence, theater, and literature. But in The Midnight, as Perloff notes, little of that is evident, and with only the book to go on, the picture of Ireland, and therefore the picture of Howe's family, is quite different.To me (and this can only be a personal position), the statement that ""maybe one reason I am so obsessed with spirits who inhabit these books is because my mother brought my up on Yeats as if he were Mother Goose"" sounds at once pretentious, inappropriate, and unnecessary: most Irish and Anglo-Irish children of her generation know Yeats ""like Mother Goose,"" and it's not enough of an explanation for Howe's motivation. It's the same when she says, speaking of Jack Yeats, that her mother ""hung Jack's illustrations and prints on the walls of any house or apartment we moved to as if they were windows"": this was also common, and for an Irish reader the use of the first name may also be cringe-inducing (pp. 74, 75). Howe gives a similar reason for being interested in ""embroiderers, upholsterers,"" and others: ""it's the maternal Anglo-Irish disinheritance"" (p. 66). For a book about reflection, full of reflections, these cultural references are unhelpfully unreflective.Even if these displays and constructions of Irish identity seem unobjectionable, they are signs of the book's intellectualism and its distance from its subject. Compare the illustrations and the narrative in Roddy Doyle's Rory and Ita, a much richer meditation on Irishness, family, and visuality. The emotional distance here can be seen as an expressive quality, and I appreciate it for its coldness and academic feel (I can certainly picture Howe traveling from one library to another, reading and photographing books): but I am not at all sure Howe thinks of The Midnight as the intermittent and experimental diary of an academic—and that lack of acknowledgment or awareness detracts decisively from my own willingness to engage with the project....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,"Oct 30, 2013","Oct 30, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/385111.The_Midnight

But I did not find this ""amazing,"" ""unforgettable,"" or ""moving,"" and especially not ""Dickensian."" (That last is a favorite adjective these days. It was applied to Tom Wolfe, and recently to Donna Tartt and Jhumpa Lahiri: it indicates a nostalgia for a certain kind of encyclopedic realism that includes satire, comedy, and tragedy. Aside from the value accorded to the ""Dickensian,"" this novel does't fit the category: it's too spare, too much beholden to postwar experimental writing and minimalism.) ""How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia"" is only supericially a postmodern experiment in genres; it is mostly comprised of vignettes of ordinary stories of poverty and ambition in vaguely ""Asian"" contexts.The self-help format goes hand in hand with the metafiction, as in sentences like this:""Because if you truly want to become filthy rich in rising Asia, as we appear to have established that you do, then sooner or later you must work for yourself.""I find the continual reminders of the book's title and purpose, together with the ongoing joke about the reader (""you"") who want to become filthy rich in rising Asia, together with the implied intimacy, to be uninteresting after the first half-dozen repetitions. If the reader (""you"") could have been allowed to have doubts, or if the narrator (""we"") could have developed, or if the usefulness of the notion that this is a self-help book could have been undermined (as it is, slightly, at the end of the book), then this could have been a much more interesting novel. As it is, the novel's set-up is schematic and unvaried: it works well in the publicity materials, but it is not engaging over the length of the book.The book is also unevenly engaged with the possibilities of writing. The ""self-help"" passages are resolutely plain-spoken, but there are also interruptions of closely written passages, like this one:""Your mind is on the day's work ahead, and as you chew and swallow you barely notice the tethered goat at your feet, with its jaunty, peroxide-bleached forelock, or the battle-scarred, tow-long beetle winding its way to a promising cat carcass.""It's as if the author sometimes remembers he is a novelist, with an interest in language; or to put it the other way around, it's as if the author of the self-help manual sometimes forgets what he's supposed to be doing. The same happens with the intermittent psychological analyses, and the love story; they sometimes toe the line of the self-help manual, and other times threaten to become dominant; but the author (the actual one) doesn't seem aware of any except the largest-scale threats to his narrative conceit. He (Hamid) knows when the self-help novel is running off the tracks at the end, and he tries to make that into a metanarrative theme (that is, it's almost a theme that a self-help book might disintegrate into a romantic novel); but in many other briefer passages psychological portraiture, narrative drive, and suddenly evocative descriptions just seem to happen without the self-help author noticing. In other words, even though on the surface this is the most controlled and artificial of narratives, I doubt the author's control over the possibilities of more open fiction, and it's his lack of awareness of those interruptions that made me lose interest in the book....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Oct 27, 2013","Oct 27, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/15815364-how-to-get-filthy-rich-in-rising-asia

I can't understand why that should be: why can't Tulli imagine something magical and wonderful, and keep the image going for a page or a chapter? Why does she think magical things need to be so frantically renewed?Here is an example. On p. 54, a bullet unexpectedly kills someone. It's unexpected because the bullet was fired twenty pages and several years before, and had ""circled the earth an unknown number of times since the day"" it was fired.

As if any one idea can't stand by itself, as if a sublime image won't work without support. Is this what Karsten Harries called the ""kitsch economy,"" the need to accelerate stimuli because each one needs to outdo the last, and they all need to hide their artificiality? Or is that over-reading, and Tiulli's succession of images, poetry, and comedy is more of a writer's tic, a leftover of literary surrealism? The book is like swabs of anesthetic on a painful tooth: the images have to keep coming, in a continuous waterfall of color and imagination, because otherwise something will start to hurt. But can pain be quieted by ornaments like these? Pain, for Tulli, might be something like the drabness or ordinary dullness or lovelessness of the actual world, and she would be driven by that suffering to produce these spectral inventions—but doesn't seem quite right. I think she hasn't actually lived through the pain the book proposes, because she has lived her entire writer's life in a manic state of continuous invention.It's clear that the writing is meant to be perceived as condensed poetry. But for whom is poetry an endless succession of isolated insights? I found In Red exhausting, enervating, endless, and timid: it's as if Tulli couldn't get up the courage to let herself tell a story with just one, two, or three absolutely beautiful images.

McDermott's writing is careful and clean, as the ers say, and that is definitely a pleasureWriting As If In the PastI had to stop reading this. McDermott's writing is careful and clean, as the ers say, and that is definitely a pleasure. But there is a limit to how much time I want to spend with a book that could have been written in 1950. To be fair, the book is set in the 20th century, but it bothers me that it has no signs of having been written in the present. It is almost the case that there is not a single word, idea, image, thought, sentiment, or narrative device that couldn't be found in book published fifty years ago. I could hardly find any new turns of phrase, any new sense of syntax or pacing, any new kinds of narrative, any new images, any new language, any contemporary stylistic influences. For some people this may be a virtue, and in a limited sense it is, to the extent that the book ventriloquizes a certain idea of the past. In that sense it's like any nostalgic novel, and its flaws are only the occasional solecisms and historically inaccurate usages -- the sort of flaws that can be found, for example, in Pynchon's ""Mason & Dixon.""But in a larger sense, this lack of interest in the last fifty years of novel writing is, for me, a decisive fault. Why read a book that is not interested in being part of its time in some way? (With an accent on that phrase, ""in some way,"" meaning that a novel can be connected to the present by narrative, by content, by style, by mood, by sly allusion, by secret parallel, by subterranean allegory.) This book is pure projection, pure nostalgia: not so much for a certain Irish-American past, although it is that, as for a certain state of the novel, one that's long gone.I am of course overstating this a little. There are some things in the book that could tell readers it was written in 2013, but for me they are minor. They're embellishments, adjustments on the forms and interests of novels written a half-century ago. For me the only interesting one is McDermott's way of compressing entire narratives into single sentences that are retrospective and prospective, combining prolepsis and nostalgia:""The births of our four children, my mother's death, the kids' tonsillectomies and appendectomies over the years, his hernia, Gabe's breakdown, and how this surgery, tomorrow, to repair my left eye.

The two parts make a rum mixture.1. The fiction about meaningless lives.This aspect of ""Eeeee Eee Eeee"" is what has gotten all the critical attention. Tao Lin often writes exactly what comes into his head at a given moment, because his characters all act on whatever comes into their heads, so nothing he invents can be inappropriate, trivial, or irrelevant. Anything and everything can be said and happen, because the world, to these kids, is pretty much empty. A brief example is enough:""They go to Denny’s. “I need a wife,” Steve says in a booth. “I need … I don’t know. I knead bread.” “We’d go on a shopping spree,” Steve says. “Then she’d leave me and I’d go on a killing spree.” (p. 57)This kind of trackless, ruleless, apparently free association, which actually expresses lives that have no freedom and nothing but senseless rules, instantly creates a strong mood, which continues without pause through the entire novel. In that respect ""Eeeee Eee Eeee"" is a very, very distant cousin of ""Notes from Underground,"" in which the leaden, slightly sickened feeling is what matters more than any plot or story. Of course this writing strategy begs questions of novelistic structure, but that does not bother me: I could almost as easily have read a 500-page version of this book: it's endless easy searches for something to say or to that drive the characters' consciousnesses onward, and form is exactly what's not at stake.2. Intrusions of the author's voiceThe second aspect of the novel is less often noted by critics, and it clashes with the first in odd ways that Tao Lin does not seem to notice or understand. For example, his narrator is capable of rising well above his less-than-zero stream-of-consciousness nearly vegetative way of life. In one passage he thinks:""He is against capitalism for some reason; something about how it directs human perception away from sentient beings and toward abstractions; he is also against being against things, because the binary nature of the universe is against being against things. (p. 68)This sounds like the author speaking, not hi character. But then the character adds, as if he's remembering his basic character:""Still, he wants to cause destruction to McDonald’s.""There are also existentialist moments, when Tao Lin speaks as himself, describing the state of his characters in way they couldn't. (Even though he writes in their voices; eg., p. 96.) Sometimes his characters speak in ways that they themselves would, or should, parody:""“Irony is so privileged,” Mark said. “It’s what happens when you don’t need to do anything to survive—it’s when the things you do have nothing to do with survival and you spend forty million dollars to make Steve Zissou and the Atomic Submarine or whatever it’s called... Andrew watched the new Batman movie without irony, sincerity, or enjoyment; or maybe a little enjoyment. Outside, he began then did not stop making jokes about believability, pacing, Batman’s smoothies..."" (pp. 100-101)Other passages have a kind of incompletely felt or insincerely articulated nihilism, which also seems ill-fitted to the character's limited capacities for attention or abstract theorizing:""Fuck you if feel angry at someone else. I’ll kill you. You are stupid and boring. Killing isn’t bad. The only thing to be angry at is existence itself. We all force our assumptions and contexts onto other people. (p. 196)These are infelicities of narration: moments when the characters are given thoughts that a person like their narrator would have: theories about them and their lives, which wold almost be a necessity for an author like Tao Lin, but which don't sit well in the characters' shiftless, ADD-addled, relentlessly trivial and dreamy lives. But by far the largest dissonance between the characters' lives and the author's voice is the principal character's ambition to be a successful novelist. It is utterly unbelievable that the name Jhumpa Lahiri would continually spring to the mind of the main character, who is on the point of losing his job as a pizza delivery boy, and who shows no signs of reading anything until his thoughts begin to be peppered by the names of famous living writers. If Tao Lin had realized this was so implausible, he could have remedied it by writing some passages about the character's library and his reading. The fact that the book has almost no such passages (there is one brief mention of his attempts to send out short stories, and getting lots of rejections), shows that Tao Lin is unaware of himself here. His own mind is clearly filled with jealous and ambitious thoughts about Lahiri, Rushdie, and others, and because he's writing quickly, he lets those thoughts fall onto the page. But they just do not fit: they remind readers that the book they're reading was written by a very ambitious writer, and that reminder has nothing to do with the gormless characters and their endless fantasies.There is one passage where Tao Lin seems to realize this is a problem, and trie to write his way around it. He has had a character mention Pessoa -- someone who is absolutely unknown in the kind of trackless suburbia of ""Eeeee Eee Eeee,"" but who is absolutely central in circles of twenty-something ambitious writers of literary fiction. Here is the passage in which Tao Lin has his characters say whether or not they've heard of Pessoa. (The main character, Andrew, imagines he's at dinner with the president, an alien, and a dolphin.)“You’ve read Fernando Pessoa?” Lelu said. “You have?” Andrew said to Lelu. “Yeah, you?” “Yeah,” Andrew said. “You?” Andrew said to the dolphin. “Yeah,” the dolphin said. “Have you?” Andrew said to Shawn. “No,” Shawn said. “Who is he?” “A Portuguese author,” the moose said. The bear slapped the moose. “Who hasn’t read this person?” Shawn said loudly. Everyone had read Fernando Pessoa. “You should just leave,” the president said to Shawn. “I already ordered,” Shawn said. “Just leave money for what you ordered,” the president said. Shawn took out his wallet. (p. 200)This chafing between two kinds of writing is compelling, but unformed, and in the rest of the book it's inadvertent. To me, it's the most interesting quality of the novel. I hope Tao Lin acknowledges his ambition, and his knowledge, and weaves them into his next project....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"Sep 11, 2013","Sep 11, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/276694.Eeeee_Eee_Eeee

The book declThis novel imagines a future in which apartheid went “the other way,” so that Afrikaans people were dispossessed or forced into poverty. The book declares itself as an allegory early on by the way Schoeman sticks to generalities.I found the first ten or twenty pages interesting; after that I found it implausible, unpleasant, and finally infuriating.1. InterestingThe book is well translated and I can imagine the Afrikaans is equally simple and clear. The ultimate model here is Kafka, and there is an echo of this in Coetzee’s “Waiting for the Barbarians.” 2. ImplausibleThe sun never shines in this novel, and toward the end one of the characters even comments on that. Everything is gray and dismal. Interiors are often described as dark, and Schoeman overuses a device in which it’s so dark people almost can’t be seen. All that serves his purpose of painting a dismal, undefined future. The people the narrator meets in the country are all reticent, and they don’t talk about what has happened to them. It’s meant to conjure a hopeless future in which some Afrikaans people stayed in their homelands, but most fled.But at a certain point it all becomes implausible. I don’t know any dispossessed or repressed people who don’t talk continuously about the details of their repression and their repressors. It’s of course plausible that people wouldn’t want to talk to a stranger, especially when (as it turns out in the novel) they are plotting a rebellion, but that’s not what Schoeman describes. He paints a number of scenes in which characters simply refuse to think about the past; some seem to have no specific thoughts about it. One character wants to live in the present; another lives for an imaginary future; a third lives in the past, but it’s a static past, fixed in her dementia. The lack of specificity serves the allegory of an indefinite catastrophe but not any psychological or political truth I know. (At the end of the book there are isolated acts of violence, and some stories that obliquely describe rape and killing -- pp. 184, 191 -- but they are exceptions.)It’s relevant that this book was recommended to me in South Africa, and I read part of it there and the rest in Uganda. I was traveling in the villages in Uganda, and hearing endlessly about corruption, illegal actions by politicians, and specific injustices. People were fixated on local and national government and they were very specific about the people they held responsible for their problems. Several times, for different reasons, people didn’t want to tell me certain things: I’d expect that. But the free-floating, supposedly timeless nature of the disaster that has befallen the people in “Promised Land” is more like the undefined nature of the nuclear apocalypse in mystical books like “The Road.” The uniform gray dialogue and listless, affectless characters begins to appear more as a failure of imagination than a device to sustain an allegory. 3. UnpleasantI understand that a certain attachment to the land (as in the book’s title) is a central concern of the book, and that in certain contexts it is an identifiably Afrikaans quality. The most emotional moment in the middle of the book is the narrator’s discovery that nothing remains of his family farm, which he left as a young child. (The farm is named Reitvlei, which I have been told is made of two words that mean “high grass” and “cow dung”--which is the state of the farm when the narrator finally visits.)There is a deep, tenacious attachment to land throughout the book, made even deeper by the fact that the land is painted as desolate and unattractive. One character says to the narrator that he should see it in the winter, when in effect it’s even more desolate, in order to appreciate its beauty. I felt the grip of that passion, on Schoeman’s part, throughout the book. But it’s a very unpleasant emotion, because underneath it I can feel a tremendous hatred, anger, and fear (on Schoeman's part, and at the end of the book in his characters). The relentless evenness and lack of emotion on the part of the characters is exactly what reveals the force and depth of that anger and the fear that the land itself might somehow be taken away. 4. InfuriatingAll this is irritating, or perhaps I should say infuriating, because the vagueness of the allegory shows that the author has not, in fact, experienced any such thing as the catastrophe he describes. In fact apartheid “came out” differently. I wonder if this book has been read by anyone who continues to suffer in townships even after apartheid. I can imagine such a reader getting very angry at the privilege, the lack of experience of real suffering, that suffuse this book. I finished this book in Uganda, surrounded by real poverty and real injustice, and those things also involve bright sunlight (the sun does shine on people who suffer) and many hundreds of everyday events that break through any self-indulgent dream of imaginary suffering....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Aug 22, 2013","Aug 22, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1889591.Promised_Land

Eco calls this ""An Illustrated Novel,I read parts of this (I couldn't read the middle hundred pages) as part of a project to read novels with images. Eco calls this ""An Illustrated Novel,"" partly alluding to the comic books that he remembers from his childhood. I found the book intolerable. 1: The narrator's knowledgeable voiceWell-read and scholarly authors, like Canetti or Richard Powers, tend to be praised by people who think they have endless erudition. I think that's a mistaken way to evaluate an author, because no author I know has that really ""peregrine"" erudition. Eco is limited, and so was Canetti. (""Peregrine"" is a word Leopardi used to describe his own learning, and it fits; in my book, only people like Arnaldo Momigliano are genuinely bewilderingly erudite. Everyone else is obviously mortal.)The problem here, aside from readers' reactions, is that Eco himself hows off continuously, unconsciously, happily, as if he wasn't showing off at all. Here's a typical passage. The main character has woken in a hospital, and he can't remember his name.--""And yet I did have it on the tip of my tongue. After a moment I offered the most obvious reply.""My name is Arthur Gordon Pym.""""That isn't your name.""Of course, Pym was someone else.[Note how coy this is: the name is part of the title of Edgar Allen Poe's only novel. Eco doesn't quite tell us, but alludes to the fact that the name does mean something. He's already done this on the very first page of his book, alluding to Bruges-la-Morte, the most important predecessor of his own book, but not quite telling readers what he's doing. It's a wink and a nod for people in the know.]""Call me... Ishmael?""""Your name is not Ishmael. Try harder.""[This is supposed to be comedy, because readers are expected to get this allusion.]""A word. Like running into a wall. Saying Euclid or Ishmael was easy... I tried to explain. ""It doesn't feel like something solid, it's like walking through a fog.""""What's the fog like?"" he asked.""The fog on the bristling hills climbs drizzling up the sky, and down below the mistral howls and whitens the sea... What's the fog like?""[Again, coy: he's quoting, but this time it isn't at all clear what the source is. It's a puzzle, like on ""Mastermind"" or NPR.]""You put me at a disadvantage... I'm only a doctor. And besides, this is April, I can't show you any fog. Today's the twenty-fifth of April.""""April is the cruelest month.""[Another in-joke, which readers will be expected to get. Eco makes sure we know now everyone gets jokes like this:]""I'm not very well-read, but I think that's a quotation."" (pp. 6-7)--The book is like this throughout. Eco apparently doesn't think he's boasting, but he is. He also lectures: there are long pages with medical diagnoses, bibliographic citations, historical references, etc. What's intolerable here is that Eco only half-realizes he's showing off. He is also exuberant about all kinds of cultural detritus, and that's great -- it's the semiotician of his early work. I liked pp. 108-110, where he tells us about obscure torture techniques, and then gives us lists of flags, musical instruments, weaponry, heraldry... he has no idea when to stop, which is great. But often what he does is either unconscious boasting, presented as the products of a full imagination, or else professorial lecturing, presented as an interest in the variegated facts of the world.The impetus to appear scholarly overflows the narration, because the book ends with a long list of sources for the illustrations. This list wasn't necessary: it goes beyond what copyright restrictions would require, and so it becomes a sort of scholarly apparatus, as if it was written by the narrator. It's also, in the end, more showing off.All this is just one reason I found the book unreadable. The other reason has to do with the images.2. The imagesThe use of images is ham-fisted, for at least four reasons:(A) The use of color.Eco is lucky -- and nearly unique -- in that his previous sales enabled him to produce this book in full color. It's one of just a few novels with color illustrations, and the fact that they are of good quality means that he can conjure objects of nostalgia differently than, say, Sebald. When Eco's character finds a cocoa tin in an attic, he can show it in full color and detail, and bring it into the present in a way that an author like Sebald couldn't (I don't mean he would have always wanted to, but the option wasn't available). But Eco makes very little use of this; most every object in this book is scanned, at apparently high resolution, and simply presented to us.(B) Reproducing objects without backgrounds.There are a few photos of three-dimensional objects in the book, but they are cropped white all around, as in catalogues. The reason for that decision isn't acknowledged in the book; it makes them look like objects in catalogues. (C) The effect of cropping.All the other hundreds of illustrations are cropped tightly to the edges of the image or cover, or else they're details. Some are arranged in rows and columns (pp. 138, 140), making them look like illustrations in a reference book. These layout and design choices are again odd, and unremarked by the narrator. Why allude to scholarly or reference works? After all, the narrator is rummaging through boxes and piles of papers in an attic -- he isn't supposed to be preparing a book for publication. In fact, Eco was preparing a book for publication, and that fact intrudes on the fiction. (One image is reproduced with its tattered margins, the way Anne Carson does; that makes it seem precious, but that isn't remarked on either.)(D) Image manipulation.The final episode of the book is an hallucination: the narrator imagines himself in a drama with comic book characters. On pp. 422-45, full-page illustrations from comics are matched with facing pages of text. It's the only time in the book where the text isn't full page, because Eco wants to match it to the pictures. From the list of illustrations it's apparent that Eco put these together himself from a number of different comics. They are credited as ""montages by the author."" But as montages, they're ham-fisted: characters are just pasted together, without even the adjustments that an artist like Erro makes when he does collages of comics. Many of the images have vignetting -- Eco used a blur function in Photoshop or some other application, and it needs to be said -- in the 21st century, when everyone has some photo-editing skills, and in the context of a novel that is all about images -- that he used the blur function very badly. He could have capitalized on this, for example by saying his narrator's mind was blurred in a simple fashion, but he apparently does not think his photo manipulation requires comment. But it does: these images are as awkwardly done as William Gass's graphics in his novel ""The Tunnel.""I once had a chance to ask Gass about those illustrations. Why, I wanted to know, do the images all look like mid-1980s computer graphics, with thick outlines and primary colors? Because, he said, the narrator inhabits that world. I think that would have been a good answer if the narrator of ""The Tunnel"" had a computer, with a graphics program, and was producing images as best he could.

""Bartleby & Co."" is a wonderful novel with a poignant and convincing theme. ""Montano's Malady"" is a quirky elaboration on the same theme of a writer's hobbled imagination. Together, I thought, they made Vila-Matas one of the most memorable voices in contemporary fiction.This book is hugely, irremediably disappointing, and I do not think I will read another of his books. There are two reasons for my disappointment: one is relative to my own experience with Ireland, and the other is, I think, endemic to the book, to Vila-Matas's project, and to his sense of literature. I do not see how he could address the second issue, and that is why I won't be following his work in future.First, about Ireland.I have twenty years of experience visiting Ireland. (I'm writing from Ireland now.) So I knew from the s and the book's title that I might have some difficulty with the way Vila-Matas characterizes the country. There are definitely solecisms, misjudgments, clichés, generalizations, and blindnesses, but in the end I didn't mind them. It is still possible to read this book as a journey, on the part of a foreigner, to a country he has never seen; the narrator knows that he knows nothing about Dublin except its literature. He's read widely in Irish modernism -- he knows ""The Dalkey Archive"" as well as secondary literature on Joyce and Beckett, and he is fully aware that to him, the country is a literary construction. I agree with Terry Eagleton (who wrote, I think, the best ) that Vila-Matas makes some mistakes, but that they aren't a problem given the book's theme her is the projection of literature onto reality, rather than the discovery of some real place.Second, about Vila-Matas's sense of literature.When I wrote on ""Montano's Malady"" and ""Bartleby & Co,"" I noted that Vila-Matas's sense of literature is mostly comprised of aphorisms from novels and poems, and stories about writers' lives. Literature is a kind of high gossip, a dramatis personae for daydreams, and source of practical philosophy. That is as it is, and even though it omits most of what I care about it in literature, it works in his books. What doesn't work is when the choice of authors means that Vila-Matas's mind is filled with aphorisms and gossip from the mid-twentieth century. ""Dublinesque"" is full of easy references to the 2010s, including remarks about Google, texting, and the internet. The narrator, a middle-aged man named Riba, has just retired as an editor, and the book has many references to real, living authors, including Paul Auster. But when it comes to Ireland, Vila-Matas's literary world is ""Ulysses,"" snippets of Beckett (but mainly his life), and quick quotations and anecdotes about Flann O'Brien and Brendan Behan.There is something quite depressing about that. At first I thought it was because I missed Roddy Doyle and Fintan O'Toole and Paul Muldoon and Luke Gibbons all the other dozens and hundreds people who are actually alive and writing in Ireland now. But it's even worse than that: as Terry Eagleton noticed, there are hardly any references to ""Finnegans Wake,"" which has all the topographic references Vila-Matas's plot requires, and is even titled after a funeral, which is the central theme of the narrator's trip to Dublin in the first place. But let's say that I stop worrying about all that, and let the author have the literary world of his choosing. An insuperable problem still remains: Vila-Matas's prose is flat in comparison with Joyce's (it's clear that this would also be true in the Spanish, because the narrative is so light on specifics); his character's thoughts are more abstract and duller than Joyce's (they seem to depend, in their best moments, on Pessoa); and his uneventful plot is less interesting than Joyce's uneventful plot. Here is how Eagleton puts this:""Very little happens in the novel, but a lot less interestingly than in Ulysses. Whereas Joyce’s work installs us inside three very different heads in turn, Vila-Matas imprisons us within Riba’s desultory consciousness, and the effect can be claustrophobic. Confused, reclusive and with only a tenuous grip on reality, he spends much of his time glued to a computer, and appropriately enough for a publisher, regards his life as a kind of text. It is, however, an unreadable one, full of chance connections and random associations, difficult to scan as a whole. Riba doesn’t believe that things logically cohere, and sees art as an attempt to foist intelligibility on them; but if that is what Dublinesque itself is up to, it is hard to feel it succeeds. What unity the book has is a matter of literary allusions and cross-connections, as a reference to a novel leads to one to a film, which leads to one to another novel. It is a high-cultural version of Bloom’s associative mental habits, one rooted in art rather than in reality."" (""London Review of Books,"" July 19, 2012)Having read this book, I can see that ""Montano's malady"" goes much deeper than the literary puzzle of how to write the next generation of fiction. Vila-Matas lives entirely inside a vacuous, nearly empty world of literary anecdotes and histories, with no texture, nothing sharp or fascinating or intrusive. The very thing he is fascinated by, literature, is itself so hollow in his imagination that it is nothing but a reverberating echo chamber of allusions. That may be one way forward for the novel -- I still love ""Bartleby & Co."" -- but it is a universe away from Joyce, and Vila-Matas's inability to see that as a problem is apparently irremediable....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Jul 30, 2013","Jul 30, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/13031462-dublinesque

What can go wrong with writing that tries to keep up with manic consciousness?Reviews in the Guardian and the Observer say that it's not clear whether Barker should have written an entire novel about a magic trick performed by David Blaine. The assumption is that it's too thin a subject for a novel. But the novel is about thinness. One er is closer to the mark in complaining that Barker's voice is cold, that she doesn't take emotional risks, that she controls her characters so much that there's nothing to engage the reader. Again, that's true, but it's also an expressive value. What bothers me about this book isn't its supposedly overly trivial subject matter (what could that possibly mean, after ""Madame Bovary"") or its supposedly unemotional, disengaged characters (what could that possibly mean after Oulipo, after Beckett, after Stein). What bothers me is that the supposedly scintillating, mercurial dialogue (which all the ers praise) isn't interesting.The book opens and closes with praise of the novel ""Shane."" Here's the end of the book:""And it ends:""'He was the man who rose into our little valley out of the heart of our great glowing west and when his work was done rode back whence he had come and he was Shane.'""Observe the total lack of punctuation.""(Jesus H. How'd he ever get away with that stuff?)""Not even a comma after 'whence he had come'? Or a dash?""Man.""Is Jack Schaefer some fuck-you, balls-out writer or what?""I'm omitting the italics, which are everywhere in the book. This kind of rapid-fire, apparently spontaneous, apparently stream of consciousness narrative is fairly continuous throughout the book. Each successive brief paragraph is like an apostrophe, directed not at the reader so much as at an immediately previous version of the narrator himself, as he compulsively comments on his own previous thoughts, and revises and sharpens his own ideas.This kind of writing is intended to be clever, sharp, witty, unexpected, fast, and entertaining, and I think it is also intended to ring true to something like inner monologue of a dissatisfied, twitchy young urban male in London. For me it isn't any of those things except twitchy. There are many other versions of continuously self-doubting, cross-cutting inner monologues. Among contemporary authors, for example, there is Mark Leyner. But Leyner is more linguistically versatile, faster, and sharper. The twitching voice in ""Clear"" is ticcy, like Tourette's. Leyner is more genuinely driven and often believably hysterical -- it's hard to imagine him stopping, which isn't necessarily a virtue, but it does make the act of writing compulsively about compulsive thinking itself a more persuasive.*Incidentally -- although nothing in a novel is incidental -- there are moments of the deeper purpose and belief ers found missing. At the end, Blaine's magic performance (it's the one where he was suspended in a glass cube for a month) becomes compelling for the narrator:""...he's holding it together. In fact he's finding himself again. Little by little that necessary transition is taking place--from sitting-duck to superstar, from total access to none.""And later:""He changed (I need to believe it).""These are brief glimpses into something ""deeper,"" even if it is only vacuous superstardom.

I am not oftWhat Are The Limits of Saunders's Control of Style?I read as much of George Saunders as I can, but I only read him for the way he writes. I am not often entertained by his portraits of the absurd, pitiful, and yet endearing problems of the lower middle class in upstate New York. I rarely laugh at his jokes. I'm not interested in campy situations like historical theme parks (""My Chivalric Fiasco""), or the kind of sentimentality that so easily and unabashedly becomes maudlin (the war veteran in ""Home,"" or the lake rescue scene in ""Tenth of December""), or the way we're invited to laugh with people by first laughing at them and then with them (""The Semplica Girl Diaries,"" in which the diarist's abbreviated way of writing first seems addled, then endearingly addled). I imagine Saunders takes enormous delight in the foibles of his characters and their hapless, haphazard lives, and that he sees truth in that kind of honesty. But the decorating of suburbia in campy colors is a very familiar strategy, because it happens also in the visual arts. It's a way of saying: this is my pitiful truth; I'm not pretending life is anything more than this. And yet the method is dishonest, because suburbia and lower middle class life are painted in the pastel colors of faint surrealism, solecisms, whimsy, and campy sentiment. The bottom of the barrel is scoured until it gleams with a lovely light.But I try to read everything of Saunders's anyway, because he is, I think, the best North American writer, if ""writing"" is taken to mean control of word choice, tone, and voice. No one has a better ear than Saunders. No one is less likely to ever use anything but the very very best image, the perfect word. He is a master of the immaculate misspelling. He uses the vocabulary of Wal-Mart and Wendy's like no one else. For years, I thought Saunders's choices of words and sentences amounted to lessons in how to write dialogue and description. Lately I've been wondering whether it might be possible to criticize what appears as simply perfect. In general, in the abstract, it might be a sensible thing to try to move beyond even (or especially) what seems best in any given context.Here are some thoughts on that, based on the title story ""Tenth of December.""1. Different kinds of language use point, subtly, to different sources. I often wonder about Saunders's sources. Because I grew up in Ithaca, I sometimes think I can tell the difference between things he's overheard in the mall, things he may have gotten from children or teenagers, and things his Syracuse University undergraduate students have inadvertently given him in their not-so-amazing short stories. ""This was concerning, this was very concerning"" (p. 218)sounds like a Syracuse University student paper.""The thing about girls? Suzanne said. Is we are more content-driven."" (p. 219)sounds like Saunders heard it, maybe from a teenager, and made it into a short-story sentence by adding the question mark (which wouldn't have been heard when the person said ""The thing about girls is we are more content-driven""), the ""Suzanne said,"" the period, and the capitalized ""Is."" In the story, a mentally challenged man walks into the woods, intending to kill himself. He is partly delusional, and he sometimes has problems controlling his words. His inner monologue is full of word substitutions, which he tries to correct. These corrections introduce a different kind of solecism than the ones I've just quoted:""Not so once the suffering begat. Began. God damn it. More and more his words. Askew. More and more his words were not what he would hoped.Hope."" (p. 223)This idea, of having the narrator's words come out wrong, and then correcting them, has great potential. It lets us listen on the narrator's mind as he tries to keep himself in line, and it lets Saunders try out different solecisms, to different effect. But it's that double meaning -- the narrative function, and the writer's opportunity -- that creates a problem. Once the narrator starts abusing words, then Saunders's own inventions and interventions take on a different cast. That difference isn't resolved. It's as if Saunders is admiring Faulkner in ""The Sound and the Fury,"" and Joyce in ""Finnegans Wake,"" and the same time, even though one presents language distorted by a particular character's mind, and the other presents language reconstructed by the author. (I say ""as if"" because I do not mean I think Faulkner and Joyce are the actual models here -- although Benjy Compson in ""The Sound and the Fury"" will come to many readers' minds.)The strategy of presenting anomalies as if they were things the narrator thought, and then letting us listen as he corrects them, opens the way to a more interesting possibility: we can also listen as he fails to correct them. There are several excellent passages where this happens; they recount episodes in which the narrator lost control, and his descriptions of those passages also lose control. (For example, p. 225.) In other places, the narrator struggles to correct his thinking:""Lord, let me now fuck it up. Let me bring no dishonor. Leg me do it cling.Let. Let me do it cling.Clean.Cleanly."" (pp. 226-7)But this sort of writing feeds the problem of the unarticulated relation between Saunders's writerly choices and his character's. As readers, we posit Saunders is in control -- he's fine-tuned his sociologist's or linguist's ear, and he's making choices that blend the possibilities of contemporary fiction with the realities of the mangled language we hear everywhere. But his character, in this story, isn't operating that way at all. And yet his character is a way for Saunders to continue to explore that blending. That's the difference that's unresolved in this story, and it is a single example -- it would have to be one among many -- of how I am trying to think about what limits Saunders's apparently limitless control....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Jul 19, 2013","Jul 19, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13641208-tenth-of-december

I could say that the Uruguayan painter Juan Manuel Blanes (1830-1901) is “the Ingres of Uruguay,” but that would only make his Retrato de Doña Carlota Ferreira—a canonical starting point of Uruguayan modernism—into a comic object.)A Brief Life is about a man whose companion is dying, and his attempts to escape that tragedy by creating and imagining different lives for himself. The parallel between the main character’s attempts and Onetti’s own is very close, and so the novel is modernist in the sense that it is clear Onetti himself doesn’t want to think about real tragedy, unless it is delivered as a question of imagination. There are issues in Onetti to do with the narrator's and author's sexism and limited empathy. Normally they would not present an problem for me: I don't expect morality from fiction; I don't expect fiction to make me better, or make the world better, or tell the truth about anything in particular (as de Botton does); I haven't avoided Celine (the anti-Semite), Sade, Stokoe (his novel ""Cows,"" which I won't describe here), or even Schreber (the psychotic patient of Freud's). But I won't be reading more Onetti, and I wrote this to puzzle out the reasons.Onetti’s women are unpleasantly imagined. He pictures them coming and going, perfuming, dressing, undressing, smoking, tapping their varnished nails, and dreaming of seducing men. Even though there are passages of some psychological insight and others with some introspective force, mainly women just recline, sit, pace, pose, and smoke (and so do men, although they aren’t observed, and they aren’t imagined thinking of themselves being observed). I found that way of thinking repulsive, exactly (and only) because I understand Onetti's narrator expects us to see it as poetic, melancholic, resigned, wise, and adult.The book has one or two pages in which the narrator suddenly dives into a deeper stoicism, and those are interesting passages because they are not integrated into the book’s perfumy pallor. This happens first on p. 44:“Bills to be paid and the unforgettable certainty that nowhere in this world is there a woman, a friend, a house, a book, not even a vice, that can make me happy.… I never did anything and presumably I will die. I have, naturally, a certain impersonal remorse; but it hasn’t kept me from being content.”An so forth: these passages are like unmelted glaciers in the narrative. It would have been a more interesting book—perhaps more dangerous—if there had been more of them.Another thing: there are moments of tremendous cruelty in this book, which are, I think, partly unnoticed by Onetti's narrator and by the implied author. On pp. 56-7 the narrator has his principal character dream of murdering his dying wife. He seems not to notice how quickly he allows himself to observe, and dismiss, the wife’s attempts to repress awareness of her illness. He doesn't see how cruelty and self-absorption limit his empathy.What is wrong with unnoticed sexism or cruelty? Since this subject is so entangled in notions of relativist literary criticism, let me set out some positions point by point. (I thank Aarnaud Rommens for helping me clarify this list.)Like most readers I don't conflate fiction with fact. But I also do not read novels to learn anything about the facts of the world, and I think most readers do. All the interest in regional and national literatures, in postcolonial literatures, in writing about gender and identity, is predicated on the idea that you might learn something about the world by reading fiction. Fiction isn't history or sociology, so it doesn't matter if the book is an accurate record of its milieu. I don't read for information, as Steve Mitchelmore says. It's the main reason I am not interested in Zadie Smith, who tells readers about new sorts of social formations, classes, and identities in London. So I'm especially unlikely, I think, to dislike a novel because it isn't informing me reliably about the world.I also may be on a far end of the spectrum when it comes to hoping literature can make me more reflective, more sensitive, more thoughtful, or even a better person. Fiction isn't self-help or self-improvement. That is Alain de Botton's belief, and in a different way James Wood's. I don't find myself optimized in any sensible way by the novels I've read. I'm drawn to labyrinthine sensibilities from Montaigne to Pessoa and Proust, but I'd be hard-pressed to make the sorts of claims de Botton makes about their capacity to meliorate my psyche or otherwise make me better, whatever in the world that might mean.It follows that it's potentially unobjectionable if an author has views or information that are false or objectionable in real life. (I shouldn't object if Onetti's narrator, or the implied author, has reductive ideas about women.) Why, then, put Onetti in a different category than, say, Celine? Here are three possibilities.1. The appearance of control.One reason to judge an author like Onetti negatively may be that what matters in fiction is what is compelling, persuasive, well represented. There is an uncontrolled contrast in Onetti between the narrator's display of what he considers psychological insights, and the narrator's or author's obliviousness on other points. It's the lack of control of that contrast that produces the deficit in persuasion, because it undermines my confidence that his imagination, as he presents it in the text, is his own possession. On the other hand, I recognize that many great novels are partially unpersuasive and largely out of control or even incoherent (for example Flann O'Brien, or Stephen Dixon's ""Frog""), so I can see that this isn't a sufficient answer.2. A lack of self-awareness.There is a problem, in Onetti's work, in the narrator's self-awareness. It's a disappointment when an author posits self-awareness as a value, but lacks it in ways that she would clearly not be happy with if they were pointed out. The author's blindnesses are not the sort that postmodern authors and readers like to agree are potentially interesting values. Poststructuralist readers love to find gaps, blindnesses, and inbuilt contradictions in texts, which can come to be seen as crucial for interesting literature. But there is a taste involved: postmodern literary critics have preferences for certain kinds of problems with self-awareness. Onetti's may not be among them.3. Inadequacy of imagination.There are ways that readers become aware of the sufficiency, the adequacy, of the writer's imagination. Onetti's world seems insufficiently imagined according to his own criteria of thoughtfulness. That kind of contradiction appears as a lapse: Sade and Celine, etc., don't have that particular problem.These last two might be ways I'd like to go if I were to pursue this issue. But it's a genuinely difficult, perhaps insoluble problem, if it's asked from within the general frame of postmodern literary criticism. On the one hand, all fiction, especially fiction that shows blindnesses, can be of interest, so there is no sense to asking, as a modernist or realist would, about ethical or moral values. On the other hand, readers have preferences. There is a difference between Onetti's book and some of the other books I've mentioned, and it has to do, somehow, with the narrators' beliefs....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,"Dec 28, 2016","Jun 26, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/172228.A_Brief_Life

Two notes: one on the photographs, and the other on the novel itself.(I bought the original hardcover, because the print in the pb is very small, and the illustrations seemed to be cropped. The cloth first edition is worth the price.)1. Concerning the photographs.Gardner isn't particularly interesting or reflective about his use of photographs. All are full page or double-page spreads, printed beyond the text margins but not quite to the trim edge. The first is placed opposite p. 22. At that point in the narrative, the main character has just discovered a rural home he wants to buy. It's described for the first time on p. 21, and when the reader turns the page, she sees the photo, which is, unaccountably, a triple exposure of a decaying wood wall, rocks, and ferns. The photo doesn't correspond with anything in the description, and its late 1970s black and white art technique doesn't fit the nostalgic descriptions of rural northwest Pennsylvania. Apparently it did not concern Gardner that (1) the image is largely illegible, (2) it doesn't fit the description, and (3) it has a style that is at odds with his narrative.The second image is a double spread of farm buildings in the winter. This one could easily be of the northeastern US, and so it fits the region Gardner is describing, and it comes just after the book's first invocation of snow. (The main character wonders how he will get through his first winter in his new house.) But the photograph is a specific farm, with a house and four small farm buildings; the house doesn't correspond with the house the character has bought, and the land is entirely different from the hilly place, with a waterfall, described in the book. Apparently it did not concern Gardner that (1) this farm is wholly different from the one he has been describing, or (2) the brief mention of snow in the narrative is at odds with the very specific and detailed scene of snow in the photograph.The third image faces p. 164; it shows parts of six windows in a brick building, from the outside. Each window has some reflections and some have hints of things inside. This fits the narrative much better than the previous photographs, because the narrator has just been thinking of spying on the prostitute he's been seeing. As the story develops, he peers into someone else's apartment, so the photograph invites the same kind of looking that the narrative describes. But apparently it did not concern Gardner that (1) the relation between text and image here is so close, while the other photographs are much more distant, or (2) that readers, encouraged by this closeness, might return to the previous images in search of more information, which they wouldn't find.2. Concerning the narrative.I stopped reading carefully after p. 259, for a number of reasons. At that point I could see the structure of the book: the professor, Mickelsson, is depressive, and has had serious mental health issues in the past; he has bought a house in an isolated Pennsylvania town, and he is setting up his life there. The idea is to plot the disintegration of his mind through what's called ""subjective third person narration"" -- that is, we see the world almost exclusively through Mickelsson's eyes, so his confusions become ours. A number of ers online have written well about the novel's project.For me the ingredients of his dissolution are dramatic clichés. They include:(a) A ""Blue Angel"" style descent from famous professor to clownish figure. Degradation and embarrassment await the character in many forms, both in the university and in his adopted town.(b) A staged drama, which is apparently supposed to provide tension, about his finances: he's bankrupt, and he is lying to the I.R.S..(c) A repeated device in which we hear about his philosophy seminars in enough detail so that we can follow the philosophic issues involved in his increasing idiosyncrasy and solipsism. These come across, to me, as awkwardly pedagogic.(d) A repeated device in which the book threatens to become an ""actual"" ghost story. Clearly, Gardner is only toying with this possibility, because he intends to blend real and invented ghosts. It's telling that by page 180, the narrator still hasn't asked any of the people in his newly adopted town why, exactly, they think his house is haunted. The delay is supposed to create some tension, but Mickelsson's unaccountable lack of interest in details is obviously Gardner's unaccountable belief that readers will continue to think this might be a ghost story, even after 180 pages.In short: the ingredients for a story about mental disintegration are themselves too conventional, even if the final disintegration might be more radical....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,Jun 2013,"Jun 01, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/32538.Mickelsson_s_Ghosts

It's a curious book, a mixture of some very dated-sounding mid-twentieth century rural Plains dialogue and simple photographs of chairs, tables, the ground, farm implements, and parts of buildings. I'll just note four things in particular: 1. The relation of the images to the text varies, so that it seems Morris was working out how images related to text throughout his novel. Photographs vary widely in the way they are attached to the text. Here is an incomplete catalog: (A) The person in the photograph is referred to in the text (p. 1). (B) At several points the text might be referring to the photograph, and the reader may check that, but find there's no connection (p. 3).(C) The picture is an emblem of something in the text. Old people, the narrator says at one point, ""were like the single plow below my window"" because ""you couldn't show them, or give them anything""; this is accompanied by a photo of a plow. (p. 25).(D) The image is an example of things listed in the text (p. 109).(E) The image is a study of something that is only mentioned briefly, in passing, in the text (p. 130).(F) The image doesn't fit the narrative, or contradicts it. (P. 132, a photo of coats, opposite a description of an empty house; but the next page is of a bed that perfectly matches the narrative description.)(G) Images that might, or might not, illustrate something in the text, making the reader cross back and forth from image to text (pp. 145, 146).(H) An image described in the text is illustrated, but not on the facing page (pp. 141-2).This list could be made about twice as long; for me, it's a sign that the book was an ongoing experiment, never resolved during the writing. Hollander makes a point of one image that shows newspaper clippings that are quoted by the narrator; but it's an anomaly, and it's text-based (the image as such doesn't play a part in Hollander's description).2. In terms of layout, the book has full-page images all the way up to p. 154, when the reader is surprised by a single photograph, printed across the gutter, with just seven lines of text on each page beneath. It's significant that this double-lage spread is a family photo: more on that below. From that point to the end of the book, the layout changes: the images are again full page, on the right, but the text on the left pages doesn't reach to the bottom of the page. The only conclusion it's possible to draw is that Morris decided to write just as much as would respond to the image on the facing page, and then go on to the next pair. That makes for a much closer relation between image and text, because a reader knows that the paragraphs on each page were probably written with that particular photo in mind; it also makes the pages into prose poems or independent sections of prose, producing an entirely different effect than the one in most of the book, where the reader turns pages at the speed of the narrative. (When the text is continuous, you're not obligated to stop a moment and look at each picture before you turn the page. When the text stops halfway down the page, it's a signal that only that amount of text responds to the picture.)3. There are few photographs of people. This is a common theme, I've found, in novels with captionless images. The immediate reason is that if a character in the novel is shown in a photograph, it disrupts reading, and suspends disbelief, in a particular way, which is different from the way that a photograph of a house or a street might disrupt reading. There's a lot to be said about this! In ""The Home Place,"" faces are presented in three ways: (A) In this family photograph, where people are small in the distance, so the reader's imagination is still fairly free; (B) in photographs of portrait photographs hanging on walls (p. 20), so the reader is insulated by a representation of a representation; and (C) by throwing the face into shadow, as in the very first photograph in the book, which is of an old man and an inner tube, standing in front of a barn: we see the kind of place and person, but not the expression itself. (See also p. 127, where a face is in shadow, and p. 50, where we see the old man's wrinkled neck from behind, but not his face.)4. There is a theory of images in the book. On p. 141, the narrator explains using ideas of Protestant imagery:""The word beauty is not a Protestant thing. It doesn't describe what there is about an old man's shoes. The Protestant word for that is character. Character is supposed to cover what I feel..."" It would be interesting to pursue this reading: the images aren't beautiful, in the way other authors (like Walker Evans?) had taken them to be; they have something to do with a non-aesthetic property called, inadequately, ""character.""5. Precedents for the book. The history of novels with captionless images is not continuous. From ""Bruges-la-Morte"" to Sebald, it seems to have been reinvented several times. The introduction by John Hollander names some precedents for ""The Home Place"" (1968), including books in the 1930s that used photographs from the Farm Security Administration, and ""Let Us Now Praise Famous Men"" (1941). Buy Hollander also notes that this book is ""almost a unique sort of novel"" because it is a novel ""with"" photographs, rather than ""in"" photographs. It's possible Morris imagined himself as the inventor of this way of writing.For all these and other reasons, this is a very engaging book. The prose itself is accomplished and sharp, but it wouldn't be the thing that would lead me to re-read the book....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,"May 09, 2013","May 09, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/450250.The_Home_Place

If it is the best, it’s because of Johnson’s light touch. The first hint of metanarrative is on the first page. The book begins with a one-sentence paragraph:“Christie Malry was a simple person.”There then follows a paragraph describing a stupid decision he makes. The third paragraph is again one sentence:“I did tell you Christie was a simple person.”The little nag here doesn’t lead to more of the same; instead the novel is punctuated by first-person asides, novelist to reader, in which Johnson tells us he doesn’t need to continue on such-and-such a point, or doesn’t think we want him to, or can’t be bothered. I did not laugh out lout after the first four pages, but these passages are handled very carefully and they are never tedious, as in so many other first-generation postmodern novels. The author’s interruptions are never longer than this:“I am told one has to put incidents like that in; for the suspense, you know” (p. 107)In the opening pages Johnson also plays with ridiculously rare words: “exeleutherostomise” (“to speak out freely, especially in an inappropriate moment”), “trituration,” “cryptorchid” (“failure of one or both testes to descend into the scrotum”), “eirenicon” (p. 42).Toward the end of the book there’s a brief chapter in which Johnson sits down with his main character, Christie, and they talk over the book’s progress. Johnson keeps varying the formula of self-awareness:“‘I’ll see what I can do,’ said the goodhearted Shrike [Christie’s girlfriend], ‘but how can we be said to be perfectly happy a few lines back, and now be complaining about the monotony of the diet?’‘Easily,’ smiled Christie.” (p. 139)“And he had contrived a way of throwing these switches by remote control, so to speak, in an unusual way which I am not going to bother to invent on this occasion.” (p. 101)The reason all this makes the book hard to  is that it strikes many readers as perfect. At the moment (April 2013) the nearly 500 s on Goodreads average 4.5 stars, and there are many five-star s on LibraryThing and Amazon. But it’s an odd kind of perfection that appears so closed, so neat, so finished. The humor is pitch-perfect but safe. The many little jokes, together with the brief chapters, the many half-title pages, and the white spaces between some sentences, depressurize an already low-pressure narrative, keeping it well deflated beginning to end.The second reason this book is hard to assess is that its theme is terrorism. Christie figures that society owes him, so he keeps double-entry books on what he is owed and gives himself credit when he causes mayhem or kills people. There is also an unusual act of cruelty in the book: Johnson gives Christie cancer, and kills him off, apparently with no ill-will from Christie. I can’t think of a reason why terrorism or cancer should not be treated in a flippant, insouciant manner, but here that carelessness is very hard to understand. It isn’t as if Johnson thinks that serious things need to be deflated: it’s as if he feels they are already deflated: they don’t have much purchase on his imagination one way or the other. This is where it becomes impossible to forget that he committed suicide the same year this book appeared. The book has a particular lack of affect that seems more disconnected than cynical, more neutral than critical. An online er who calls this a “spiteful slip of a novel” may be half right, but I don’t sense the spite, only a memory of what spite once felt like. In that respect this book is entirely different from other novels of disaffected, lower middle class people in the UK in the 1970s, such as Alisdair Gray’s “1982, Janine.”PS. Among the five hundred or more online s I found this one on Goodreads, by someone with the username knig, posted January 17, 2012. It is one of those geeky s that takes the author to task for something technical, but this one is a kind of miniature masterpiece in its own right. There are five photocopied sheets of double-entry bookkeeping in the book, showing Christie’s balance sheet from his point of view. (He gets credits for killing people and being a troublemaker, and debits for insults received.) Knig contributes a real accountant’s  of double entry bookkeeping. It’s interesting that his (or her)  is drier than Johnson’s book, and has more affect; for me that shows this book’s lightness and lack of affect. I quote from Knig’s :""…what I’ve retained from Accountancy 101 makes me cringe at this blatant misuse of credit and debit. (Done deliberately I believe, as Johnson worked in accounts for six years. He must have had SOME inkling.) Debit does not mean take away from, reduce, diminish or anything remotely like that. It simply means a sum is entered on the left hand side of the equation. Nothing more. Similarly credit. It’s not an increase, just a right hand sum. Not to mention, if your boss shouts and you decide to debit, you can’t credit by shouting back. That’s not double entry, because its the same variable in two different events in the space time continuum. It would have to work a little like this: ""Boss shouts""Dr Assets (you now have a shout, which you didn’t before you were shouted at).""Cr Liabilities. Name it anything, like “I’m gonna get you sucka.” (You owe the boss a shout back.)""Now, when you’re ready to shout back (or kill 300 people or whatever):""Cr Assets (you’ve just shouted back and depleted your stored shout).""Dr Liabilities (or the sucka account). (You no longer owe a shout. Accounts are square.)""...more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,"Apr 19, 2013","Apr 19, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/762334.Christie_Malry_s_Own_Double_Entry

It takes risks with form, wThe Relation between Risky Structure and Graphical TypesettingGray is an experimental novelist; this was his second novel. It takes risks with form, with the reader's sympathy, with coherence, and with the capacity to suspend disbelief. Gray was also a painter and printmaker, and he made the cover and drew his own self-portrait for the jacket. The book also has some pages of graphical typography, which he says are unconsciously borrowed from ""Tristram Shandy."" A. The structure of the narrativeThe protagonist, John McLeish, is a middle aged alcoholic and drug addict. He has had, by his own account, a disastrous life, and he's been especially miserable with women. He's full of ""self-disgust"" and embarrassment. (p. 106) He's in a hotel room, thinking (and by implication writing), drinking, and popping pills. The risks begin immediately, when it seems the book is going to be a series of pornographic fantasies, designed to distract him from thinking about his miserable cowardly behavior, his pitiful obsessions, and his ineffectual life. That's risky on two levels, for two reasons:1. As an idea for a novel, it's risky because pornographic narratives are notoriously difficult to manage. Readers might be aroused, bored, offended, or numbed, in succession, repeatedly. That was the 1970s reception of de Sade; the repetition in his novels was said to be a psychoanalytic symptom or an emblem of the endlessness of narrative in general. Here, the novelist's idea of attractive women and how they dress is especially annoying. (Gray has McLeish dismiss de Sade in a brief couple of sentence, for an irrelevant reason. What can that be except classic repression?)So early on I began worrying for Gray, wondering if he could sustain either the pornography or the abrupt transitions from fantasies to realist descriptions of middle-class Scottish life. 2. As representation of someone's imagination, it's risky because the character, McLeish, is using these fantasies for two purposes at once: they supposedly help him to stop thinking about his actual life, but they are also masturbation fantasies—but he doesn't want to wank, because that depresses him even more, and so he keeps wanting to end the very fantasies that are sustaining him. How long, I wondered, could McLeish, in the novel, continue in that mindset? It doesn't make things easier that the two worlds are so far apart. The fantasies are lurid, full of clichés, repetitive, sexist in the most obvious ways, and the stories of McLeish's real life have all those same qualities but are opposite in affect. The pornography is relentless, optimistic, and controlling; the memories are equally relentless, but pathetic and pessimistic.So early on I began worrying for McLeish, wondering if he could sustain... etc., and those worries remained when the pages of the book ended.B. Notes on layout and typographyConcerning the cover: Gray has several styles; the design on the cover is a nude man in a variation of Leonardo's homo ad circulum. It's done in the kind of mid-20th c. woodcut style that was itself a belated emulation of Beardsley and other fin-de-siecle illustrators. It gives of a stale perfume, as Ezra Pound once said of his own first collection of poetry, ""A Lume Spento."" (He called his early work, which had a similar serious preciousness, ""stale cream-puffs."") The style does not fit the novel's content.Concerning the graphic typography: almost exactly in the middle of the book, McLeish has a drug-induced breakdown, which is expressed partly in the narrative, and partly in the gradual introduction of all-caps words DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG DUNG and partly with words that run down the marginsCOLDCOLDCOLDCOLDCOLDCOLDCOLDCOLDCOLDCOLDCOLDCOLDand partly in italics, boldface, and marginal annotations, and finally in a couple of pages where the text funnels down to a point, and new texts come in at each side. It's a graphical crux, and in the middle there is also print that is set sideways and upside-down. (p. 184) Right at the crucial point, printed across one line, is a word that condenses the pornography with the pathetic life the narrator is actually leading:SUFFUFFUFFUFFUFFUCKUCKUCKUCKATINGwith ""fuck"" right in the middle.This is all hand typeset (in 1982, if Gray had lived in California, he could have used the early microcomputers, but this book was done without that kind of assistance). Naturally it is necessary to avoid judging the book anachronistically: but it's still possible to ask if the graphical typesetting expresses what it is meant to. I find it the most convincing part of the book, partly because it is so fastidiously managed, even though it means to depict a moment of hysterical crisis and hallucination; and partly because Gray permits himself other voices, which can't be assigned to anyone in the book. This is the only time in the book that such a thing happens, and it is strange and liberating.C. Returning to the reading.After this, the book relents on its own structure, the one that worried me, and becomes more of a narrative about McLeish's actual life in Scotland. In the second half, there are fewer interruptions from the pornographic fantasies, and when they occur they are more managed. At one point, McLeish is having a fantasy about his principal imaginary object of desire, Janine, involving ""two unfastened studs in her skirt""; he interrupts this with the words ""and this is NOT the fantasy I intended,"" and then immediately resumes his thoughts about politics. The very next sentence is ""One of the earliest aims of the United States space programme was to create a self-supporting human colony on the moon..."" (p. 311). This is an atrophied, defanged version of the more hysterical, less effective, interruptions that fill the narrative up to the crisis.In this way the book becomes less risky, and for me less interesting, after the crux. It ends with a moment of redemption that is suitably pathetic: McLeish remembers a minor moment of courage that he had back in school, facing up to a sadistic teacher. There could hardly be a less self-aggrandizing moment of triumph, and it's so tiny in relation to what he had done, and left undone, during his life, that it's clearly meant to function as the only possible believable redemption. For me, it's a patch that is required by the second half of the book. The more radical first half couldn't have used that moment, even if it had been available to McLeish or Gray. So my worries about Gray, and McLeish, sustaining their radical structures, seem to have been justified.D. Envoi, on the politicsI wasn't taken by the politics in the book, and it's one of Gray's central preoccupations. A good treatment is in Stephen Bernstein's book ""Alisdair Gray,"" which devotes a chapter to ""1982, Janine,"" and the many links between the narrator's politics, his sense of class, place, and self, and his sexual fantasies....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,"Apr 05, 2013","Apr 05, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/1251167.1982_Janine

This primitiveness is lodged exactly where it should not be, in the fluency and ease of his storytelling. As ers always say, he is an inexhaustible source of stories, and in this book the stories never stop: there’s never any danger of slowing down; that is fitting because somehow slowing down feels like treacherous thing to do. What would happen if one story failed to succeed the last in a seamless sequence? Why should that seem like a problem? It feels that way, I think, because despite Auster’s themes—the book is about a widowed older man, his daughter who was abandoned by her husband, and the daughter’s daughter whose boyfriend died in Iraq—this is a book in which stories are used as distractions to avoid thinking more deeply. Auster is absolutely accomplished as a storyteller, and that theme (using stories to distract yourself) is built into the book. The principal character invents some stories of his own, to help him not to think about his family. That much Auster knows, and controls. He even has his principal character kill off the protagonist of his own invented story. But at another level, Auster doesn’t seem aware that all the stories in his book, and not just the ones invented by his narrator, serve the function of avoiding real introspection, real difficulty. As evidence of that I take the quality that binds all the stories in this novel together: the stories all run with a predictable, uninterrupted fluency. They are like driving by the scene of an accident: you slow up a little, but not enough to get involved. The story that the narrator invents in order not to think about his own past is itself as threadbare as they come (a post-apocalyptic fantasy, along the lines of any number of TV fantasy movies), but that doesn’t seem to bother either the narrator (who is supposedly a literary critic, and should really show some embarrassment at his own story), or the novelist (who is actually a prolific writer, and could easily have added a subtle sign that he didn’t find his narrator’s invented stories as entrancing as his narrator does). That is what I mean by “primitive”: the architecture of the postmodern novel is there, and there’s a clarity of structure and pacing that few novelists can match, but Auster seems relentlessly to misunderstand the function of narrative: it cannot only be a balm or distraction. Narrative has to break down or get itself in trouble, or falter, or question itself—not just the way a character might question the truth of a narrative, or its appropriateness, or its usefulness in distracting him—but the way a character might fail just telling a story, fail in the telling and not just in deciding whether to tell, the way this sentence is failing because I can’t quite get my thought about it right.There are a few moments in Man in the Dark when the flow of stories stop, but they are stage-managed to create a little shocks, or streams of tears: and that, too, is a kind of evasion, an easier sort of crisis, something not at all genuinely persistently moving. The surprise ending of the entire book is one such moment. Spoiler alert: I’m about to say what that surprise is. But note: books that can actually be spoiled by giving away their endings are trivial sorts of books like murder mysteries and detective stories. This book presents itself as literary fiction, and there probably shouldn’t be a spoiler in it. In this book the surprise is that the grand-daughter’s boyfriend was kidnapped in Iraq, and the family has seen his gruesome execution video on the internet.When I read that I groaned. Isn’t ordinary human suffering enough to create empathy and significance? Is it really necessary to tack on something spectacular, something topical and political, something garish and horrible? Doesn’t that sort of ornament just distract from what really counts—which is, in this case, that a person has died? The surprise ending is tremendously irritating, not for its politics, but because it functions just the way an elaborate murder does in Agatha Christie: it helps us not to think about what we are actually witnessing, a death. Readers of murder mysteries expect that kind of superficiality. Here, where there are literary ambitions, and where many pages are devoted to people’s feelings and thoughts, it is not just annoying: it is bewildering that a novelist could think such a surprise is sufficient, justified, necessary, sensible, or even expressive....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,"Apr 05, 2013","Apr 05, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3136288-man-in-the-dark

""Jamais,"" for example, is isolated on its page, where it resounds against the white paper like a single loud word echoing in a silent room. But in the end such “concrete” devices are only accents on the fundamentally anti–pictorial nature of the entire typographic and expressive project: and that is to represent hasard, the meaningless, chance and momentary “place” or configuration. As the final page declares, the poem itself is a “constellation,” something that seems to have meaning but does not, an act that is intensely deliberated but ends up meaning “nothing.” Un coup de dés is anti–pictorial in that it forms its picture of arbitrariness by flowing without interruption across frames and pages. It is a beautiful paradox: print, behaving as print always does, forms the best representation, the best picture, of something unrepresentable. Mallarmé’s poem is the most reflective conversation between typographic page and written meaning that has yet been produced, and it demonstrates with great persuasiveness just how close print and pictures are, and yet how difficult it is to ever fuse the two. ...more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,not set,"Feb 25, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2180403.Un_coup_de_d_s_jamais_n_abolira_le_hasard

It concerns a sinkhole that appeared in a mining community called Blyvooruitzicht in South Africa in 1964 and swallowed a house, killing five people. I have three sorts of comments: on the book's structure, on its precedents, and on the oddly marginal place of the visual.A. StructureThe book is divided into three sections. First are twenty-one poems (they are numbered), many about people who died or were involved in the event; a ""Mediation"" (subtitled ""Appendices""), with six short poems on such things as ""Ethics"" and ""Autobiography""; a section of ""Commentary"" supposedly written by someone named Alan Charles; and finally a third section called ""Present,"" which is a prose essay on ""The Secret History of 'Sinking,'"" signed by Michael Green. The book concludes with Green's song lyrics.The author presents himself (or rather, the ostensibly multiple authors present themselves) as fully aware of the complications of this structure, and its inability to hold. At one point, for example, Green notes that ""with this the allegory / Becomes rather heavy-handed"" (p. 74); and there is a poem called ""Failures with Metaphor"" (p. 84). (It's ironic in a different way that the author himself makes a negative comment on his website concerning ers of the book who didn't see the structure.) The preeminent tone is realist, and the book is principally posed as a historical inquiry and archive, with the important -- central -- exception of the twenty-one poems, which play with the metaphor of sinking and the coincidences of politics and geology.B. PrecedentsAs a collection of self-aware, historiographically ironic fragments, mingled with first-person prose and serious poetry, this book is not without precedents. Here are a few, in some order from those the author knows and acknowledges to those he doesn't mention and may not know:1. The chapters and poems are peppered with epigraphs by Walter Benjamin, Camus, Nietzsche, Jameson, Barthes, and Derrida: a sadly predictable canon of theorists favored in poststructuralism. Green uses the quotations well, but they are such a familiar territory that they bring back the smell of certain academic hallways in the 1980s.2. The chapters and poems are also decorated with epigraphs by Woolf, Auden (""In Praise of Limestone,"" an inevitable parallel), William Carlos Williams, and others, pointing to a conservative reading of English-language modernists. Green has one of his fictional contributors say that he is ""not content with aspiring to a 'Wasteland'"" for South Africa"" (p. 111). This is somewhat at odds with the academic citations, because Green's literary epigraphs miss the generation of Barthes and Derrida, and the authors they themselves read (including older writers like Balzac and Flaubert, and contemporaries like Ponge, Cixous, and Jabès). The book's structure is itself partly beholden to Woolf, Auden, Eliot, and other modernists, especially Williams. ""Paterson"" is a proximate model for the mixture of essays, documents, and poetry, but Williams mingles, uneasily in my reading, with the poststructuralist intertextuality suggested, and practiced, by Benjamin, Derrida, and others.3. The poems themselves owe something to confessional poetry, and something to Williams (there's a pastiche on p. 50), but also a lot to Wallace Stevens, especially in their intermittent illogic, their direct grammar, and their propensity to flow into allegory without announcing the fact. 4. A text that Green appears not to know, but is a close parallel, is Hans Magnus Enzensberger's wonderful book-length poem on the Titanic. Enzensberger is also concerned with ethics and politics, and the impossibility of capturing a disaster in poetry. And like Green, he experiments with the limits of metaphor.5. Another is Paul Metcalf, whose books combine factual information with prose narrative, occasional poems, and documents. 6. Or, more recently, William Vollmann's ""Imperial.""In short: the book as a whole is not as new as it proposes. Some of its voices are in dialogue with the past, but others aren't.C. Regarding the visualOne reason I bought this book is the picture on the back cover, showing the sinkhole at the Blyvooruitzicht Mine, with neighboring houses perched at the brink. It's a remarkable photograph. On the front cover is a woman holding her hands to her face, apparently in shock. (The photo is credited to someone named Carole Lynch, possibly his partner.) It's a hokey image, especially the way it's designed as if the edges had been ripped; but it's much better than the cover Green himself wanted, which is on his website (michaelcawoodgreen.com). That cover, ""designed by his partner, Carole,"" includes Millais's ""Ophelia.""But it's the image on the back cover that interests me. Why, given Green's wide-ranging interest in documentation of all kinds, did he not illustrate his book? Why not put that image in the text itself, if only as a frontispiece? For me (and I suspect this must be the case with other readers), the photograph on the back cover is integral to the book. I often turned to it to compare details described in the book. There are several references to news photographs in the book -- especially a passage citing ""Several of the photographic spreads / Covering Blyvooruitzicht's overnight sensation / Feature it: / A washing machine / Poised inches from the edge of the half-house"" (p. 23). At one point we learn that Green had ""four years of tertiary [graduate-level] History of Art,"" even though he was always weak at visual arts (pp. 123-4).It is a sign, for me, of a pervasively non-visual imagination that it did not seem at all anomalous to put a magnetically attractive, narratively central object outside the text itself.

(p. 60.) There is interesting literature on this book--the art historian Georges Didi-Huberman has written on it--but that it not my interest. I read it because it has illustrations, photographs of the city. (So it is part of my project to read novels with images in them.)All of the following comments are provisional because I have not had a chance to look at the original French edition.[Note added October 19, 2013: since I wrote this I have learned that the photographs in this edition were taken by the translator. His 23 photographs replace the original 35 photographs. The book doesn't announce that; I learned it from a documentary film! So all comments here about individual photographs are actually about Will Stone, the translator. Even more astonishing, in the film Stone says his only purpose in replacing Rodenbach's photographs with his own was ""to show how little has changed"" -- a completely incomprehensible motivation if readers not only haven't seen the original photographs, but don't even know that what they're seeing aren't the originals.]1. The influence of the non-fictional character of the photographs on the degree of reality of the fictional characters. What's interesting here is the juxtaposition of fiction with non-fiction in the form of photography. The narrative describes real places in Bruges, including the names of artworks, churches, and streets, so the setting (as it is presented in prose) is different from the setting of, say, ""Madame Bovary,"" where the provincial town could be anywhere in France. Strangely, the narrative is more specific about real places than the images, because they are not captioned (so people unfamiliar with the city would not know where they were taken). It is not at all clear to me how to characterize the slightly greater degree of veracity this gives to the fictional characters, especially because the plot is mainly an interior monologue (told in third person) with a sensational murder at the end.2. The reason the photographs have no people in them.Almost all the images are empty streets. I think only one image has a person in it; one image is a sculpted tomb; one has swans. As Sebald also saw, it is crucial not to have too many people in photographs that are set in novels, because then the reader will try to identify the characters with figures in the photographs. The one figure I can see in these reproductions is far enough back so that it isn't clear whether he, or she, is the woman who is being described in the accompanying narrative. On the facing page (p. 82) is the line: ""she made her way back along the dead streets..."" so (if the photograph is opposite that line in the original French edition) the parallel is irresistible. Because no figures appear elsewhere--or at least most streets are clearly deserted--a read can conclude that Rodenbach did not think about this issue: otherwise the anomaly of this one figure would have struck him, and he would have seen how it disrupts the way both streets and figures are described elsewhere. And because he did not think about, it, it's also clear that photographs, for him, worked in series or signified as a single overlapping evocation rather than a series of discrete scenes (which is what they obviously are: they are all very carefully framed).3. The relation between the narrator and the person who must have taken the photographs.The author makes no mention of who took them: they are presented as the actual town itself, through which the fictional characters move. It's the same gambit as in Sebald and others: if, as a narrator, you develop a character who is a photographer, then it is that person who must have been holding the camera, adjusting the focus, managing the flash, and so forth, and that awareness is intrusive. By avoiding all mention of photographic equipment in the narrative, the authors manage, provisionally--and, for me, unconvincingly--to present images as if they were partly the projections of the character's mind or mood, or as if they were simply there, un-authored, without agency or context. Surely this strategy excludes a tremendous richness of meaning.4. The coordination between images and text varies without any clear pattern.On p. 89 in the English edition, the narrator is speaking about how he feels guilty whenever he sees one of Bruges's main spires. The page turn to 90 includes the phrase ""the towers mocked his wretched [sinful] love."" Opposite is a photograph of one of them. It's a striking correspondence. On p. 96, the narrator is describing the inside of a church, but the image opposite is an unusually uninteresting view of the back of the outside of that church, implying the narrator spent time outside, or perhaps implying that the art in the church couldn't be adequately photographed? On p. 124, a procession involving hundreds of people passes by in front of the narrator's house. On the bottom of p. 124, the streets ""had quickly emptied."" The image opposite is another empty street. Again the correspondence seems intentional. But most photographs in the book do not correspond to the text, so these few examples would seem to indicate that Rodenbach had not completely worked out how to integrate photographs into his novel: or, to put it differently, he felt that such integration or correspondences were unimportant in relation to the overall purpose of evoking the ""dead"" city. But what a simple idea that is regarding photography, and images in general--that they work en masse, while narrative moves in discrete passages, and even through discrete ekphrases....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,not set,"Jan 28, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/133164.Bruges_La_Morte

The author is in his 30s; he grew up in California; he is Asian-American (that's clear from the book), and his family is Taiwanese (that's mentioned only in the acknowledgments at the end). The version of the author who narrates the book has the author's real name, and is also in his 30s, and also grew up in California. But he has a white-collar job as a repairman for time travel devices. The book opens as pure science fiction, but elements of Yu's childhood are woven in as the book progresses. Most of the narrative is about his father and mother, and their suburban house and neighborhood. In the story, Yu's parents' actual house is at the center of a diminished reality, torn apart and rearranged, and now known to be part of a larger science-fictional universe numbered 31. When this works as a narrative device, it's because time travel is an allegory for people's disaffection and alienation from one another. Yu's father, an engineer in real life (as we learn in the acknowledgments), is said to have designed a time travel device in his garage; at one point he moved just a minute into the past, so people couldn't communicate directly with him. In the book, he disappeared into some other time; that's presented as an allegory for his emotional distance.Two comments: one about the narrative, and the other about the images that are inserted into the text.1. The narrative is clever, self-referential, ironic, knowing, post-postmodern, and so forth. The problem is that the knowing inventions and ironies melt into a mush of sentimental memories. The central episode concerns his father's failed attempt to become famous. It takes place on a baseball field, combining the bathos of ""Field of Dreams"" (or, I suppose, any American baseball narrative) with the endless longing and disaster of Charlie Chaplin movies. The emotions here are maudlin. That could have been meliorated in two ways: it would have been possible to expand and strengthen the ""science-fictional"" parts so that they had some control over the presentation of the deep emotionalism of the central scenes; and it would have been possible to put in some of the details, the sights and smells and ideas and preoccupations of middle-class Asian American life in the 1980s in California. But in this book, the texture of Yu's family life is nearly absent: there is nothing but his distance from his mother and father, and his father's bottomless, pathetic desire for success and inexorable, predictable slow-motion fall into suburban obscurity and failure. Even Buddhism, mentioned in passing as his parents' religion, is presented in a manner so devoid of detail that it could have been written by someone who only knows Buddhist temples from Hollywood movies. Where is the grit, the feeling, of this suburban life? What exactly did his family do in their spare time? What television did they watch? What cultural histories interested them? Did they subscribe to Taiwanese newspapers? It's the absence of culture and history that bother me here, and open the door to the childishly endless emotionalism of the central scenes of the book. Not every narrative has to be as full of everyday life as Updike, Cheever, Hemon, Pamuk (or any number of others) but there is nothing here but the yawning abyss of middle-class aspiration and the insatiable desire for success and love. There is only one fully successul, immersive fantasy life in the book, and that is the character of a successful research scientist, who enters the narrative briefly and is presented as calm, distanced, and effortless. He lives in a secure fantasy: everyone else's world is a wreck of disillusion, propped by ineffective opiates (time travel, impossible success, unattainable love).When Yu is writing as an ironic contemporary novelist, and not as a memoirist, he tries to up the ante of time-travel narratives by being cleverer about paradoxes than his predecessors have. It happens I saw the movie ""Looper"" while I was reading this book -- in fact I saw it just before I came to the page in the book that has a diagram of a time-travel loop -- and Yu's treatment is certainly more complex. But all of that just leads down the road to unironic science fiction or the common complexities of any murder mystery. ""Memento"" is still the most clever in that vein. But it's not what Yu really wants, and in the end the ""science-fictional"" physics, diagrams, definitions, and jargon are just distractions. When Yu writes about time-travel paradoxes, he sounds like a mixture of Mark Lerner and Douglas Adams, but it's as if he can't keep his mind on it in any consistent way: sometimes the time-travel devices are allegories of emotional states; sometimes they are said to be founded on emotional states; but in other passages the time-travel evaporates, and we're on the Field of Dreams.2. I read the book for the images, as part of a project to read contemporary fiction that uses images. Here images come in several kinds: in the Kindle version, there is one picture of the pages of the book itself (an almost mandatory moment of self-reference), several diagrams (drawn with GraphViz?), an image of a hypercube (drawn in Mathematica?), a couple of book covers (drawn in Photoshop?), a made-up, childish sketch for the cover of the book, a link to a YouTube video, a link to an entry on quantum mechanics in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (disappointingly obvious, after the book's more arcane mathematical references), and, most interestingly, a number of pictures of Yu's neighborhood. Those snapshots are what mostly interest me about this book. They make the entire ""science-fictional universe"" melt away: they remind me, repeatedly, that this is the product of a thirty-year old Asian-American writer, and that everything I am reading is a fiction. That's an unusual use for images in fiction. The narrative is also open about the fact that the ""science fictional"" part of the book is fiction, but a snapshot of Yu's totally ordinary house (linked to the words ""as soon as you step outside your house"") declares the fictional nature of the book in a decisive way. Another photo, an entirely indifferent picture of two houses and a couple of cars, is captioned ""Unincorporated region between SF and reality, in close proximity to Charles Yu's childhood home"" and linked to the text:""Despite improvement in recent years, successful transition into the SF zone remains difficult to achieve fr many immigrant families, and even after decades of an earnest and often desperate striving for acceptance and assimilation, many remain in the lower-middle reaches of the zone, along the border between SF and 'reality.'""That sentence is a perfect one-line description of the book, whose bathos brings it right back to the father and son's ""desperate striving"" and erases all the ""science-fictional"" irony. Once a reader has seen one of these suburban snapshots, it is difficult to suspend disbelief and return to the narrator's world as a time traveler. Yu never expects his readers to fully suspend their disbelief -- this is a novel about novels and movies about time travel -- but I don't think he realizes how coercive these photographs are. They are so relentlessly, unanswerably real that the narrative becomes a filigree. I think the fact that this did not concern Yu is a sign that he did not take the images as seriously as I think they need to be taken. By the time a reader comes to the picture captioned ""The park where my father attempted to sell his time machine prototype,"" and sees, again, an utterly ordinary park with an utterly ordinary baseball field, it's clear that Yu isn't really looking at his own images. Photographs proclaim their reality much more loudly than any declaration in the narrative about the difference between Yu's ""real"" world and the ""science-fictional universe."" Images work differently, and perhaps the only way to control their reality effect is to ignore them -- to refuse to notice that photographs are unanswerably strong....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,not set,"Jan 23, 2013",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7726420-how-to-live-safely-in-a-science-fictional-universe

Here at least, ""memorable"" means prone to uncontrolled, uncategorizable narrative misbehavior.""Box men"" are homeless men who walk around inside cardboard boxes. The boxes are fitted out with viewing portholes, little shelves, hooks, and supplies. The descriptions of the box are vivid, so precise and unexpected, so that it seems they could only be the result of actually building such a box and living in it. Abe is extremely precise about what goes into the box—what the box man carries around with him—and how such a box is constructed. I would expect that from any realist or surrealist novel; but the details are inserted into unexpected places in the narrative, where they would only occur to someone who has actually spent time in such a box. The stains on the inside of the box, the uses of a small shelf under the observation window, the purposes of a plastic tablet—they outdo Nabokov in their myopic realism, and they produce, for me, a creeping sense that Abe did more than just imagine his subject. I haven't looked into this, but it wouldn't surprise me if there were such things as ""box men"" in 1970s Japan, and if Abe wasn't one himself. And since ""box men"" are sociopaths and voyeurs, that's a kind of narrative unreliability that goes well beyond what a reader might infer about the author of Lolita.(In 2022, a student in a seminar reconstructed a box according to Abe's instructions. We took turns walking around the city in it. I no longer have any doubt Abe did the same. The box was simultaneously empowering, because you can't see the person inside, and embarrassing, because it was about as long as a miniskirt. I used it to stop traffic in downtown Chicago, and I tried walking into a bank lobby.)The story turns around a ""box man,"" another person who may want to become a ""box man,"" and a nurse they both like. The other man is explicitly a Doppelgaenger and projection of the narrator, so in terms of men's roles, the book is about the nakedness of walking around in public without a box, the temptations of the box's security, and the odd feeling of slipping out of society and living in, and as, a box. In terms of women's roles, the book is substantially more bleak. The nurse only exists in the story to take off her clothes and pose. She is watched by the ""box man,"" once from outside a window, and later from inside a hospital room. The narrator fantasizes about cutting her up and eating her, but that's just a passing thought. Mostly he is stricken with embarrassment about his own body, and the sum total of his idea of relations with women is watching them undress. It's an openly childish, masturbatory fantasy. Over the course of the book, the effect of that relentless, unreflective, supposedly natural way of representing relations is increasingly unpleasant. When he wrote this book, Abe's imaginative universe was so shriveled and poisoned that he could only imagine women as things that are peered at from inside cardboard boxes. I have no problem with violent, misanthropic, deranged or psychotic narratives or narrators, but this one is also unreflective.The narrative is quirky to the point of opacity, often uncontrolled, wandering, and shapeless. At one point the narrator admits he has made up the other ""box man"" entirely; several pages are devoted to a fantasy of turning into a fish and drowning; the story is interrupted by notes about the color of the writer's ink or the nature of the paper he is writing on. I take all those shapeless experiments as strategies to keep writing, to get the bizarre story, whatever it is, down on paper. I take the whole novel as a purge: Abe had lived this way, or tried it for a while, or wanted to, and wanted to get past it by writing the book.What makes all this so memorable? It's the book's refusal to behave. Like Watt or Naked Lunch, two parallels in this regard, it strongly refuses continuity of purpose and imagination. Abe's combination of polymorphic perversions, sociopathic encounters, dry descriptions, inexplicable asides, obsessions with squalor and excretions, grainy street photography, detailed how-to instructions for living in carboard boxes, a plot that veers so often out of the author's control, and small, badly reproduced, disconnected photographs makes it one of the most memorable books in all postwar fiction.

The opening chapterAlthough it's not crucial to this book, ""The Shadow of Memory"" is a good example of how visual art is abused in ""literary"" novels. The opening chapters are about Pontormo's late frescoes for San Lorenzo, which survive only as drawings. The narrator and an older man have both read about them, and the drawings are used in conversation as examples of astonishing acts of imagination. I am allergic to almost all appearances of fine art in novels, for three reasons: first, paintings in particular tend to be used to register a kind of reverence for high culture; second, the art is often inexactly conjured, so it exists more as an idea of something wonderful than an image in the reader's mind; and third, descriptions tend to be dependent on second-hand and popularized accounts in art history textbooks and museum guides.If, as a reader, you do not already know about Pontormo's lost frescoes, then the descriptions in these pages can't be much more than abstract and dry. If, on the other hand, you do know, then these descriptions are loose, full of clichés, and inadequate to their subject matter. It follows that the pages in this book devoted to Pontormo (and later, to Brunelleschi and others) are for people who have a glancing acquaintance with the art, and a reverence that comes from visits to museums and time spent in college classrooms. This kind of foggy adulation and unwitting repetition of popular ideas is a commonplace in novels that include visual art. In this novel, Pontormo serves mainly to show that the narrator and his friend are in possession of supposedly arcane knowledge (they read ""manuscripts"" in the Bibliotheque Nationale), outside the world of middle-class values. The only novel about fine art that I know that escapes this is Thomas Bernhard's ""Old Masters"": in that book the narrator doesn't really even like the one painting that he has gone to see nearly every day of his adult life: it's just the only thing in the world that is more or less tolerable to him. Removing the adulation removes the problem of the worship of erudition; removing the need to describe the artwork (which is a relatively unimportant Tintoretto portrait) takes away the problem of descriptions so vague that the works fail to be clearly present in the text; and removing the interest in the work's value lets Bernhard avoid repeating information in art history textbooks.Most of Comment's book isn't about visual art, but the painting and architecture are parts of Comment's dream of perfect erudition. In that respect ""The Shadow of Memory"" is a muddled mixture of Canetti, Bernhard, and Sartre (especially the autodidact in ""Nausea,"" and the tutor in ""The Words""). There are several possibilities: the book might be a novel of ideas (in this case, about how people possess memory, what kinds of memory people can have, whether memory can be learned, whether its loss can be slowed), or perhaps a psychological thriller, or a character study (the narrator and the compulsive, unpleasant old man he befriends), or a genre novel (because the book's publicity materials make it sound as if the narrator enters into a magical Faustian bargain to possess a memory). I found the book unconvincing as a drama, as a description of character, and as a representation of memory. The narrator says he has a memory disorder, and wants to acquire a memory: but even in the first few pages, it isn't at all clear what makes him different from anyone else. At some point the reader realizes that the narrator doesn't have a memory disorder of the sort he claims, but rather a kind of dementia. Comment himself seems never to have decided what place tension and narrative drive play in the narrator's interactions with the older man: it's as if Comment hoped to mingle a novel of ideas with a psychological thriller.In the end, the book poses itself mainly as a novel of ideas: but the notions of memory, its loss, and the ways it might be kept are inconsistently imagined. I am not convinced Comment himself has a clear idea of what memory means in this novel, how people might possess different sorts of memory, or what it might feel like to have those allegedly different kinds of memory. I'm not convinced he has thought through the ways that his genre-novel premise, the pages that develop his characters, the passages used to create the sort of tension that is expected in psychological thrillers, the devotion to what is taken as high culture and vast learning, the Bernhard-style rants against the bourgeoisie, and the scattered pieces of theories of memory, might possibly come together into a novel....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,not set,"Jan 13, 2013",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/14433737-shadow-of-memory

(Review here.)This book is quite different, and it showcases qualities of Saeterbakken that I didn’t like as much: his penchant for nauseating detail, which he thinks of as darkly humorous (a man smells his cold sweaty feet, and wonders why he enjoys the smell); his tendency to write in a succession of set pieces (in this book each ends with an exemplary loss of self-control); his way of characterizing people using the most disgusting possible images (a man who spends his day swatting flies, whose arm is covered with tiny fly bites); his general feeling that life is a succession of awkward, humiliating, embarrassing, and futile experiences. But this book does have an overall arc, from a genuine tragedy, briefly glimpsed, through a series of trivial and ridiculous social failures, and back suddenly to the real tragedy. That arc does hold it together, if only in retrospect. But I may not read the third book in the trilogy (it hasn’t yet been translated), because I think that Saeterbakken’s attraction to dark comedy, embarrassment, and awkwardness are still standing in the way of any more substantial pessimism. All the little gaffes, sweaty palms, fears, blushes, and tics are meant as entertainments and even as expressive vehicles: but actually they are bandages that soothe, protect, and hide the deeper wounds. I would love it if Saeterbakken would just give them up. I don’t want to laugh (I don’t, anyway) or shiver in repulsion (I seldom do, anyway).

Wild’s arcane technique of self-erasure must be connected somehow or other with the novelist’s annihilating his mistress “in the act of portraying her”; the association of depiction with destruction is common to both. But the writer can’t have destroyed her in the literal act of writing, since at one point we see the still-living Flora beginning to read a paperback copy of the novel in which Laura dies. “Let me show you your wonderful death,” says a friend who’s already finished the book. “You’ll scream with laughter. It’s the craziest death in the world.” So does the novel “destroy” Flora in some figurative sense? Perhaps reading it goads her cuckolded husband (who calls it a “maddening masterpiece”) into using his mental eraser on her? We assume that the original of Laura has to die some “crazy” death or other, as her fictive double does, but their creator beat them both to the finish line.“And here’s a puzzle for hard-core Nabokov obsessives. From a free­standing paragraph headed “End of penult chapter,” we infer that after Wild dies of a heart attack, the novelist-lover gets hold of his “testament” — they seem to have the same typist — and arranges for its publication, though we don’t know how, where or why. Are we to suspect that the lover has invented Wild’s mystic manuscript? And even Wild himself? (Readers of “Pale Fire” still argue over whether Shade invented Kinbote or vice versa.) Yet the lover has already made Wild a character in the “Laura” novel, under the transparent name of “Philidor Sauvage.” Would even a trickster like Nabokov invent a character who invents a character and then invents a pseudonym for him? Nabokovians are welcome to take it from here, as long as I don’t have to go with them. And while they’re at it, who’s the oddly named Ivan Vaughan, who seems to know Flora and who appears in one uncompleted chapter to tell us that “the novel My ‘Laura’ ” was “torn apart by a book er in a leading newspaper”?”This kind of puzzle — which I am not interested in solving — bears on the hope, also noted by most ers, that the book might give us a glimpse into Nabokov’s writing method. It does, but not in a way I have seen any er mention: it shows that at least in this case, he wrote around or between the cruxes of the plot. They would have been clear to him; the flesh between those bones would have been what took line-by-line inventing. It is possible there may be novelists for whom this is helpful.PreciousnessI read this because the book is an example of preciousness, which is something that happens when the visual appearance of pages--an writer's typescripts, experiments in typography and design, letters reproduced in color--begin to be more interesting than the content of the writing. There's an edition of small drawings by Walter Benjamin that is precious in this sense: Benjamin didn't draw much, and the book lavishes high-resolution color photography on the small fragments. Another is the recent edition of Emily Dickinson's poems on envelopes, reproduced natural size and in color, and provided with keys on the opposing pages. Robert Walser's microscripts have also been reproduced this way, natural size, in color on coated stock. In this case it's 3 x 5 cards, and they are reproduced in color, front and back, even when the backs have nothing but an X on them. The result could be called ""fetishized,"" but I do not think that word illiminates much. ""Precious"" is better: it implies the cards are valuable, like old postage stamps or diminutive works of art, and it suggests there is a relation between the visual qualities of the cards, Nabokov's handwriting, and the interest of his words and ideas... but there isn't. Preciousness, here, is the spurious imposition of visual significance on literary meaning.(Preciousness is a problem in a number of novels and poems that have images in them, so I am studying it as part of my ""writing with images"" project. More on this on writingwithimages.com/2-texts-as-images.)PS: an astonishing imageAnd last thing: the central visual image in these fragments is the mental exercise of drawing yourself in your imagination on the inner surfaces of your closed eyelids, and then erasing yourself: an imagined—and then real—act of deliberate self-destruction.

This novel, the work of over 25 years, is one of the first and still one of the most complex anti-novels ever written. I am delighted to have discovered it only 60 years late. (It was written between 1925 and 1952.)I have found that in reading and re-reading The Museum of Eterna’s Novel (The First Good Novel) (and re-reading is the only way to read: the novel itself theorizes its possible readings extensively, inventively, repetitively, exhaustively) I find my thoughts divide into two currents. First is the mechanics and proposals of the anti-novel; then there is the psychology, the mood, or the affect that emerges from so many layers of anti-realism. The former develops mostly in the first half of the book, which is comprised of fifty prologues to the novel. The latter emerges mainly in the second half, which is the novel, and is titled “Were Those Prologues? And Is This The Novel?.”1. The mechanics of the anti-novel. In terms of the ways it articulates its relation to reality and fiction, this book is more sophisticated than many that have followed it. It ends many times (there is a chapter that declares “a minute more, or a minute less” remains of the novel), and it talks continuously about itself (there are prologues that meditate on the blank pages that publishers still print before and after the text). It describes all possible sorts of readers: the one who reads straight through; the one who helps write the book itself; and the “skiparound” reader, who is both essential and wrong. (p. 119) The very idea of narrative, of plot, is theorized as a matter of memory. If something “big and new” doesn’t happen, he says, after a character “dies” (in quotation marks because characters don’t die, but move from one fiction to another), then we will always see her as she was, because “without new things happening there’s no forgetting, because there’s no Time—which is nothing—outside of events, which weaken our images of the past.” Such a thing would be “a formula for unforgetfulness.” (p. 117)There are moments when all this is fairly programmatic, and Fernández seems to be writing a fragmentary manifesto of literary modernism (“the first good novel”). “For my pages,” he says, “I want constant fantasy” in order to “avoid the hallucination of reality, which is a blemish on the face of art.” (p. 36) One of his characters, the Traveler, “functions exclusively as the extinguisher of the hallucination that menaces the story with realism.” The only “frustration or abortion of a character” in the novel is that he appears to live. (p. 35) At his least interesting, Fernández is doctrinaire in his anti-realism. “There is a reader with whom I cannot reconcile myself,” he says in a prologue “about the doctrine of art”: “the reader who wants what all novelists have coveted, to their shame: Hallucination.” (p. 32) Most of the time, Fernández’s paradoxes of realism and anti-realism are inventive and labyrinthine enough to keep me fairly amused. But none of this is what kept me reading and re-reading The Museum of Eterna’s Novel.2. The mood, the feeling of the novel. What ends up mattering is the emerging sense of the implied author and the moods that seem to have impelled him. At first it appears the dominating aesthetics of the book may be early twentieth-century idealism and aestheticism. At the end of the book, the President speaks of “Ugliness’s long reign” in Buenos Aires, and how he wanted to “abolish civil ugliness.” (p. 236) It’s true the book bears the stamp of its time, and even—as the translator reports—uses archaic language in places. But there's more to it than that. Throughout the book characters speak of their distances from one another, and the story turns on people coming together in a frail and unrepeatable gathering, and going apart again in separate journeys. The President invites each of them “to choose a path that would take them farthest from the others, so as to assure, at least, that no one had to experience in another that other farewell, death.” (p. 231) I think it is central to Fernández’s imagination that the sight of death, and ultimately anything at all like it, has to be kept away. Here the President is a novelist, imagining a world in which characters can be moved around in such a way that they suffer and die alone, offstage, as far away in their own worlds as possible. There is an amazing short essay on suicide, about a character named Suicide: it begins in such an abstract way that Fernández apologizes and starts again. It must have been a difficult couple of pages for him to write, because it tries so hard to think away the experience. (p. 171)And why does Fernández want to be a character? Partly because he feels that if he has not experienced love, or when he does not experience love, his only hope of happiness is to be fictional. (p. 229) Being a character is not just a way of juggling the real and the imaginary, or playing with novelistic conventions. It is a way of existing as a trace, in a trance. “She is… exquisite,” he writes, “no one can tell the difference between seeing her and thinking of her.” (p. 143) A character can “feel nothing,” but be read. A reader is “moved” by such a character. (p. 130) For the character, such an existence is “enviable”: it is like living at a distance from yourself and from life. (p. 141) Ultimately the point of the anti-novelistic experiments in this book is to live without pain. Fernández says “each person” in the estancia was “moved by this double impression: ‘I entered La Novela, and I entered the novel.’” (p. 136) That is not a definition of the modern novel: that's the mirroring that he hopes will save him. The Museum of Eterna’s Novel (The First Good Novel) is, in the end, not a piece of experimental fiction as much as a concerted dream of a life without pain: Fernández was neurasthenic and exquisitely afraid of suffering, and he slowly dreamed his this book as an Eden, a museum, and in a perverse and impossible way, also a novel. The affect is strong, but in retrospect, thinking back on my re-re-reading, the anti-realist, metafictional apparatus that supports it is distracting because it then appears as insufficiently metabolized unhappiness....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,not set,not set,"Dec 21, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6554891-the-museum-of-eterna-s-novel

So my comments here have to do with thatI picked this up because it is illustrated, and I'm trying to read all contemporary fiction that uses images. So my comments here have to do with that; I have something to say about the prose at the end.In a book of fiction (well, experimental writing that combines journalism with bits of the novel, the memoir, and the travel account) the first image is always an unexpected guest. Here the first chapter opens with a description of a ""dew pond"" (not sure what that is, but never mind):""A single cramped ash was reflected in the gunmetal disc of water, a disc that was ringed with pocked earth and cupped in a fold of cropped turf.""Seven pages later comes the first image in the book, which is unmistakably that ""dew pond."" So it's reasonable to assume that a reasonably interested reader will turn back seven pages to compare the description: and it fits. A next question might then be: why is the image on page 10, given that in the intervening pages the narrator has been remembering other times and places? The book opens with Self's friend, an artist supposedly called Sherman Oaks (modeled, I think, on a combination of Anthony Gormley and Corban Walker), ranting at the edge of the ""dew pond."" In the next few pages, before the first image appears, Self recalls other meetings with Oaks. The line on the bottom of page 9, just before the image, is:""Then, in the late 1980s, there began the inexorable rise of Sherman Oaks, the artist.""Turning the page, we're brought back to the ""dew pond"" and the book's opening: but the prose seems not to notice, because it continues with memories of Oaks.I do not propose this as a criticism: I mean that this is the kind of calibration that has to accompany any reading that is attentive to images. The detail with which the author describes the image and its placement in the text are the rules of a game of word and image that a reader might expect will continue through the book. But the next two images, the book's second and third, work entirely differently. They are on p. 24 (that is, a long way into the narrative), and they are snapshots of sheep and of a street stall offering handbags. Neither one connects securely to the prose in which they float. I can connect them -- I can guess -- but clearly these images are being used differently, with less care, as generic markers of places Self has been. And so it continues. The photos in this book are almost all indifferent, uninteresting, uncomposed, and that's fine: it's clearly intentional. But it becomes clear that Self's interest in linking his images to his text is uneven, intermittent, uncommitted, disengaged. Sometimes the images are referred to in the text, but even then the references in the text rarely make me look at the image for more than a millisecond (as I did with the opening photograph). Self explains his Barbour jacket at length, making it an emblem of his OCD and his travel anxieties (p. 34): but when we see it, it's just been thrown into a corner of a toilet stall, and none of the details he describes are visible. That photograph (p. 37) is actually a good exemplar of his idea of images: the photo also features his bare knee, because, as the text informs us, he's sitting on the toilet. That's actually an interesting thing to be showing readers, but again nothing is made of it.I think the book is non-visual, because it just isn't engaged, one way or the other, with its images. I can only imagine snapshots are mnemonics for Self, but why does he think readers don't need to be informed about how he thinks about images? Is an image such an intractable thing that its uses can't be addressed? Or such a non-verbal thing that it doesn't need to be integrated into a narrative? Or such a self-explanatory thing that it doesn't need explanation? Or such an uninteresting thing that it can't be dissected?And why doesn't it matter that the low-grade loneliness of the images contrasts incomprehensibly with the effervescent and fiercely social autobiography?--A small note about the text. I couldn't finish this book. Self's style, to me, is a kind of incessant struggle for quirky cleverness. Every sentence is tweaked and twisted so it uses English in a slightly striking way. For what kind of reader is this entertaining? I suppose for a reader who needs a continuous series of faint jolts of interest to remain engaged. For me, it's a kind of hypertrophy of the English newspaper habit that requires every headline, even on serious events, to be some sort of clever pun. That's always driven me batty. What does it accomplish? It isn't a satire of world events: it's just an unending registering of the journalist's snide wit, which sprays itself over everything from gossip reporting to war. On p. 44 Self proposes a succinct self-criticism (as a ""micro-critic""): it's an affecting moment. He has all sorts of interesting qualities, but the volume of wit is turned up too high for me....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Dec 01, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7307214-walking-to-hollywood

The book was done in collaboration with three ""stitchers,"" who sewed the sometimes very elaborate patterns that are reproduced throughout the book. The problem here is that the stitching only intermittently connects with the narrative. The key moment when a box with five latches is opened (p. 212 ff.) is illustrated with full-page, full-color photographs of stitched rectangles intended to illustrate the latches. But there is no connection between the zig-zag patterns on the latches and the scene evoked in the narrative. Why curvilinear decorations on the latches? The mismatch between the single lines of text--in which each child lifts a latch--and the labor expended on the sewing isn't itself explained or motivated. The sewing works best in the pages that illustrate the spooky storyteller's swords (p. 196 ff.), because the imaginary swords in the story are rendered as static pictures of swords: a nice contrast with the slicing horrors the storyteller is evoking. But most episodes are disconnected from their narratives. The ""Forest of Falling"" is illustrated by falling lines of punched-out holes, but they're randomly stitched in patterns that look more like confetti than leaves. And so forth. An MFA-level critique would have been helpful here, matching the form of the stitching to the images and shapes in the story.2. So imagine the book without the illustrations. The principal typographic innovation in this book is differently-colored quotation marks, that stand for different speakers. But it is apparently nearly from the first page that it is not possible to read every yellow quotation, for example, in sequence; and it is apparent from somewhere around page 20 that the five characters, introduced in the author's preface and coded by color, will not in fact be introduced or described in the book. And from that point on, a reader just reads straight through the colored quotation marks. Occasionally a slightly different point of view, or a briefly fragmented narrative, will recall the color coding, but it doesn't help read the book. This is in contrast to any number of modern and postmodern experiments with unnamed and unnumbered interlocutors, from ""Ulysses"" to Derrida's ""Truth in Painting,"" where it really is interesting to try to figure out who is speaking.3. Imagining the book without its colored quotation marks or its graphics, there's still the arrangement of words on the page. Occasionally that makes sense, for example when one of the characters is slicing herself up with an imaginary sword, and the words scatter to evoke her cuts. But for the most part, these are not inventive or expressive arrangements. I agree with the er in the ""New York Times"": sometimes the space around sentences just doesn't work to emphasize them; and in addition, there are almost no imaginative pictorial arrangements of words, despite a century of precedents, from Mallarmé to Apollinaire and Huidobro.4. So now imagine the book is just printed, in the usual way, with no special typography, no colors, and no graphical arrangement of text. There is one final obstacle between a reader and the narrative itself and that is Danielewski's penchant for inventing portmanteau words. I found this annoying and inept throughout. The modernist tradition of newly coined words, from ""Finnegans Wake"" through Matthiessen, Winterson, Burgess, and Bernstein, demands consistency: the author has to adopt a certain mode, a manner in relation to the voices she's imagining. What happens here is entirely different: Danielewski only occasionally invents word—one or two per page. As a result they are consistently distracting. Is it really a good idea to interrupt the climactic moment of the story, in which a woman is running to help another who is literally falling to pieces, by saying she was ""racing forward, direticating others""? ""Direticating"" seems to be a portmanteau combination of ""directing"" and ""dictating,"" with an echo of ""dire."" But all it does her is interrupt the narrative flow, bring the reader out of the scene, and compel her to solve a ridiculous little puzzle before continuing. There are many, many other examples—my copy is entirely marked up with them. Virtually none of them work with the narrative, the voice, the style, or any other component of the fiction: instead they forcibly compel a read to attend to Danielewski's show of skill. (Is that's what it is: I don't think portmanteau is especially difficult.)What is left? A good, brief ghost story, suitable for children—except that it isn't suitable for any kind of children except the ones whose parents insist that they become sophisticated and literary. People who praise Danielewski as a postmodernist (and there are over 500 s on the Goodreads site, most very positive, many mentioning Derrida and other postmodernists) are missing the book's preciousness, the fragility of Danielewski's writing skills, the superficial veneer of multiple dialogic voices, the mistaken belief that typographical finesse indicates deep engagement with postmodern narrative, the obliviousness to the meanings of the graphical interventions, and the overwhelming obviousness of the fact that Danielewski has an entirely conventional sense of narrative, which he obscures to himself by elaborations and multiplications. People who like this book must have an impoverished sense of the stakes of serious writing in the last thirty years.

I read the principal novella of the three, the one that occupies two-thirds of the book. It is an unappealing book: conservative and full of clichés. For me, the meliorating quality was the oddity of Ndiaye’s way of thinking.At first it appears that what matters to Ndiaye is the construction of elaborate long sentences that produce introspective surprises. Those sentences are often in single paragraphs, and even when she writes brief sentences she prefers them in individual paragraphs. (I haven’t checked the original French: I’m assuming that a translator wouldn’t make up such an obvious device.) As a result her thought—the inner monologue of the main character—stumbles along in single steps, as if each moment, each sentence, has to contain an insight, catharsis, or expressive image that needs to be savored, like an epigram, before the reader continues. At times the long sentences yield moments of unexpected or dense reflection that could compel a reader to stop a moment; but other times the sentences are not especially well-formed, expressive, or insightful:“That particularly striking quality of his, he recalled in the ensuing silence, a weakly panting silence that sounded as if he were phoning a far-off country with rudimentary communications, his words needing all these slow seconds to arrive, though it was only the echo of Fanta’s anxious breathing as she pondered the best way of answering his question so as to safeguard he knew not what—her dared not imagine—future interests she might have (a bubble of anger suddenly exploded in his head: what possible future could she envisage that didn’t include him?), yes, he recalled, as he let his eyes wander over the green vines with their tiny bright green grapes, over the green oaks beyond them that the property’s new owners, those Americans or Australians (who fascinated and upset Mummy because she believed the vineyard should have stayed in French hands), had pruned so savagely until the trees looked humiliated, punished for daring to let their shiny, unfading foliage grow so dense as to partially conceal the once grayish, now blond and fresh stonework of what was, after all, only a large house, though of the kind on which people of these parts bestowed the respectful name of ‘chateau,’ yes, that particularly striking impression that his own blondness, his own freshness, made over there…”[Ellipses end the paragraph in the original.]This rhythm of language, of thinking, in which a thought stands by itself and gives the thinker or reader a little shock of recognition, becomes monotonous—and not only when the longer thoughts (that is, the longer paragraphs) fail to yield any particular insight. Ndiaye thinks one step at a time, like an elderly person who takes one step, contemplates something, and then takes another step—or, because senility isn’t the issue here, like a stamp collector, who puts each treasured object in its proper place and goes on to the next, row after row. I find it oddly limiting, as if she is herself afraid of thinking in longer stanzas.All that is one reason I found this book tiring. The other is its relentlessly conventional, bourgeois mentality. The main character is tortured by his past: he has lied to himself and more or less ruined his life, and in the course of the novella he loses his job, probably his wife, and his last connection to his mother. As a reader, you’re meant to feel his embarrassment when his co-workers, his boss, and even his own child shun him. He is awkward and unreliable; he sweats and scratches himself; he can’t quite see through his own self-deceptions. At the time time, like characters from Flaubert and Zola onward, he loves middle-class life: his job, until he loses it, is designing overly expensive kitchens for upwardly-aspiring clients, and he admires other people’s kitchens. All these things—the striving, the embarrassment, the class aspirations, the ruined ineffectual self-interrogation—are stocks in trade of the bourgeois novel, just the kind of thing Barthes dissected, just the sort of thing that modern and postmodern writing have left behind.

I bought it in Reykjavik in an art book store. The author, Helene Sommer, is Norwegian. I have seen it on used.addall.com, and I assume it could be found through the Lithuanian publisher’s distributor, www.mottodistribution.com. It’s a lovely book, with a blue cloth cover and a red ribbon for reading.“I was there” is arranged in eighty chapters, each one titled with a word that is both a noun and a verb: “to reason/the reason,” “to attempt/the attempt,” “to rank/the rank.” Sommer calls the pairs “class-ambiguous words,” and she says she chose them to organize her project because they work on the mind in such a way that they are “dysfunctional as a classification tool.” It’s hard to know exactly what that claim means, but it is true that the meanings of the verb-and-noun pairs vary so widely that they effectively do very little classifying.In each chapter there are text excerpts and images, each one with a footnote. The texts and images are taken from “newspapers, books, magazines, TV, Internet, museums, rumors and encounters.” Some footnotes contain glosses and summaries; others are bare-bones references. Each one describes “dysfunctional and problematic systems whether in… history, science, memory, or information.”An example: a print of a flowering plant, a moth, and its caterpillar is reproduced without a caption. The note “2.17” (chapter 2, item 17) reads, in part:""Agnotology Means Culturally Induced IgnoranceFlos Pavonis—literally Peacock Flower—is a stunning nine-foot tall plant with brilliant yellow and red blossoms. The plant was a forceful abortifacient for Awarak and African slave women who refused to bear children into inhuman bondage. During a time of colonization, when the import and export of plants and botanical knowledge was worth gold, the Peacock Flower’s abortive properties escaped its captors. Instead its ornamental use in many a European garden was emphasized. In many places in the Caribbean they still use the plant as an abortifacient.• Schiebinger, Londa, Plant and Empire: Colonial Bioprospecting in the Atlantic World (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2007).""One word is underlined, ""places""; it's the reason this entry is in chapter 2, whose title is “to place/the place.”Sommer says she organized the book “according to an automatic classification system” based on the frequency, in the texts, of these “class-ambiguous words.” It isn’t possible to tell exactly what that means: the “class-ambiguous words” don’t seem more frequent in the beginning chapters than the closing chapters, and the opening chapters aren’t longer than the closing chapters. But never mind: the salient point is that the principal of organization is “automatic,” so it is not necessary to search for meaning in the sequences. Sommer’s book tells stories of dysfunction, classified in a dysfunctional manner.I think she expects ""I was there"" to be read as a kind of Arcades Project, crippled by its own imposed dysfunctional classification system. In terms of affect it could be a disassembled set of notes for a Sebald novel. The texts she chooses have a uniform flavor of failure, sometimes surrealist, sometimes dystopian, sometimes Benjaminian. But I am more interested in the experience of reading the book, and how it feels to negotiate close attention and boredom, or to distinguish the meaningful from the random. What interests me is the effect of the book’s formal structure on my reading, aside from questions of content.When I began reading, I was surprised to encounter entries that repeated earlier ones. At first I compared the two, in order to be sure they hadn’t varied. In fact the texts never vary from one repetition to the next, but the images do, with the result that sometimes the images don’t illustrate the texts. Belatedly, I noticed that the table of contents lists the repetitions of each entry: ""Nature’s OccupantsPg 25, 102, 161, 177""After I saw that, I mostly didn’t read entries I had seen before. As in many artist’s books, it isn't necessary to read this book from front to back, but I think that is the only way to experience the many classificatory and indexical principles Sommer has brought to bear. At first, when I came across entries I’d read before, I remembered them without re-reading. Later in the book, I found I couldn’t keep them all in mind: they'd look familiar, but I’d have to refresh my memory. I didn’t always do that, because it became unrewarding: I’d be reminded of the particular failure or dysfunction, but its meaning would be unaltered by its appearance in a new chapter.As I went along, more and more entries were repeats, so I turned the pages more quickly. At the same time, the effect of the returning stories of catastrophes, useless experiments, failed and absurd science, and anachronistic racism started to produce a jarring effect, like the experience of watching a news channel on television long enough so that the news cycle repeats, and you’re seeing the same stories in slightly different orders. As in news cycles, the reordering and recontextualization did not produce new meaning, despite the fact that the “class-ambiguous words” were different with each new appearance of a given entry. (There are exceptions, such as 26.2 and 26.3.)And then, on page 116, I entered a kind of free fall: on that page every entry is a repetition, and when I turned the page the entries were also repeats. I turned more and more quickly, and finally, on page 153, a new entry appeared. From that point to the end of the book there aren’t more than a half-dozen new entries, so the entire second half of the book can be read in ten minutes. Like the news-cycle effect, that change in speed is an unusual phenomenon in reading, and both effects were captivating. The sequence of chapters ends abruptly, and it is followed by several pages of densely printed words that were not used to organize chapters. That's a gesture toward a much larger book, which would have the same dynamics as this one—in other words, instead of promising a greater richness, it promises a longer duration, more work for the same result—which is an unusual promise.All these features of reading were fascinating. I loved the ongoing meaninglessness of the juxtapositions of the entries. Only very seldom did the transition from one entry to the next carry any significance. And most amazing: meaning itself became unfamiliar and even distasteful....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,Nov 2012,"Nov 03, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/16125526-i-was-there

There are also long s online, for example at piercepenniless.wordpress.com. I don't have anything to add to the ers' comments about the text. I agree it is problematic to have Antigone say things like ""BINGO,"" despite Carson's clear intention to speak to a contemporary reader. And problematic to have the characters in Sophocles's play cite Hegel, Beckett, and Virginia Wolff, despite Carson's claim that the idea was to show that ""Antigone"" has a history of reception that now includes those writers. (She makes that claim in a taciturn, reluctant interview at suicidegirls.com.) There are, as George Steiner points out, some wonderful passages in the translation--more than enough to help readers overlook the quirks that apparently enabled them.What concerns me, as usual, are the illustrations. They ruin the book: for me, they make it nearly unreadable. Many ers like them. They are technically poor (at the level of a BFA student), stylistically outdated (they're an amalgam of 1970s cartoon surrealism a la Zevi Blum, with strands of Pop Surrealism and 1950s style realism as in Ben Shahn), poorly conceived (in one picture, for example, some people have temple forms for heads, which also look like cement blocks; but others don't, and there is also a book, a cup of coffee, a shovel, and a clay making tool, with neither internal logic nor surrealist disjunction to support the choices), and they are inconsistently related to the text (one picture shows a sink with dripping faucets, and a figure lying in the background, an arrangement that might have a connection to the narrative; but the next picture is just a stove, and it comes right after one of the strongest, most tragic lines in the translation). It's sad that the pictures, by Bianca Stone, don't try to either work with the text, or against it; it's sad Stone seems to think that this kind of freedom is both expressive and appropriate; it's sad that Carson chose this artist for the project: but worst of all is that ers, with almost no exceptions that I could find, think the images are interesting, good, and even profound. For me, that points to a visual illiteracy that is wildly at odds with the ers' sometimes acute observations about Sophocles, tragedy, translation, theater, Brecht, and Hegel.Some ers let Stone off the hook by generalizing about what the images do. The pictures are ""full of a sense of opposing, irreconcilable forces"" according to one er. (practicallymarzipan.com) But surely girls in miniskirts, with temples for heads, are not simply ""opposing, irreconcilable forces"": they are particular choices, and they're jarring in themselves, aside from their content.I only found three ers who paid attention to the images. One, on www.full-stop.net, says the illustrations ""lack the depth, in both subject and style, to dovetail with Carson's translation... Carson's work is so erudite, and Stone's so elliptical, that the composite effect is frustratingly opaque."" This really can only be half true, because if it appeared that Carson and Stone both intended that effect, it could have worked: the pictures could have been intentionally shallow, dissonant with the text, and hard to read... but none of that seems planned at all. Instead the collaboration is a typical effect of the latitude that is given to visual artists in some contexts: the artist is allowed to do whatever she wants, because art is thought to work on the register of visuality, of the non-verbal. It's as if visual art is exempt from rational critique because it does not use language.Steiner notes that the images ""at best... imply a spectral domesticity or haunted landscape."" That could also be true, if the illustrations were done in such a way that viewers knew those two themes were intended. But Stone's fantasies of horses, people with shovels, tables and stoves, shacks with crows, desert landscapes with small figures, schematic birds, ladders and stairwells, are the stock in trade of undergraduate art students. There is nothing to suggest she was thinking of Antigone's missing domesticity. I have seen enough student drawings of things like horse's legs entangled with threads and punctured by nails (as in one picture) to know that those images stem from from the artist's previous studio experiments, not from ""Antigone.""Of the s I've seen, Butler's tries hardest to give an account of the pictures. She mentions one, an interior with a chair and dresser looking out on a smeared landscape. It seems, she says, that ""some living character had departed the scene not long ago."" (www.publicbooks.org/fiction/cant-stop...) But she knows that ""spectral domesticity"" isn't a satisfying reading, and in any case it wouldn't be supported by the other pictures. So she makes a more abstract proposal:""It would probably be less right to say that this image interrupts the text as the unconscious does, or that it is the unconscious in some symbolic sense. Rather, as the scene switches between the textual and the graphic, a temporal shift takes place between the past and the present: something is gone, and something is caught, and vibrates still. The image is the nick of time."" (She later says ""the nick is the time of the line itself, the scan of poetic meter,"" leaving the images aside.)This passage is good, but it still isn't an interpretation of the individual image: it's a reading of any image (especially one with an empty room, but any image could be construed the same way). So it isn't an account of Stone's choices, Carson's collaboration, or the particular images and specific words in the text.It is an unhappy reflection on some contemporary literary culture, and on how the art world presents itself, that a translation as radical and eloquent as Carson's can be marred by such an irresponsibly chosen, poorly executed, effectively random series of pictures, and almost no one notices....more",Notes are private!,0,35,1,not set,"Oct 27, 2012","Oct 27, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/13305951-antigonick

The prose pieces, usually one or two pages long, have titles reminiscent of Calvino or Jabès: ""The Book of Forgotten Bodies,"" ""The Book of Broken Bodies,"" ""The Book of Echoes."" It isn't clear why the two alternate, because the poems and the prose share a voice that is alternately disaffected, violent, academic, existential, disconsolate, ironic, surreal, activist, and conceptual. It's the strange alternation of voices--mirrored by the alternation of prose and poetry--that makes the book interesting. At times Borzutsky writes language poetry or conceptual poetry, as in Charles Bernstein:""This poem is firm in its convictions and compassionate at the same time.This people-poem, not a political poem.This poem is committed to public service.This poem is simple, unobtrusive, and easy to use or ignore as the reader sees fit."" (p. 20)Passages like this are unconvincingly self-deprecating and openly academic in a way that is apparently meant to be simply honest, but sometimes appears trapped. Earlier in the same poem there are passages that are more surrealist, like mixtures of Burroughs and Neruda:""Poets shit on this poem.Babies and graduate students eat this poem.There are bivalved mollusks in this poem, and hemorrhoids, and a dog named Chucho, and coyotes who kidnap immigrants."" (p. 19)Here I take it the excesses (as in the first line) are intended to be faux-shocking, a reminder of earlier kinds of poetry in which people had real convictions and could actually be shocking; and the surrealism (as in the third line) is meant to be ersatz surrealism, filtered through academic writing workshops. But the voices in the book seem not to be entirely under the author's control. In some poems his voice is consistently arch, media-savvy, and ironic, occasionally like George Saunders in its impeccable unaccountability. But the voice veers, and becomes ecstatic (p. 67), campy (p. 72), activist (p. 80), like early Merwin (p. 5), like Bernstein (p. 28).Here is the end of ""The Relevance of Poetry in Our Current Climate"":""...This poem is not capable of deception or transcendence. Additionally, this poem is perfect for the occasion of being strapped against your will to a fence or gurney, electrocuted, or for having your face shoved in excrement. This is a contemporary poem. This poem allows you to be young, and to shake and move with the times."" (p. 62)The last line is careless, knowing, and disaffected, like Frank O'Hara. But the line before it speaks with the voice of the military. The awkward ""additionally,"" and the formal ""excrement"" sound like military documents about interrogation. And the first line I quoted is an entirely straightforward bit of theory: there, oddly, the voice is most transparent.It is the veering voice that provides the book's real passion and conviction. Within any individual voice, it can seem unconvincing or unstable. It's a conundrum for a writer: normally over time, the strands of the voice come together, and the writing becomes more coherent. But here that may not be a good idea. The battling voices in Borzutsky's head are more interesting, I think, than the battles he describes from within individual voices....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Oct 22, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10396305-book-of-interfering-bodies

The problem with this book is a problem it shares with many others: it just isn't ambitious enough. It's about a psychoanalyst and a philosopher, both women, who go into the Centre to look at the papers of a self-styled philosopher who had lived on a sheep ranch. The theme has potential as a dialogue among women friends (this is the best-developed part), as a meditation on nation and landscape, as a philosophic contrast between psychoanalysis and literature, and as a novel of letters. It just doesn't do very much with any of those themes. When the dead philosopher's papers are finally sampled at the end of the book, they reveal Bail's idea of philosophy -- at least in this instance -- as a mixture of Wittgenstein, popular psychobiography, and undigested Nietzsche. I wouldn't trust Bail to write about philosophy, or the idea of philosophy, and I have no evidence he knows anything about psychotherapy. The book is strong when it's about imagining the inner lives of the two women, but there is no much more that could have been done here. The moral, for me, is this: if you're going to write a novel of ideas, put in the ideas. If the novel has big ideas in it -- here, the entire history of Western philosophy -- then the prose should work to include those ideas in their full difficulty. The aspiring philosopher in the novel who has died has left sheets of aphorisms hanging on a clothesline. What if those had been real aphorisms? What if they had been Ludwig Hohl's sheets?

That's my experience reading ""The Man Who Would Be King."" Kipling is an author who does not need to be read to be experienced, because every mannerism, every narrative move, each racist and colonialist clich�, is already lodged in our culture. I'd seen the movie, which is a John Huston epic, and I had thought the book must be long: but on my e-reader it's only 80 pages, and Kipling only needs one-third of that to tell his story. The speed of his narrative might be an indication that even for him, the subjects and interests of the story were so familiar they only needed to be telegraphed.[return][return]Reading is an empty experience: how can any of the reality effects work?

Every once in a while, a character says something colorful, and I make a mental note to remember it, but it's so trivial, so uninteresting, that I immediately forget it: I had only noticed it because everything around it was so blank, so free of interest. Kipling has died a cultural death: the work is empty, and there isn't even any reason left to mourn for it.[return][return]But then again, this must be the experience of millions of readers who consume murder mysteries, romances, and any other formula fiction.

I would have to do some serious reconsidering of my own capacity to reflect on what I read. There can't be a thrill here, if everything that presents the thrill is such a frail clich�.

A piece on kitsch later in the book is trivial -- it makes fun of itself -- and its insights are not anywhere near as interesting as those of Hermann Broch or Walter Benjamin on the same subject. The translator tells us that Musil considered the longest piece in the collection, ""Blackbird,"" an example of ""daylight mysticism"" (taghelle Mystik), but it isn't that far from von Hofmannsthal or some of Poe, reined in by a twentieth-century sense of the real. From a philosophic standpoint, the most substantial piece in the book is ""Art Anniversary,"" a meditation on the way that art, when it is re-encountered after a period of absence, can fail to move us. But even there, ""great art"" is excepted -- in a brief aside, apparently cleverly but actually carelessly tacked onto the end of the essay.For me the only interesting piece is ""A Man Without Character,"" which the translator says, complicatedly, is ""from the seed out of which the novel erupted like a magic beanstalk."" (I don't see why it isn't the seed itself -- is there another text that is the actual beginning of the novel?) At any rate, there's an interesting equivocation in ""A Man Without Character"" between the use of ""character"" to denote moral strength and manliness, and ""character"" to denote ""qualities.""

The latter is the more interesting usage, because it prefigures (or echoes?) the novel ""A Man Without Qualities.""

The author, Andrzej Stasiuk, How Uncontrolled Metaphors Can Amount to Bad WritingCouldn't finish this, despite several weeks of intermittent efforts. The author, Andrzej Stasiuk, is attempting to write photographic images of the town Dukla as the narrator experiences and remembers it in 1996. The book, its narrator says, is about light and time. It isn't driven by plot, and the episodes don't accumulate into a coherent memory of the past.Fair enough, and exactly on some of my own interests. The problem is that, in this translation at least, Stasiuk isn't a good writer. The problems begin immediately. The book opens with this line:""At four in the morning the night slowly raises its dark backside as if it were getting up from a heavy dinner and going to bed.""Is ""backside"" ""back,"" in North American usage, or is it ""bum,"" in UK usage? Either way, it's an odd word and an indigestible image. It's faintly Rabelaisian, slightly awkward, a bit absurd, somewhat comic, and somewhat rude. A reader like Nabokov or Empson might point out it's also illogical: at that hour the night shouldn't be either rising (that would be morning) or going to bed (that happened hours before).As a reader I don't mind being challenged in this way, provided the author intends me to be thrown off by such an odd opening image. The proof that it's intentional should come in the next few pages, where I'd expect echoes of the humor, the Rabelaisian body imagery, or some such ironic misuse of the sublime.But the very next line belongs to an entirely different mode, a kind of photographic lyric:""The air's like cold ink, it flows along the road surfaces, spills to each side and congeals into black lakes.""This is lyric realism, worlds away from ""backsides,"" but we're not given a way to understand the bridge between the two. The opening pages and chapters repeat this sort of problem. On p. 6 there's this mixed image:""The sky is bursting with the glow, but it remains trapped inside itself like air in a child's balloon.""That's not something I can visualize: it punctures the serious sublime with a playful metaphor, and yet the context isn't playful, it's plangent and lyrical. One more example, among hundreds:""The hills, houses, water, clouds all had the distinctness of a supernatural photograph."" (p. 9)This is again photographic imagery, and it's easy to imagine. But then the next sentence is:""In a landscape like that, thoughts sound like mechanical music.""That doesn't fit with the sentence before, but it also doesn't make a comprehensible contrast. And it isn't a metaphor I can understand. Then the next sentence:""You can watch them, listen to them, but their meaning is always ominous, like echoes in a well.""Is mechanical music like echoes in a well? Are thoughts in ""supernatural"" landscapes like either?I won't go on, even though my copy is marked up until p. 105, when I gave up. I can understand Stasiuk's intentions, and the affect is sometimes very strong. He wants to recapture intense feelings he's had looking at deserted landscapes and thinking of his childhood. Mainly he's preoccupied with visual memories of a kind of oppressive absence which is nevertheless a plenary presence. I understand that, and I can feel its effect on his images: it presses his metaphors into some strange shapes. Sometimes he tries hard, repeatedly, to capture that mood, and the result, as Damian Kelleher writes, can be ""tiresome.""

The back cover copy compareA Collision Between Metafiction and Empathy An extremely inventive experimental novel, with a distinctive authorial voice. The back cover copy compares ""Barley Patch"" to Calvino and Perec: the first is wrong, the second misleading. It's a book about the author's decision -- which is rescinded and contradicted many times in the book -- to stop writing fiction. Its salient features are Murnane's strangely disaffected and self-aware voice, and his insistently overly accurate forms of description; in that last trait, I think, he is closer to Stein than Perec.The book takes the form of narratives interrupted by italicized questions, asked by an imaginary reader, but in first person. In the following passage, the author is explaining why he thinks he does not have the kind of imagination necessary to write fiction (which he clearly has), and why that capacity would not, in any case, interest him:""[In italics, asked by a reader:] Surely I have paused at least once during a lifetime of reading and have admired the passage in front of me as a product of the writer's excellent imagination.""[In roman:] I can recall clearly my having paused often during my first reading of the book of fiction 'Wuthering Heights,' which reading took place in the autumn of 1956. I can recall equally clearly my having paused often during my reading of the book of fiction 'Tess of the D'Urbervilles,' which reading took place in the winter of 1959. I doubt that I paused in order to feel gratitude or admiration towards any authorial personage."" (p. 95)""Barley Patch"" is at is best when Murnane is moving patiently among the apparently badly remembered episodes of his childhood (""apparently"" because in fact he has manuscripts tens of thousands of pages long on his memories), which was mainly spent reading, and trying to re-allocate them as putatively fictional elaborations that would, supposedly, have been parts of the fiction project that he decided not to write, but which is, manifestly, the book ""Barley Patch."" The narrative slows in the middle section, in which he just goes ahead and tells the only story he thinks would have been worth making into a fiction, the story of how his parents met. First that story is told in a carefully distanced third person, but then it becomes first person, and toward the end there are rote mentions of the fictional frame:""I would have reported in my abandoned work of fiction that the chief character, while he watched the rain..."" (p. 221)The book's strength is in its strangeness, and its strangeness is dependent on how carefully Murnane restricts the fiction of not writing fiction, and not writing autobiography, by confining fiction, writing, memory, and autobiography in elaborate stockades of conditionals and the past subjunctive mood. Later in the book, those devices become simpler. (For example, pp. 162-3.) (This slipping back from hypotheticals about unwritten fictions, to examples of those unwritten fictions, to the writing of the fictions themselves, also happens in ""A Million Windows."")At the beginning Murnane reports how, as a child, he experienced books by inserting himself into their fictional worlds, not as one of the represented characters, but as someone the author hadn't invented. That curious idea returns in a strange, almost mystical fashion at the end, when he speculates that characters in fictions might have even more complex lives beyond the fictions of which they are a part:""During all the years while I had been a writer of fiction and while I had sometimes struggled to write fiction -- during all those years, I had wanted to learn what places appeared in the mind of one or another fictional character whenever he or she stared past the furthest place mentioned in the text that had seemed to give rise to him or her... Now, I was free to suppose what I had often suspected: many a so-called fictional character was not a native of some or another fictional text but of a further region never yet written about."" (pp. 246-7)For me the interest and the drawback of Murnane is condensed in this passage: it's interesting because it echoes Stein's compulsive grammars, but disappointing because the theme (imagined lives of fictional characters) is not the theme he'd started with (imagined lives of invented characters supposedly living among fictional characters). The former is more interesting than the latter, and the fact that the book starts with one and ends with the other is a sign that Murnane hasn't purified his project. ""Barley Patch"" is really about obsessive, compulsive distancing, categorizing, re-naming, and re-imagining.To be exact, there are three founding fantasies: that fictional characters in fictions may lead lives beyond the fictions of which they are a part; that imaginary characters may also be objects of attention in the context of fictions that don't include them; and that it might be possible to wander in the spaces implied by a novel, even if they are not described. (This last comes from a meditation on a reproduction of Claude Lorrain's ""Landscape with Samuel Anointing David,"" which has an enticing uninhabited distant landscape.) These fantasies congeal, I think, into a single desire to disappear multiply, repeatedly, beyond rescue: not only out of ""the place that I called the world,"" as he says, and not only into fiction, but through or beyond fiction to places only partly represented, or not represented at all.The desire is inseparable from Murnane's sense of writing: he repeats and elaborates it in ""A Million Windows,"" 2016. (The book got a very unsympathetic  in the New York Times, June 19, 2016, which misses much of Murnane's point.) As the desire works itself into books, it produces an idiosyncratic theory of metafiction in which the usual acknowledgment of the artificiality of writing is mingled with a stubborn insistence that immersion happens best, or only, in imaginary figures within imagined fictions. I think Murnane isn't in control of this fantasy, which is a desire for full empathetic imagination and real immersive picturing, undercut by a disillusion about desire and a need to exhibit its failure. Just as deeply as he seeks immersion, he believes that it has to be constrained--in this book, immersion is located only certain rare species of invented creatures, and yet he cannot decide which sorts of creatures, because that would mean giving up the multiplying metafictional frames that protect him from those very creatures.""Barley Patch"" is not the book it appears to be. For a er like David Winters, it calls attention ""to the way the content of a work exceeds whatever words are read or written."" (""The Far Side of Fiction,"" in the book ""Infinite Fictions: Essays on Literature and Theory,"" 2015, p. 113.) It's true that ""Barley Patch"" is a disquisition on the openness of fiction: but that is its argument, not its expressive value. What matters here is how all that goes wrong, repeatedly, because Murnane is not, even as he writes, in control of his desire, which is at once to disappear into the work and to turn the sad impossibility of that disappearance into art....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,"Sep 19, 2016","Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10879308-barley-patch

What follows is a negative account of vol. 1, which I read when it was first out in English; now ""My Struggle"" is famous, and subsequent volumes have attracted some reflective s. Thoughts on those at the end. At the moment, there are three postscripts: I intend to add two more, about Fred Jameson's  and Toril Moi's essay. What is in need of explanation at this point (that is, after every other reader on the planet has tried ""My Struggle"") is the remarkably broad spectrum of indecision about his work: the fascination coupled with the disagreements about what ""My Struggle"" is. (This note added October 2019.)- -Notes on vol. 1, written c. 2013 (the original was published in 2009)It’s possible this book may be memorable. It has structural, narrative, and tonal problems that may, in the end, turn out to be strengths. I have no idea why ers say it seems “like real life,” or why “the public have fallen to their knees in awe,"" but I do have some thoughts on its addictive and puzzling qualities. For me, the compulsion of the reading experience turned on two qualities: perplexity about what Knausgaard imagined he was creating, and the strangeness of the incommensurability between what he apparently imagined, and what he created.In another context, Knausgaard's endless inventories of uninteresting incidents could have been an emulation of one of Perec’s experiments in description, but Knausgaard has nothing to do with Oulipean ideas. Or they could have been demonstrations of the triviality of ordinary life, but Knausgaard is only a tiny bit like Kavanaugh and not at all like Larkin. Or they could have been intended to find the sublime or the poignant in the everyday, but that would not account for their length or lack of structure. It becomes perplexing to decide just what the book is attempting, short of a total inventory of the author’s life, which the narrator knows is impossible. And that preplexity, for me, is one of the qualities that accounts for the book's hypnotic attraction for many readers. There is a kind of dogged deliberation in “My Struggle,” as if the only way to continue is to write, and the only way to write is to write everything: but at the same time Knausgaard doesn’t record systematically; “My Struggle” isn’t rule-bound or fanatical. It’s as if he has put all the energy and concentration he has into this project, writing year after year, writing out each memory in detail, omitting nothing, inventorying his entire remaining memory, but without any sense of what a complete life might look like, or any hope of stitching the parts together.This sort of unsystematic, intermittently oblivious, partly uncaring attitude toward the obsessive compulsive project of plumbing his past produces strange effects. At first, a reader might expect that each episode will have some connection to others, or some special meaning or resonance -- as things usually do in novels. When that turns out not to be the case, a reader might reasonably conclude that the author is just writing as best as he can, about whatever he can remember, hoping the weight and inertia of the project will create, if not literature, then a sort of perplexity. He sometimes interrupts his narratives with meditations, which he apparently thinks are original or interesting; for me they usually aren’t. Only a few of the stories in Part One are interesting or unusual. Here is an example of the sort of meditation that is apparently presented as insightful:“I recognized the feeling, it was akin to the one some works of art evoke in me. Rembrandt’s portrait of himself as an old man in London’s National Gallery was such a picture, Turner’s picture of the sunset over the sea off a port of antiquity in the same museum, Caravaggio’s picture of Christ in Gethsemane. Vermeer evoked the same, a few of Claude’s paintings, some of Ruisdael’s...” (the list continues; p. 219)Knausgaard did not have an unusual childhood, and he does not describe it in an inventive way. But there is a strange contradiction between the narrative he wants us to read and the one that emerges as I began to attend to what was going wrong with what I took to be his project of writing a raw, honest memoir.An example of the strangeness: he spends 200 pages describing his childhood, but he opens Part Two with remarks like this:“If I had forgotten something in my childhood it was probably due to repression” (given as a throwaway line, and never developed; p. 216)or“I remembered hardly anything from my childhood.” (p. 189)Weirdly, he doesn’t think it’s worth noting that it sounds odd to say that sort of thing after having spent 200 pages describing his childhood in meticulous detail. He opens the book with a story about a face he thought he’d seen in the sea, and it comes back at the opening of Part Two. But, strangely, he doesn't think it is puzzling to simply mention the face, but not draw any meaning from it -- and he never returns to it again. All he gives us is one throwaway line (p. 189):“the remarkable thing was that I had forgotten it and now remembered.”And very strangely, he does not seem to notice that a reader might expect the story of the face in the sea to be of some interest to the narrator himself. As I read, I became increasingly convinced that Knausgaard was not aware that the success of his project turns not on his anti-literary ambitions, but on the reader's perplexity about his inability and lack of interest in resolving his intentions, and in the strangeness of the results. - -First postscript, 2013Volume 2 is now out in English, and there are signs Knausgaard will become a major figure. At the end of 2013 Rivka Galchen named vol. 2 as the ""most interesting literary development"" of the year, saying it is ""substantive, comical, and artistically singular."" (New York Times Book Review, Sunday, December 15, p. 43.) It is singular, but it is loose, unreflective about structure, unaware of readers' plausible expectations, and relentlessly simpleminded about how the everyday has been put into prose.- -Second postscript, May 2014Volume 3 is now out in English, and it's gotten an excellent  by Ben Lerner, ""Each Cornflake,"" London Review of Books, May 22, 2014. (I find this more convincing and clearer than the longer  by William Deresiewicz, "" Why Has ‘My Struggle’ Been Anointed a Literary Masterpiece?"" The Nation, May 13, 2014.)I am surprised at how widely it's being accepted that Knausgaard is a major novelist -- or, in Lerner's assessment, a largely successful anti-novelist, who is out to end the novel and literature in general by avoiding selection. (By recording everything.) As Lerner notes, that sets up a tension between the endlessness and lack of selectivity in the writing, in which the entire world spills onto the page, on the one hand, and the idea of plot, structure, or development, on the other. This is how Lerner puts it:""Of course Knausgaard does leave things out (why, I wonder, is sex described in less detail than cornflakes?), selects among scenes and sentences, but we are caught up in the fiction that he doesn’t. Yet that childish sense of open-endedness, in which everything is equally interesting, is countered by another fiction: that the meaning of 'My Struggle' will be revealed at its end, secured by the author’s death (at least his death qua author). The former fiction is a fiction of formlessness, the undifferentiated, an infinite verticality outside time; and the latter is a fiction that gives form, the imposition of shape on experience, a syntax of events. The constitutive tension of Knausgaard’s work, its internal struggle, is the push and pull between these two fictions.""Here ""death"" stands in for the novel and literature in general, and it is a reasonable synecdoche. For me Lerner's way of putting things raises two questions, both of which cannot be definitively answered for English-language readers until the final 3 volumes are translated. The two questions are:1. Can the supposed lack of structure, choice, taste, plot, style, and skill – the things that ruined volume 1 for me – be adequately understood as a bid to escape from literature? I agree that ""breaking of the vessel of art, the renunciation of fiction, literary suicide – these are fictions, and they’re the devices on which the power of 'My Struggle' depends""; but does the mass of unstructured writing actually work as an escape from fiction? 2. Can the supposed lack of structure, choice, taste, plot, style, and skill be understood as a representation of what Lerner calls ""the undifferentiated mass of experience""? Can the flood of ""raw"" experiences, especially the uninteresting, unremarkable, everyday ones, represent experience?These are two distinct questions. The first is about strategy: can a novelist put an end to the novel by putting everything into it except the structures that would have made it literature? The second is about experience: is it ""experience"" that is represented in ""My Struggle""? (I note that the first question is separate from the possibility, which Lerner ponders, that the book might conclude with death, and therefore conclude as literature: the question pertains to the strategy itself, not whether this 6-volume project succeeds. Apparently ""My Struggle"" does have an ending; is does end with ""death"": i.e., it has an arc, it does rehabilitate and motivate its formlessness. And apparently, too, Knausgaard has not defeated the novel, even for himself, because he has told an interviewer he is at work on another. But this first question is about strategy, not result.)My answer to both questions is no. To the first question: I am not persuaded that proposing to have laid down the nameable skills of the novelist is a strategy to avoid literature. Some Oulipean strategies do bypass some parts of literature, but this strategy is too knowing, too deliberate, and – though I recognize this won't be a popular opinion, given the many enthusiastic s of ""My Struggle"" – too easy. It's too easy to fill 6 volumes with a spew of uncurated thoughts. It's true the novel ""cracks,"" as Knausgaard himself says (""I thought of this project as a kind of experiment in realistic prose. How far is it possible to go into detail before the novel cracks and becomes unreadable?"") but that does not mean literature is left behind or even effectively critiqued. It would be as if someone tried to ""ruin"" the sonnet by interpolating thousands of extra lines.To the second question: the undifferentiated mass of experience supposedly rendered in ""My Struggle"" is itself a trope, an idea about the continuum of sensory experience that comes in part from Hume, Bergson, and de Certeau. ""My Struggle"" is a large-scale rehearsal of what counts, in such theories, as ""raw"" experience.So I doubt the project of ""My Struggle"": it is not an effective anti-novel, and it does not break through conventions to represent real experience. We need to begin to ask more closely why we think, as Lerner does, that ""it’s amazing.""- -Third postscript, April 2016.The fifth volume has just appeared. The New Yorker ran a long excerpt online (""At the Writing Academy,"" March 10, 2016), which is interesting because it includes photos taken of Knausgaard when he was at the writing academy in Bergen (the subject of the opening chapters of col. 5). The inclusion of images seems careless to me: I don't know the circumstances under which they were included, but I imagine the editors at The New Yorker imagined that they would lend appropriate veracity to an account that is itself a display of apparent unfiltered neutral observation. In relation to my own study of writing with images (online, under that name), these images are thoughtless, because Knausgaard's text is persistently slightly unbelievable in its apparent neutrality and directness, but the photographs are very direct in a much simpler manner. It's also curious that volume 5 opens with Knausgaard's observation that he kept his own photographs from that period, which are not reproduced in The New Yorker excerpt.

I would normally never buy a book advertised as ""feel-good,"" but Saeterbakken knows ""gloomy"" better than any other novelist. The book is a mixed achievement.On the positive side: the character, a quirky, probably autistic, uncommunicative, scattered, self-involved old woman, is memorable.On the negative side: the book relies on brief images, anecdotes, page-long stories, and jokes. Often the jokes are maudlin, pathetic, and even bathetic, and sometimes fourth-generation surrealist. Some examples:(The context for this first example is that the narrator (the old woman) tends to rhyme compulsively, and at one point in the book she has a writing.)""Sometimes I wrote about a friend I had when I was little, but that didn't happen often, since it was hard to make 'she buried me in anthills' rhyme with anything."" (p. 85)I imagine that a reader is supposed to laugh at this, sensing the story of pointless humiliation and social isolation that will follow. I don't find this kind of thing convincing or funny: it just short-circuits any more carefully and slowly developed sense of character. The narrator is so thoroughly, reliable, predictably socially isolated that these kinds of stories don't elicit sympathy or amusement. The woman and her husband barely speak to one another; the husband is also apparently a social outcast, and he only communicates in mathematical examples. One scene, in which he draws a Venn diagram to show that he's interested in another woman, is affecting. Most of the time his math-speak is reciprocated by her silence, or by something irrelevant she says, ruining the conversation. This could have been effective, if we had been given longer excerpts and contexts for their truncated exchanges, but instead Skomsvold prefers brief anecdotes that are supposed to be affecting:""I wanted to tell him how much I cared about him, but instead I told him that last year seven people had been killed by sharks and fourteen by toasters. [He] gave me a strange look and I wanted to disappear."" (p. 89)I imagine Skomsvold's model reader finds this funny and painful. But the ersatz surrealism is a thin, over-used strategy. And the dynamics of this scene are repeated throughout the book, so that there's nothing but a recurring disappointment: at first it's a disappointment that the two aren't communicating; then it's a disappointment that Skovold doesn't realize that expressing a lack of communication requires something other than the repetition of a single strategy.I might read her next novel, if it has a better sense of large-scale motions of narrative.

It's quite inventive and diverting to read about the cat's impressions of its depressed and occasionally suicidal owner.

In this case, a ""black man"" visits the cat's owner, and stays some time without speaking. Aside from the unfortunate choice of a ""black man"" (any visitor would have done as well, and Western readers can't be expected to join in the author's simple equation of blackness with strangeness), the problem is that the visits are never explained. The rest of the story is more realistic; that detail is from another kind of writing, a mildly surrealist or magic-realist tradition. Can Xue apparently doesn't notice that the closure of the story of the cat and its owner is at odds with the openness of the unexplained visits of the ""black man,"" and that that dissonance will appear to readers as an author's problem, not an author's gift.[return][return]I think Can Xue is at her best when she concentrates on either surrealism or realism, because she has no clear sense of how they mix.

OrThe Problem With Not Defining AllegoriesThis is an interesting hybrid between conceptual or experimental fiction and story-driven literary fiction. Or to be more exact: between Tom McCarthy's kind of conceptual fiction and Cormac McCarthy's violent narratives. There is strong writing here, even if it is a bit unremitting (everyone in this book is desperately sick, from the first page to the last, and Marcus loves nauseating descriptions, welts and odors and crusty sores and hemorrhaging bruises and seeping wounds), and there are also strong ideas, even if some are muddled. The book's central conceit is that the language of children has become toxic. At its best, in Part One, ""The Flame Alphabet"" is an interlocked series of allegories and parables about speech, articulateness, parenting, tolerance, belief, and Jewishness. At its worst, in Parts Two and Three, the details veer from literary fiction to genre or science fiction, because Marcus finds himself having to explain how mass evacuations work, or detention centers are kept secure, or the ways food can be scavenged, or how antidotes are manufactured, or how scientists explain the ""virus,"" and so forth--a whole machinery of explanation, none of which feeds the allegories. The book's uneven s are justified, because it slowly escapes its author's control. The cliche metaphor is that such a book is a train wreck. That isn't exactly the right image, because trains crash all at once. When a book's logical machinery goes wrong, it tends to happen in a series of small distractions, contradictions, and oversights, which build up in the reader's mind until finally it becomes impossible to suspend disbelief. A book that goes off the rails (in the accompanying cliche) is usually more like a car gradually breaking down: first a hum, then a funny smell, then a shudder, then a loud sound... until it just doesn't run anymore. The machinery of a complex book seldom breaks all at once. In hat sense, no  is long enough to describe a failed book, because its failure requires a map that is, in Borges's metaphor, the size of the book. It's not so much the logical problems that bother me (how does the main character research ancient scripts when he can't read anything without collapsing in pain?) as the conceptual problems (it's never explained whether or not speech is painful because it has meaning or because it causes ""understanding, knowing""; p. 196). It seems Marcus never really figured out exactly what his principal allegory is, or rather, he decided to let parts of it remain unanalyzed in the name of ambiguity and expressivity. In that sense, too, this book deserves a much longer  than it has gotten in the press. Is the language ""virus"" like what happened in the Tower of Babel, or not? Is all language a disease, and has it always been (as he hints in a number of passages, even making up citations from actual authors; p. 84)? Is the mystical faith of the narrator a matter of not communicating truths (i.e., a classical mysticism), or an allegory? Is language a disease because it is ultimately comprised of the names of God (the flame alphabet, a 17th c. idea; p. 65)? Why, exactly, aren't internal representations of language painful, given that introspective life and inner monologues continue even when the characters are mute because their own speech hurts them? Does language act as an ""acid over its message"" (p. 44), or, as in most of the book, is the message the acid and language the medium? Or to put it more rigorously: is the polemic against sense, meaning, denotation, langue, or parole? Other equivocations work better, because they're part of the book's ambiguous moral message: it's not resolved, for example, whether or not this is a specifically Jewish ""virus""; it's not resolved whether or not the central character's moral passivity and confusion are related to his ability to survive, or his value for people trying to control the ""virus""; and it's not resolved whether or not the mystical form of Judaism the narrator practices is genuine, valuable, or hopeful. Those kinds of ambiguity are compatible with allegory, but evasions and contradictions about the allegory itself are signs of a lack of control. (The idea of the ""forest Jews"" here owes something to ""hole worship,"" a 19th c. Russian practice described by Ceslaw Milosz; if Marcus doesn't know that, he should, because their anti-mimetic religion is close to what he's conjuring here. I wonder, too, in passing, if he saw my own book ""Domain of Images,"" which has many of the obscure scripts he mentions, including Bamum and Alaskan pseudowriting.)In terms of affect, the strongest passages are the brilliant conversations between the narrator, his wife, and their rude, clever, rebellious daughter. (For example p. 27.) But on p. 103, there's a passage that strongly suggests that the master metaphor, or the leading allegory, might be that bad parenting has caused the ""virus,"" which might be a kind of unconscious collective retribution. Apparently Marcus decided not to develop this, and eventually it seems that the narrator hasn't been a particularly bad parent. But on the other hand, he is consistently depicted as oblivious of other people's thoughts... and so on. ""The Flame Alphabet"" could have been spectacular if Marcus had made a decision to control his allegories, or even to decide which ones are leading tropes, which ones might be proven false in the course of the book, which ones contradict which others, and which should be permitted to remain undefined. I think the general issue here is it has seldom been the case that undefined allegories are more expressive than more closely defined ones, or for that matter that ambiguity is itself automatically expressive....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/11325011-the-flame-alphabet

His doctor decides the man is Finnish, because he has a Finnish name embroidered inside his shirt collar. The doctor is passionately Finnish himself. The patient imagines that the words he's learning have resonance somewhere deep within his injured brain. Even though each word and idea is unfamiliar, he assumes he's gradually reconnecting to his fundamental identity. It turns out, in the end, that he is Italian. He never learns that, but about halfway through the book he realizes he is not Finnish. At that point, however, it's too late: his identity is broken in an unusual and interesting way -- he's increasingly dedicated to learning Finnish, because he has no other way to create an identity for himself; and at the same time he's aware that the outlandishly complex Finnish grammar is floating on the surface of whatever he was, or might still be.It's a great idea, with all sorts of implications for identity theory, language, and translation theory, and it fits with the ongoing fascination with stories of failed memory. Marani's book questions one of the common assumptions of identity theory in relation to language -- that the words, phonemes, and grammatical forms we learned as infants are deeply embedded in our nature, in our character. A seminar on structural linguistics could make good use of this book, and so could a seminar on translation theory.Four issues prevent the book from exploring those problems as thoroughly as it might have.1. The author never quite figured out how someone with no language can contemplate the etymology of words or the poetry of myths when he can scarcely understand anything that is being said to him. Throughout the entire book -- all the way up to ten pages from the end -- the narrator says things like, ""Once again, I did not understand it all, although I could not fail to see that it contained harsh words"" -- this after an impassioned and extremely eloquent letter from a woman who had loved him. (p. 173) After a lengthy and detailed exposition of the Finnish epic Karevala, the narrator says simply, ""I had at last managed to begin to make some sense"" of the myths. (p. 126) The book is full of eloquent, articulate, detailed accounts of national character, history, literature, and language, which we read in full, but which the narrator can't really understand. Somehow, he reconstructs these speeches by memorizing entire sentences, and by pondering what had only seemed to him to be passionate random sounds. It would have been easy, for example, to introduce another character who could hear and transcribe everything in detail, and then have the patient recall what he could of each speech.2. The book has very conventional narrative structures: a story prefaced by a narrator, a journey to find a man who has disappeared, a book found and edited by another person, a love story represented by letters. In terms of narration it could have been written by anyone after Balzac or Poe. The stage-setting and continuous interpolated explanations (how the narrator found the book, how he edited it, how he reprints letters the soldier had transcribed) are all frameworks to support the central story. They could all have been dropped, and the book written by the soldier could just have been presented, with a second narrative by his doctor. (We get some detailed descriptions of what the notebook pages look like, so it might be an interesting art project to create the book we're asked to imagine, rather than the edited and corrected version we're given.) For some people, these devices still work, but for readers since Barthes, they should appear as what they are: scaffolding to help readers suspend disbelief in narratives that do not require that suspension.3. There is Finnish nationalism throughout the book: nothing objectionable in that, except that it doesn't fit the theme. A pastor who becomes a friend of the soldier is a major voice in the second half of the book, and we listen to his sermons on Finnish poetry and nationhood. Often the soldier's only comment is that he isn't sure whether the pastor is exaggerating. These paeans are sometimes woven into the theme of language and memory, but often they belong in another book.4. The most important subject in the book -- Finnish grammar -- is hardly discussed. There are many passages with etymologies, but only two passages in the book that even mention the fifteen noun cases or the the derivational suffixes. I would have loved a book, written by a translator like Marani, which took me through some of the labyrinths of Finnish, always with the possibility that the words might come from deep roots in the narrator's mind.[The comments from 2017 and 2022, below, respond to the original , written in 2012.

(There is a YouTube video of an old episode of ""Charlie Rose"" with Leyner, Wallace, and Franzen as the guests, made before Franzen was widely known.)The s I saw praised Leyner mainly for going there: he says things and writes in ways that are not usually permitted in literary novels. (One er put it that way: he was astonished at what he read, and wondered, ""Is that permitted?"") People say his writing is virtuoso, brilliant. They find him hilarious; ers mention how they laughed -- often, loudly, even continuously. They say his work makes other novels seem old-fashioned. Here is one of the 2012 Amazon s, in full:""It took me exactly 3 pages of this book to make me realize that I've been ever so slightly bored with every other book I've read... since Leyner's last book. This is the divine comedy.""I won't deny I smiled a number of times reading the book: it would be hard not to smile when Leyner is telling us, for example, that J.D. Salinger wrote an article with A.J. Foyt and published it in ""Highlights for Children."" The book's central conceit, that the universe is run by a white van-load full of gods who appeared about 14 billion years ago and are obsessed with someone named Ike who lives in New Jersey, is the kind of opening move that announces -- all by itself, with no need for an accompanying novel -- that as soon as any rule of novel writing, or even of propriety, appears, it will be happily broken.But I never laughed reading ""The Sugar-Frosted Nutsack."" I tried to picture the sort of reader Leyner was imagining: such a person would come to the novel with their head filled with Austen, Tolstoy, Nabokov, Forster, Greene, Roth, Updike, and especially Franzen, Ford, McCarthy, Proulx... and on the first page they'd be shocked, dismayed, and delighted. (This is one reason, I think, why Wallace once envied Leyner, even though Wallace tried hard not to depend on fireworks, paranoia, virtuoso writing, and hallucigenic scenarios.) It is more difficult to imagine the kind of reader for whom the whole book is funny, joke after joke. Several people hinted that the book became boring, but those who liked ""The Sugar-Frosted Nutsack"" tended to identify it as a kind of revelation of the inherently boring nature of other people's books. Boredom figures in Leyner's work in a complicated way; for me, thinking about boredom was the most interesting part of reading.The book staves off whatever might count as boredom by keeping up a nearly uniform pitch of hysteria. There are only a few moments in which the narrator's voice relaxes, and the double exclamation marks, italics, pop culture references, scattered knowing citations, Pynchonesque paranoia, Barth-like meta-references, all around goofiness, and boldface celebrity names let up just a little. One such passage is a list of things that Ike, the hero, loved about his childhood. Without its context, that list would be a lyrical, unironic, nostalgic evocation of memories. In context, it's drowned out by the gods and their craziness. Another passage, also a list, is about what men can understand about women. It turns out it was plagiarized from ""O,"" Oprah's magazine. The novel itself admits that, and it's also credited in the endpapers. Out of context, that list would be sincere and heartfelt (as I'm assuming it was in ""O""); in the novel it's said that people who take the list that way are hard to figure out.What, then, could count as boredom? Here are two possible positions:1. Boredom might happen when you don't need to be shocked. For me, it's the flood of writing itself that became boring, mainly because it was nearly unmodulated, and also because most jokes weren't funny. And that, in turn, was because I am used to unexpected juxtapositions of high and low culture, past and present, sense and nonsense, seriousness and irony: those kinds of jolts were a stock in trade of first-generation postmodernism. If you find it humorous to see Mircea Eliade's name juxtaposed with the name the god of testicles, that may be because you are anxious about the values and meanings of serious culture, philosophy, high art, and so forth, so it's a relief to see them deflated. If you aren't anxious, then it isn't especially funny to see those juxtapositions.2. Boredom might be an intrinsic quality of kitsch. Readers who are energized by a continuous barrage of wild writing are, I think, good examples of what the philosopher Karsten Harries called the ""kitsch economy."" In kitsch, what matters is effects, and in each repetition they have to be done more intensely, more densely, than before. The ""kitsch economy"" is tied to perpetual inflation: each new novel, film, painting, or composition has to have more special effects than the one before, because the effect of each innovation -- the hit, the force of the drug -- wears off. Readers who found that Leyner made other novelists boring might have found themselves needing his next book to be more outrageous.Boredom and its opposites (attention, immersion, absorption) are one of the themes that makes the book interesting. Another is what counts as funny, and why. Those were the kinds of things I was thinking of as I read. The book's repetitiveness, which some ers criticized, is part of the whole game: if what matters is to be entertained continuously, with no letup, and if one of the ways of accomplishing that is to be perverse and badly behaved, then what better strategy than to make repetition part of the plot? The book would have been twice as good if it had been twice as long. Or, in the spirit of Oulipo: it would have been a thousand times as good if it'd been a thousand times longer....more",Notes are private!,0,10,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/12419326-the-sugar-frosted-nutsack

When each everyday occurrence is adequately transfigured when it's changed into an odd insight?There's an anxiety here, something about life, but we'll never know what it is because the author is so content to paper everything over with the first clever thing that comes into his mind. It's almost an automatic reflex: he experiences something, the world is about to bear down on him, and he flicks it away with a joke. Everything has to remain rigorously lightweight, offhanded, unserious. Each new experience has to be decorated with his trademark cleverness so it's domesticated, neutered, ornamented. Clearly he thinks that profundity is best approached by slyly accumulating several thousand harmless witty observations, but it's like spending an evening with someone who laughs at everything and makes jokes continuously. It is exhausting, depressing, dispiriting. Readers who like it might ask themselves why they're so easily pleased, why the world is a puzzle that's so easily solved.[Note, added 2023: see Tamara's note, below.

The book provides a good test case for the possibility of detaching biography from the experience of fiction: it isn't possible to read the book without continuously jumping out of the fictional setting and wondering about the actual author; but at the same time it is possible to see through the autobiography to something of the book itself. Two things in particular strike me as properties of the book that resist the autobiographical.First there's the strange relationship between the narrator (a man who dies by suicide, addressed as ""you"" throughout the book) and his wife. In the fictional frame, the wife isn't known to the narrator. He speculates about her once, and he reports, briefly, on exchanges between the man and his wife -- they're all brief and bloodless, especially the one about why they don't have children. On the other hand, the narrator plainly loves the protagonist, and the narrator is plainly a man. So without an autobiographical frame, one of the principal interests and meanings of the book would have to be the love between two men, and the author's inability to imagine the woman in his character's life. Reading as autobiography erases that theme.Then there's the moment when the narrator stops speaking of the dead man as in realist fiction, reporting things the narrator might plausibly have known, and starts speaking in ways commensurae with an omniscient narrator. That slippage is a common trait, or flaw, in fiction, because it's such a temptation. Here it occurs along with a break in narrative style. Up until page 41, the book is nonlinear, comprised of brief thoughts about the person who has killed himself:""Your pain died down with nightfall.The possibility of happiness began at 5 o'clock in the winter..."" (p. 40)Page 41 opens a story of a trip to a city to play in a band; it includes a long description of wandering, and the possibility of an affair. The story continues to p. 57, and when it ends it's abruptly replaced by more brief paragraphs of reminiscence:""You directed toward yourself a violence that you did not feel toward others. For them you reserved all your patience and tolerance.""The story ends with a common author's device: the narrator had supposedly kept a journal of the journey, and it is implied that is how the narrator knew what was happening. But it's a threadbare device, and Leve doesn't bother, or remember, to explain its context or how the narrator came to read it. The story stands out because it's the moment the author forgets his fictional frame. The implied author is groping for ways to talk about himself, and the story within the novel is the moment when that desire swamps his impressionistic control of his work as fiction. The same happens again several times in the novel, especially in the concluding pages, which are curtly offered as having been written by the man who died by suicide. For me these are signs of the rupture between the work as fiction and the work as autobiography, and they are the principal interest of the novel....more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10845531-suicide

(For example Patrick Reardon in the Chicago Tribune, December 9, 2008, which was included in the publisher's press pack.)But this book is not one sentence, for at least four reasons. Two of them are listed in an excellent short survey of long sentences by Tim Parks (New York Times, December 24, 2010, in the Book Review, p. 27):1. The sentence is ""compromised"" by 23 chapter breaks.2. Three of the chapters are excerpts from an imaginary book that the narrator in ""Zone"" is reading, and those three chapters are full of periods.But there are two stronger reasons why ""Zone"" isn't a sentence:3. Enard sometimes gives up commas, so that the prose becomes agrammatical. It's not a sentence if it is a string of sentence fragments.4. He mixes tenses, doesn't observe parallel constructions, doesn't avoid run-on phrases, and doesn't make any attempt to structure his book according to subject, verb, and object: in other words, he only takes intermittent notice of the convention called the sentence.Still, it's hard to see how any of this matters. By concentrating on the supposed single sentence, the publicity engine that drove readers to this book missed other more important points. (The same pattern repeated in 2019 with Lucy Ellmann's ""Ducks, Newburyport,"" and Ellmann—I assume it was her—answered one of my comments on Twitter by saying it was one sentence ""in spirit."")First is the literary genealogy of the long sentence. It's a typically modernist strategy, most famously used by Joyce, Faulkner, and Beckett, intended to represent experience. The stream of consciousness (which has been separately studied) is an example. Why, then, should readers in 2011 (or 2019) be interested in the continuation of this particular device? Wouldn't it at least be interesting to ask why Enard feels that early twentieth-century experiments fit his theme of twenty-first century politics?Then there's the problem of the disconnect between the political and historical themes of the novel and its anti-grammatical construction. In the New New York Times  (""River of Consciousness,"" January 9, 2011), Stephen Burn says that ""the lack of formal boundaries permits an openness that counters the protagonist's obsession with the other boundaries men make and fight over,"" but that implies that all the ""boundaries"" the narrator recounts -- and the book is made of hundreds of such stories, from ancient Greek mythology to the wars in Iraq -- are equally well balanced by the tumbling endless prose. Is each act of warfare equally well answered by the missing periods that express it? Is each missing period a small indictment of the boundaries people construct? There's a mismatch between the specificity of the historical material and the sameness of the lack of punctuation.Then there's the carelessness of writing without periods and other punctuation. It's easy to write a version of the prose Enard writes here. It's much easier, in many ways, than constructing long sentences: I would trade this entire 500-page book for the sharpness of a couple of William Gass's fabulous sentences in ""On Being Blue.""There is also a disconnect between the prose and the consciousness it is meant to represent. In Beckett's prose, or in Molly Bloom's monologue, there is a reason for the tumbling endless narration. Here, in Burns's words, Enard ""leaves the reader floating free in the liquid"" of the narrator's mind: but why is the narrator equally angry, equally disoriented, equally atemporal, in respect to each individual moment in history? Even though Enard admires Joyce, Pound, Butor, and others, his mixture of allusions has more to do with Sebald: but in Sebald, different places and stories have differing weight, and require differing degrees of patience and coherence. Enard also admires the Pound of the Cantos, but those are deliberately fragmentary -- another high modernist trope -- while here, everything is melted as if it were the same.And does it bear saying that the writing and the allusions, are ponderous, portentous, and humorless? The weight of history has the same leaden quality here that it does in George Steiner. I wonder if what caught the press's attention wasn't the very superficial combination of a gimmick (a long sentence), a leaden world-historical seriousness, and the commonplace rehearsal of Mediterranean political guilt and honor. I notice several of the endorsements are from French television and journalism.In brief: the book is full of stories, and some of the stories are full of passion, but letting your sentences slump is not a radical strategy: it's a way of not working hard to make language fit its subject....more",Notes are private!,0,26,1,not set,"May 30, 2016","Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8519058-zone

I am stalled, for reasons I explain in the last paragraph.[return][return]Reviewers hThis is a half-, written about the first half of the book. I am stalled, for reasons I explain in the last paragraph.[return][return]Reviewers have remarked on Chapter 9, because it's the one that begins ""Author here."" It's an interesting gambit, given that it only takes about three lines to see that the author isn't there, and yet a sense that Wallace is actually speaking re-emerges toward the end, where the ""author"" gives his reasons for thinking his book ""has significant social and artistic value"" (p. 82). The ""author"" says the book is an exploration of the massive ""parallel world"" of ""boredom,"" which is also glossed as ""opacity,"" ""user-unfriendliness,"" and ""dullness"" (pp. 82, 85, 86). At the end of the chapter, the tone becomes especially straightforward, and it reads like the theoretical musings of an earnest, if informal, academic. The theory itself is something like this: dullness is rebarbative because it doesn't succeed in distracting us from a ""deeper type of pain,"" and therefore it is an especially interesting form of ordinary suffering (p. 85). There are echoes here of Baudelaire on boredom, Walter Benjamin on boredom, and Foucault and de Certeau on the everyday: that is to say that as a theorist, Wallace isn't doing something new. Because it's a novel, what counts is Wallace's particular species of boredom, along with what can be deduced about his reasons for thinking that what his practice, what anyone's practice, needs now is an unremitting exploration of boredom. Without those two specific sources of interest (his sort of boredom, and his sense of the contemporary English-language novel), and aside from the many cultural differences that I'd like to say can be bracketed out, there would not be much to distinguish his motivation from Flaubert's motivation in writing ""Madame Bovary."" Both books were intended to be nearly plotless, without grand gestures of mythology, legend, religion, politics, Literature, theater, or drama. Both books were intended, apparently, as difficult but necessary feats, as attempts to get back to the ""matter"" of writing and away from all its distractions. For Flaubert, those distractions were ""St. Anthony"" and his other ""purple"" books; for Wallace, it was, famously, the pyrotechnics of his own early work, which is still carried on in ""McSweeny's.""[return][return]Chapter 13 is on a boy who suffers from ""shattering public sweats."" Here the clearly repulsive (""hideous"" would be the Wallace word here) symptoms and life of the hapless narrator are counter-balanced by the matter-of-fact tone that would normally be associated with clinical reporting. The contrast between this and the long passages on tax law are interesting: tax law isn't repulsive, but because it's treated with an analogous disinterest (in the proper sense of that word, as opposed to lack of interest), the ""hideousness"" of the sweating boy begins to appear as an unnecessary ornament. Real boredom, real dullness, can do without this sort of flashy, affect-heavy content. In fact it seems that anything sensational, attractive, repulsive, or affecting, could be pared from the book if its intention is a species of ""dullness."" What are the conditions under which a chapter like this could be seen as a standout achievement? Those conditions would have to include readers for whom every apparently dull, but actually disgusting or embarrassing description is a source of shivery pleasure. When that isn't the case, the chapter can only seem inappropriately tricked out in a froth of campy body humor. A purer form of the same investigation would be a boy who had, say, a simple tic, or a slight stutter.[return][return]Chapter 14 has the episode that several ers have noted, in which a character imagines a play in which nothing happens (p. 106). The character says he could never decide on the action, so there wasn't any. It's a clear invitation to see this book's purpose as actionless realism, eventless story, fiction voided of its usual content. But most of the book is not like that: it's full of concentrated attempts to produce incidents. This section conjures Beckett, which very little of Wallace resembles. (Tom McCarthy's front-page  in the ""New York Times Book Review"" is, I think, largely a mirror of McCarthy's own ambitions. It's not that McCarthy projects Beckett, Kafka, and others into ""The Pale King,"" because they're there: it's that McCarthy does not pay attention to what Wallace is actually doing. McCarthy's head is full of contentless ambition, and that's what he sees in this book.)[return][return]Chapter 15 is a Pynchonesque riff on ESP; Chapter 16 is another essay in adolescent awkwardness, like Chapter 13; Chapter 19 is a sketch for a set piece on boredom: and this brings me to the reason I have stopped reading the book.[return][return]Somewhere around Chapter 22 an idea occurred to me that made it too depressing to keep reading. Reviewers all mention the moments in the book where characters mention suicide, and of course they're hard to read, but no one seems to have thought of another possibility: Wallace's suicide might have been -- complexly of course -- related to what he may well have perceived as the irrecuperable failure of this book, and therefore of a decade of work. ""The Pale King"" continuously tries to be clever and bright in new ways. The Chapters all strain to be about lack of action, lack of interest, lack of character. It's the strain itself, rather than its successes and failures, that suddenly struck me as genuinely depressing. If you feel, as I think Wallace did, that something significant needs to be done both with the novel and with one's own previous practice, and if it appears, as I think it did to Wallace, that what would matter most would be some sort of draining away of the machinery of ""interest"" in favor of ""boredom,"" ""opacity,"" and ""dullness,"" then you're likely to set up a framework like Wallace did -- a ""boring"" IRS operative, a full-on course in tax law: and in that case two options present themselves. One is to write about ""boredom"" but do it incandescently well (as in Incandenza, and, in a different register, as in ""Madame Bovary""). Another is to lay down writing (as in Beckett). But ""The Pale King"" struggles because it wants to break into new territory -- the territory of the flat, the boring, the everyday -- but it doesn't know what to do but scintillate. Chapter 13, on the sweating boy, was a tipping point for me, because I could not take any pleasure in it. Without the fun of camp or squeamishness or misbehavior or embarrassment, it is genuinely empty. Somewhere around Chapter 22 I began to see all that as deeply depressing, and I started experiencing the entire book as tremendously heavy, overwhelmingly sad -- completely and totally apart from its subject matter or its characters or their lives. It is depressing, not in an artistic sense, but in an operative sense. It's empty, it's a dead end, any yet there isn't anywhere else to go....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/9443405-the-pale-king

The book's central argument is that the devices of the novel, including plot or narrative, character, voice, and genre, are obsolete, and that appropriation, randomness, fragmentation, and other strategies of collage can restore a sense of the ""real."" In its general form, that question is still open in contemporary fiction. Yet I still find ""Reality Hunger"" unconvincing. Here I will try to pose two questions.1. What counts as ""collage"" in Shields's book?As Wojciech Drąg has pointed out, Shields's principal models were the concept of the lyric essay and collage or ""mosaic."" The former is an unevenly theorized form. It is associated with John d'Agata, and carries associations of first-person or lyric address, but for Shields it was apparently mostly a matter of ""eclecticism, heterogeneity and fragmentation."" The latter, collage or ""mosaic,"" is the subject of Drąg's book. In his words:Collage embodies most aspects of the idea of art advocated in Shields’s manifesto, including the central proposition of drawing on ""reality"" in the form of ""raw,"" unprocessed material. As he explains in the collage section, borrowing the words of the poet Charles Simic, ""found objects [and] ready-mades . . . abolish the separation between art and life"" (340). Their familiarity helps create ""an immediate identification . . . between the viewer and the work of art"" (364). Drąg suggests that Shields's main points of reference are D’Agata, Jonathan Lethem (especially his essay ""The Ecstasy of Influence: A Plagiarism,"" 2007), Jonathan Raban, and Dave Eggers. What Shields has in mind is perhaps clearest in this passage:A deliberate unartiness: “raw” material, seemingly unprocessed, unfiltered, uncensored, and unprofessional. . . . Randomness, openness to accident and serendipity, spontaneity; artistic risk, emotional urgency and intensity, reader/viewer participation; an overly literal tone, as if a reporter were viewing a strange culture; plasticity of form, pointillism; criticism as autobiography; self-reflexivity, self-ethnography, anthropological autobiography; a blurring (to the point of invisibility) of any distinction between fiction and nonfiction: the lure and blur of the real.[""Reality Hunger,"" 3; Drąg, ""Collage in Twenty-First-Century Literature in English,"" 87]It's interesting that Shields likes the word ""mosaic,"" because it imples the fragments add to form a single continuous image. Tesserae would have been nearer the mark. What he is aiming at is in irrecuperable state of fragmentation, because the operation of fragmentating is itself what will restore ""reality"" and expunge the obsolete elements of the novel. This kind of collage needs to avoid being a single coherent image, a mosaic. (Parenthetically: the identification of fragments, appropriation, and discontinuity with the ""real"" makes Shields's argument susceptible to James Wood's objection that Shields poses reality in an overly facile way against fiction. Writers like Reznikoff and Metcalf might well have agreed with what Wood implies: fragmentation and appropriation, in their work, hardly make the texts more ""real."" (See Wood, ""Keeping It Real,"" The New Yorker, 7 March 2010). Benjamin, here, is the better example, but even his work is not intended to produce a heightened effect of reality: he might have found that an amusing symptom of a certain bourgeois longing in relation to literature. His own project was about assembling a dossier to exhibit certain thoughts about culture.)2. Is ""Reality Hunger"" original?Why does Lydia Davis think ""every page abounds with fresh observations""? In Drąg's count, over two-thirds of the entries are exact or modified quotations from other writers. Shields says his editors told him he had to acknowledge his sources, and as a result it's possible to see which entries he wrote himself. The original sections make disappointing reading. They tend to be either cliches of literary criticism and history, or undeveloped literary theory.Section 58 reads, in its entirety, ""My medium is prose, not the novel."" Why, I wonder, doesn't he feel it is necessary to look more closely at the word ""prose"" here, since it is doing so much work for him? Section 140 reads: ""Plot, like erected scaffolding, is torn down, and what stands in its place is the thing itself."" This is part truism, and part surprisingly naive realism. Perec, for example, could be said to have wanted to ""tear down"" plot, but he wouldn't have said that what remains is ""the thing itself"": that almost sounds like George Steiner in ""Real Presences"" (1986).Section 457 is another example of a one-sentence manifesto that doesn't quite get to the end without a twist into ambiguity or obscurity. It reads: ""So: no more masters, no more masterpieces. What I want (instead of God the novelist) is self-portrait in a convex mirror."" This is over-complicated: the first part is against the naturalistic novel and the traditional role of the author, as in Foucault's or Barthes's critiques; but the last clause is an allusion to John Ashbery's ""Self Portrait in a Convex Mirror,"" and to the Parmigianino original: and those allusions are semi-opaque, unnecessarily metaphorical, and unaccountably coy.Section 307 reads (also in its entirety): ""There's no longer any such thing as fiction or nonfiction; there's only narrative. (Is there even narrative?)"" No graduate student would be allowed to write like this: his leading terms, in this case ""narrative,"" are allowed to stand without explanation, and his positions are at once polemical and vague.Sections 234 to 236 are also original; they are unremarkable observations about popular culture. Section 236, for example, begins: ""What does it mean to set another person before the camera, trying to extract something of his or her soul? When are we exploiting? When are we caressing?"" Other people have said these things so much more exactly, at such length, so much more eloquently. Section 310 is another original section, on popular reality TV. It breezes over themes that need to be more closely articulated: ""The bachelorette on the brink of true love with one of several men she has known for seven hours; the cad who manipulates his beloved on cue--two narratives: false actualization and authentic shame. The success of the genre [of reality TV] reflects our lust for emotional meaning."" Does Lydia Davis really admire criticism like this?There are more sections similar to these; section 428, for example, is a page-long contribution on Nabokov, which is used to make an unremarkable point about autobiography and its independence from plot. Section 456 is also a relatively long passage on how ""plot isn't a tool: intelligence is."" Section 473 is autobiography: it's informative but nearly free of interest.Snide literary jokes are also scattered through the sections of the book that Shields wrote. Section 458 quotes Nabokov, but in the footnote Shields says that ""in honor of the author's Olympian hauteur"" he ""corrected"" Nabokov's grammar. Section 139 begins, ""In the end, I missed the pleasure of a fully imagined work...""; this turns out to be a quotation from a  of one of Shields's books. Section 145, another original section, is a mean-spirited listing of a ""Verboten thematic: secular Jews, laureates of the real, tend to be better at analyzing reality than re-creating it:... Harold Brodkey, most of the essays; Philip Lopate's introduction to ""The Art of the Personal Essay""; Vivian Gornick, pretty much everything..."" At the end of this list he tries to patch things up by associating these authors with certifiably important people: ""And, of course, less recently, Marx, Proust, Freud, Wittgenstein, Einstein."" That gambit, of putting someone down and then trying to make it sound like a compliment, never works: it betrays a superficial sense of rhetoric. And the passage is painted with such a broad brush that it's impossible to make much sense of it anyway.The original texts in ""Reality Hunger"" don't strike me as original. (Benjamin's original interpolations in the ""Arcades Project"" can be much more thoughtful.) In a certian sense they shouldn't, because they argue for unoriginality. But there is a crucial difference between arguing for a practice of unoriginal writing, and claiming that the argument itself does not need to be original. Shields's book presents itself as a polemic: i.e., a timely and therefore original intervention.There is a historical problem with the implicit claim that collage or ""mosaic"" are needed now. In one sense this is unproblematic. Perloff's book ""Unoriginal Genius"" traces a history of collaged texts to Benjamin, and she includes postmodern texts like Anne Carson, Kenny Goldsmith, and Jan Baetens. (I wish she'd said more about Charles Reznikoff and especially Paul Metcalf, whom I've written about on this site: their senses of what to do with collaged texts are among the most interesting.) Collage, as a literary strategy, has a genealogy in early 20th century modernism. But in what sense, then, is it a postmodern or contemporary gesture?In fact, ""shards"" (another of Shields's many terms) and fragmentation are not only not specifically postmodern: they are premodern. First-generation German romantics like Novalis explored fragments as ways of discovering a new kind of unity. Novalis's ""Notes for a Romantic Encyclopedia"" is still amazing, and it is not a realist manifesto. There is also scholarship on the romantic nature of the shard, for example by the philosopher Guy Sircello. So what's at stake in Shields's book is a particular reaction against a particular sense of the novel, one that draws selectively on a restricted history. ConclusionIf I read ""Reality Hunger"" straight through, without looking at the notes, I do get a collage, but then there's the question of what kind of collage it is: whether it is disruptive, dissociative, genuinely and constitutionally fragmented, or whether it develops and depends on resonances and unexpected harmonies between its isolated entries. I don't mind genuinely random assemblies of fragments, as in Burroughs, but most literary collages, from Pound and Eliot to Benjamin, Reznikoff, Metcalf, and Markson work by implying or proposing new forms of order. In that sense ""Reality Hunger"" is an uninteresting collage: its thesis is simple, and so are its ideas about what counts as interesting juxtaposition....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8372445-reality-hunger

I wasn't happy with ""Remainder,"" but McCarthy is an art world fixture, and I expected something experimental here. Given his psychotically disengaged, affectless narrator in ""Remainder,"" I expected unresolved existential puzzles, meditations on reality and presence, and maybe some Oulipo-style games. I expected that all the technical material in the novel, which impressed some ers, would add to some elaborate theory about the illegible codes of the world and their inadequate representations, as in ""Remainder,"" or as in the late-surrealist manifestos of the International Necronautical Society. I thought each chapter would be a set up for something elaborate that would be developed in the next chapter: the main character, Serge Carrefax, hunts down strange radio signals at the limits of his receiver's range, listening to the aurora borealis -- and around that time, his sister kills herself. His father is experimenting with radio and dreaming of television, and his household is full of botanical, chemical, and entomological pursuits. All that, it seems, should lead toward some inevitably failed system of signification that would allegorize the main character's emotionally frozen state. (If I'd read Charles Baxter's excellent  in the New York Review of Books, I wouldn't have thought all this; his  is posted on this site, but it's better to read it on the NYRB site, with the footnotes intact; November 25, 2010. More on that at the end.)[return][return]The s praise the book's ambition, its originality. It's ambitious only in the most abjectly old-fashioned manner: it's Hollywood-bound. The opening scenes describing Serge Carrefax's childhood home are clich�d evocations of a late nineteenth-century English estate. There's a chapter-long set piece about a spa in Poland, with all the details so familiar from early 20th c. novels. (The acknowledgments name a person who helped McCarthy find ""a perfect spa town,"" but why did he bother? All these descriptions come straight from novels written 80 years ago.) There's another long set-piece on flying reconnaissance over the trenches in WWI: again, dusty material, stocked with all the clich�s of that genre. And another long set piece about Egypt, complete with mini-lectures on Isis and Osiris, the Book of the Dead, Sekmet, Upper and Lower Egypt, the meaning of ""pharaoh,"" and other things: astonishing they aren't tongue in cheek. Astonishing McCarthy thinks he's woven them into his narrative. Astonishing they've been read as evidence of the author's erudition.[return][return]The book is studded with short expositions of supposedly esoteric or technical subjects: the silkworm industry, a chemistry manual, a dung beetle, how the sound from cannons is picked up using piano wires; how gunners learn to site their targets. There are lots of those, and they could have accumulated into an impressive sense of the world's codes, or an obsessive sense of the main character's disengagement from the human and pathological attachment to affectless semiotics. They could have, except that they're too short. They're hardly up and running as metaphors before McCarthy turns to something else. It's as if his sources (old journals, whatever he's found in libraries) were all brief, so his exposition had to be brief; or as if he thinks he'd bore readers if he kept going on such subjects, or -- the strangest option, but the one I suspect might account for the book's collage of little lectures -- as if he thought that even his psychotically detached narrator couldn't plausibly be that detached. But the whole point of elaborate, technical descriptions is that they can carry dense loads of meaning, and when they're sustained over pages or chapters they become resoundingly strange and compelling. I think, for example, of the descriptions of sunlight or banana plants in Robbe-Grillet's ""Voyeur,"" or the endless technicalities in ""Locus Solus,"" or, for that matter, the children's textbook in ""Finnegans Wake."" Why sample what should be endlessly repeated? Why be coy about the very signs of disengagement that are the book's theme?[return][return]These brief episodes are also unbelievable judged as conventional realist fiction. I can't believe that Serge, growing up in a family that is engaged with science and natural history, doesn't know what a spittle bug is (according to the novel, his sister tells him about it, and he briefly relishes its Latin name). I can't believe that he doesn't have more experience in the chemistry lab (the novel makes it sound as if he went in one or two times, and tried a couple of experiments without have any previous acquaintance with chemicals). I can't believe that when he finds a book a German soldier left behind, it happens to be H�lderlin, whom he apparently has never read before even though he has fluent German; and I can't believe that when an English soldier is reading poetry it happens to be A.E. Houseman (and I can't believe that McCarthy has to incorporate a lesson in the relative merits of those two poets, as if it fits seamlessly into his narrative simply because his narrative is stuffed with detail). I can't believe that he first notices some of the stages in silk manufacture, even though it's the principal industry on his father's estate, when he's almost a teenager and -- supposedly -- just happens to wander through the rooms. Realism, and writerly work, aren't McCarthy's strengths. At the level of writing, the book is often weak. Charles Baxter noted actual misspellings; I noted awkward sentences like this one:[return][return]""At the beginning of September, an arrival creates a small eddy in the flow of leavers from the town.""[return][return](A ""flow of leavers""?) The next sentences are also typical: [return][return]""She turns up in the Grand Hotel's lobby with a large round hatbox, a mink stole, a folded parasol of the same light blue as the hatbox, a black handbag and a flotilla of smaller bags and boxes. As porters duck and tack around her, she stands static as a lighthouse in a busy harbour, leaving her older chaperone to issue instructions and distribute tips."" (pp. 98-99)[return][return]McCarthy is not parading stereotypes here: he is only writing a period-piece description -- so he doesn't really have an excuse to be piling on the clich�s. The lighthouse metaphor is like one of the overdone pieces in Roussel's ""New Impressions of Africa,"" except that it's not generated by any compulsive rule: it's simply an attempt at a realist metaphor. But ""duck and tack,"" which prefigures the harbor image, is the only well-written phrase in the sentence, and its function as an ornament to the marine metaphor ruins it as description. So at the level of writing -- realist craft, in this case -- the book is often distractingly dysfunctional.[return][return]I kept reading, hoping the Hollywood-style set pieces would finally congeal into a pattern, a theory, a systematic hallucination of meaning (as in ""Remainder""), a language game, anything experimental. But no: this is a profoundly, resolutely old-fashioned sort of novel, interlarded with what the author thinks are unusual and fascinating pieces of period detail and technical information. (Baxter is good on the reasons why McCarthy was mistaken by people in the art world as an experimental novelist.) But the period detail is hackneyed and unconvincing (he isn't a good historical novelist), and the technical information is too sparse, didactic, unfelt, and undeveloped. And too unconvincing. I was hoping I could get ideas about the state of the experimental novel from this: instead I see McCarthy's headed for a different sort of career....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10766374-c

So there's the physical book itself, the thing, which needs to be understood. Then -- a separate issue, and the separation is the problem -- there's the story that can be read on each page, in sequence, as a book is usually read.As an object, the book is very attractive. If you flip through the pages you see the empty spaces that tunnel down through the book. The edges of the empty pages are filled with words, which sit on little shelves of paper leaning out into the space. You see that each page is constructed as a rectangular frame of paper, made sturdy by five or six horizontal strips. The words and punctuation marks are appended to that framework, like the tabs in an extruded-plastic toy. If you open the book wide, and try to read everything you see, you get an attractive chaos: ""With secret spring, oneyco [that's part of the word ""honeycombed,"" showing through from a later page] without transition, myself in an evenwider, more sumptuous interiormy father kept. and his desk a""and so forth. (p. 82)More could be said about the book as an object. It's intriguing and attractive except for the cover, which is unaccountably a freehand rendering of dots. There would seem to be little reason for freehand painting in a project that is all about geometry, precision, and rectilinear cutting; and dots don't make sense at all, either in relation to the book as an object, or to its title, or to its contents.Next is the experience of reading. To actually read the book, you have to hold each individual page up by itself, and fold the other pages back as far as possible. (If you don't hold up one page at a time, then your reading of the sentences on any given page will be hopelessly confused by the appearance of words from other pages.) Because the perfect binding is strong, it is impossible to hold each page straight in front of you, so you end up reading at an angle. It would also be possible to read by slipping a blank sheet of paper behind each page. Either way, reading is artificial, and that artificiality does not seem to be linked to the themes of the book or the physical appearance of the book. Foer and his designers do not seem to have planned reading at the same time they planned the construction of the book itself: an example of the separation of parts that makes this book problematic.[And then there's the question of content, and that is where ""Tree of Codes"" becomes especially interesting. The book is presented as a die-cut, redacted version of Bruno Schulz's ""Street of Crocodiles."" But it's not even necessary to consult Schulz's book to see that's not so, because the words that appear in Foer's book have such capacious white margins around them that they could not have been cut from any actual printed edition of Schulz's book. That is most apparent when it comes to periods and other punctuation, which Foer sometimes leaves isolated on the page, without words around them. They have white space on both sides, in a way that periods don't.Consulting copies of the English translation of the book, I conclude that Foer printed out and formatted his own version of the book -- either that, or once he chose the words he wanted to retain, he reformatted the book so they were spaced in ways he liked. For example p. 67 begins:""My father kept in his desk abeautiful map of our city""There are two missing lines of text, in Foer's book, between those two redacted lines of text. But the original (in English) is:""My father kept in the lower drawer of his desk and old and beautiful map..."" (That is the Penguin Classics edition, for which Foer wrote an Introduction.) So the two cut-out lines in Foer's book are invented. That matters, because it means this is not a redacted version of a book (a physical object) but of a text (Schulz's text).And then finally, at the level of meaning, the book becomes very puzzling. If you were to read just this book, and not know anything about Schulz's book, you'd find an evocative, spare, sometimes mystical, often abstract family drama. It is quite different in tone, speed, content, and meaning from Schulz's original. Sometimes Foer picks words that summarize or evoke Schulz's text, so that it seems he is interested in making a purer, less dense version of the original. Other times he changes the emphasis and the meaning of Schulz's writing. As I read, I began to be interested more in what Foer intended readers to think he was doing, than I was in the story he was presenting in his own book. Some examples of those puzzles:""Tree of Codes"" is made of fragments of ""Street of Crocodiles."" There are places in ""Tree of Codes"" where it seems that Foer's interest is in deepening the mysteries that fascinated Schulz -- the idea that meaning can be found in overlooked details, in deepening twilights, in strangely long summers, in abandoned and rooms, in empty hallways and streets, in comets, in patterns and coincidences, and in subtle phenomena that go unnoticed. This is the old-fashioned, late-Romantic Foer, the one involved in Jewish and Central European early modernism, which does not interest me. In context of these practices, the world becomes more mysterious, in a simple sense, when parts of it are missing -- at least that is what would be implied.The section called ""Street of Crocodiles"" in the book of that name describes a street, which in Foer's version turns into a meditation on codes and what they might mean. At some points Foer's intervention becomes self-reflexive, pointing to his book itself, in the way that the ""Shem the Penman"" passages of ""Finnegans Wake"" refer to the book itself:"" The tree of cod es was better than a paper imitation .""we read on p. 97; in the Penguin edition, p. 72, has""The Street of Crocodiles was a concession of our city of modernity and metropolitan corruption. Obviously, we were unable to afford anything better than a paper imitation...""Foer's book loses all the politics, the meditations on class and poverty, the specificity of time and place; it substitutes, at times, a placid postmodernism. That's especially hard to understand given Foer's Introduction to Schulz's book in the Penguin edition, and his ""Author's Afterword"" in this book. In his own book he re-uses some passages from the earlier introduction, including a crucial few lines describing how when he first read it he realized it was a great book, but he also saw that he didn't like it:""The language was too heightened, the images too magical and precarious, the yearnings too dire, the sense of loss too palpable--everything was comedy or tragedy.""Here, by implication, he has worked to make the book into something that he can like as well as love, or love as well as admire. That same line is reframed in the ""Author's Afterword"" so it becomes part of a myth of origin that he fantasizes lies behind Schulz's book:""Often, while working on this book, I had the strong sensation that ""The Street of Crocodiles"" must have, itself, been the product of a similar act of exhumation."" (p. 139)Then follows the sentence I quoted, along with some others, but this time not as criticism but as signs that ""The sentences feel too unlikely to have been created on purpose."" I am assuming Foer doesn't actually believe this: he doesn't think Schulz is an Oulipo-style writer. But then it becomes difficult to understand exactly what his response to Schulz's book is. Is it an attempt to come to terms with an author he admires by reducing him, not only by reformatting his book and cutting out most of his text, but also by pretending that Schulz himself was partly constrained by a similar rule-bound exercise? Or is it an attempt to articulate the deepest ""yearnings,"" the most intense ""loss,"" the purest ""tragedy,"" by excising their cultural contexts?I do not mind this vacillation, which it seems to me is the book's real purpose and heart. What I do not like is the way the physical experience of reading, and the visual experiences of looking, looking askance, and looking through, are not linked to these themes of admiration, love, and distaste. The visual and the physical are present in a generic way: the die-cut pages are there in the same form throughout the reading experience, even while the story develops and the resonances with the original change. This inattention to the specifics of the visual is also the case in ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close: A Novel,"" in which visual interpolations are largely ignored, or treated as generic images, in the text. All that is disappointing for readers who want to pay the same kind of attention to the visual as to the written. But it is very rare to find a work of fiction that engages the visual in such a concerted fashion, and rare to find a book that takes so long just to begin to describe....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9583799-tree-of-codes

He can be tremendously inventive, repeatedly unpredictable, quirkily self-reflective. This book is an older one, written in 1991, and it's one of the few I haven't enjoyed. It's much more along the lines of Latin American magic realism of the 1970s and 1980s, with the addition of a postmodern authorial voice. At the beginning, Aira says he doesn't want to follow the dictates of memory, and there's a wonderful quotation along those lines that he attributes to Boulez:""Memory makes things felt, heard, and seen rise into the light, a bit the way a bolus of grass rises again in a ruminant. It may be chewed, but it is neither digested nor transformed."" (p. 9)The problem is that the opposite of this dependence on memory is, in this book, a continuous whimsical magic-realist inventiveness. There are many reasons to dislike magic realism, and they have been well rehearsed. In this context the two most pertinent are: (1) magic realism is the symptom of a need to continuously produce wonder, and that itself reveals a more interesting problem: that the author feels reality calls for a kind of frantic augmentation, as if whatever is ordinary is part of an oppressive, uninteresting or even punishingexistence that has to be magicked at all costs, and (2) magic realism has, by principle, no rules, and that freedom also removes a constraint on the reader's attention: if the author has no guiding ideas, then the reader is permitted a similar freedom, and that includes the freedom to not follow along, to not agree that magic has been made, to refuse to find meaning or emotion in unexpected transformations. If anything can happen, the rules of the writing are relaxed to the point where it is no longer possible for the author to make a misstep. Where anything is permissible, there is also no failure, no tension in watching the author negotiate the invented world.""The Seamstress and the Wind"" relaxes, gives away, the real oddity that Aira can conjure by imagining that fireworks are always entrancing, that they will create the same cognitive dissonance, the same uncanny surprises, as a more personal and less programmatic sense of existential humor. Aira is interesting, I think, in inverse proportion to his affinity for magic realism....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/9887215-the-seamstress-and-the-wind

Bergvall writes a mix of concrete poetry, language poetry, experimental prose, graphic elements, and language and translation theory. She does performances as well as written pieces, and some of these are detached from their original contexts, so ""Meddle English"" shouldn't be judged as a book whose contents are only printed matter.""Goan Atom"" is often a very strong poem. There are pages for chanting (I'm assuming) that are especially wonderful (pp. 116-19). Several ers, including Matt Reeck in Jacket2 (in a pdf on Bergvall's website) also praise passages in ""Goan Atom,"" especially lines that take sexual and violent subject matter and break it into phonemes and other word fragments. Several of the ""Shorter Chaucer Tales"" are also excellent; I liked ""The Not Tale (Funeral),"" with some broken echoes of Stein; and the echoes of Chaucerian English are sometimes funny and expressive at the same time:""A new ideology of yvele evell evyl evil manaces society[return]and it includes gay weddynge jolly marriage"" (p. 32)I think Bergvall is at her best when she is crushing together Chaucer, Celan, and Stein, and pushing them all into a sort of performative rhythmic verse.Other strategies in ""Meddle English"" are weaker. I don't see that Bergvall has put much thought into her graphics, or even into the pages of graphical and concrete poetry. There are four pages of ink spots before the last text in the book. There's no way to pay attention to them -- they don't vary in accord with any motions of the framing texts. There's nothing to do but page past them as quickly as possible.I am also unconvinced by her ways of writing literary criticism. The essay ""Material Compounds"" compounds references to Anne Carson, Sappho, Sugimoto, the YBAs, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, and others; but Bergvall is not careful or, apparently, well read on all those subjects, and parts of her collage of thoughts come across as in need of further pondering and elaboration.""Middling English,"" the opening essay, is only intermittently evocative or persuasive. It is too performative, too midden-like, enmeshed in its own alliterative concepts, to also be a theory of middens, middles, or meddles. Bergvall sometimes says something succinctly and then follows it with an unhelpfully abstract paraphrase, for example here:""The point is less whether it is a world language than the kind of world it perpetuates. The point is less whether it is a vehicular language than the kind of vehicle it charters."" (p. 12).""Charters"" here is strangely formal and hard to understand as a word choice, and the difference between the claim in the first sentence and the one in the second sentence, is muddy, both because it's not clear what ""kinds"" of vehicles might be meant, but because the comparative analogy isn't sensible. In the first sentence, there's a play on ""world"": first it's the literal world, then it's the world of a language; in the second sentence, there's a play on ""vehicle"": first as utility, then as literal transportation. This doesn't make sense, and the kind of poetry it implies remains obscure unless we are meant just to be listening for playfulness: in which case I'd prefer the play to be more interesting....more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/10048134-meddle-english

There aren't any other options.The book has some real empathy and emotion, and it is written tenderly, as Colm Toibín says. But the onslaught of clichés begins on the first page and never lets up. At first I thought it was ironic, and then I hoped it might be an attempt to create a period feeling, but the clichés are unremitting. There are entire pages made up of nothing but commonplaces about old Ireland, Irishness, the Irish landscape, the Irish character. I wouldn't mind an evocation of stereotypes of the past, since this is, after all, a narrative about an 89-year old woman. But Barry himself swims in this stuff. There is no effective authorial distance. A reader wades in thickened nostalgia for ideas that were old even in their generation.Not every Irish reference in the book is a cliché, but those that aren't tend to be introduced, guidebook fashion. There are arch references and explanations for some of the more local usages; at one point Barry informs us that people in Dublin call packages ""messages.""

The line that stopped me -- I will never finish this book, or read anything else of his! -- is on page 128, when he brings the hoariest of all clichés onstage, the wirra-wirra.

It's endorsed enthusiWhen the Author Clearly Knows Things the Narrator Supposedly Doesn'tThis is a book about an afternoon spent wandering in a park. It's endorsed enthusiastically by Vila-Matas as an example of the future of the novel.The problem here is that I just can't believe the implied author (Chejfec). The book has airs of the universalism of Beckett and the everyday despondency of Pessoa. The narrator (as opposed, as always, to the implied author) isn't particularly good at remembering things, making distinctions, or observing (as in Beckett's ""Ill Seen Ill Said""). The city he's exploring could be any city (as in Pessoa). But I just can't believe it: the detachment, the indifference, are poses put on for this book. The narrator carries books with him, and he is attending a literary conference, but we hear very little about either: it's as if the narrator is so deeply abstracted that he has lost touch with the day-to-day reality of the business of writing fiction. But I don't believe that: it's more like he's an ordinary academic, but he wants to write a novel in which he appears as a detached, indifferent observer of the world.What's especially telling (and, in the end, particularly annoying) is that he won't tell us what city he's in. It's ""a large city"" in ""the south of Brazil."" Cities are never named in the novel. Now on the one hand, that's reasonable, if the purpose is to avoid the travelogue genre. But it's more a matter of a spurious seriousness. It's portentous and pretentious to keep saying ""a city,"" and it has to be supported by an equally forceful strangeness in the narrator. Chejfec isn't ""K,"" roaming unnamed cities, and he isn't Levi's protagonist, cataloging imaginary cities. Clearly he is a perfectly ordinary writer, traveling for a literary conference; he needs to get away, so he goes out wandering. An interview that came with the book confirms this; Chejfec tried to obscure it by writing a nameless, placeless prose. But he, and his narrator, aren't as absent-minded, or as transcendently indifferent, as they want us to think. All sorts of clues show this. He says he's excellent at map reading, but when the book opens he's lost. That seems inadequately imagined, by which I mean the implied author is clearly good at maps, and hasn't convinced me his narrator isn't. He also adds ""map reading is one of my few skills"": that's one of many disavowals of skill and knowledge that are meant to establish the narrator as a slightly abstracted personality, but which read, to me, as entirely gratuitous assertions of a degree of detachment that the writer himself doesn't possess. In another passage, he observes some people either playing cards or dice. We're told he can't tell which. The idea is that the narrator is slightly disengaged and has indifferent skills at observation. But it comes across as unbelievable: it doesn't seem plausible that a man in a park -- a writer! -- whose entire business is recording his thoughts about what he sees, cannot tell which game the people are playing. It's not that the book needs to be the ordinary realist memoir; I would have loved it if Chejfec were a second Pessoa. It's that the narrator's voice is a pose. The narrator's observations are also not interesting, except in one or two cases: there's a fairly good but brief passage on looking at animals; another on William Kentridge's depiction of people seeing. Again it would be fine if the entire book were full of average, disconnected, stray thoughts about things, at the level of reverie appropriate to a city park: but it appears in some passages Chejfec thinks he's being insightful, but he isn't: he isn't Musil, or Canetti, or Benjamin. He is more like his narrator than he would like to think, but not enough like his narrator to make the book convincing.Vila-Matas's unawareness of this is perplexing. I would have thought he would pick up on the book's artificiality: but the artifice of writerly writing about writing is something he also loves.

The difference is not made into a theme, either in the text (which doesn't acknowledge the viewpoint of the photos), or in the photos (which shift without rhyme or reason from telephoto to close-up). It makes images seem weak: it appears it's not right to request too much of them. I think the opposite.(Update: in 2012 I talked to Davis, and she read this note; she said the images were true to the way she'd observed them. We talked in her house, looking at the cows in question. I don't doubt what she said, but I wonder about how precision is to be understood when it varies so widely from text to images.

Perec's project is to describe the ""infraordinary"": everything about this square in Paris that is not recorded in the history and tourism books, and, by implication, in novels. He spends a lot of his weekend noting what people are eating or carrying, and he spends a lot of the first day noting when different buses go by. But even the first two pages are dense with implied narratives, and it is those narratives that give the project interest, not the lists of ""infraordinary"" events.Each session begins with a header, labeled DATE, TIME, LOCATION, and WEATHER, emulating the news, and announcing a deadpan and perhaps objective or neutral standpoint. The opening paragraphs of the opening session list letters of the alphabet that he can see from where he's sitting. It's an interesing beginning, hinting the ""attempt"" might be an overgrown children's game. But by the bottom of the first page—six short paragraphs from the beginning—he writes:""Ground: packed gravel and sand.""This is a deviation from his letter-and-number game, and an indication that his ""attempts"" will include subjects that will fail, since he won't inventory every pebble or brick. The next paragraphs (p. 6) can also be read as announcements of the limits of his project:""Stone: the curbs, a fountain, a chuch, buildings...AsphaltTrees (leafy, many yellowing)""These are indications of refusals: the Flaubert of ""Madame Bovary,"" for example, might have written at length on each. Then, two more paragraphs down:""Vehicles (their inventory remains to be made)""This is self-reflexive, a note on what the writer might intend to go on and accomplish. Then (the next paragraph):""Human beings""Now the voice is ironic. In the space of one and a half very short pages, the voice has moved from rule-bound (listing letters and numbers), to obstinate (refusing, by implication, the project of naturalistic description), self-reflexive, and ironic. Then comes a heading:""TrajectoriesThe 96 goes to Montparnasse stationThe 84 goes to Porte de ChamperretThe 70 goes to Place du Dr Hayen...""This is different again: this time the writer is searching for new games. All these shifts in just the first two pages. In the following two, the voice and intention changes again several times. There is found poetry, hopeless inventorying, compulsive listing, abandoned lists, vignettes from imaginary novels, and touches of surrealism. All this has to raise the question of whether there is a larger plan, a game that comprehends these partial games.""An Attempt"" is interesting mainly for the writer's restless and continuously renewed interest in different kinds of non-literary voices, not for the ""attempt to describe"" or for any notion of the ""infraordinary""—and certainly not for the ""unoriginal"" or ""inexpressive"" qualities more recent writers ascribe to Oulipo and related ""constrained"" writing. There's not much ""constrained"" about this, except his self-imposed unmoving vantage point. The very project of the ""infraordinary"" is entirely soaked in the mixtures of writing projects that are floating and assembling in the writer's mind. Writing is the subject, not the place. If Perec has an interest in exhaustion it's not the sort that results from listing items despite their endlessly ""inexpressive"" nature: rather it's the exhaustion of his inventory of possible topics for lists (regardless of whether the lists have pages of entries, or none at all), and even there he fails to finish, because it's easy to think of other things that might be listed.

I read this edition just for her translation, to see if she could help me understand more about Flaubert's claim that writing, and not plot, was all that mattered in ""Madame Bovary.""Flaubert's sense of what counts as ambitious writing -- his meticulous prose, where every sentence displays the work it took to make it, where each adjective is the only possible choice, and never hides its perfection as simple inspiration -- has hypertrophied in contemporary fiction into hyper-realism or else atrophied into rote description. He had a constant deliberate sense of responsibility to mimesis, which gives the book an unremitting, pressurized attachment to what he considered as real life. His laborious search for the right word or image sometimes makes him perfunctory and mechanical, like the pharmacist Homais, a parallel Flaubert seems not to have noticed. (He enjoyed the character, so presumably he saw parts of himself in Homais, but there is no sign that he saw his own daily struggles for the perfect word as anything like Homais's grandiloquent misuses of language.) The constant ferocious search for the perfect word, the dogged myopic search for the perfect image, the oppressive sense of the pages he discarded, registers as a dull humming in my ears as I read. For me, that is not a road that can lead to the kind of realism that might provoke me to suspend disbelief, and yet, because Flaubert's sense of the world of plausible French provincials guided his searches, he needed a minimal narrative scaffolding, and so I can understand why he needed to say that writing, and not plot, is what is at issue.What's jarring about the book is the recurring dissonance between word choices that I recognize as Davis's, and ones that transfer Flaubert's choices into the English that necessarily forms the background and most of the substance of any given page. Davis has a different sense of precision than Flaubert. Hers is microscopic, and works at the level of the line or the sentence, like her abbreviated fictions. His is more often a question of narrative, scene, and mood, things that work on a larger scale or depend on criteria of coherence as much as concision. I read this translation as an example of the anxiety of influence: the writer Davis struggles with the writer Flaubert by getting as close to him as posssible. Instead of writing about him (or rather, instead of only writing about him), she chooses to translate him. Her word choices are icy, sharp, clear, clean, like cuts. His, when they can still be heard in the text, are broader, wider, to do with scene, passage, place, and time. She is magnificent, but so is he, and they are a quarter-tone off from each other. The dissonance cannot be resolved, and the result is a mixture of pleasure and unpleasant reverberations.But at least now, thanks to Davis's translation, I have a clearer sense of Flaubert's writing, and I can see enough of it to know it is not a model for the contemporary novel. It does not correspond to any viable contemporary sense of realism, the reality effect, autofiction, mimesis, or descriptive skill. His novel is nearly sunk in history, and one of the only part above ground is the extremely sharp point of his skill with words.Postscript, on the genders and charactersThen of course there's the story. Contemporary readers still admire Flaubert's capacity to despise so much of bourgeois life, and to write with such sarcasm (""irony"" is the word Davis prefers in her introduction). But he doesn't despise everyone equally. The book is deeply sexist, for example. Emma notoriously ignores her daughter, and so does Flaubert. Emma famously fails to appreciate her husband, but Flaubert doesn't have anything very bad to say about him: he's almost as innocent and unformed as a child. Those things are increasingly intolerable, not in themselves but in the author's obliviousness of them....more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7945374-madame-bovary

There can't be many authors who have looked at themselves from inside such a cocoon of self-praise. ""No one before me, and in this language, has written as I write, as I dare to write, as it is my pleasure and my plenitude...

Of course it's understandable that someone praised by ""Michel Leiris, Roland Barthes and Philippe Sollers... Michel Foucault...

But it's also necessary to note that radically explicit homoerotic prose and an incarceration in Algeria were practically passports for praise in the minds of mid-twentieth century French writers.Aside from those hyperbolic moments of self-praise, what is there? A warm and affecting love for nearly everything; and many echoes of Lautréamont, Rimbaud, Genet, and Céline. The book doesn't actually describe the author's coma until ten pages from the end, and it says remarkably little that might help us understand his descent into the coma. There's a lot of talk about his addiction to an over-the-counter painkiller, and many mentions of his dwindling weight. But his sexual encounters are described so coyly that they're actually puzzling. (Why did he have to leave Orléans, exactly? And why don't we get to hear the reason, given that Guyotat is so famous for writing explicitly?) And the book has next to no direction: there is no sense, as the book goes on, of any reason why he should be declining so drastically.These are reasons why it is important, even for important writers, not to love yourself too much....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7583006-coma

It's about a woman who nurses her husband, who is in a coma. He won't wake up, and that drives her to speak more and more candidly about her life. She reveals an entire dictionary of the mistreatment of women by Afghan men. In the course of the book she is also threatened with rape; she masturbates in front of him; she describes how she made her menstrual blood apear to be the blood from her hymen; she recounts the times she was beaten; she reveals he wouldn't let her kiss him; and in the end she talks about his infertility. The book isn't appalling because of any of that. It's awful because it uses the medium of literature to tell those stories. People apparently read Rahimi to know about the situation of Afghan women. One er on the back cover says ""we know so little about the day-to-day life of people in Afghanistan."" But this isn't what literature should be. What kind of reader feels she needs to get her news about Afghanistan from novels and plays? What sense of literature do such readers have? Then there's the question of the literary form. ""The Patience Stone"" is written as a stage play: it calls out, on every page, to the potential director or playwright, giving instructions. Everything takes place in one room. All sorts of artifices are arranged so that the action never needs to leave the room. Footsteps are heard dying away and approaching. A gun barrel comes through a window. A tank, offstage, shatters a window. What does any of that stage machinery have to do with the situation of women in Afghanistan? One er on Amazon says the author ""keeps the props simple"": they're minimal, but unremitting, and all of them are clichés. The idea of the man who never moves, and the woman who soliloquizes, owes something to Beckett, but it owes nothing to any play written more recently than 1950. The staginess of ""The Patience Stone"" would be awkward and intrusive even if it didn't have to do with truths about Afghanistan. Staginess also explains some of the infelicities in the narration (this despite the fact that a number of ers think it is beautifully written). One er on Amazon notes that ""Rahimi uses a third-person point of view to keep us out of the protagonist's head and make her revelations to her husband more powerful (I think this was a smart decision). But in several passages, the narrator tries to intrude on her thoughts by interpreting her actions for the reader."" That's a good example of the sort of artificial construction that Rahimi needed in order to sustain his implausible premise -- that the woman tells all her stories to the man, whom she thinks isn't listening. It's hard for me to imagine Rahimi's reasons for setting this entire novel as a one-scene play, especially given that he's working on a film adaptation. I can only think that he understands minimalist or absurdist theater as a kind of optimal expressive vehicle. But how could that be an adequate understanding of theater?This book is an excellent example of the misuse of literature for the purpose of revealing truths about the world.

It is enteFiction Within the Imagination of HollywoodThis novel is so much better than ""The Keep"" that it seems to have been written by someone else. It is entertaining and sometimes funny, but also superficial and obtrusively intricately constructed. Like ""The Keep,"" this novel is full of stock Hollywood scenes. It is as if Egan's imagination is bounded by Hollywood's. Everything takes places somewhere inside Hollywood, and nothing stands out as a thing that happens only in novels and not in films made from them. There is a safari, a deathbed scene with a millionaire and two women by a pool, and an unnamed tropical Third-world city draped with colorful laundry, ""fragrant nuts and fake-leather purses."" It's not that these are reminiscent of individual movies, it's that her imagination seems to move within things we've seen in the movies.The emotional charges in this novel are often intense but also confined to the familiar novelists' and short-story writer's devices of sudden insight, epiphany, unexpected recurrence, apparently careless revelation, apparently chance mention. There is little psychological depth. As a consequence it's the novel's structure that becomes its most prominent feature. There are two aspects to this: the uncritical reliance on commonplace writer's devices, and the book's unusual narrative complications.1. Commonplace devices. The infidelity in Chapter 7, for example, is set up subtly, but that's the problem. The clues were there, so that when it's revealed it quickly comes to seem inevitable. This is supposed to seem realistic, because half-noticed events all become clues in retrospect. But how tedious to be shown this machinery of writerly deception.The book is full of bright, micro-managed explosions of sentiment. In Chapter 8, Dolly's daughter Lulu says, ""Mom, you have to try this,"" offering her mother a star fruit. (The star fruit is part of the rote exoticism of the tropical country the unnamed General commands: another Hollywood cliche.) Her mother is moved, and we don't know why, until she herself realizes that her estranged daughter hadn't used the word ""mom"" for some time. As readers, we're meant to do the same double-take, and feel the same pleasure and surprise. But it's a setup, so there is no pleasure in it.At the end of Chapter 7, when Stephanie realizes her husband is unfaithful, she goes over to a fence at the end of her yard, where we have heard a nutty neighbor lurks. The neighbor had only been mentioned in passing, so it is a surprise that Stephanie more or less seeks her out -- but only a slight surprise, because the short-story form is built on this sort of supposedly unanticipated recurrence. Egan's book is full of these short-story style endings. If a crazy neighbor is mentioned in passing, she'll be brought back ""unexpectedly"" at the end of the chapter--but not in such a way as to to tie things up, because that would be too obvious, too unevocative. She'll be brought in to create a suspension, an open-endedness, a note of irresolution that is meant to be expressive or poetic.2. Narrative complications. The book is filled with cross-references, which function at first to increase the realism, the texture, of the book, but become increasingly distracting as the reader sees that every detail mentioned in passing may reappear in other chapters and therefore needs to be carefully noted and memorized.""Kitty's real fame had come years later,"" we're told in Chapter 8, and the narrator then gives us some names, which take us out of the immediate setting of the story. Faced with this interpolated interruption, the reader has several choices: (1) read the book as if it were a murder mystery or a popular thriller with many threads, and relish the intellectual exercise; (2) read through the cross-references, not trying to remember them, taking them as part of the ""reality effect""; (3) read them as signs of the author's skill, knowing they are part of an intricate design. I am not interested in murder mysteries, and I do not read mainly for diversion, so I take no particular pleasure in intricate plots. But I also want to care as much about the construction of the book as the author, so I try not to read more loosely than the author wrote, as in (2). That leaves (3). But why should I want to read advertisements of the author's skill? What does skill express? Under what circumstances should this sort of skill be displayed for the reader to appreciate? Egan experiments with styles. One chapter is in second-person narration; another uses texting conventions; a third has footnotes. After writers like David Foster Wallace and William Vollmann, this kind of thing has to be done brilliantly. But here it is just normatively skillful. A footnote on entanglement in quantum physics is, I think, an inept imitation of Wallace, in that it's poor, unpoetic physics. It's clear Egan doesn't realize this.Chapter 10 is a good attempt at a modernist narrative experiment, using second-person narration as in Faulkner and others to invoke a person alienated from himself. But it is insistently artificial, tenuous, and continuously partly unconvincing, especially since the story it supports is traditional, naturalistic, immersive, and romantic.The book is diverting but superficial. It relies on readers for whom the principal point of reading is puzzle-solving, for whom displays of ingenuity are sufficient reasons to read, for whom emotion is best delivered in intense contained bursts that leave the surrounding story free for easier pleasures, and for whom characters have articulate and well-controlled senses of their inner lives and are therefore never threatened by deeper doubts, what Antonio Lobo Antunes called the knowledge of hell....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7331435-a-visit-from-the-goon-squad

He's very uneven, but at his best, he has occasionally been the world's best writer. He can outpace conventional narration, magic realism, surrealism, absurdism, and philosophic fiction.This time I'll zero in on just one quality of his imagination that sets him apart from most other authors. This book begins with a short chapter describing how the author, a certain César, famous writer and ""mad scientist,"" discovers the secret of the ""Macuto Line,"" a mysterious braided cord on the coast of Venezuela. The Macuto Line, César says, was one of the world's wonders. It had been constructed by pirates to hide their treasure, but no one had succeeded in figuring out how to retrieve the treasure, which was somehow buried, at the end of the line, under water. César protests that he is not a universal genius, that there is no such thing as universal genius. But he has a particular combination of talents and weaknesses. He spends a couple of pages describing his theory of unique but unexceptional talents. He proposes a thought experiment: think of any three books you've read. There may be hundreds of other people in the world who have read those same books. Now add a book, and only a few people will have read those same four books. Add one or two more, and you will be the only one in the world who has read that particular combination of books. You aren't a genius for having done so, but you have skills and qualities of attention no one else has. Using this individual combination, César does something simple to the braided Macuto Line, and the treasure chest bursts out of its underwater cave and falls at his feet.Now here's what's different about Aira: almost any other author would have made that an emblem, a theme, a leitmotif, a central subject. But ""The Literary Conference"" never returns to the subject, draws any conclusions from it, or proposes it as a key to César's character. The Macuto Line is actually more or less forgotten. It doesn't even function as an introduction to the logic or narrative of the book, but at the same time it isn't an absurdist episode that is meant to be read allegorically as a sign of the illogic of life. Nor is it a surrealist or magic realist moment that is intended to evoke the world's absurdity or mystery. (In other books, Aira does fall into the clichés of magic realism, with its assumption or hope that every surrealist juxtaposition or moment of illogic is in itself meaningful, poetic, or profound.)The Macuto Line is simply the reason the narrator is rich, and even that doesn't matter much for the novel. There is something extremely peculiar about Aira's way of imagining fiction. The Macuto Line, and other things that happen in this book, are nominally in the magic realist tradition, but only in a superficial sense because they don't reveal any unconscious ideas (as in surrealism) or hidden natural sublime poetry (as in magic realism). The abstract meditations Aira uses to introduce things like the Macuto Line are nominally examples of philosophic fiction, but he has no philosophic arguments to make, only stories to tell. It's not that he doesn't care about literary precedents, possibilities, and expectations, but that his imagination is apparently either entirely impossible to control--or he would like to avoid controlling it as much as possible. Aira can be absolutely wonderful. It would be wonderful to have a guide to his work, because so much is untranslated, and because his method creates enormous variations in quality....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7444221-the-literary-conference

If I ignore that fact that Time magazine said Franzen is ""The novelist for our times,"" and imagine I have discovered his book in a used bookstore, what do I find?First, as in ""The Twenty-Seventh City,"" his imagination is entirely swept up in making portraits of social classes, neighborhoods, civics, types, social structures, and upper-middle class aspirations. For me, the difficulty is that I don't read in order to see ""my time"" mirrored in a book (thinking here of Mailer's ""The Time of My Time""). I have a minimal interest in reading depictions of my generation, class, or region, and I do not try to find those things in novels. When he writes about people's private lives, he is interested in marriage, children, inheritance, patrimony, succession, mobility -- things that impinge on the bourgeois life. (And even if you read this book as a barometer or mirror of our time, there's a problem: Franzen can't find anything nice to say about the conservatives in his novel, and he can't find anything wrong with the liberals except their guilt. He repeats his one insight about liberal guilt about five times in the novel, without realizing that a reader might expect him to develop it.)Second, his prose is serviceable, dependable, unremarkable. His writer's voice is strangely smooth, easily eloquent, polished, like an experienced liberal politician. The writing is unremittingly bland, accomplished but not interesting. Every four or five pages he inserts a striking metaphor or a bit of naturalistic description, almost as if it's an expected ornament in a novel. The etiquette of his writing in this regard makes me a bit queasy: it's well-behaved, silver-spoonish, empty and proper and far from awkwardness, experiment, or embarrassment.And what, in the end, drives this impeccably well-behaved prose? Given his chosen subject matter, I can't help but see it as aspirational: it announces its author's suitability for the next higher social class. I think Bellow, Updike, and Roth would have despised Franzen. Where is the shudder of insecurity or the sickening weirdness of adolescence that Wallace knew so well? Where is the personal risk that Vollmann's so good at? Where is the writing? How many interesting, quotable sentences are there in this book?At the same time I read this, I read Thomas Bernhard's ""The Lime Works."" The first sentence of that book is a bizarre. The sentence is a masterpiece, so much richer, better written, better imagined, than anything in this massive anodyne harmless lesson in the blandness of Franzen's White educated liberal American twenty-first century....more",Notes are private!,0,30,1,not set,"May 14, 2016","Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/8332846-freedom

As a photographer, Goldblatt isn�t remarkable. It�s possible to see all the influences of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s in his work. But as a document of places, times, and people, his work is wonderful. Much the same cold be said of Vladislavic's novel: both the novel and the photographs work, in the end, more as documentation than as interesting fiction or photography. [return][return](Parenthetically: the leve of photography criticism that supports practices like Goldblatt�s is evident in the novellas, where Vladislavic�s narrators wonder about such things as intuition, the perfect moment, and the practiced eye: all tropes from the 1940s and 1950s, all entertained without mention of photographers, theorists, or historians outside South Africa.)...more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7688206-tj--johannesburg-photographs-1948-2010-double-negative

In this case I stopped reading on page 78 out of 254. The principal character is strangely bereft when someone steals her collection of sea shells. We're supposed to wonder why, and we're told people think she's ""heartless."" But nothing develops. In place of insight into her character, we get her own unrevealing descriptions of the shells, and then -- suddenly, incongruously -- she says:""I do not see myself as heartless. I have a particularly heavy and sorrowful heart: dark, heavy, and saturated with blood. A hairy sack, like the sun in Revelations."" (p. 63)It's a typical writer's fault to tell us something that we should be given to understand through narrative. The book is full of these basic infelicities.This passage is also out of tune with the straightforward, often rote nature of most of the writing (as far as it's visible in translation from Afrikaans). Up to page 78, there is only one other comparable passage, and it's on the very next page: a gruesome and memorable description of the ugly body of one of the narrator's lovers. The rest is pale prose. It seems Winterbach had an especially inspired afternoon at the computer, but she didn't notice the incongruity or the relative lack of inspiration in other passages, and that insensitivity -- or rather, the sense I am compelled to imagine she had that these passages could fit with the rest of the book -- are irremediable flaws in the flow of the narrative and in the confidence readers can place in the writer.Other infelicities and writer's errors: the chapters tend to begin with lists of obscure Afrikaans words (the narrator works as a lexicographer). As far as it's possible to guess in the translation (the book would necessarily read entirely differently in Afrikaans, because some terms would not be given definitions, but others would), Winterbach thinks that lists of words have a cumulative expressive effect. They don't: they're often fascinating, but that's not writing.On p. 56, the narrator is driving home, and asks her friend to tell her stories while she drives. After some conversation, the friend speaks while she's driving. Winterbach notes, in the narrator's voice, ""We are taking turns to drive."" It's easy to see what's happened here: Winterbach has set up the scene in her mind with the narrator driving; she's shifted without noticing, so she explains the shift with this aside. But it's bad writing: she should have described the moment the two stopped the car and traded places, or else she should have fixed the passage so the narrator is still driving. It's a small point, but a characteristic one: Winterbach doesn't seem to notice that an aside like ""We are taking turns to drive"" is an enormous distraction, because it reminds readers that the writer isn't managing things.Along with this sort of evidence of lack of skill, and lack of awareness of how characters develop in fiction, there is also a lack of ambition. The narrator gives the Latin names of the shells she's lost, but only glosses them with brief, half-imagined descriptions. Any number of authors -- Joyce, Canetti, Nabokov -- have given us apparently technical lists of apparently uninteresting objects, and fleshed them out with so much erudition, unexpected detail, and brilliant description that they have come alive and become capable of carrying all sorts of unexpected meaning. Nothing of the sort happens here: it's half-heartedly erudite, indifferently expressive, disengaged, light, superficial.

This book reminds me of William Newman's remarks in his books on sonatas that a sense of large-scale form is the rarest quality among the 18th and 19th century composers he studied. Schnackenberg's sense of large-scale form is also interesting in itself. It involves partial or literal repetitions of images, lines, and stanzas, the sort of repetition that might once have been called incantatory, except that her sense isn't rhythmic or geometrical or symmetrical in any clear way; it's episodic, and I wonder if its real precedent might not be Whitman. It's the form itself that keeps me reading, even though this book is also a very dramatic and affecting narrative of the death of her partner. He dies in an especially abstract poem, which -- along with passages taken from the Mahabharata -- are a little too Transcendental (again in the New England sense) to work along with the more realist, first-person narratives of the hospital, nurses, and doctors. I wonder if, in another decade, she might produce something that is more purely speculative, stripped both of the mythologizing that has preoccupied her, and also of the vestiges of confessional poetry that are interpolated throughout this book.

After a while, reading the older Merwin, I felt chill, as if I had been walking too long on a foggy seashore. Merwin's later poetry was not just a ""last style"" (a distinction Erwin Panofsky made about Albrecht Duerer, whom Panofsky said simply oscillated between styles), but something different, which clearly presupposed the ""early"" and ""middle"" styles. But it was also a counterexample to Said's praise of canonical late styles in Mann, Beethoven, Genet, Euripides, and others. Merwin's late style was something chill and quiet, not unpleasant, and not narrow, but also no longer responsive to the work and ideas of thirty and forty years before.

OA fitful imaginationIt is easy to agree with Saramango's opinion, quoted on the cover: ""Tavares has no right to be writing so well at the age of 35. One feels like punching him!""Still, there are many faults. Tavares plans very carefully, and he likes to hint at his planning in the novel's structure. But the numbered sections, Roman-numbered chapters, and chapter titles consisting of the names of the characters in each chapter, don't add expressive power or momentum: they read like devices that helped the author organize the author's material, or, worse, signs left in the text to indicate the work that went into it. Many of the numbered sections read like exercises in writing for the theater: they have a dramatis personae, a stage for the action, an unexpected ending. The sections can be more like set pieces than prose poems, more like fragments for a novel than parts of a novel about fragmentation. Tavares's psychological insights also come in bursts: a paragraph, a page, two or three pages at most. They do not always accumulate into the sense that characters are changing. This is not a representation of the world as a fragmented place, and because it isn't, it reads as a limitation of Tavares's imagination. I care for each of the characters in a fitful way: perhaps during an intense or insightful page-long description, and then again, differently, at some later moment in the book. But my care, and my memory of the characters, doesn't grow -- except artificially, when some characters are shown to have suffered in many different ways at different moments in their lives.Tavares has a deficient sense of the relation between fate, evil, and will. The book presents itself as a meditation on those themes, but he seems to think that a series of coincidences, in which characters wander and then meet in unpredictable ways, does the work of philosophic inquiry. Actually it usually means nothing, because he doesn't draws consequences or build on the apparently random meetings. Some are surrealistic (a woman gets the chance to point a gun at the murderer of her child, without knowing who he is), some are fatalistic, others seem to be about the inexorable nature of evil (a theme that one of the characters researches in an inappropriately quantitative manner), and still others are apparently about the world's randomness and the powerlessness of will. But none of the intersections of characters can function to support any of those various perspectives, both because all the implied meanings are mixed in together, and also because Tavares neither develops them nor sets them against one another. He prefers to draw the contrasts and let them imply meaning: a common strategy in literature and the visual arts in the wake of surrealism. What's needed is a position, a theory, a sense of the author's sense of the relation between fate, evil, will, and associated themes: a dose of Canetti, for example.Tavares also has an amazing strength: he can imagine and express the relation between the body and its thoughts more closely than many other novelists. The characters in this novel who have spent time in a mental asylum often remember their experiences in the most unusual ways. One person tries to punch another, but finds he can't:""Ernst's so-called attack was sabotaged not only by his general lack of coordination, but also by what you might call a condition of incompetence... the physical therapy [in the asylum] wasn't focused, naturally, on building strength, since strength is disruptive, but on consistency of pressure, on equilibrium -- his muscles, in fact, had been tamed, made into daydreamers: contemplative, patient. Thus, against his will, if Ernst wanted to grab hold of something, he found it wasn't so easy to let go again, and if he wanted to push something, he didn't press and then release, but kept pushing, regrouping, and then pushing again.""

Intense SentimentalityCouldn't finish this book, so this is only a partial . Atxaga was recommended to me as the best contemporary Basque writer who has been translated into English. (The person who recommended him said Luisa Etxenike is actually the best.) Annie Proulx's endorsement on the back cover kept me going until around page 100: her notion is that the novel ""at first beguiles us with its leisurely flow like a late summer river, but it is a dark river with streaks of blood seeping from the muddy banks of the past."" What stopped me from finishing ""The Accordionist's Son"" was the first part of that sentence. The opening 50 pages are like ""a late summer river,"" but that's to say they are deeply sentimental, treacly, soporific, retrospective, ponderous, steeped in the passage of time, powdered and scented with loss and history, bathed in golden light, muzzily nostalgic. For example there's a brief chapter describing a wondrous cord that the narrator sees as a boy. It's like a rosary, and it has objects tied to it: piece of coal, a piece of burnt wood, and some coins. The narrator describes how, as a boy, the man who made the cord explained it to him: it was a mnemonic for selling insurance. (The burnt wood reminds us that even stable things can go up in smoke, and so forth.) Then, after the salesman made his pitch using the cord as a mnemonic, he gave it to the boy, saying that he'd never need it again because even with its help he was losing his memory; then he got in a car and went back to his home, presumably for ever. That was enough heavy-handed nostalgia for me, but there was more: the narrator then explains that he'd forgotten the cord until he came to write the book, and then he realized he could ""go from subject to subject just as the fingers of the insurance salesman had gone from the piece of coal to the charred wood or the butterflies."" (p. 44)A hundred pages in, blood is seeping, as Proulx says, but it's done in such a gentle, gradual, and grandiose and self-involved way that it made me more nauseous than sympathetic.One last thing: the entire book is founded on a premise that can only be described -- as far as I read -- as a mistake. The book begins slowly, with a framing story. (There's even an ""Internal dedication"" on page 45, when the book finally gets underway.) That in itself was hard to bear, because it's the sign of a much older kind of literature, where the reader's enchantment increases each time the story is reintroduced and reframed. For such readers, stories within stories increase the realism. The notion here is that the writer was the best friend of the author of a memoir, written in Basque. The author of that memoir dies before ""The Accordionist's Son"" opens. The narrator of ""The Accordionist's Son"" takes the memoir written by his friend, and tells his friend's widow that he'll rewrite it, adding a voice the way someone might clarify a carving in a tree by deepening and sharpening its features. From that we understand that the book we're going to read is written twice over, and should have two voices in it. But the opening of the rewritten memoir, which occupies most of ""The Accordionist's Son,"" is about the dead friend's children, and it's written as if the children belong to the friend. But they don't! And the next section is about how the author of the memoir courted his wife. It is written in the dead friend's voice, but we, as readers, know it's actually written, or re-written, by the friend. The effect is bizarre, as if the author of ""The Accordionist's Son"" has stepped into his dead friend's life and is courting his wife. Of course you're not supposed to think of it that way, but if you're paying attention to authorship, you simply have to.Awful book: sentimental, annoying, and hopelessly old-fashioned: these things don't need to go together (there are traditional novels that are cold and precise, like Hardy), but they do here, and so, having failed to conjure the empathy that Proulx apparently felt, I stopped reading....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/7025043-the-accordionist-s-son

In twenty or thirty years' time, it is likely that every major art school and department will offer the PhD. The degree is controversial wherever it exists, and there is a fair amount of resistance to it: there have been some stormy sessions on the subject at conferences.

But it is full of images that sound like Eggers's own. ""The sky was a child's fingerpainting, blue and black hastily mixed."" I read this, and wondered: did Zeitoun tell Eggers that? Perhaps he did, but it seems very unlikely. Perhaps it was prompted: ""What did the sky look like then? What did it remind you of?"" And perhaps it was doctored: maybe Zeitoun said the sky looked like a smeared painting, and Eggers made the tight, MFA-style sentence in the book. There isn't a way to know, and it isn't important for the book's story: but how is it possible to read, with a minimal awareness of authorship, and not stop to wonder about such things? Other sentences are openly Eggers's, such as this one: ""There was only the sound of the city breathing, weary from the fight, grateful it was over."" Or this one: ""They could still see the faint, blurred likeness of a machine, like a relic from a previous civilization."" And so again, I know that I am not supposed to mind, that Eggers is taking me along through the story, that he doesn't disguise the fact that he's a novelist: but how can I read a work of non-fiction when it is peppered with lines that come from a life so different from the lives in the book? To do that I would have to read complacently, dully, as the front-page er in the New York Times Book Review did when he simply praised Eggers's style. No style is simply present, no style can be simply praised, when a book presents itself as non-fiction.Second because the book preaches, edifies, instructs. It tells us how to be liberal, and what the U.S. can be. It's not the liberalism that annoys me. It's the way it is done. When Islam comes up, we get an earnest lecture: ""An Muhammad. She'd been misinformed about Him... An illiterate man, Muhammad was visited by the angel Gabriel (Jibril in Arabic)..."" and so forth. These are supposed to be the thoughts of Kathy, Zeitoun's wife, and it is possible they once were. But Eggers should know that when they're presented this way, they sound like they answer his own desire to tell Americans about Islam. There are a number of passages in which Eggers gives us information (the book ends with pages of acknowledgments), but they seldom sound like things Zeitoun or the other people in the book would have said. Sometimes those informational passages are poetic, as if they were part of the weave of the narrative (p. 119), and other times they seem improbably interpolated even if they weren't. On p. 224, Zeitoun notices a mural with ""Ku Klux Klan hoods, skeletons, harlequins in garish colors"" etc., all while he is in a terrifying outdoor prison: it sounds more like Eggers visited the place afterward and filled in the details. The instructional manual of multicultural, liberal America is grating for three interlocked reasons: first, because it is annoying to be instructed by anyone, for any reason, and that annoyance is especially strong when the instruction is couched as literature; second, because Eggers seems sometimes aware that he needs to tell us things, occasionally aware that he wants or needs to instruct us and can't help himself, but most often unaware that he is preaching at all; and third, because instruction itself, the very idea of instructing, seems very far from the interests of the book's principal character, who is apparently a very centered and unaggressive person, not given to telling people much of anything.What is a nonfiction account that presents itself as a novel? It's an oil and water mixture. Eggers's book is more engaging in places than, say, Roddy Doyle's lovely ""Rory and Ita"" (his illustrated memoir of his parents), because Eggers fuses his sources into a narrative. But in doing so Eggers asks readers to melt their sense of reading, writing, and literature into a formless blob. He needs us to read through his writing to the facts the writing records: but that is a violent, unthinking kind of reading, and if I refuse it, I'm likely to become annoyed. If you weren't annoyed by this book, you weren't reading it as writing: you were reading it as reportage....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6512154-zeitoun

At that time de la Pava's only book was ""Naked Singularity,"" and it was not well known. It's famous now for having been self-published after 88 agents rejected the proposal; after it was published by University of Chicago Press (thanks, I think, in large measure to Kristy McGuire), it got more attention; in 2015 or so I found a copy, published by an English press, in a bookstore in a small town in Ireland, in with a small fiction selection that also included Melville, Austen, and others. Most North American readers probably discovered de la Pava in a  of his third novel, ""Lost Empress,"" in ""The New Yorker,"" May 7, 2018. More on that at the end of this .*""Naked singularity"" is a dense, 689-page self-published novel with no endorsements and, as far as I can see, only three s on the internet.A tremendously perplexing novel. The first four hundred pages are more or less out to match ""Infinite Jest."" They are written at a pitch of cleverness and complexity, with asides, chapter-long irrelevant distractions (sometimes insouciantly declared, by the author, as irrelevant), philosophical interruptions, and compulsively micromanaged descriptions, all in the service, apparently, of a vast and continuously enlarging cast of characters and situations that can just barely be remembered by the ideal assiduous reader. This is done with the help of sharply written courtroom slang, strongly reminiscent of, and probably competitive with, ""The Wire"" or Richard Price specifically.A reader who stops after four hundred pages might do so because she is exhausted by the prospect of another David Foster Wallace, even if that prospect is spiced by bleeding-edge contemporary urban conversation, larded with solecisms, misspellings, travesties against grammar, and ""em"" and ""ums"" and ""...""s. (That is: ellipses marking where the interlocutor doesn't speak: an invention, I think, of DWF's.)In next hundred pages things tighten up, and a reader will realize that there is a single plot after all, and that the novel is in fact driven by this plot in a way that DFW would have experienced as dangerously non-fractal. At that point--somewhere in those roughly one hundred pages--my interest peaked, because then I thought de La Pava was trying to pull off a new hybrid form of fiction, mingling the overspilling and intentionally excessive maximalist plays with language with the plot-driven intricacies of, say, ""Law and Order."" But I became perplexed when I saw that despite De La Pava's characters' unremitting, hypertrophied self-awareness, which involves mandatory long chapters discussing fate, causality, and freedom, with examples drawn from Wittgenstein, Hume, and other staples of the undergraduate college curriculum, he (the author) was entirely unaware that a large part of the appeal of his book would, in fact, be the suspense generated not by the turn to a ""policier"" plot, but by the possibility that he might pull off this new fusion of genres. He seems to have written the book in the grip of the commonplace feverish admiration and ambition generated by DFW and publications like McSweeny's, and he seems to have thought he could profitably and unproblematically use those fictional techniques to write a truly great crime story. But that, to me, is a misunderstanding of the stakes of the entire DFW project, and the author's obliviousness to those stakes made me rethink the reasons for his attachment to perfectly pitched, hyper-eloquent minimalist dialogue and madly overstuffed maximalist description. The last two hundred pages plunge into crime and courtroom drama. There are three concurrent plots: the narrator, a public defender, is under investigation; he has participated in a robbery; and he is trying to get a stay of execution for a death row inmate. Each of these is treated with a maximum of drama. When the narrator talks to his death row client, the prose is suddenly, frighteningly maudlin, Oprah style, including a tearful scene in the jail. (""Your eyes are funny now,"" the simple-minded inmate says to the narrator, implying that the narrator, and potentially also his readers, have been crying listening to the inmate's pathetic story; p. 491.) Then, when the narrator robs some drug dealers, the scene is edge-of-your seat exciting for a good thirty pages (starting abruptly on p. 516). That kind of writing has absolutely nothing in common with the prose experiments of the preceding four hundred pages, and the fact that the author does not notice the nature of that mismatch--he certainly understands that there is a mismatch, but not what it means in terms of the self-understanding of genres and writing projects--made me intensely disappointed.So: given that the novel is a hybrid, in the pejorative sense of that word, meaning that it is an attempt at mixture where mixing remains the principal issue, what can be said about the writing itself? When the narrator and his legal colleagues talk, their speech is relentless in its cleverness, and when the perps talk, their speech is consistently surprisingly realistic and entertaining. Blending those two modes is a real accomplishment. But when the educated characters and think or speak, then it's DFW territory, and that part is problematic. There is a line to be drawn between writing that is tortured in order to be expressive, and writing that is tortured because the author is a compulsive torturer of language. Here are some lines I experience as compulsive, non-expressive cleverness. They might redouble my admiration for the author, but they don't mix in interesting or expressive ways with the scenes, the characters, or the story.1. From the recounting of a corner store robbery caught on videotape. Two men, Rane and Cruz, have been stalking the store. ""Now Rane signals Cruz with his chin and they rhyme toward the counter, and the near-future decedent."" (p. 77) ""Rhyming"" to the counter is clever and visually effective, but ""the near-future decedent"" is a needless complication of ""the man they were about to kill,"" intended, presumably, to keep us in mind of the legalistic context, and to foreshadow the mangled language that will be used at the trial. But here it's too much (spending so much time with the book makes me wonder if the author would prefer ""supernumerary""). It's distracting because it points for the hundredth or thousandth time back to the author's wit.2. ""I recently began my thirtieth ellipse around our sun, an anniversary that as you can imagine barks louder than the usual ones."" (p. 95) Again, ""my thirtieth ellipse"" is clever, and expresses the speaker's resistance to acknowledging his age too directly; but ""barks"" distracts by bringing me back to the author and his wit.Overall, too much of the writing is of this sort. Sentence sparkle is not the unproblematic virtue the author hopes it appears to be: it's a symptom, a sign of anxiety about straightforwardness, a sort of fear of the plain style, a tic, a compulsive complication with a life and logic of its own. In ""A Naked Singularity"" wit is intense: not so much intensely expressive as intensely compulsive. The issue is whether that compulsion is experienced as such by the author, thematized, explained by context and purpose, pondered, used for expressive purpose--or simply expressed the way a patient expresses a sign of illness. Wit, as DFW realized very deeply, sincerely, and ineffectually, is a problem as well as an accomplishment.*That's the  I wrote in 2011. The main point wasn't that de la Pava didn't take on board DFW's anxiety about the overwrought qualities of his own prose--a concern that became clear with ""The Pale King""--it was that the detective-story plot didn't mix with the maximalist prose. And that was mainly because it was not thematized in the novel itself: nothing in ""A Naked Singularity"" explains or explores why the intricate legal plot needs its verbal fizz, or whether that style has a function beyond its compulsive drive to razor-wire sharpness. Now, nearly eight years later, it seems that the readers who like de la Pava enjoy him precisely because he mixes maximalist prose with real-world plots. Here is Jonathan Dee, in ""The New Yorker,"" praising de la Pava's third book, ""Lost Empress"": ""There are, to be sure, trace elements in 'Lost Empress' of David Foster Wallace and William Gaddis and other postmodern giants. What's unusual--electrifyingly so--is to see this kind of polyphonic, self-conscious literary performance and all-stops-pulled-out postmodernist production value brought to bear on upperclass lives, and on questions of social justice...."" (p. 71).It's ""electrifying"" for a hundred pages, but the shock wears off, because it's meaningless....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/7163933-a-naked-singularity

The idea is to ""deconstruct"" the genre of the Western by describing many things other than the action. In chapter 1, the narrator seems to be distracted by ants crawling under the hero's boot. ""Western"" is a sort of anti-Elmore Leonard, or a mash-up of Leonard and Robbe-Grillet.The lack of risk and passion appears in many forms, and in the end it erased my interest. Chapter 2 opens with what I take to be an echo of Robbe-Grillet's opening of ""The Voyeur"": a minute description of sunrise on a porch. But that echo made me wonder what Montalbetti was doing. Her description is less precise than Robbe-Grillet's, less of an interruption, less fanatically myopic, less of a radical gesture. So why do it? Later in the book there are episodes of compulsively detailed, apparently irrelevant description that may remind English-language readers of Nicholson Baker or David Foster Wallace. But Montalbetti's asides are not as detailed, and they're botanically, neurobiologically, geologically, architecturally, and entomologically less precise. They are, in fact, full of signs that she hasn't mastered the technical disciplines she is playing at. So again, I wonder why: it is an intentionally less than exhaustive encyclopedism? A softer Oulipo? A less avant-garde nouveau roman? Why not write with microscopic precision and inexhaustible tolerance for irrelevance?There are good passages in the book -- I especially enjoyed one that follows the labors of a single word in a man's mind as it tries to persuade its lazy companions to join into a sentence and actually be spoken into the world. I also liked the inevitable moment when Montalbetti inserts herself into the narrative -- that was well done precisely because it was inconclusive and purposeless. And I liked the conceit that we, the readers, are walking along with her, the narrator, as invisible companions to the cowboys. But that particular innovation is also affectless, safe, disengaged, academic. I wouldn't mind a studied absence of affect, but I felt Montalbetti simply lacks affect. For an uncontrolled, conceptual, experimental novel, this one is remarkably far from any real risk.*Some notes about the translation.Once the book gets underway, the reader knows what to expect from the translator. But this is one of those books where tone, at the outset, is crucial, and there are some infelicities in the first two pages that upset my sense of what the narrator was doing. In paragraph 1, there's a comparison between the runners in a rocking chair and ""some scarcely populated jaw."" Surely that's the wrong word: it should be ""sparsely."" But if there is even a chance that the translator was trying to match an unusual word, she should have either signaled that or used the common word. This sort of thing matters in the beginning of a book because it signals whether or not an author is playing with language. Here it isn't clear.The second paragraph has the first sign of the narrator's offhanded tone: ""Pushing down on the boot that rests on the horizontal rail built onto the front of the porch, well, it acts like a piston.""That ""well"" is our first indication that the author is going to adopt an informal tone, involving changes of mind and apparently impromptu digressions. But the ""well"" isn't quite ordinary North American usage. It reads slightly awkwardly. And did the original also sound ambiguously awkward? That isn't clear.There are a half-dozen more of these imprecisely calibrated usages in the first two pages.

And then it seems Saeterbakken is more indebted to Thomas Bernhard, because of the vitriol, the petty paranoia, the hatred and spite, the disgust that pours from the old man's imagination like one of his many pustulent infestations, imagined intestinal worms, scabs, psoriasis, boils, blackheads, pellet-like shit, or powerful farts.But Saeterbakken has an imagination of his own, and it comes out in an amazing continuous invention of his characters' inner lives. The man's wife is an excellent study in emotional paralysis. I can imagine the Joyce of 'The Dubliners' enjoying the way she passively and inaccurately mulls over the many things she hasn't quite said or understood. The man himself is not just desperate or angry, because in the past he was a compulsively accurate record-keeper, and that compulsiveness has an unresolved relation to his current intermittent dementia. The usual way novelists balance irascible senility is with moments of sentiment and lucidity; those do occur here, but they don't do much work. What matters instead is the puzzle of how the middle-aged irritating micromanager chose his muddled but constant wife, and how he then became the old man in the novel.There are a few problems that I would like to assign to Saeterbakken's age: he was only in his thirties when he wrote this. (He died by suicide when he was 46, in 2012.) First, it is often possible to tell when he is recording things he learned in hospitals and old age homes. Sudden precise details from the world of hospitals and critical care facilities take me out of the novel and remind me Saeterbakken must have kept real, or mental, notebooks in preparation for this novel. Second, there are set-piece scenes that a better novelist, like Bernhard, would have washed away in a flood of anger, nihilism, or some other driving concern. One is the first meeting between the man's wife and the superintendent of the building, which reads like a sketch by Ibsen about some claustrophobic and embarrassing domestic life. And third, the relentless inventories of the man's body are clearly intended to shock, but as Roland Barthes knew, shock quickly becomes 'shock,' which in turn becomes irritation. A purer version of this book could have done without them. And fourth, there are attempts at black humor and campy funeral-parlor jokes, like the old man's diet (Orbit chewing gum by the case, Coke, and meatballs): they also go from funny to 'funny' to irritating. Better here to follow Beckett, and let things like food be forgotten. 'Black humor' is a rum category, because it pretends it isn't serious about what it actually most serious, its ambition to be as dark as possible.Those are flaws, because they are less than total blackness, and once blackness appears it wants to be total....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6758247-siamese

(I have not read either book.) From an art historical point of view, Ellis belongs with Koons and Salle: it's all smooth surface and insouciance, and the ""ultra-violence"" (the term from ""A Clockwork Orange"") is just a necessary, inevitable accompaniment of a late capitalist life cleaned of any morality -- not the hidden underbelly of consumerism, but its traditional contrasting twin. [return][return]This book is not shocking at all: its violence isn't shocking, Ellis's insouciance about the violent scenes isn't shocking, the character's coldness and confusion isn't shocking. A sign of how little violence signifies is that the ""Guardian"" critic didn't even mention the descriptions of rape, torture, and snuff films. And so it goes without saying that the slick, cold surface of the characters' emotions and lives (they report they cry the way they report the weather, or what they're wearing) cannot highlight the violence, as ers said it did in ""American Psycho."" I imagine Ellis's books of the 1980s were disturbing only to people for whom bourgeois accounts of bourgeois life are simply, adequately true. To anyone else, they are X-Rays, simple and smooth and portentous black-and-white versions of ordinary fantasies that underly ordinary upper-class first-world consumer-driven late capitalist life.[return][return]This book is apparently, but not quite, about people who occasionally figure out something about their superficiality or disengagement or the superficial psychological problems that drive their behavior. It's not quite about those things because it isn't a reflection on them, but an example of them. The only thing that ripples the still surface of the book is the very occasional stylistic quirk or lapse. Ordinarily Ellis is perfectly fluent, as Koons and Salle aspire to be: but he also has barely audible lapses from perfect flatness: his punctuationless paragraphs sometimes go on too long and end too predictably with surprises; he uses the names of pop songs too often to set moods; he relies a couple of times too many on scenes where characters refuse to tell other characters the whole truth. Those slight slips, residual awkwardnesses, are crucially important, because they show that introspection must be possible, that the author has done it in the past, if only to his writing and not to his characters' lives. That nearly inaudible evidence of the possibility of depth ruins the book. Flat needs to be flat, as ""In Cold Blood"" was perceived to be, as ""Less than Zero"" was perceived to be, as some of Larkin, Kavanagh, and Beckett, and nearly are.

The allusions and citations in this book are sometimes clever but mainly pedestrian. Erudition, even real erudition, never makes a novel, not even for Elias Canetti or Richard Powers, and certainly not for Umberto Eco. There are, I think, two reasons for that:1. One person's erudition is another person's common knowledge. Erudition is relative, and it will disappear entirely as a quality if the reader knows the same material. I've remarked on this in several s; see for example the essay on Christian Bok (that's on writingwithimages.com).2. In fiction, what counts is the work facts do, not their veracity. What is the affect of the knowledge that the narrator or author deploy? What expressive value does it have? Pessl is not a particularly knowledgeable person; she's more a product of her undergraduate university education, swimming in a soup of half-digested half-popular academic knowledge, in the same boat as the author and screenwriter of 'Watchmen.' Without the supposedly clever allusions and tricks, there is only the psychology. At that level, this book doesn't take a single step past high school: the most important thing for its characters, and even for its author, is whether or not they might be accepted into their preferred social groups....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6215960-special-topics-in-calamity-physics

It is longer than 'Infinite Jest' but shorter than 'The Anatomy of Melancholy.'I have two sorts of comments. The first are about Part One, 'Introductions,' which is 182 pages long and divided into 12 chapters. I asked myself, as I read Part One, what reasons I might have to continue on and read the other 12 parts of the book, especially because Part One is nearly the length of a small book, and it reads as a coherent, if not unified summary of the 'Imperial' as a whole.The second set of comments are about what sort of reader Vollmann might have had in mind: who his ideal reader might have been. I don't think he had one, and that's why the book is so good.1After Part One, what motivation would a reader have to go on to the other 12 Parts of the book? Aside, that is, from the motivation they might have if they were treating this like James Mitchener's 'Texas' (which is incidentally 16 pages longer than 'Imperial,' a fact that couldn't have escaped Vollmann)? That motivation would be to learn about the history of Imperial County and its politics, sociology, linguistics, botany, geology, and other statistics, all arranged in a palatable fictionalized form. But I am not that interested in Imperial County (it is, as Vollmann knows so well, not exactly a picturesque or relaxing place), and I doubt that in five or seven hundred more pages I might be convinced that Imperial County is a microcosm of the United States -- especially because Vollmann flirts with that idea and rejects it.Other reasons for reading past Part One? 'Imperial' isn't a novel, and in fact chapter 11 of Part One sets out that argument in a very entertaining fashion, imagining how Flaubert or Steinbeck might have written 'Imperial,' and reminding itself (that is, Vollmann reminds himself) that novels always end up being just what the novelist intended, that they are opportunistically assembled from minor travesties against truth. So if you were to read 'Imperial' in hopes of finding the bleached skeleton of a postmodern 'Moby-Dick' (a comparison Vollmann himself makes, as if just to stave off the inevitable er's remark), you would be reading against the grain. Which is, as Vollmann might say, entirely your business.A third reason to continue reading past Part One: to find out what new form the author is creating. Vollmann is a master of the postmodern game of authorial awareness, forever talking about the book called 'Imperial' that he hopes, hoped, and still might hope to write, and playing themes and variations with irrelevancies, digressions, apostrophes, and inappropriate but irresistible stories. So people who read Vollmann have to be interested in what kind of books he is producing -- or rather, in what ways his books might be unclassifiable, or how interesting that condition might be. I saw 'Imperial' filed in a university bookstore under 'US History,' but in those first 182 pages he tells us a lot about the 'love of his life' and how it felt to break up with her, and he gives us plenty of evidence of his interest in interviewing unreliable, uninformed, atypical people, whose 'testimony' wouldn't make the cut in any normative history text. (He also tells us about interviews with bigots and people who have suffered, and then he's making points, but I find the dull interviews the best: the ones where the 'informant' says he doesn't know, or isn't sure, or doesn't want to talk.) I like this maximalist aesthetic, but it isn't a reason to read the entire book: in fact if that's what had drawn me to Vollmann, I would happily have stopped after Part One because it so clearly frames the form-breaking ambitions of the book and so usefully samples its major voices and styles.But I have a fourth reason to continue reading past Part One, even though it also isn't a reason to continue reading all thirteen Parts. His writing is stupendous. His prose is sharp and parsimonious. The writing continuously refreshes itself, and never, in the first 182 pages, feels like it will need the crutches of statistics or long quotations to make it to the thousand-page mark. He looks and thinks with every line. This is not a reason to read the book in its entirety, because it has nothing to do with criteria of unity or coherence, and it doesn't justify the book's exact length: but it does justify the book's relative length.2 And these are thoughts about Part Eleven, 'Postscripts,' pp. 827-990. This is the second, and last, section of the book I expect to read. I have been wondering -- page by page, while I'm supposed to be paying attention to what he's telling me -- about what he expected his ideal reader to be thinking. And to the extent that I can understand how he imagined that reader, I realize that I won't ever really understand such a person.One thing an ideal reader is clearly not supposed to be thinking is: This is second-rate reporting, so I'll go and read something by a better investigator. In the chapter on the maquiladores, Vollmann fails, again and again, to get any definitive information. He buys a spy camera, and tells us for pages and pages how it doesn't work; in the end he gets videos, but they are too blurry to be of much use, and he can't transfer them to his computer anyway. Over and over, interviews are inconclusive, and the people he talks to are ill-informed. An ideal reader is not meant to think: This isn't necessarily a bigger picture, or a more balanced picture: it's just an incomplete picture. So an ideal reader must be meant to be sensitive to some gathering larger truth, one that is accumulates in narrative asides, in intrusions of expressive writing, in the often unaccountable divisions into chapters and numbered sections. At one point Vollmann writes: 'Like most human records, this account essentially recounts failure.' (p. 905) Well, his ideal reader apparently would take that as poetry, and as an admission of any writer's limitations. But in order for such a reading to happen, it would be important not also to think that things could have been managed better, or that some failures are more partial than others: and how would it be possible not to think along those lines? What notion of maximalist writing can possibly be that capacious, that forgiving? What kind of reader could come across a tightly written story like 'German's Story' (pp. 901-904) and not wonder, in retrospect, about the possibility that there are hundreds of pages of loose, unaffecting, unpersuasive, indulgent maximalist overspill in the pages before it?In short: I'm baffled when I try to picture Vollmann's concept of his ideal reader, but as the book proceeds I can hardly think of anything else. On p. 887, Vollmann writes: 'like many other insane people I long to be considered 'balanced.'' 'Imperial' is balanced, in an obvious and respectable way, because he always tries to present both sides of every issue. But so do most journalists. If I think Vollmann is 'insane,' I don't think it's in the way he apparently intends, which is that he's excessive, obsessive, compulsive, and dedicated without limits. I think he is 'insane' because his enterprise depends on not thinking in any plausible way about any plausibly reflective reader. And that is the best reason of all to keep reading his books, no matter what subjects they're supposedly about....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,not set,"Dec 15, 2016","Oct 09, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5719302-imperial

This book, and this author, are irredeemably poor.

There are some sustained passages in which he is imagining something from one point of view, as one experience -- there's a chapter about a rat, and one about a dead man washed up on a beach -- but he continuously interrupts himself with random notions, names, places, and ideas. He seems to think this is how novels work, and he may also think this is how abnormal mental states feel. It is childish, in the bad sense of that word.And the Nobel Prize: clearly, it is evidence that for some people, this kind of scattered, adventitious, random, opportunistic bricolage is an adequate representation of states of consciousness.

Phillip Lopate's ""Art of the Personal Essay"" is almost the only one in English. The problem here is not the selection, but the author's lack of a theoretical and historical perspective. The lack of theory shows in the editor's sometimes random comments on what might count as an essay; and the lack of history shows in his occasional obliviousness to the history of his own taste, his own position as the product of late twentieth-century North American liberal arts education. Ten examples:1. Kenko's ""Essays in Idleness"" is presented as an example of ""associative and irregular"" writing, without any mention of its reception history in Japan (where it is not famous for those properties, which are given to other texts), or its troubled presentation of gender roles.2. Petrarch's account of his walk up Mt. Ventou is marred by the author's own translation, which owes more to ""McSweeney's"" than to the fourteenth century (Petrarch says, ""I was seized by a desire to go for it. To climb."" What sense of Petrarch is enriched by that colloquialism? What supposed stuffiness is aired out?).3. Bernardino de Sahaguin's dictionary is excerpted, creating a false and fortuitous sense of poetry. The dictionary was not meant to be expressive, of course; d'Agata's use of it descends from surrealism, and it would have been good to acknowledge that. 4. Francis Bacon is used to introduce the idea that an aphorism can be ""very like a thesis"": but why use Bacon to make this point? Why not theorize on aphorisms (since Bacon's theses are not aphorisms)? Why not use Rochefoucauld? If scholastic philosophic propositions can be aphorisms, and aphorisms can be theses, why not develop that as an historical argument?5. Christopher Smart's verses on his cat are connected, by a weird historical lineage, to Khlebnikov, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Kathy Acker, and Joe Wenderoth. It's a dumbfounding genealogy, which can only make sense as a late twentieth-century sense of Smart, in which he is plucked from his saner contemporaries and pressed into use to justify completely different and more contemporary experiments.6. The excerpt from Blake's ""Marriage of Heaven and Hell"" makes me wonder if d'Agata is listening to the content of his own selections, or choosing only for form, rhetoric, and music. I wonder because the content of this selection, if it is read alongside Bacon's text, proposes an anti-clerical Enlightenment: but does the editor care?7. On the other hand, the selection from Artaud is fundamentally hysterical, but d'Agata doesn't seem to notice; it's as if hysteria doesn't matter provided form is interesting.8. Michel Butor's wonderful and very French speculation on Egypt, which I hadn't read before, is wonderfully translated by Lydia Davis: and it stands out, too, because it proposes itself as an essay. Any why doesn't it matter that some of the texts in this anthology know themselves to be essays and others don't?9. A long excerpt of a text by Kamau Braithwaite is presented as an example of an illocutionary (performative) text. But why Braithwaite? Why not Vachel Lindsay or Allen Ginzberg? Why reach so far for performative writing, and why not justify that reach?10. The book ends with an epilogue by John Berger. It's lovely: but why Berger, once again? Why is he the model for so many people in academia interested in writing, when they themselves don't write like him? What does he have to say about essays? It's an opaque ending to an undertheorized, under-historicized book.The controversy about D'Agata's book ""The Lifespan of a Fact"" (2012) and the two negative s of his position in the New York Times (February 26, 2012, in the magazine and in the book ) make good sense in relation to his lack of awareness of his historical position. In ""The Lifespan of a Fact,"" he shows he has an unmodulated Romantic notion of the relation between inspiration and truth -- a notion he could have modified with better historical understanding....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/5989572-the-lost-origins-of-the-essay

One comment on the book as a novWhen Fiction and Nonfiction Are Like Oil and WaterThis is a combination novel and friendly teacherly essay on poetry. One comment on the book as a novel, another on the book as an essay, and a third on the two together.1. As a novel: the implied author's sense of the offhand, the corny, the careless and carefree, the vernacular, and the informal, are too easily satisfied, and they amount to too much of his sense of what contemporary writing can be. ""The Anthologist"" is too easily convinced that home-town, un-ornamented, straightforward, honest description is the best way to write a novel. Or to put it the other way around: it's easy to see the kinds of writing the implied author doesn't like -- they would include consciously developed styles and manners of all sorts, which Baker indulges in other books -- but not easy to see why he is so content writing what he takes to be their opposite. I imagine he might justify it to himself as a development of the American novel after Updike, but not toward elegant prose as in ""U and I"" -- rather toward a minimalist, anti-modernist, firmly North American, styleless style or mannerless manner, more like DeLillo. But this book's solution is weak, unable to account for its persistent low-level fear of writing.2. As an essay on poetry: it's good, but not on topic. The narrator, a poet, is working on an anthology of rhymed verse, and in the course of the book he tells us many times how important and interesting rhyme is. None of the ers of the book seems to have noticed that he doesn't actually say more than a sentence or two about rhyme itself. The entire essay on poetry is about meter. On that subject, it's fun, clear, and entertaining, and I'd recommend it if it were published by itself, without the novel accumulated around it. And it's unfortunate that the poetry essay is all about North American poets, with the usual sprinkling of Victorian predecessors in a predictable canon (Swinburne instead of Browning, shout-outs to contemporaries like Graham who might read his book, etc.). And the  in the New York Times is absolutely right about Baker's lack of connection with the real poetry world, even in North America: Baker scarcely mentions publications other than ""The New Yorker,"" and he imagines a poetry conference in Switzerland where the room is abuzz at the appearance of Paul Muldoon. That social isolation is of a piece with Baker's advocacy of rhyme and regular meter. If he were a student, I'd shut him in a room with some books of Celan's until he saw that meter can be broken in fascinating ways -- that poetry doesn't need to be either regular or simply ""free"" -- and that a poet's voice, like a novelist's, can involve more than just the assiduous mimicry of daily informal speech. I wonder if Baker thinks his loyalty to regular meter and rhyme (which he fails to separate) are a sign that he is not only contemporary and postmodern, but also traditionalist: if so, that puts him nearly in the NPR - PRI - Lake Wobegon set. This is just the kind of novel that makes Horace Engdahl right.3. As a composite essay and novel: it doesn't work. When the essayist is in the room, he talks to us, asking us to try out the sound of lines, and even to sing along. But when the novelist is speaking, it's an ordinary first-person narrative. We are asked not to notice when we, the readers, are suddenly urged to disappear for a few minutes so the novel can resume. And we're asked not to be surprised when the character in the novel we're reading abruptly turns to us and asks us a question. It's not that this couldn't work: it's that Baker doesn't notice it as a problem. And that's of a piece with his studied insouciance about voice: just say what you mean, don't gussy it up, and you're a novelist....more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/6364068-the-anthologist

It has all the worst qualities of a grad-student theory manifesto: a collage oA Poorly Conceptualized Manifesto of ConceptualismThis book is a wreck. It has all the worst qualities of a grad-student theory manifesto: a collage of sources, willful contradictions, inadvertent contradictions, overdetermined graphics, leaps of argument, supposedly evocative breaks between aphoristic paragraphs.Here are four possibilities for reading such a text:1. As a piece of conceptual writing. In this case the claims would not be referential, but about the obduracy and materiality of language itself. Such a reading would be in line with conceptual writing, but clearly not with the authors' intentions.2. As a collection of aphorisms, like de la Rochefoucauld, Lichtenberg, Chamfort, Novalis, or Pascal. In that case, a reader would pick and choose images and ideas, and wouldn't mind the inconsistencies. But the text itself speaks against that because it keeps addressing its putatively single subject.3. As a document of its time (2009) and place (those parts of North American academic experimental writing that are closest to visual art). In this case, ironically, a reader wouldn't need to consider how plausible or coherent the claims are, because they would be signs of their historical place. Ironic, because a nominalist, literalist reading is in line with conceptualism.4. As ""notes"" that approach the utility of a manifesto or at least a position paper, and hope to adequately address and express an emerging field. This is more or less how the authors intend it. But how it is possible to read this text as theory? Consider some exemplary obstacles:(4a) The text opens ""Conceptual art is allegorical writing."" The paragraph that follows says, among other things, that allegory is ""saying slant what cannot be said directly,"" which is not a useful definition of allegory; the same paragraph also offers about a dozen other properties and possible definitions. The authors apparently don't know Stephen Melville's essay on the ""re-emergence"" of allegory, and they only mention Benjamin in a group with De Man and Stephen Barney, saying all three argue that allegory is about the ""reification"" of words. I think that in the history of the modern and postmodern reception of allegory, that opening page is a mess. Does it follow that ""Words are objects""? That's what they claim, on the top of the next page, in an isolated one-sentence paragraph.(4b) What kind of reading does an entry like this call for:""Sophocles wanted a true language in which things were ontologically nominal. This is true in fiction and history.""Fiction meaning poetry.""Poetry meaning history.History meaning the future state of having been."" (p. 17)Surely such a passage is a signal to the reader that the ""Notes"" cannot be read as theory or as argument. And yet they keep insisting they can be.There's an interesting problem with recent theorizations of conceptual writing, especially Craig Dworkin's essay: there's a tendency to trace the lineage of conceptual writing to conceptual art. It's a problematic genealogy, which sometimes makes sense but often doesn't. In these ""notes"" there are references to many art world figures, including Hal Foster. An especially interesting moment is when the authors  some highlights of institutional critique, mentioning Andrea Fraser, and then wonder what conceptual writing has done by way of critiquing its institutions. They name some examples (p. 49), but there aren't many; and soon the text is back to its a-political literalism.Of the four readings, the only one that makes sense to me is the third.(Further remarks in the  of Place's ""Dies: A Sentence."")...more",Notes are private!,0,7,1,not set,"Feb 10, 2017","Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/6365306-notes-on-conceptualisms

""One on a Moonless Night"" is contemporary, but Dai Sijie's imagination is embalmed the period between 1890 and 1920: the period of romantic Sinology, of Fennolosa, Binyon, and the young Ezra Pound. The period when an aesthete's most obscure and arcane imaginings conjured a rare perfume, a fragrance so refined, so delicate and faded that it could hardly be perceived. The book's aesthetics, in which only the fabulously rare, perfect, and long-lost artifacts of culture can attract the true connoisseur's eye, comes from symbolist and fin-de-siecle aesthetes like Huysman's Jean Des Esseintes, and book's cast of characters are the stock in trade of 1920s Sinology: Huizong, Du Fu, Li Bo, lost masterpieces of Tang painting, rare sutras, the Jin Ping Mei, oracle-bone script... if those points of reference aren't familiar to you, if they aren't completely tarnished by generations of conservative historians and late-romantic poems, then you may not see just how cloistered, how cobwebbed, Dai Sijie's imagination really is. The book might remind you of ""The Name of the Rose,"" ""Foucault's Pendulum,"" ""The Dictionary of the Zhazars,"" or any number of overly intricate, supposedly erudite novels, all the way down to and including ""The Da Vinci Code""... or it might remind you, more precisely, of admirers of Pound's original Sinophilia such as George Steiner. (See Steiner's comment in ""After Babel,"" that Pound translated Chinese poetry better than people who could actually read Chinese, and his notion that the translation issues raised by Pound's versions of Chinese poems might be the most complex event in the history of the universe.) But Eco, Pavic, and the other contemporary writers of the arcane have their own idiosyncracies. This novel is warmed-over cobwebs. If you think otherwise, you might spend time reading about Huizong, Du Fu, Li Bo, lost masterpieces of Tang painting, rare sutras, the Jin Ping Mei, oracle-bone script, and then, when they are as familiar as Updike's descriptions of New England WASPS, when they have lost whatever aura they might once have had, then come back to this book and you may agree....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/5948641-once-on-a-moonless-night

(A bit like Graveyard Clay or Lincoln in the Bardo. Nominally the book is written by a dead man; by itself that wouldn't be remarkable (The Third Policeman also comes to mind), but here the narrator is content. He tells us all sorts of things that aren't grisly, melodramatic, or macabre: he doesn't dream, but the frangipani tree above him sometimes dreams of him; he has a pet spiny anteater, which burrows down to him and speaks to him in a kind of inner monologue as if it were his dog; he doesn't remember much of his life, but that doesn't often bother him.Partway through the novel -- which is a mainly unsuccessful series of vignettes framed as a detective story -- I realized why Couto feels so at home with the idea of being forgotten, buried, suspended in a state of more or less permanent amnesia. It's because he sympathizes with people who live, as he has, in an isolated and impoverished corner of an isolated and impoverished country. Their lives are mainly forgotten, and their sense of themselves is tenuous: they are linguistically and racially mixed, and they do not always have any good way of matching ideas to words (as one of Couto's characters says). There are some good pages on the hopelessness of feeling at home in such a postcolonial world (pp. 41-46) but that theme is familiar: what's new is the way these characters are partly happy, mainly reconciled, slightly drifting, virtually isolated, somewhat dreamlike: it's the qualifiers, the lack of absolutes, that make Couto's way of thinking so distinctive. His sense of the postcolonial experience is the opposite of Frantz Fanon or any number of occasionally polemic or strident writers (Helon Habila, Chris Abani, Aminatta Forna) and theorists of hybridity and dislocation, and it is also miles from the usual ghost story in which the ghost pines for life. There's no passion and little introspection in this postcoloniality. This ghost likes his six days above ground, but in the end he is more or less as content in the earth, vaguely content, vaguely uncertain about what he has forgotten. By the end it seems attractive to think of lying underground, with most of your memories gone, with no sense of smell, no light or color, and very little sound.

This collection of short pieces has some models for prose experiments:1. ""Thoughts of Sorts / Sorts of Thoughts"" is fragmentary in an uninteresting way: it could be much more intensively executed, more fictionally complete, more obsessively classificatory. But it makes up for that unaccountable lightness (it seems that it's the product of a waning interest, or a lack of energy) by some wonderful passages, like this:""THOUGHTS / SORTSWhat does the forward slash mean?What exactly is the question? Whether I think before I sort? Whether I sort before I think?""And so on. The problem is that there isn't much so on, but no clear reason why there isn't.2. ""I Remember Malet & Isaac"" is an inventory of one of Perec's school books, a history of France. He lists the table of contents, then all the words in italics, then just one picture's caption, then everything in boldface. It's also incomplete in a strangely unaccountable way, but it has a great cumulative effect: it makes me share in Perec's impatience with the cobwebby history texts we've all had to read.3.

Stifter is the ""landscape painter"" of German realist novelists, and this little novel begins with a leisurely tour of a mountain range, so that as readers we know our way around. Then two little children get lost in the mountains. It's not meant to be melodramatic: it's the opposite: a potentially maudlin story told with absolute calm and with fastidious and accurate attention to the Alpine landscape. Beautiful and serene.W.H. Auden makes all these points in his intentionally simple introduction. Stifter means to make a Christian parable, but it is not a parable of redemption. It's about harmony: harmony of people with themselves, with each other, with the landscape. People and mountains are largely silent. A person's regard of another shows how much they understand of that other: the boy of his devoted sister, both the boy and the girl of the mountain.The pace and the purpose of the story couldn't be farther from the frenetic & hysterical inventions of our current novelists (thinking of McCarthy, Galchen, Baker, et al.).It is a wonderful tonic. I would read it as a reminder of the fact that the frantic need to invent clevernesses in every line, which has come to seem like nothing other than good writing, is a form of obliviousness to other meanings. And note: the calmness here, and the disinterest in writerly invention, is on an entirely different level from minimalist fiction of the last forty years.

That impression, I think, occurs mostly to people who have not written fiction. The book is loose, with some episodes that should be tighter and others that should be longer. I think Bolaño discovered that letting his prose wander, and being insouciant about structure and agnostic about the boundaries between fiction and nonfiction, were useful strategies for breaking out of certain fictional modes. The Spanish critic Ignacio Echevarría picked out the crucial passage on p. 896, noting that it's the only passage in the novel that clearly announces Bolaño's ambitions for the book.If you are not a writer, you can test this claim of mine by asking yourself about the ""Part about Amalfitano."" It develops an acute psychological portrait, centering on a book Amalfitano puts on a clothesline. It is a striking invention, but it isn't complete. Does that incompletion--we leave Amalfitano in an unresolved state--do anything for the architecture of the book? Is it necessary to leave the ""Part about Amalfitano"" open in order to crystallize other parts, ot to propel a larger narrative? I think this is a writer's issue: Bolaño was developing his sympathies with Amalfitano as he went along, and at some point he couldn't get further into the character, so he changed the subject. He had plans beyond this version of ""2666,"" but the development of Amalfitano in the course of the book-within-the-book shows how organic and open that process was. There isn't anything profound about the story's incompletion: no plan, no narrative experimentation. It's just a small, ordinary failure of writing writ large, concreted into a long text, which is itself immersed in the many intentionally unformed texts Bolaño had long been writing.A friend once told me a story about Pynchon: he sent a copy of ""Gravity's Rainbow"" to his old university professor at Cornell, Baxter Hathaway, with the inscription, ""For Baxter, Is this tight enough for you?"" This book isn't tight in Pynchon's sense, and it doesn't help when inattention or inexperience with narrative contruction leads critics to assume the book has the control or architecture that other long books possess—which is not, of course, to say that architecture and control can save long books.At the same time, part of ""2666"" among the strongest things written in the last couple of decades. I have not forgotten the astonishing novel-with-the-novel set in Juarez, which rehearses the murders of women. In the years since the novel appeared, those passages have gotten even more resonance, given the percussive effect of the hundreds of murders of women not only in that part of Mexico, but around the world, and given the events of 2020, including Black Lives Matter. It's an exemplary fictionalized witnessing, which is as strong—as pummeling, as hard to read, as unresolved—as the facts the world hurls at us. (""Percussive"" comes from Elaine Scarry's book ""The Body in Pain,"" also still a strong source after an even longer period.)...more",Notes are private!,0,25,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/3115359-2666

There are abyssal moments of perversion, neurosis, psychosis, and delusion that can also be found in many sentimental North American novels of the sort publicized by Oprah, but this book is different. The Romanian-born Hungarian author is very much of his time and place: there is mordant black humor (made familiar in Kundera, but closer to the sharper postmodern humor in more recent Czech writing like Viewegh's); routine admissions of debilitating moral weakness (in the end, an inheritance of Beckett); eastern-European style surrealism (a whore with twenty birds, who also poisons birds in her spare time); compulsively disgusting inventories of bodily fluids (lots of stains, smells, and sticky fingers); a remnant of Soviet-era paranoia and disaffection about government and the church; and a post-structural dedication to a lack of progress or any passing melioration (the character never really tries to understand himself). In short: no American sentimentality, no American moral for self-improvement. In that, Bartis is more like A.L. Kennedy than any best seller.A lack of momentum fits these themes but weakens the book. It is clear that Bartis had the rudiments of a plot--a priest, introduced near the beginning, comes back in the end, and so forth. But after a while there is not much impetus to turn the page, other than to find the next dead-end epiphany. The character doesn't change, even though his only real love affair is the book's central event; and it's clear Bartis wrote this in a series of dissociated one-page bursts. Some of them read like prose poems, and they are separated by asterisms. So the book keeps starting and stopping. That, and the unrelieved gloom, must be the reasons Rivka Galchen describes it as ""even Endgame-ish"" on the back cover: it is less like Beckett than Naked Lunch.Another difficulty is that Bartis apparently counts on his readers to feel a strange elation when he confronts them with horrors. That elation is meant to include a bit of laughter: we are shocked, we shiver and laugh, and then we take some comfort in having looked, at least for a moment, at something lightless. The main character has spent fifteen years living at home with his reclusive mother after his sister abandoned them; his mother had bought a plot in the cemetery and held a mock funeral in which she buried her daughter's things. The son goes on pretending that his sister is sending their mother letters--he writes the letters himself--and the mother gives the son letters to post to the sister. Toward the end of the book it turns out that all the mother's letters were blank: she knew, all along, that the son was writing letters supposedly from the sister. As this story is revealed, we are meant to be both shocked and amused, and to take some small pleasure in knowing we have now experienced, even if only through an undependable narrator in a novel, something truly repellent about human nature. But what if these effects don't work? What if I don't laugh? What if I'm not shocked? What if I begin to feel that the plot devices are garish, artificial, and too deliberately disturbing? What if I start wishing I were re-reading Molloy instead? What if I begin to wish that Bartis felt he could communicate his depths without spilled fluids, psychotic breaks, and new categories of squalor?The book is trapped in the twinned heritage of eastern European realism and surrealism. When effects that are supposed to be perceived as natural seem forced, pathos becomes bathos, and communication appears artificial and staged -- as it always is, but must not, in the romantic and modern novel, ever appear to be....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3419335-tranquility

It has short sections, many just one sentence long, which are often bursts of emotion or violently condensed images. Like Winterson, Gander is content to compromise narrative drive in order to insert poetic images. ""As a Friend"" is, in effect, a novella interlarded with fragments of late twentieth-century American poetry. It's mainly very effective. I had two reservations:[return][return]1. The book is divided into four narratives. Their affective power increases from the first to the third, which is a lyric about despair, and the heart of the book to that point. The narrator of the fourth section ruined the lives of the narrators of the second and third sections. But in the fourth section, where the character responsible for the others' despair is finally given a voice, it becomes difficult to pay attention. The excerpts of that character's thoughts can only serve as condemnations of pretense and artifice -- but readers who have responded appropriately to the second and third sections don't need to be persuaded of such things. It would be devastating if the person who wrecked the lives of the other characters turned out to be genuinely inspired or otherwise profound, but no matter how much he talks about himself, art, love, and friendship -- even if that fourth section had been hundreds of pages long -- it isn't persuasive, shocking, or even interesting.[return][return]2. Many of Gander's images are typical North American lyric moments: large cricket-like creatures swarm from a cave; a dead shrew wriggles from the activity of the beetles burrowing in its body; a moth is cut in half by a machete. The squashed bugs, moments of sudden disgust, piles of shit or vomit (at least six in the book), are supposed to function as compressed, partly unreadable epiphanies: but they are a such a common device that they read more like placeholders for more appropriate metaphors -- images that might resonate with the surrounding narrative....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/3816454-as-a-friend

The back cover copyHow Difficult it is to Escape from Academic WritingThis remains an interesting book going on fifteen years after it was published. The back cover copy makes it sound like it's science fiction. One of the endorsements describes it as ""an uncategorizable hybrid of philosophical fiction, heretical theology, aberrant demonology and renegade archaeology."" That's a bit sloppy, because the book is only philosophical fiction in the sense that it is invented, a la Borges or Lem. And heresy isn't its point. ""Cyclonopedia"" is a philosophic treatise framed as a fiction, and woven together with devices from literature.The author, Reza Negarestani, has read a lot of Deleuze and Guattari, and a wide range of political theory (Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri's Empire has a similar rhetoric in places). Many chapters could almost be presented at philosophy conferences; there are analyses of oil, machinery, war, camouflage, and other subjects that are in line with some eccentric Deleuzian readings that have long been acceptable in academic contexts. The fictional part comes partly in the book's claim that ""the Middle East [is] a sentient and living entity... in a very literal sense of the word,"" but more in the many poetic analyses of its leading concepts--analyses that draw on Deleuze but also on popular culture, from H.P. Lovecraft to John Carpenter's ""The Thing."" (Again, that's commensurate with Deleuzian and cultural studies, and, oddly, with Graham Harman's subsequent interest in Lovecraft in Weird Realism.)Since this book, Negarestani has become interested in a range of issues in contemporary philosophy of mind, computation, and science, and his writing has become much less experimental and closer to academic norms. (See the publications of Urbanomic, and the journal Collapse.) Cyclonopedia is not the clearest formulation of his interests, but it is by far the best writing. The best passages of the book are imaginative analyses of particular concepts. There is a spectacular long footnote explaining the concept of the ""inorganic demon,"" ranging from ""The Exorcist"" to ""Doom III."" (p. 223 ff) There is a very good page on the survival of pre-Islamic ways of writing ""Allah."" (p. 173). There is an excellent poetic analysis, reminiscent in its way of Bachelard's ruminations on elements, but also of Lautreamont, on the subject of the Babylonian demons Enkidu and Pazuzu (the latter familiar from ""The Exorcist""). (p. 113 ff) That analysis includes a description of ""rammalie,"" ""an Arabic word for communication with other worlds and aeons through patterns on pebbles and desert sand.""The book has a glossary, with well-developed theoretical concepts. In that regard it resembles Latour's book on nature, or Ranciere's book on politics. Negarestani has invented, and defined, an entire vocabulary for interpreting the socio-political, historical, and psychological state of the Middle East: Double Numbering, hypercamouflage, polytics, heresy-engineering, Druj literature, Tellurian blasphemy, schizostrategy... they could all be used in discussions outside the book.The book's weaknesses have to do with Negarestani's shortcomings as a fiction writer and as a theoretician. The former become apparent when the reader moves from the brief introduction, which tells the story of the discovery of the manuscript, into the manuscript itself: at that point it is clear that the introduction is poorly, incompletely imagined fiction (it consists of brief vignettes, which are intended to be taken as sufficient fictional context). Before the reader makes the transition to the body of the book, it appears that the fragmented descriptions in the introduction are a deliberate strategy; but there are no other fictional strategies in the book.Negarestani is in some ways a wonderfully prolific and inventive theorist, so it may seem odd to suggest that the book's other weakness is theory. I have in mind the fact that in a number of passages the theory is incrementally close to Deleuze and other mainly French poststructuralist theorists, and it risks reading like the sort of parody written by disaffected graduate students. An analysis of the semiotics of the rat (p. 229) is an example: it has a kind of grim humor, but it is a pastiche of any number of such analyses in authors as diverse as Barthes and Serres. In other passages, neologisms proliferate in the way that used to be called ""Derridadrivel,"" for instance in this chapter opening: ""In the mid-eighties, before succumbing to his petromantic nympholepsy..."" (p. 195). There are also passages that read like pastiches of popular film and novels, as in this chapter opening: ""By the time Colonel West turned into a renegade and deserted Delta Force's Special Tactics and Rescue Squad..."" (p. 129). This is knowing, but it's not in control of the fact that as it continues it appears inadvertent or unreflective about its closeness to is sources.These two weaknesses -- regarding fiction and theory -- are common, but usually they are found in different kinds of writing: the first occurs in novels everywhere, the second in academic philosophy. It is extremely unusual to have them together in one book, written by a person with an understanding of Middle Eastern languages, history, and archaeology. I read the book at first as an attempt at academic fiction (as in Borges), but again as an attempt to seriously theorize the Middle East, and especially the meanings of oil. In that respect, the book is spectacular.The relative weakness of the overtly fictional moments in the book, as compared with the outlandish strength of the conceptualizations and the pleasure of the unexpected cultural juxtapositions, is the reason this book remains academic, tied to and reliant on academic philosophic knowledge. I also wish that Negarestani had written a book that did not rely so much on Deleuze, Foucault, and its other points of (Western, European, mainly French) reference: since ""Cyclonopedia"" Negarestani has developed strong critiques of many such positions, but this book was a chance to tip the balance of explanation from France to Iran and beyond. Instead he joined the Anglophone and Francophone discussions of speculative realism and other subjects that are common in Western academia.[2011, revised 2017, 2023]...more",Notes are private!,0,11,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4617457-cyclonopedia

It has When inadequate imagination leads the reader out of the book and to the author""Book of Clouds"" is well enough observed, paced, and structured. It has some ingredients of a good novel: but it's trite, and the reason for its triviality is a strange lacuna in the author's imagination of her main character. The Mexican woman who wanders around Berlin, taking pleasure in riding the S-Bahn, in long walks, and in the weather, is a habitually solitary person. She isn't often lonely, but even after five years in Berlin she has only three or four acquaintances, including a homeless woman who begs on a train platform -- and she only talks to that person once. The lacuna is not the character's solitary life, which is expertly observed. The absence I have in mind springs from two two higher-level absences:First, there's a lack of anxiety on the character's part that she is so isolated, so without interests. She knows, in the novel, that she has no friends and often does nothing for weeks or months at a time, but she is not anxious about it: it's almost as if she is on a strong course of antidepressants, so that her condition doesn't affect her.Second, there's a lack of interest on the implied author's part that her character is isolated and without interests. The character is clearly occasionally delusional, but that does not seem to concern the implied author.It is, in the end, disengaging to read about a character who does not care to know more about herself, described by a novelist who doesn't seem to notice that there might be more to see.At the beginning of the book, the character imagines seeing an aging Hitler (as a woman!) on a train, and throughout the novel she remains convinced of what she thinks she's seen. At the end of the book, she hallucinates a dense fog that loosens locks throughout Berlin and causes posters to slip down from the walls. Because the character never doubts either event, the novel creates an opening: I expected the narrator to develop a story about her mildly, occasionally delusional protagonist, and I thought the novel would probably develop into a story about her decline. But it's as if the implied author herself is unaware of the deeper psychology of her own character. In the course of the novel, the character experiences several other unusual events, and she's uncertain about a couple of things, but nothing comes of them. Increasingly, I thought not of the character or narrator, or even of the implied author, but of the real author, Aridjis. (Even though I know nothing about her.) I had no clear sense that she meant anything by these events, other than the passing whimsy that life is sometimes odd. And I could not -- cannot -- understand how Aridjis didn't experience her own character's inner life as anything except mildly surrealist and entertaining, harmless, ultimately ordinary. That's why in the end I was more concerned about Aridjis (even though as a good poststructuralist I know that she's a projection of the reading experience, and nothing would come of finding out more about her) than her novel....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/4643586-book-of-clouds

It's as if this is what happens in a writer's mind when he or she is contemplating the craft and social world of novel writing, before it's time to settle down and actually write. I think that's an excellent insight, and it explains an odd effect in Bolano: when you encounter a passage that is beautifully written, it seems somehow out of place, as if that is something that should only happen in the novels that Bolano's characters are forever discussing.

A thoughtful  by James Wolcott (""Bookforum,"" February / March 2008, pp. 9-10), sums it up: ""Today, I would hazard... the track marks of Barthelme's suave, subversive cunning are to be found less in postmodern fiction -- although David Foster Wallace's dense foliage of footnotes suggests a Barthelmean undergrowth and George Saunders's arcade surrealism has a runaway-nephew quality -- than in the conscientiously oddball, studiedly offhand, hiply recherché, mock-anachronistic formalism of 'McSweeney's,' 'The Believer,' 'The Crier,' and related organs of articulate mumblecore."" The current generation of young MFA writing program candidates still see the ""McSweeney's"" option as one of their main goals. So in that sense, Barthelme remains a ubiquitous influence. (George Saunders's essay on Barthelme, in ""The Brain-Dead Megaphone,"" is the best thing written on Barthelme, if you're looking for a guide.)Barthelme is part of the history of postwar American writing. But is he someone to read now? Here I was struck by just how much of it has lost its shine. There are hilarious pieces, and at times the wit is as sharp as it seemed in the 1970s. But Barthelme's liberal politics are as predictable as his quips are surprising. His absurdism has always been a safe version of real absurdism. If you're interested in surrealist or absurdist shock, read Raymond Roussel, or Daniil Kharms (who has also been praised by Saunders, in the ""New York Times Book Review."") As Wolcott points out, the entire New Fiction movement was subjected to a typically devastating critique by Gore Vidal (""American Plastic: The Matter of Fiction"") back in 1976; Vidal thought the movement, including Pynchon, was contrived and derivative of French experimental fiction. I'd rather trace it to Russian and central European absurdist literature and surrealism, but the significance is the same: Barthelme is watered-down, domesticated, playful, harmless absurdism. Never too angry, seldom directly polemic, never despairing. (That would be gauche, and it would dispense with the multiple layers of irony that are necessary to project authenticity while studiously avoiding it.) After a few days reading Barthelme, the happiness of seeing plodding seriousness exploded continuously and brilliantly in my face when I least expect it (but really not-so-secretly expecting it all along) pales into a memory of that happiness, which I now mistrust and even regret, and I find I want some real pain or a laugh that doesn't come with a small grimace acknowledging the writer's artifice and the reader's complicity....more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1693460.The_Teachings_of_Don_B_

Why it is Important for an Author to Live in Their NovelThis is a good example of a novel that isn't written with concerted attention. The author's mind wanders, and I can imagine him thinking of many things beside his novel. The book is divided into many sections, some quite short, and I picture him writing a section one morning over coffee (and adding a bit about coffee in the book), then going off to meet friends, then skipping a day, maybe thinking of his novel over dinner... I imagine him living too much in his own life, as an Angolan novelist in Lisbon, and too little in the imaginative world he is thinking of creating.The problem with a novel written in this way, with intermittent and uneven attention, is that the lack of continuous imaginative commitment seeps into the narrative itself. It becomes difficult to stay immersed in the novel. The idea that the narrator is a gecko is fun, sometimes; and the idea that the main character invents fictional pasts for people is fun, sometimes; the descriptions of the gecko's dreams are fun, sometimes; the whimsical, slightly surrealist section titles are fun, sometimes; and the plays of memory and truth are fun, sometimes: but even the consistency of a sentence like this one is missing from Agualusa's wandering and watery imagination.

But it has a pernicious, pervasive, clinging effect on a reader. I try to forget it, but it seeps into my thinking. A number of times Coetzee goes on too long -- he lets his alter-ego in the book pontificate, partly for novelistic effect, and partly because he can't help it -- and then I think: does the Nobel, and everything that goes with it, create an atmosphere in which he feels justified in taking any liberties? Other times the clever pagination of the book doesn't quite work out -- a dozen or so instances, the sentences don't end on the page, but flow on to the next, compelling the reader to read across pages instead of down the page -- and then I wonder: does the Nobel, and everything that goes with it, give Coetzee the sense that things like that need not matter, that they will be eclipsed and forgotten by the force of the concept? The Nobel (by which I mean the steady warmth of adulation and writers' appearances and awards) has this effect: it cushions the writer, so it seems, and it makes it that much harder for a reader trying to gauge what is measured and intended and what is simply permitted. But that is not my principal objection to this book. Its crucial problem, to my mind, is the quality of the disquisitions that the narrator permits himself. As the other s point out, the narrator goes on at length about his opinions. In the logic of the novel, those opinions are being prepared for publication, so that is their immediate excuse for being in the novel. And Coetzee himself criticizes his own opinions, both in the voice of the principal female character and in the voice of that character's partner. At one point, he even uses his own voice -- the voice of the person who writes the opinions -- to criticize the opinions. But none of those criticisms is enough. The problem with many of the opinions is not that they are harsh and inhuman (as the female character says), or that they are ineffective (as the male character says). It is that they are ill-informed and ill-argued. Coetzee is just not as interesting a thinker as, say, Musil, or Rochefoucauld, or Chamfort, or Lichtenberg, or Badelaire, or Brecht, or Broch, or any number of others. His opinions, mostly, are not interesting. And they are frequently ill-informed. Coetzee needs to read more about numbers and statistics (one of his topics), and more about theories of capitalism and democracy. He comes across as the kind of person who writes in to a newspaper of magazine, and doesn't know the subject as well as he should. I am not criticizing his ideas because they are radical: I am criticizing them because they are not radical enough. In ""Disgrace,"" he had one absolutely stunning idea -- that animals could be as important as people, or more important. Here there are few such interesting ideas.For me this is exemplified by a passage on page 203, where the narrator, in the course of writing one of his ""opinions,"" one titled ""On having thoughts,"" says: ""But do I really qualify as a thinker at all, someone who has what can properly be called thoughts, about politics or about anything else?"" And he answers: ""I have never been easy with abstractions or good at abstract thought."" Let me suggest that Coetzee is fooling himself here. The shortcomings of his ""opinions"" are not related to a skill at abstract thinking: that's a red herring. His ""opinions"" are limited by what he knows, and by a lack of original thinking. ""Elizabeth Costello"" was translarently a mouthpiece for Coetzee's opinions, and it was the kind of book that someone who is not feted, who is not a Nobel laureate, would not have been allowed to write; his editor would have stopped him, and said something like this: ""Coetzee, you need to realize that your characters' opinions need to be allowed to become truly monomaniacal, really nuts, dangerously obsessive, intentionally boring -- otherwise they will appear to be what they really are, the very serious opinions of the author, whose only thought is to broadcast them to the world. It is your lack of understanding of the uninteresting nature of those opinions -- bolstered, I know, by the many people who continuously take them seriously, and praise you for them -- that makes them intractable as materials for a fully imagined fictional setting. A reader knows that they are not under your control: you think of them too highly, too primly, to seriously. Let them risk dying a natural death: put them at the mercy of the fiction, not the other way around."" I do not know if I will read another Coetzee novel....more",Notes are private!,0,2,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2675481-diary-of-a-bad-year

First, it misjudges the effect, force, and interest of short sentences. All the sentences in the book are brief. All of them, in all 451 pages. None are sentence fragments. So the book does not experiment with modernist prose. It is apparently intended to emulate Beckett. It is apparently intended to be hypnotic. It is apparently intended to hint at the book's hidden and rule-bound structure. But it is a mannerism. And the mannerism is not connected to the content of the book. As the subjects change the writing remains the same. Tarnawsky could have learned from Stein. Use fragments. Vary. Long and short. Don't just declare again and again.[return][return]The book also misjudges its form. It is billed as a novel. It is actually 200 two-page prose poems. There is a deliberate avoidance of the obligation of narrative. That avoidance is not tempered by moments when rules can be guessed. That avoidance is not tempered by the emergence of any new structure. That avoidance is undermined by individual passages that show the author is not a machine. He is a late surrealist, working in a well-known tradition. When he writes pages of successful surrealist prose, he undermines his own attempt to pretend he is entirely rule-bound.[return][return]The book misjudges the device of the dream. Many sections begin by announcing they are dreams. That can work well when other sections provide contrasting reality. Here none do. Many dreams could just as well have happened in waking life. Many episodes of waking life would have been dreams. There is no point in declaring some are dreams. It is an annoying tic, a crutch that supports nothing.[return][return]The book misjudges affect and emotion. Most of it is meant to be curiously passionless. Sex is described mechanically and carefully. Emotions are simple. Many times sections end with characters being dumbly happy, astonished, pleased. That is intended to convey childlike wonder and purity. It ends up being simpleminded with no clear reason. Then there is one section, near the end, in which the main character rapes someone. The main character's name is Hwbrgdtse. It is meant to be unpronounceable. I will write more on that in a moment. The section is called 'Hwbrgdtse Rapes a Girl.' In it, Hwbrgdtse plans an executes a rape. It is described step by step, along with his thoughts. It is intended to be experimental. It is horrifying. It is like a fragment of 'In Cold Blood.' Perhaps, in another context (I have to be careful not to make my sentences too long, or use anything other than the most schoolbookish grammaer), that could have been interesting. But it makes a reader wonder: am I supposed to be thinking the entirety of this book is written by a psychopath? And the answer to that is clearly No, because many sections are also intended to be childlike, amusing, funny, and many other things. So it means the author has completely failed to imagine the entirety of his own project. And this brings me to a conclusion.[return][return]I know why these things are misjudged. It is because the author uses 'a complex mathematical scheme' to determine what he writes about. Even without knowing he used mathematical rules (and I know nothing more: I only read the back cover copy), I would have guessed. Many sections have unexpected transitions of the kind that are impelled by rules. But the authors in Oulipo knew that not all rules result in expressive forms. As an author you also have to look back on your work after the rules have been followed, and read it again as if you did not know the rules. Only then can you see what you have made. This is a very common failure in rule-bound surrealist prose, so let me say it again: not every rule produces an expressive result. Not every unexpected meeting of metaphors is interesting. Tarnawsky could learn a lot from Leiris, who did not follow rules, and he could learn a lot from Perec, who did. The back cover also says Tarnawsky has 'developed... a substitute for the traditional architecture of the novel.' The reason he hasn't is because he does not listen, as a reader, to what he produces, as a mathematician. There is productive psychosis in this book, but Tarnawsky has to see where it appears as psychosis in order to control it as a novelist.[return][return](As a postscript, and an example of the author's lack of awareness of his function as an author: There is a section, late in the book, just before Hwbrgdtse dies, in which goes to a teacher to learn how to pronounce his name. It is whimsical, but disconnected from the rest of the novel, where the issues never arises; and that disconnection is neither supported by half-visible mathematical rules, which might have shown readers why such an intrusion was required, nor contradicted by adjoining sections, which pursue other subjects without every mentioning problems with pronunciation. So the section appears exactly as it is: something enjoined by the author's hidden schemata. It can express only the author's lack of understanding that evidence of a hidden structure is insufficient to sustain interest. Compare that to the fascinating and bizarre effect of the book's final section, in which the author goes in search of a watch repairman, even though he has just died, in the previous section. That is an expressive, surrealist invention. The section in which Hwbrgdtse attempts to pronounce his name is an inexpressive, pointlessly opaque, unaffecting, uninterestingly illegible interpolation in the uninterestingly illegible schema of the book as a whole.)...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/2431815.Three_Blondes_and_Death

Suddenly the earthquake is relived, inside the reader's eye, as an abstract vision. The author's migraine, which becomes the reader's image, is a sign of the impending destruction of his consciousness, just as the earthquake destroyed Anchorage. And in retrospect, it's all set up by the last section of the preceding earthquake chapter, which is about how Houston was lifted four inches by a surface wave from the Alaska quake, 3,300 miles away. That's an analogue, a signal to the reader that distant connections will reappear.This is only one example, one appearance of one theme. Metcalf should be required reading for all MFA students, because he takes even the most attentive reader to school, demonstrating how to make connections that aren't forced, programmatic, obvious, repetitive, awkward, or otherwise business as usual. It's real poetry, and it's no wonder that in interviews and essays, Metcalf said that Melville wrote poetry in prose, even if his actual poetry was awful, and that people like Melville and Poe knew they were blurring the boundaries of poetry and prose.

Franzen's ""Freedom"" is like that, and most of �nard's ""Zone."" Schulz is the diametric opposite: no sentence is permitted in his fiction unless it squeezes language until it nearly chokes. [return][return]This is one of the things Jonathan Safran Foer likes about Schulz. In his introduction, he he says he thought ""The Street of Crocodiles"" was a great book, but that he still didn't like it:[return][return]""The language was too heightened, the images too magical and precarious, the yearnings too dire, the sense of loss too palpable--everything was comedy or tragedy."" (p. ix)[return][return]Some of Schulz is surrealism, as when a man is reduced to the rubber tubes used for enemas (!), but most of it is rhapsodic, ecstatic, and visionary -- ""magical"" in Foer's term. And that is exactly the limitation of the work: it is deeply romantic in an old-fashioned sense, desperate (""dire"" is Foer's word) for revelation and salvation, obsessed with ending, decay, corruption, ""loss,"" and their fragile opposites: brilliant flashes of light, comets, strange meaningful patterns, hidden arcane knowledge. ""The Street of Crocodiles"" is not a novel or a collection of stories, but not for the usual formal reason (that is, not because the sections fail to cohere, as in a novel, or remain distinct from one another, as in a collection of short stories or prose poems), but because Schulz's obsessive scenes keep recurring. Form isn't the point: what matters is getting the transient revelation right. There are inadvertent repetitions, and repetitions he has recognized turned into elaborations. Both sorts are signs that what matters is not the story but the mould, the fever, the impending insanity or petrifaction, the pathos of the overlooked and ruined hallway smeared with grime and spotted with stains. It is a very nineteenth-century vision, made more intense by its twentieth-century setting. In that sense it is typical central European romantic fiction. What it lacks and ""desperately"" needs is the coldness of Kafka....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1576188.The_Street_of_Crocodiles_and_Other_Stories

I'm writing on April 25, 2010, and the keyboard was just released.) Appropriate for this book, where all sorts of language artifacts mingle with the usual writer's voice, including the 01 attached to the whimsical, faintly dada, faintly machine-language, faintly internet-password title.Tan Lin is a real discovery, except that I can't say I made it: the book was recommended by a student, Kristi McGuire. Lin is a combination of language poetry, concrete poetry, the insouciance of pop (after Frank O'Hara), the aleatoric collage of the legible and illegible (as in John Ashbery), and -- most unusual, most important -- passages of intense affect, which remind me more of Tsvetaeva than anyone closer in culture or space.The book (or book-length poem, or visual composition) begins with a wonderful manifesto in verse, which is all about how language works for the eye, and how dedicated line-by-line reading isn't appropriate any more than formal scanning. ""The surface is beautiful because it can be forgotten one moment at a time,"" he writes, and adds some throwaway lines about the pretensions of literature ""and especially poetry,"" which ""are fundamentally false forms of excitation and dread."" Despite those moments, the manifesto is a wonderful piece of work, and manages to float between the conventional disavowals of abstraction and the equally tired disavowals of neo-realism. (Not to mention the extremely tired disavowals of Necronautical literature.) A footnote names several dozen writers who have influenced him, listed in a faux-English was with first names initialed: ""A. Warhol, M. LacNeice, S. Tomkins, b flieschman, W. Pater,"" etc. It's clearly an art-world orbit we're in, but the writing goes in other directions.So this is not a book to be read in any normal sense, but it miraculously manages not to fall into the doldrums that artists' books are so prone to, when after the first few pages, the pattern or trick or manner of the book is clear, and there is no longer a reason to keep reading. Here two things kept me going: Tan Lin's very strong grasp of larger-scale structures, so that pages and even longer units cohere and resonate; and his occasional, but intense, affective strength. It can't be quoted here because it depends on layout (""surface""), but it contains lines like this:as white as milk 02[return]and not milk 02spare me the strength to leave you 01when you were born you looked so cute all dres sed up in your birthday suitas green as grassand not grassPassages like this, with their weird mixture of felt confessional voice, slant allusions to ""Death Fugue"" and Rimbaud, and random alphanumeric blips, are something genuinely new. I will be starting his new book soon. But in fairness, the sketchiness of this  reflects my sense that there are many passages in this long book where voice of any sort -- mechanical, affective and confessional, random or aleatoric -- gives way to combinations of relatively uninteresting formal and ""surface"" plays, clearly written quickly, apparently in the hope or belief that white noise, static, and meaningless ""surface"" are, after all, part of life, and therefore invitations for the reader to fill in, do some writing or musing or theorizing. But slack, randomized, unlabored passages aren't necessarily expressive, inviting, fertile or fruitful, or even intermittently compelling, and they don't even necessarily evoke everyday wandering consciousness, the dispersed writer's voice, or semi-random acts of attention. Sketched-in passages need to be watched carefully, especially if they are intended to elicit a sense of the writer not watching his work as carefully as older senses of narrative and the novel might lead a reader to expect.Shall I put this more forcibly? I think Tan Lin has enormous potential if he reins in the loose leash of his language. Otherwise he will not be read, ""read,"" or even ""'read,'"" except by people with an infinitely expandable sense of what reading is -- a sense that would just as likely bring them to read phone books, text dumps, and other semi-automated, collaged, or random sources of text and pattern.

In their view, Coetzee's sense of politics is simple-minded to the point of absurdity, and unhelpfully mythologizing (""Waiting for the Babrarians""), while his sense of place is abstract to the point of universality (where, exactly, does ""Despair"" or ""Diary of a Bad Year"" take place?). Personally, I had never read Coetzee as a way to learn about South Africa, but I can easily see the frustration among South African readers when he is taken by so many people around the world as an emblem of what South Africa is. As one person said, he's a salve for the consciences of many readers.Vladislavic is a tremendous antidote. There's a small similarity between ""The Exploded View"" and Roddy Doyle's early work: in both cases, the subject is the forgotten parts of the country, where dirt, corruption, kinds of poverty, and general confusion mix with kitsch, regional capitalism, and camp. ""The Exploded View"" is about those stretches of the freeway in South Africa where townships sit beside new housing estates. It's an excellent verbal portrait of that new sort of landscape outside of suburbia and slums.As with Coetzee, it's also possible to read Vladislavic just as a writer, instead of as a way of finding out about South Africa. (Even though he occasionally makes that difficult by putting census facts and figures in his characters' mouths. telling us, for example, that one two percent of white South Africans speak an African language.) In terms of writing, some of his descriptions are wonderful, although he does rely a great deal on similes and tends to write brief, imagistic tropes, one per clause or one per sentence. There are some passages in which images merge rather than accumulating, but they are in the minority. His similes are inventive and sharp enough to sustain the writing--but it also feels as if the writing needs sustaining, as if it would sink down into ordinary prose if it weren't buoyed by metaphors. The tropes are like little gulps of air: they make the surrounding writing appear inert. What are the limitations of such a style, where description happens in iterated units, and is almost exclusively metaphoric, visual, and deictic? There's also the issue of realism, and Vladislavic's distance from his raw material. Occasionally his similes are based on observations that appear to have been made minutes before he took notes on them. They're hard-edged, sharp and immediate. It's hard not to imagine him walking and driving through the housing estates, townships, and highways, and jotting things down in a notebook. Those passages are distracting, and it might have been better if he'd modified and integrated them into material he'd invented later on....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1138248.The_Exploded_View

""The Blindfold"" (1992) is a very poor novel. It's barely altered from her experiences as a grad student: the episodes are hardly knitted together into a novel at all. The opening episode reads as if it's going to structure the novel, but she seems to forget it later on. The same happens throughout; the episodes, usually about fifteen pages long, read like sketches done for a weekly MFA writing seminar: they appear to be transcribed experiences with the first frail senses of how they might be fictionalized, how she might create distance and a sense of writerly purpose.The prose is utilitarian rather than descriptive, the dialogue just serviceable, and there infelicities in description, temporality, and continuity, of the sort that beginning writers make. She relies too much, for example, on the device of anticipation: ""I didn't realize until later that..."" and so on. I see the same writer's problems mentioned in s of her more recent work, for example ""Memories of the Future"" (2019), which toys inconsistently with autofiction and uses a gimmick (Minkowski space-time) to resolve questions of memory.

She has gotten some great s, bSigns of Lack of Authorial Control, and Their Relation to IntrospectionThis is not the voice of a major novelist. She has gotten some great s, both here on Amazon and in print, but the ers are mainly discussing her work as a reflection of contemporary Japan: in other words, they are reading it as documentary evidence of social phenomena. As a novel, ""Grotesque"" is fairly poor. Two points about that. 1. In three sections of the book, we read texts written by characters other than the protagonist of the novel (who writes, or narrates, the novel itself). The first and third are diaries, and the second is a court deposition. But the styles of all three are almost uniform with the style of the protagonist. I can imagine it might be said that this is a translation, but I am basing my observation on traits that survive translation. It's improbable that the two diarists and the accused man writing in custody would have exactly the same chatty style, the same apostrophes to the reader, and the same manner with spoken dialogue. Even phrases are repeated. And it is especially improbable that a police deposition will flower into a long, fairly skillful, first-person narrative with speaking characters, whose pace, style, and mannerisms is such a close match for the novelist's pace, style, and mannerisms. 2. The book's main purpose is to explore the characters of the narrator and her friends and relatives. All are twisted -- made grotesque -- by Japanese society. The narrator herself is grotesque, and so the novel turns on the old but potentially interesting trope of the unreliable narrator. How twisted is she? Can we rely on what she says? It seems that the implied author is actually not very introspective, that she is not the best person to write about these characters. That sounds improbable, I know: anyone who accuses a novelist of being less than introspective will sound suspicious. But consider two things: (a) Several characters in the book are prostitutes, and the book is centrally concerned about why they turned to prostitution, and how the pressures of Japanese society affected that choice. But a reader waits, through hundreds of pages, for some rumination, on the part of any of the characters, about what prostitution does for them. Halfway through the book, there is on brief passage in which one of the diarists considers the issue. It is inconclusive, and isn't followed up. And then, a page from the end of the novel, the narrator reminds us of it, and actually quotes it! As if we could have forgotten! The lines introducing the passage are: ""In her diaries, Yuriko made some interesting comments about prostitution. If you'll indulge me, I will quote them here."" There isn't even an acknowledgment that the imaginary reader might have forgotten the lines; the assumption seems to be that they will have forgotten. But how could any attentive reader forget the only lines in the novel that purport to explain the central problem of the novel? (b) The characters, especially the narrator, tend to identify themselves according to simple types and ideas. The narrator describes her special genius as maliciousness. I did not count the number of times she says that -- it's on the order of fifty or sixty. Now there's nothing wrong with that device: it indicates the narrator has an idee fixe about herself. She makes no progress in understanding herself. But to use that kind of device, it is necessary not to make it seem as if the reader doesn't know it, or might have forgotten it. Here is an example: aside from maliciousness, the narrator also presents herself as a person who is fascinated by people's faces, and the way that traits can be passed on from one generation to the next. We learn that in the first two pages of the book, and whenever she meets someone new she studies their face for signs of their character. So do we really need to be told, on page 298 (!), that ""I was fascinated by the way genes are passed along, the way they are damaged and mutated""? I want to be clear about my claim here: it can work very well to have a character repeat something about herself -- it can indicate stasis, or unawareness, or even dementia -- but here it sounds as if the novelist has an idea about the character -- this is how the character behaves -- and just brings it out each time, hoping the repetition will create a sustaining or evolving or deepening sense of the character. It ends up sounding like the author does not have the imagination to either show us verbatim repetitions as a sign of the ""grotesque,"" or else modulate the appearances of the character's idee fixe so that it can tell us something new about the character with each appearance. It is difficult, and time consuming, to try to express these characteristics. But they are, I think, very important. They are among the differences between an ordinary novelist and someone who really controls the medium....more",Notes are private!,0,5,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1234930.Grotesque

But there are roadblocks to appreciating the book's accomplishment, and they have to do with how Irishness and Danishness are imagined. Higgins inadvertently raises very interesting questions of translation and dialect.(Since Higgins's death in 2015 there have been several assessments of his work. In light of my notes here it's significant that he is taken to be an internationalist, as in this passage from a piece by Neil Murphy in The Irish Times, January 11, 2016: ""Higgins was a citizen of the world long before our current battalions of émigré writers and his works reflected this in ways that even Joyce’s did not. He repeatedly reminds us of the essentially cosmopolitan DNA that features so heavily in the Irish genetic-imaginative code and, more importantly perhaps, that the connection between our lives and the way we talk of them is an endlessly fascinating, mutable process."")1. The letters written by the Danish woman are full of infelicities. To a native English reader with no Danish, they can seem touching, awkward, and sometimes a bit opaque, and that is how I imagine Higgins imagined them. But how do they read to a native speaker of Danish? They do not remind me of errors I hear when I am in Denmark, listening to English being spoken. Do the choices of solecisms make this book effectively unreadable for Danish readers? Why didn't Higgins imagine he might have such readers?2. And if the book were to be translated into Danish, what awkwardnesses would the translator invent? And if it were put into German, how would those awkwardnesses be distinguished from the couple's awkward 'love German'?3. The main character's English is seldom distinctly Irish-English, as in Joyce and even Beckett. That seems to be a conscious decision, made in the name of internationalism, or just out of general fatigue with Irishness. But to a native English speaker who has spent time in Ireland (like me), or to an Irish person, the relative lack of Anglo-Irish inflections and slang is strange: apparently Higgins didn't mind alienating readers who might expect something more Irish in the Irish character, but why didn't he think that alienating Irish readers would be a distraction from his love story? Why didn't he realize that a novel that turns on infelicities of language is necessarily going to make readers sensitive to erasures of language?4. Sometimes the characters write modernist punctuationless stream-of-consciousness prose, or modernist sentence fragments. And why would Higgins think this isn't distracting? I can't imagine him thinking that readers would conclude that free form modernist stream-of-consciousness prose is somehow a natural way of representing passion, as it was, once, for Joyce. The only alternative is that he is just not picturing modernist prose as an historical moment.Higgins seems not to have thought about these things. His focus is on the beauty of his own writing and the love story. For me those are not quite enough to make up for his obliviousness about who, in the real world, might read his book.Addendum, February 26, 2010: here are some thoughts contributed by a Danish correspondent of mine; what she says goes to point no. 1:'Normally it would be easier to read English written by a Dane; it is easier to figure out what was ment. But that's not the case here. Sometimes I am not sure what the sentences mean, and I am not sure if it is because my English is not good enough, if it should be a stylistic touch, or as a 'Danish' mistake (if it is the latter it very often doesn't succeed). ('The unbath child'? p. 34)It annoys me that there are so many relatively complicated sentences and varying words and still it is almost the same -s ending mistakes 'she' makes (like 'you was' p. 35 so many times) (typically a Dane would make many different endings, sometimes remembering the -s and other times putting it where it doesn't belong because we don't have any variation in the jeg er/I am, du er/you are, han/hun er/she/he is...). And when she writes that she doesn't use the dictionary anymore it seems weird that the kind or number of mistakes don't change at all. Her writings seem constructed like 'I was tempty to go down into the green valley' (p. 49). A Dane wouldn't write tempty - the ending in Danish would have been fristet /tempted (a more usual mistake would be temptet). Somewhere she spells 'skin' as 'skinn' and that wouldn't be the mistake of a Dane but a Norwegian. I can't find the quote again, but there is also a spelling mistake in a Danish sentence.There are also a lot of typical Danish mistakes like writing 'His complexion is sickly and sunburned' (p.69) (Danes tend to have problems with or without -ly). But the overall feeling is that it is constructed with some kind of authentic material as the starting point.The German words and sentences seem to me a bit corny (not a love language, but a making love language). I think a Dane would typically find German a bit funny or like a parody when it is used as a 'love language' (there are too many German porn movies here, maybe).I had a feeling of not being the right reader for this book, because the language became an obstacle in an, I think, unintended way. I think he went so deeply into the construction of the text that he forgot or didn't find important to think of the Danish reception. All the mentioning of Denmark and Northern European places, products, names and even the style of writing made me feel like a part of an exotic tribe. I would have guessed the writer to be American if I didn't know his origin.'I'm imagining Higgins would be mortified by that last observation....more",Notes are private!,0,3,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/1255641.Bornholm_Night_Ferry

It's about a man who spends years in a mental asylum in Reykjavik, watching as several of his friends commit suicide. Eventually he kills himself.It is desolate, but I don't think its humor makes it less so. I have the impression the author thinks humor brightens or relieves the tragedy, and several ers have said the same thing. To me, that's a mistaken estimation of the place and power of the kind of gentle absurdism that stands for humor in this book. That kind of simple laugh at fate, embarrassment, coincidence, or circumstance can't possibly lighten the passages in which the author, writing in the voice of a man who is chronically depressed and sometimes schizophrenic, meditates on the emptiness of his mind, of the landscape, and of the few people he knows who are still alive. Even so, ers -- and, I gather, the author himself -- thinks the scattered humorous episodes counterbalance the bleakest images of the sea, the waves, the stars, and the deaths of the narrator's friends. Does that mean he is so used to black imagery that he experiences trivial jokes as relief? Or that he is so entranced by trivial jokes that he gives them a redemptive power? I would have liked this better without the sense that absurdism, surrealism, or humor somehow alleviate the narrator's pain. I have a hard time understanding how the authors thinks about humor: if it is ultimately ineffectual, why keep returning to it? If it is effective, how is it possible to explain how an ocean of unhappiness is brightened by a second-rate joke?For me the most interesting aspect of the novel is its fragmentary narrative. The author, Einar Mar Gudmundsson, begins chapters with anticipations of things to come, and then circles back to explain them. Chains of those cycles constitute the book's structure. Within each cycle the book progresses in page-long or even sentence-long ""pieces"" of narrative: prose poems, narrative fragments, quotations, and scenes separated by white spaces. Some of those ""pieces"" contribute to the stories, or add to our anticipation of what happens next, or help build our sense of the characters. Other pieces are self-contained because they are jokes; they end with punch lines. But there is a third principle at work in the cutting and arrangement of the ""pieces,"" which is the most intriguing: their abrupt transitions and their unfinished feeling are intended as signs of the narrator's mental state. After all, the protagonist is himself suffering from delusions and blackouts, and he was incarcerated for years in a mental asylum. He is an undependable narrator, and the nature of his undependability is exactly what is expressive about the book. It matters that some fragments end where his self-awareness ends, and that others end where his own experiences ended. As we read past those breaks, we are reading into blacked-out spaces and times in his own experience, which can be very poignant. It is the written analogue of listening to someone who is very ill, as they drift in and out of coherent speech. The problem is that I'm not convinced that Gudmundsson is in control of that device. Sometimes the fragments are typical novelist's compositional devices, and sometimes they are vehicles for jokes: it is not always possible to tell if the sudden gap in a story, the sudden change of subject, is intended to express the narrator's mental state, or whether we are to take it as part of the novel's construction. If I could have been sure of that, I might have found this even sadder, more heartbreaking, than other ers have found it....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/462680.Angels_of_the_Universe

The writing is full of solecisms, awkward overstuffed tropes, and poorly managed anachronisms meant to sound ancient or portentous (Lovecraft is the model there).Rick Moody's piece is accomplished and glib. I wonder how quickly the sense of accomplishment fades for a writer like that. Reading it is like watching a sparkler: it's out in seconds. Dennis Cooper's piece is a meditation on the asshole of a 13-year-old boy: it is harsh and strident, and reminds me of a critique of ""The Exorcist"": someone said it was like grain alcohol, very strong but probably not good for you. Is a single strong image really an effective strategy for a text of any length?The rest tends to be weakly imagined fluff, with the usual one-off lines that sprinkle postmodern fiction and make it seem worthwhile: the moment the President comes on TV and shows people it's OK to eat cockroaches; an apocalypse that happens suddenly at the end of a story, when ""a torrent of blood comes crashing through the trees."" (Robert Bradley) The emotions that are depicted in this book are tiny, sharp things that can only be captured haphazardly, in minute quantities, like pins found in a haystack.What I'm saying here isn't new, and could be generalized to a lot of contemporary fiction. Nietzsche's critique of Wagner is a good starting point for understanding work in which a sense of the overall architecture of an artwork has given way to momentary effects, a reliance on local color, what are now called ""minor aesthetic qualities,"" and an artistic sensibility that demands continuous stimulation. Since Nietzsche these issues have been developed by many writers, from Adorno to Karsten Harries, and recently, in a different register, Sianne Ngai.

Ostensibly, it's a serieHow to Create a Text From Appropriated Texts (before Goldsmith)The book ""Genoa,"" included in this collection, is astonishing. Ostensibly, it's a series of quotations from Melville's novels and letters, and from Christopher Columbus's writing and accounts of his voyages. Ostensibly, those quotations are running through the mind of a man who lives in the Midwest, in an old house, pondering questions of writing, travel, gestation, and deformity. (Actually, they're running through the mind of the author, who is Melville's great-grandson and writes at Melville's desk.) Ostensibly, all the man does is think, pace, and smoke cigars. We don't watch him writing, and the quotations supposedly just occur to him. (In this ""Genoa"" is like books by Arno Schmidt, in which characters have outlandish prodigious memories.) Coffee House Press has done a great job designing the pages so that the various quotations are distinguished by indentation, italics, boldface, and font size, looking a bit like a neatened-up scrapbook.But that's the surface. Somewhere the narrator says that he doesn't know how good a writer he is, but he knows he's a great reader. Normally a collection of favorite excerpts is a recipe for fragmentation and reader's inertia. (For insance David Shields's ""Reality Hunger,"" or Goldsmith's ""Capital."") But Metcalf's sense of tone, metaphor, subject, allusion, parallelism, and allegory are bewilderingly supple. Each page presents some new and unexpected form of coherence. Often, reading a quotation from Melville or Columbus, I would first wonder what the point was, and then realize I was being presented with a new species of connection. Metcalf must have been one of modernism's best close readers, and his articulately shifting sense of how passages can be chained together keeps ""Genoa"" going, and gives it both analytic precision and a ""mysterious"" coherence (as a er said).Some of the links between passages put Walter Benjamin's collections to shame. The ""Arcades Project"" is organized by themes, even if Benjamin keeps losing and refinding them. Metcalf is closer to William Carlos Williams's ""Paterson,"" but even that book has motivated sorts of segues. ""Genoa"" is a master class in the weaving of texts. Another intriguing parallel is Reznikoff: his senses of what comprises poetry are similarly fluid and often surprising. In that sense Reznikoff (1894-1976) and Metcalf (1917-1999) might be seen to represent high water marks in the history of appropriation and collage. (It would be interesting to know how a scholar like Wojciech Drąg would incorporate either author into his work; see ""Collage in Twenty-First Century Literature in English,"" 2020.)About halfway through ""Genoa"" we start hearing about the narrator's brother, who was in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp in China. The brother witnessed the horrors that have been so thoroughly documented outside of Japan, and reading about them brings the book, which was already infused with gender-masculine, mid-century, Melville-style metaphors, into harsher lights. From that point to the end, the narrator's pale life and scattered imaginings are all made to work even harder, so they can make contact with the passages on violence.It is an amazing book, the best of its kind (the ""kind"" made of appropriated texts), and needs to be known by everyone who practices modernist collage, postmodern pastiche, appropriation, or found texts--what Marjorie Perloff calls the unoriginal....more",Notes are private!,0,18,1,not set,"May 10, 2016","Oct 09, 2012",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/636959.Paul_Metcalf

I'm interested instead in the moment, common in constrained writing, in which the author names the self-imposed rules under which he wrote.Bök names these at the end of his book: ""All chapters,"" he writes, ""must allude to the art of writing. All chapters must describe a culinary banquet, a prurient debauch, a pastoral tableau and a nautical voyage."" (From the Afterword, called ""The New Ennui."")The language in ""Eunoia"" can be mesmerizing, and it's true that Oulipo-style restrictions can produce unpredictable and fascinating distortions of conventional narrative lines and ordinary usages. Constrained texts owe their hypnotic quality to the fact that a reader may not be able to decipher the tone, the narrative arc, or even the style of the text, because the writing is repeatedly deviated by rules that have nothing to do with conventional narrative. Or to put it another way (this is thanks to John Luna, who read a draft of this essay on Facebook): a new kind of writing emerges despite the constraints. Whether or not the author makes the constraints known, readers will usually know they're reading the result of constrained writing, so an awareness of constraints will temper the reading, accompanying it like a second narrative. The way the actual narrative and that ""second narrative"" of constraints work together depends fundamentally on whether or not the auhor chooses to make the rules known. Within that second possibility, as in Eunoia, there's a fundamental difference between texts whose rules are thematically justified (as in Perec's ""La Disparition,"" where the missing ""e's"" are emblems of what Warren Motte calls ""catastrophe, loss, and mourning"") and hose where the rules are simply stated (as in ""Eunoia""). When rules are announced, but not justified, reading becomes especially complex. As I read, I follow the narrative, which is distorted, truncated, or otherwise modified in many ways by the presence of the rules; at the same time, I am aware of culinary banquets, prurient debauches, pastoral tableaux, and nautical voyages. I understand that those rules are a stratgy to avoid convention and force invention. But I am also aware that the author has decided not to tell me how he chose those rules, apparently because they have no aesthetic, expressive, or biographical relevance. But how is it possible to read a text that is all about expression and aesthetic values, when a part of it (the rules) is expressly excluded from expression and aesthetics? Saying that the exact constraints are immaterial, or that their content is not relevant, is disingenuous to the project of producing an expressive literature, even if it is only ""potential"" (as in Oulipo's definition) or otherwise experimental. The lack of a better justification goes to a blindness or evasion in certain Oulipean practices. It is as if the author or narator is claiming to be able to exclude certain acts of writing from the domain of expression jus by denominating them as rules rather than text. If there's theoretical or critical writing that addresses or jusfities this, I'm not aware of it.Consider for example a reader interested in the passages that ""allude to the art of writing."" Such a reader may feel a momentary annoyance when the narrative swerves to accommodate the ""culinary banquet."" Annoyance and ""chafing"" (one of Robbe-Grillet's words) is integral to the project of Oulipo, but not that particular annoyance. The problem is not that unexpected swerves in the narrative tone or content are faults, it's that the choice of moments when the text swerves to accommodate some rule, and the choice of rules themelves, are not articulated, and there is not reason to suppose those choices aren't both expressive and conventional. Why shouldn't a read assume that the content of the particular rules (""a culinary banquet, a prurient debauch, a pastoral tableau and a nautical voyage"") is entirely conventional?""Eunoia,"" in my reading, would have been even stronger if the choice of mandatory subjects, and the transitions between them, were either motivated as expressive choices, or else defended as anti-aesthetic, rather than merely presented as inscrutable instances of the ""potential"" critique of literary forms. As a reader, I often don't mind annoyance. Often I actually look for it. But I want to know that it resonates with the act of reading, and not just with a loose, unjustified, arbitrary accumulation of generative rules.This is an excellent book, and so are Bok's others. (writingwithimages.com/2-3-christian-b....) But I find myself still unconvinced by the custom, in some constrained writing, of presenting the rules as faits accomplis instead of aesthetic choices. I don't understand why texts like this wouldn't be even more interesting if the authors spoke about their self-imposed constraints as aesthetic and expressive decisions....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/765252.Eunoia

It is clear that he thinks these changes of direction produce meaning, and that their accumulation can lead to deeper meanings. But for me, it's consistently disappointing to see him leading up to one of those moments, and imagining that the result will be expressive or even profound, and then turning, satisfied, to the next episode. The book has a large-scale structure, and was clearly planned in advance, but on the level of the page, it is loose. Epiphanies were managed so much more tightly, and with so much more variety, by Joyce. Even though Marias provides an introspective narrator, there are clearly limits to his self-awareness, and to the implied author's awareness, when it comes to these structures. That lack of self-awareness extends to repeated phrases and images: the implied author knows he is repeating them (he is not an unskilled or unpracticed author), but he believes they are justified by the ebb and flow of inner monologues. The result is loose and usually not believable, like a sloppily sketched painting. I know this  is somewhat abstract, but it's on this level that he fails. If you can stop yourself from seeing how he thinks he is creating deeper meanings, then you can suspend disbelief in the naturalness of his prose.(This is an ""early""  of Marias in English, which I wrote around 2012 and edited in 2020.

One of them spends his time arranging for people to kill themselves. In all of that, and in the author's age (was born in 1968; this was written in 1996) this book owes something to Bret Easton Ellis and other writers of the 1980s (Ellis was born in 1964). A little further back in time, the models are William Burroughs, Sylvia Plath, and Henry Miller. So in terms of urban affect, the book is about fifteen years out of date.But in terms of the author's, and the narrator's, aesthetic choices, the book is massively anachronistic, and the author seems entirely unaware of that fact. He presents his narrator as a person who loves Gustav Klimt and Van Gogh and reads Oscar Wilde. Other time periods play into the plot: the narrator also likes Henry Miller and Sylvia Plath, and the book opens and closes with Romantic painting: in the beginning, it's the ""Death of Marat,"" and at the end, it's Delacroix's ""Death of Sardanapalus.""These visual and literary influences can be divided into three groups. The Romantic paintings are emblems of the desperate passions and romantic suicide that drive the book's plot. Henry Miller and Sylvia Plath are the literary mix that inspires Kim. It's the fin-de-siecle art that is so deeply anachronistic. The author clearly wants us to think of his narrator, and his tastes, as thrillingly nihilistic, scarred, urban, cosmopolitan, and knowing. But the taste for fin-de-siecle painting and prose was typical of the first generations of Chinese, Korean, and Japanese artists who visited Europe beginning in the 1920s (and earlier, in the case of Japan). It is as dusty now as a ""stale cream puff,"" as Ezra Pound described his own early book of poetry, ""A lume spento,"" written earnestly, in Venice, in a kind of nineteenth-century dream.Is it possible to take a book seriously if its imaginative world is so belated, so scattered, so unaware of its anachronism? Can a taste that combines the 1820s, the 1900's, and the 1980s be presented represented seriously, without irony or historical distance? Can characters in their 20's be read sympathetically if the author doesn't realize they are pastiches?

Descriptions are so perfectly judged, incidents so astonishingly well balanced, episodes so impeccably resonant with one another, hints and allusions so delicately poised, psychological insights so bewilderingly sharp, that almost any novelist will seem dull-headed by comparison. I went from ""Desperate Characters"" to a novel by Cees Nooteboom, and I could hardly stomach it: Nooteboom, by comparison, seems hulkish and animalistically unreflective. His prose is blockish and his sense of timing and humor are like crude uncomprehending apings of real wit. It's not his fault: Fox has in dense excess what other novelists sweat to achieve. The number of felicitous, inimitable formulations on each page puts most anyone else to shame (her companions in this sense are perhaps Flaubert, or Joyce). But on the other hand. The reason Jonathan Franzen could write about this book in such superlatives is that he is himself very much a product of the ""New Yorker"" style from the 1970s onward. He is right that the novel can be read and re-read (he says he's read it six times). He's right, too, that it's a kind of model of what novels might be. But one of the Amazon ers, Jay Dickson, is also correct that this novel is very much a product of the style exemplified -- or should I say molded? -- by the ""New Yorker."" And what is wrong with that? Well, it breeds a kind of virtuosity in which a reader is continuously interrupted, and asked to stand back and admire what has just been deployed with such apparently unstudied effortlessness. A number of times reading ""Desperate Characters,"" I wanted to put the book down, stand up, and applaud. But those moments were more or less quickly followed by irritations. I pictured the author, not the narrator, expending a jeweler's attention on every turn of phrase, weighing and considering it until it was at once perfect and brittle. The same happens in Nabokov.Virtuosity at this level is a snake that bites its own tail, and a novel as perfected as ""Desperate Characters"" chews off little pieces of its own plausibility each time it indulges in another coruscating fireworks of outlandishly gorgeous, uncannily insightful, hyper-eloquent, impossibly well-judged description....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,not set,"Sep 12, 2016","Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/526593.Desperate_Characters

[return][return]The book is replete with passages like this; there are examples on every page. That's why it's not boring. It's clever and witty, snide, arch, parodic, droll, and dry. But when I read passages like that, I do not laugh. I do not think they are delightful. I find myself wondering what kind of reader the author was imagining -- what kind of reader would be delighted by that kind of wit. An ideal reader would presumably be taken by the narrator's simpleminded reverie (this book owes a lot to ""Forrest Gump""), and then surprised and amused by the way the reverie spins into absurdity. But what is the source of that delight? [return][return]I spent most of my time wondering about that. I think an answer would have to go something like this: at first, reading a sentence like the one I have quoted, we feel sympathy with the simpleminded narrator, the way we do with Forrest Gump. We are comforted, realizing the author really loves the character, and sees that in his simplemindedness there is also some wisdom. (That's the book's sentimental moral, which comes out at the end.) And we are doubly comforted when we realize we aren't genuises, either, and that in the end we may be more like this narrator than we might like to admit. He is one of the meek, who should inherit the earth, and in certain ways -- ways having to do with humility and a heightened sensitivity to truth -- actually do inherit the earth, even (or especially) if they end up misunderstood or even jailed, as the narrator does. (Think of ""The Green Mile"" or any number of redemptive jail dramas, where a misunderstood convict is actually deeply humble, or even supernaturally gifted.) But then why laugh at the end of the passage, the part about Noah? I think it's because we realize that bit really is silly. Having his narrator think about Noah and then personalize the Flood is obviously crazy, and so it is the author's way of permitting us to stay aloof, to reassure ourselves that we are better than the narrator after all. [return][return]If you think about these things, and ask yourself why passages like the one I have quoted are meant to be funny, then you will not enjoy this novel at all. But it will make you think about why so many dramas about mentally challenged heroes and unrecognized geniuses (think of ""Slingblade,"" ""Powder,"" ""A Beautiful Mind,"" ""Phenomenon"") are so popular.

If Oates really wants to write outside of modern middle class America, she should write like Roussel or Bernhard. Those are two different examples, but they share two crucial traits that show how awkward and artificial ""Zombie"" is: first, they're decisively outside bourgeois values (their characters are the real psychotics, the ones who really don't care about the social fabric); and second, they don't have to work so hard, with every line and image, trying to break out of normalcy. They are already irreparably abnormal. It's not that easy to write outside middle-class values. I wrote essentially the same  about Osamu Dazai's ""No Longer Human.""

Absurdism has a sell-by date. I may once have cried at the end of ""La Strada,"" but I was very young then. The moment in this book when I'm shown that it all comes down to lost objects in a walrus's stomach--the absurdist reveal--is no longer a revelation or an unexpected and bracing comfort, and so it's also not something that entertains me.Another reason why a reader might give up before the end is Ugresic's unresolved relation to nostalgia and kitsch. She uses both without reserve, and sometimes meditates on her boundless fidelity to both. In one passage she writes:""With its heavy, mournful wing, the angel of nostalgia brushes aside the demons of irony."" (p. 29)""The Museum of Unconditional Surrender"" trades in ironies, but actually they are brushed aside by the heavy, mournful nostalgia that pervades the entire book. The title is a good example. The fact that Ugresic doesn't think of her irony as ineffectual and her nostalgia as heavy is also difficult for me to understand.Later in the book there's an interesting passage on kitsch. She is writing about snow globes (emblems of both kitsch and nostalgia), and she remarks:""Some time later many magic balls were thrown out of homes (for some reason they had been declared kitsch)."" (p. 65)This makes it sound as if they are not kitsch, but they are, and it is not at all clear why she thinks they aren't. She herself calls them ""magical objects,"" which contained ""tiny towns,"" ""as tiny and distant as another planet."" So, re-reading the passage, I have to conclude she doesn't think of her own reaction as kitsch. She apparently experiences her reaction as something like wonder or sincerity, and her parenthetical statement is intended to bracket away any doubt. But that just can't be plausible for readers in a book written in 1996.So to read this book as I think it was intended, it's necessary to accept the idea that deep, effectively limitless suffering is best conveyed by nostalgia, touches of absurdism and surrealism, a sweet acceptance of kitsch, and an ineffective but pervasive irony. I can't do that....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,"Dec 21, 2022","Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/328093.The_Museum_of_Unconditional_Surrender

The translators seem to think that people can still ""ejaculate"" with surprise -- I know they're English, but are they also Edwardian? That kind of slip-up is fatal to a book whose strings are pulled as tight as Viewegh's. And at the end, a grammatical error mars one of the book's very rare moments of seriousness: a quotation -- for once, not snide or otherwise suspect -- from Daniela Hodrova: ""I write a novel in order to preserve the living but also to lead out of oblivion the past and my own dead, to rescue myself from it.""

Several ers have seen this as a narrative of self-discovery and ""awakening,"" but Kathrine, the principal character, doesn't develop through the book, and she never has significant insights about herself. Most of her life, and the lives of the people she meets, are spent not thinking about themselves. In that respect this belongs more with Beckett's ""Ill Seen Ill Said"" than with novels of discoveries. Other ers have thought this is a book about a journey, but Kathrine's first trip south of the Arctic Circle doesn't occupy more than a quarter of the book. Stamm makes a point of saying the things Katherine photographs in France are nondescript, and she forgets the subjects of her photographs soon after she returns.The book suffers from some of the common problems of indirect narration in minimalism. At times it's hard to believe Kathrine's lack of introspection, especially because the author of the book -- who is managing the narration of a character who isn't reflective -- is clearly introspective himself. It's not hard to believe in a character like Kathrine, who drifts from one encounter to another. It is more difficult to suspend disbelief that a character who can encounter, and describe, people as sharply drawn as Thomas and his family could also be as unaware of herself as Stamm wants us to imagine her as being. At other times the book shows the commonplace signs of the writer's craft, which can be concealed in fuller, maximalist narratives, but tend to show through in minimalism. There's a scene in which Kathrine tries to imagine herself as a liar, making up stories (that's what novelists do, and sometimes it leaches into the story when characters are said to be trying to invent things, and having the same troubles that their narrators know so well); a scene in which a woman in a hotel doesn't speak, so it's necessary to guess about her past (that often happens to novelists, who can't always get rich background information on interesting people they encounter, so they have to make things up; again, it leaks into the narrative here); and scenes of traveling in which the details have clearly been noted as Stamm experienced them (episodes set on trains, with the usual paucity of characteristic details, caused simply by the limited time Stamm spent on such trains while thinking about this book). It fits ""Unformed Landscape"" that the descriptions of Finnmark are threadbare; but it is also a sign of the short time Stamm seems to have spent there. Compare the dim recollections of dim summers in this book with the dense, rich description in Vollmann's ""The Rifles.""This amounts to saying that a book about a dimly perceived life, in a dim part of the world, should either be more strictly minimalist, or should permit its central character a greater richness of inner life: a problem inherent in minimalist treatments of minimal lives....more",Notes are private!,0,8,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/440836.Unformed_Landscape

But why would such a character be interesting? The kind of reader who would be satisfied by a book like this would have to feel a need to simplify character: to such a reader, people would appear unhelpfully or uninterestingly complex in real life, or in other novels, and so it would be desirable to find the most basic types of people. The intricacies of psychology, morals, and ethics would have to appear as deceptive, irrelevant, or even dangerously ill-conceived. There would be a fear of ambiguity and weakness, of moral and social entanglement, and of relationships. All those apparent problems are easily solved by a characters so unavailable to society that they can only appear as heroes or a villains.[return][return]In terms of writing, Leonard has a special interest in brief moments of decisive action. He expands them, in slow motion, and that produces a characteristic effect of drama: but why is he interested in them to begin with? Maybe he feels, somehow, that real human interaction takes places in those compressed moments. But of course it doesn't: it takes place slowly, painfully, incrementally, over lifetimes.

An essay in the form of a novel, ruined, a little, by its plotThis is a stupendous character portrait, marred by a cliche plot of financial downfall. I agree with Brian Verigan that ""Walser's hero is... a nobody with drastically limited prospects. He not only knows that and has accepted it, he embraces it."" But it bears saying that the reason the apprentice's prospects are limited is that he is a little simple-minded, and he realizes that, partially and intermittently, throughout the novel. It's a difficult trick for a novelist: a slightly limited, partly unintelligent narrator can often result in a schematic narrative, in which we are more amused or detached than immersed and engaged. That happens, for example, in ""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,"" which at times becomes a literary trick or puzzle. But in this book the narrator also has an enormous capacity to understand people, an inherent kindness, and a joy in his natural surroundings. At the same time, each of those capacities is limited: he loves his employer somewhat helplessly, even though he sees some of his employer's flaws; he is kind, but his kindnesses are often ineffectual; he loves nature, but in an unreflective way. And he is aware, sometimes, of each of these traits in himself. He loves to eat and sleep and walk in the countryside: those are his certainties. He is also deeply concerned with injustices and social infelicities: those are his ongoing interests. The rest is all a cloud: he knows he has no ambition, but he never succeeds in thinking very much about that fact; and he knows that he probably has only a little cleverness, but he doesn't have the energy to keep his mind on that problem long enough to do anything about it. It's a lovely psychological portrait of a partly simple person who is also deeply reflective. Yet I think the book is also flawed. The tremendous psychological portrait of a person who has some kinds of intelligence and not others is partly ruined by a distracting plot about the plunging finances of the apprentice's boss. We're compelled to worry about his household finances and increasingly angry creditors. The plot resembles an Hollywood movie of Walser's generation or pulp fiction, with their stock figures of drunkards, bank managers, and suspicious townspeople. Through all of that, Walser continues to develop the remarkable character of the assistant, as if the machinery of financial ruin were somehow necessary to bring out the assistant's character. But it isn't, and the novel would have been more focused and convincing, more a masterpiece, if Walser had had the confidence to concentrate on the assistant. After all, he was given a quiet, unchanging character, so why have an off-the-shelf narrative of ruination blaring in the background? I wonder if this isn't part of the general problem of the ""novel-essay"" in the 1920s and 1930s, which has been written about by Stefano Ercolino, Sianne Ngai, and others: the way ""plot"" and ""narrative"" increasingly appeared to be artificial, and were contrasted against plotless ""essays"" on character, theories, and many other things, until the novel itself stalled. Plot became machinery, and then distraction, and finally obstruction—but the narratives that it obstructed were themselves immobile: they were essays in human character and situation that were incompatible with temporal development....more",Notes are private!,-1,17,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/335333.The_Assistant

I have a long and hopefully thoughtful assessWhat Does It Mean, Exactly, To Say You've Read This Book?(This is a first impression of New Impressions. I have a long and hopefully thoughtful assessment here.)First, I think it must mean that you have already read 'How I Wrote Certain of My Books,' 'Locus Solus,' and 'Impressions of Africa': that is, you are thoroughly immersed, hypnotized, pithed by Roussel's unimpeachable and unapproachable weirdness. Then, I think it should mean you have read something about Roussel: Foucault's book, or possibly Mark Ford's sober appreciation.But then what can it possibly mean to read a book that keeps opening parentheses (like this ((and then parentheses within those, like this (((or this))) apparently endlessly (((and not at all always rationally ((((or so it seems)))) )))) )) ), playing arcane word games, making unconsciously ridiculous similes, proposing utterly opaque allusions, proposing the reader stop to cut the intentionally uncut octavo pages, and posing book-length puzzles that can never be solved because they aren't even (proper) puzzles. Even that sentence is easiest to read by plowing straight through. If I try to read it according to the order of the parentheses, I need to parse it carefully, and that is at once tedious and nearly always unrewarding.Here are the two obvious ways that 'New Impressions of Africa' proposes that it be read.1. Read straight through, including footnotes whenever they appear.2. Read the way the surrealist's machine for turning the pages of the book supposedly worked: i.e., read to the opening of the first parentheses, find the place where that parenthesis closes, read from there to the end of the canto, return to the opening of the parenthesis, read (skipping interpolated parentheses), etc. -- until you have read the very last quintuple-nested parenthesis.The first kind of reading cannot yield the sense of any canto, because the logic, the argument -- whatever it should be called -- will be impossible to follow. The second raises two further possibilities:2a. Read mechanically, assiduously, skipping nothing, but reading in the moment, taking in each new stanza or couplet or page as it presents itself.2b. Read as you would read a piece of argumentative non-fiction, or a detective story: that is, try to keep the argument, or logic, or story, or grammar in mind as you go.I propose this last is the real challenge of the book, and I see almost no evidence that critics have tried it: and yet I think the logic and structure of the book itself makes such a reading just barely possible, and therefore necessary. I claim to have read Canto 2, 'The Battlefield of the Pyramids,' in this way, keeping the logic of the entire canto in mind as I read. It opens with three nested arguments in the space of half a page: a description of a coat (then a parenthesis opens, and inside it begins a description of a scarecrow, as an allegory of faith ((then a double parenthesis opens, and inside it a meditation on the cross apparently begins)) ); the first two arguments end where the parentheses close, on the last page of the canto. It was possible for me, one afternoon, to keep the entire top-heavy, preposterously artificial, tottering, twisted, perverse, inhuman argument in mind at once. At that moment -- which is now long gone -- I felt I had expended the effort Roussel demanded, and found my way to a new kind of rigor. A useless rigor for any other text, of course, but that is as close as I can imagine to what it could mean to say I have read the book....more",Notes are private!,0,15,1,not set,"Jul 16, 2013","Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/405238.New_Impressions_of_Africa

There is a long biographical introduction, which does not solve problems of interpretation. For example there is this lovely poem:[return][return]My body will somewhere fall[return]by the wayside into a state of[return]sleep and more sleep --[return]like the dew that each night appears,[return]then falls from roadside grasses.[return][return]This stands out among dozens of others because of the specificity of its simile. But that specificity may be an illusion, brought to the poem by my Western reading habits: I see it as more particular than tropes in other poems, because I picture the leaves of grass bending slightly, and the drops drooping, and I think of those as figures for exhaustion, made poignant by the lightness of drops of water. But perhaps I'm only supposed to be thinking of the raindrops' ephemerality and anonymity.[return][return]Another example, said to be Saigyo's most famous poem:[return][return]I thought I was free[return]of passions, so this melancholy[return]comes as a surprise:[return]a woodcock shoots up from marsh[return]where autumn's twilight falls.[return][return]The translation permits two readings: in one, the melancholy is what's figured by the image of the woodcock and the marsh, and together they comprise the writer's mood; in the other, surprise is what is figured, and melancholy is previous and unexplained. The gloss doesn't discuss this, and introduces a completely different idea:[return][return]""What happens in the scene of the darkening marsh is is reflected in the person of the poet, someone in whom, fortunately, long and arduous practice had not taken away the capacity to respond emotionally to a sudden manifestation of beauty."" (p. 68)[return][return]I can't understand this, or how the author, William LaFleur, could think it is an adequate interpretation. If it is right, then the woodcock in the autumn marsh means only beauty, and neither surprise nor melancholy play any determinate part.[return][return]Perhaps I'm thinking too much like William Empson, but unless I can understand the basic ground rules of interpretation, it doesn't help to be told Saiygo sounds ""medieval"" in comparison to Basho, and it certainly doesn't help to be given a long biography of the poet. For all I know, I'm reading into translations that themselves read into, or even past, the poet.[return][return]And ""Awesome Nightfall,"" as a title, does not do anything for my confidence in these translations.

Is there really any value to this thing we call... living?""Those lines are from the anime version (2016- ) of a manga called ""Bungo Stray Dogs"" (2012- ), which has characters named after Japanese authors. The Bungo Stray Dogs wiki website identifies Dazai's ability as ""No Longer Human,"" a power to reverse other characters' powers.What's interesting here is the continued—if attenuated and indirect—presence of Dazai's book in contemporary Japanese culture. In the anime the character seems outside of bourgeois life, but he doesn't actually become inhuman because he's androgynous, glamorous, polite, and empathetic. Curiously, that same ambivalence about taking the final step (not toward suicide, but away from being human) haunted Dazai's other novels, as Martin points out. In ""The Flowers of Buffoonery,"" the characters ""won't allow themselves to comprehend the enormity"" of one character's culpability. As Martin says, it's as if Dazai didn't quite know what to do with his invention.I wonder if ""No Longer Human"" and its wonderful new incarnations are so widely popular because they play at being inhuman but keep to the forms and values of settled culture and functioning society.

After reading ""Wittgenstein's Mistress,"" I was eager to see what else Markson had done. This novel, judged just for itself, is extremely weak: it depends on a ploy, which Markson announces: he will keep himself out of the book as much as possible, and fill it instead with facts and anecdotes about painters, composers, and writers. But the few passages about ""Novelist,"" as he calls himself, seem random - and not in an aleatoric, combinatorial, Oulipean, or Cagean sense. They are simply weakly imagined. The anecdotes, which fill the book, are often stories about unrecognized fame: a plausible but unpromising and uninteresting subject for an aging, relatively unrecognized novelist. Others are stocks-in-trade of the arts and humanities. (I am neither objecting to Markson's erudition or praising it. I seem to write this a lot: but any  that refers to an author's erudition is going to be off the mark, because the imaginary ideal reader should be the one to whom the erudite references are all known, and therefore not erudite. The question then remains: are they interesting references?)So the book itself is disappointing, but I am sadder that this book partly ruined Markson's ""Wittgenstein's Mistress"" for me, because it shows that the desperate self-control of the narrator in that book is actually an easy fabrication comprised of strings of random references. The Wittgensteinian feel of that book depends very much on the illusion that there is an ""investigation,"" in Wittgenstein's sense, of whatever facts the narrator can remember. But ""The Last Novel"" shows that the parallels, resonances, and recurring references are loosely done and mainly fortuitous. In addition -- most damaging for me -- the few references to Wittgenstein in ""The Last Novel"" show Markson knows, actually, very little about Wittgenstein, so little that I doubt he even intended the narrator in ""Wittgenstein's Mistress"" to be exploring the kind of ""investigation,"" or experiencing the kind of linguistic and logical isolation, that I take it Wittgenstein experienced. On p. 44, for example, the ""Novelist"" notes""Wittgenstein's shockingly limited aesthetic sensibilities in every area except music. His virtual consecration of third-rate American pulp fiction detective stories, for instance.""Aside from the dubiousness of that first sentence (what about architecture? what about Wittgenstein's patronage of Trakl?) the second sentence betrays a deep misunderstanding. Wittgenstein loved detective comics (not even just ""stories"") because they were antidotes to thinking. He would have hated those sentences.

The people respond by living indolent lives as savage drunks and louts: but at the same time they are stupendously well-educated in the deep riches of Russian culture, and even when they are stuporously drunk they swim naturally in literary and historical anecdotes. People are romantic, funny, and talkative precisely because they know it is pointless to be romantic, funny, and talkative.

But from the point of view of a reader brought up more on Beckett than Dostoevsky, the glitter and swill of sloshing, effervescent, pointless conversations about hope that people no longer have, romantic yearnings they hardly recognize, and culture that they despair of ever actually living, is all inappropriate. It's like someone dying on the street wearing a stage costume with feathers and baubles: it's maudlin and tiring to insist on frenetic empty celebration when emptiness itself is at hand.And so despite all the acid wit, all this is old -- old Russian humor and social criticism, which never worked, which might not even have produced much solace, and whose pyrotechnics only became harsher, not more beautiful, after Dostoevsky and Gorky.

The narrator is a boy, but then again, he might be a girl: that's strange enough, because the ambiguity is managed offhandedly -- someone refers to the protagonist as ""he,"" and someone else as ""she."" (The offhandedness of references to gender outdoes Yann Martel's recent attempt at similar insouciance.) The child is offered a strawberry ice cream. It's a special treat, because he, or she, has never had ice cream. He, or she, nearly gags on it, and Aira's description is intense and nauseating. The father doubts his son (or daughter), argues angrily with her, and then tastes the ice cream himself--and realizes it's poison. And then the father flies into a rage and kills the ice-cream vendor. After that very memorable start the book unravels, or rather, Aira relaxes into a sequence of set-pieces that could have been independent short stories. It's a Bildungsroman, and you follow the little girl, or boy, through various adventures to an ending that aspires to be as willfully strange as the opening.Aira is a stupendously talented storyteller, and I used to read everything of his that was translated. (My reasons for dropping off are in other s.) In this case, the form is episodic for no clear reason, and the eccentricities are artificially concocted. I'd argue that the problem here is the lingering pernicious influence of magic realism. This isn't magic realism, because nothing is supernatural, and it's programmatically unromantic and unsentimental. But it's determinedly quirky and persistently exaggeratedly eccentric, and those traits, I think, are leftovers -- echoes -- of the frissons and surrealist pleasures of magic realism. Aira writes quickly, and without revising, and so his books are unusually uneven; given that working method, magic realism isn't always a help.

Sometimes they are, but often they aren't, and they keep coming, page after page.

In the final paragraph, the narrator sees ""a group of bicycles wrapped in plastic sheets,"" ""parked outside like a herd of calves."" And she adds: ""Perhaps the ghosts of calves killed in railway accidents sneaked out at night to gather by the station for a chat.""If this were the beginning of the story, or if calves killed in railway accidents had a greater role in the story (they have a momentary role), then this might be compelling as an image. But it's not: it's distracting and exhausting, for two reasons. First because it shows that Tawada could just keep going with surrealist images indefinitely; and second because it's apparent she likes the image: she's proud of it, and she thinks her ability to come up with tropes like this is one of her strengths, or even her principal strength, as a writer.I might read more of her work. because two of the three stories here have a core of genuine self-alienation. They are driven by unaccountable judgments, both on the part of the narrator and those around her, and Tawada's sense of sexuality is persistently weirdly affectless, even though that persistence is itself almost impossible to take seriously.

""Eunoia"" is a more consistent book, but raises some of the same issues.Four reactions to this book, arranged pseudo-scientifically, like Bök's arrangements, leading from local to larger-scale issues.1. The ghost of Escher From an art historical or art critical point of view, it's a bad sign that the book begins with a page-long quotation from Escher, who has invariably been a sign of a certain misunderstanding of modernisms and postmodernisms. Escher is popular with chemists—he still appears in introductory textbooks, which is appropriate for this book—but not with people engaged with current possibilities of the image. From an expressive standpoint, the epigraph signals the likelihood that Bök will be engrossed in structural games, and that those games and rules might owe more to Escher's kind of compulsive mathematized imagination than to concerns that stem from Oulipo or conceptual poetry. There are a number of passages in the book where Bök's games seem compulsive in Escher's particular, emotionally stunted, myopically neurotic, algorithmically limited, aesthetically adolescent fashion. Even in the graphics—especially the mylar graphic—it's not possible to imagine much other than an author unreflectively obsessing about the placement of X's in page-layout software. (What is the difference between Escher's unpleasantly narrow experiments, which have exiled him from the narratives of modernism, and Roussel's wonderfully narrow experiments, which have put him at the center of stories about modernism?)2. The role of crystallographyI come at this book with some knowledge of crystallography: I know Haüy, Bravais, birefringence, and crystal classes. I'm aware that bringing a specialized knowledge to a book that does not demand that knowledge of its readers is risky and usually irrelevant. (I'm also aware that the book isn't about crystallography.) But this knowledge does yield several things that are pertinent to a general reading. (a) I can see how, in some sections, Bök is trying to find verbal equivalents to crystallographic facts, and fails. The way he fails is significant. In the poem ""Birefringence,"" he tries to conjure interference colors by comparing them to stained glass, ""gasoline rainbows,"" ""iridescent / insects,"" and several other things. The result, for someone who knows the colors, is insufficient; and for someone who doesn't, the result is scattered in an illegible fashion: that is, the illegibility appears to be rule-driven and its obscurity related to language games, but actually it is caused by limitations in the author's descriptive power.(b) In the poem on Miller, Bök makes what I experience as a half-hearted attempt to conjure Miller indices (comparing them to the Dewey decimal system): what matters is that I can see this is half-hearted, because of the impossibility of conjuring something like Miller's system: Bök knows the attempt is tepid, but that he doesn't need to be more precise because his readers will not judge that aspect of the book—but poems like the one on Miller demonstrate how loosely he regards his crystallographic master metaphor: a looseness that is not at all projected by the book. I wonder if the book could have been even stronger if he had found a way to signal the looseness of his attachment to his non-poetic sources.(c) Specialist knowledge is also pertinent because the book's appeal should not, even from Bök's point of view, depend on the hundreds of polysyllabic technical terms: their exoticism and opacity can't be the central strength or indispensable strategy of the book. When those terms aren't opaque (for readers who know some crystallography), they reveal themselves more clearly as inexact references chosen in accord with very loose criteria: they are used to suggest global parallels with some poetics, or to provide Greek- or Latin-sounding obstructions to the text. (Incidentally, there is a similarity between Bök's taste in crystallographic illustration and mine. When I first read this book I suspected he had taken two illustrations from a book of mine, ""Domain of Images,"" which has a chapter of crystallography, which is also, like this book, one of the few texts on crystallography that is not intended as a contribution to science. Bök reproduces two very obscure images I also have in my book on pp. 119 and 129. But Bök's book was published in 1994, before mine, so it's evidence of a similar sense of what counts as an interesting crystallographic image.)3. Emotional passagesThere is one section of the book, ""Diamonds"" (p. 64), that is self-contained and different from the rest of the book. ""Diamonds"" purports to be about the author's father, a diamond cutter. It is affectively direct, and scientifically minimal. It isn't a flaw, in a book about flaws, to have a section that's separate: but it is problematic to have that difference consist in directly emotional and even confessional prose, and to have that direct appeal to feeling be tied to a dilution of the scientific poetics, because that means the other sections—most of the book—require science in order not to speak directly about emotions, and that, I think, is not Bök's purpose.4. Self-imposed rules The fundamental issue in all these points (1, 2, 3) is the role played by self-imposed rules: the master trope of crystallography, and the many smaller rules that govern how individual concepts and people are articulated as poetry. My concern here is the irregular application of those rules, and the kinds of occasions and contexts where Bök permits himself to bend or suspend the rules. As in ""Eunoia,"" the rule-bound construction of the book is continuously undermined by clearly aesthetic choices, freely made, which are themselves almost always the result of specific late-romantic and modernist allegiances. Sometimes Bök sounds like Celan (""Bleeding away / ages of images,"" p. 30), sometimes Bachelard (""A crystal is the flashpoint of a dream intense / enough to purge the eye of its infection, sight,"" p. 37), sometimes A.R. Ammons or his admirer the chemist Roald Hoffmann (""A word (like love) has a high refractive index,"" p. 37). Much of this material is late romantic, including typical romantic natural science interests like abyssal creatures and invertebrates (""lammelibranchs, coelenterates. / the lost animalculae from alien seas"" (p. 47). The specter of Escher returns whenever the rules appear to be constructed by the author in order to articulate his own repetition compulsions: ""any path that you take / breaks from its route / in the way that a root / word, when said, gets / tangled in its ganglia"" (p. 44). This is rum poetry, driven by a nearly autistic sort of compulsion, much like the long lists of supposedly similar things in Roussel's ""New Impressions of Africa."" All these non-rule-bound emulations and aesthetic choices distract from the book's rule-bound, self-proclaimed metaphoric purpose. As in ""Eunoia,"" I wish he had either presented these as also rule-bound (""I choose Celan because he is the poet of the crystal fragment,"" etc.) or purged them from the text in favor of echoes and allusions that remain illegible....more",Notes are private!,0,0,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/160749.Crystallography

All that is tremendously enjoyable, especially moments when the ventriloquism becomes suddenly so strong that the reader comes to an awareness of their own previous awareness of the ways the character had been evoked. For example: one of the characters, Astrid, is a twelve-year-old girl; she uses the expression 'id est' and 'i.e.' way too much, and slightly inaccurately. Then, all of a sudden, we hear her rehearsing the 'meaning' of 'id est' as part of her inner monologue, and it turns out she not only doesn't understand it (as we suspected), but she doesn't understand that her explanation isn't an definition (she just says 'i.e.' comes from 'id est'). The realization that the author knows her character does not know she does not understand the idea of a definition, and that her misunderstanding is what generates her solecisms, is itself a higher-order misunderstanding than we might have thought. (We would have expected an inaccurate definition, something like ""id est means 'that'."") So we think back on our own previous sense of the character's awareness of herself, and realize it wasn't as prescient as the author's.Okay, that's a bit abstract: but it is what happens as I read some passages, and it's what gives them their uncanny verisimilitude.On another level I was less persuaded by the book. Reviewers tend to note that the central character, Amber, is never clearly defined, and that is certainly right and also intentional. But the manner of her ill-definition is actually quite clear, sometimes too clear for me. Amber is (a) a typical figure of a person with intense unaccountable insight, whose function is to perceive, empathize, and heal, and (b) a typical figure of a person who is inexplicably good at sizing people up in order to rob them either physically or emotionally. The difficulty I had with this is that these two are both, by themselves, familiar, and their juxtaposition doesn't produce any new or special meaning....more",Notes are private!,0,4,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/127630.The_Accidental

Sebald and Susan Sontag, and whose author -- and his amazing translator -- can write sentences like this:""To be wise, however, soberly to anticipate what might lie in store, was truly no easy task, for it was as is some vital yet undetectable modification had taken place in the eternally stable composition of the air, in the very remoteness of that hitherto faultless mechanism or unnamed principle -- which, it is often remarked, makes the world go round and of which the most imposing evidence is the sheer phenomenon of the world's existence -- which had suddenly lost some of its power, and it was because of this that the troubling knowledge of the probability of danger was in fact less unbearable than the common sense of foreboding that soon anything at all might happen and that this 'anything' -- the law governing its likelihood becoming less apparent in the process of disintegration -- was leading to greater anxiety than the thought of any personal misfortune, thereby increasingly depriving people of the possibility of coolly appraising the facts."" But the problem with the book is also contained in this sentence, which occurs just one page after the beginning. The first third of the book builds a dense atmosphere of uncertainty, as we are introduced at first to a very common stereotype of a paranoid haute-bourgeois woman whose main pleasure is her hermetically sealed apartment and whose main fear is mainly being stared at in trains, but then to increasingly unprecedented characters who don't seem to follow any clear models -- a young man who cares only for the heavens, and senses only the sublime, but isn't a poet and can't articulate much of what he feels, and who runs randomly through the town like Wozzeck; and a reclusive, self-deluding retired music teacher who has increasingly unpersuasive gems of unhelpfully abstract wisdom based on a threadbare nihilism he derived, improbably, from the study of equal temperament -- and we follow those very different sorts of characters, who would normally occupy different books (the woman would be in a social satire; the ineloquent young man in a sequel to ""Wozzeck,"" the decrepit sage to some draft by Beckett) as they move through a small Hungarian town that is prone to a series of apparently unrelated, sometimes meaningless events (a tree falls, at first diagonally onto a building across the street; people in the distance may or may not be beating someone; it hasn't snowed for a long time; cats are increasingly feral; someone may or may not be following someone else); the whole flows along in a paragraphless prose that the translator describes as ""a slow lava flow of narrative.""All that is wonderful, and reminded me of Buechner, Gogol, Kafka, Musil, Canetti, and above all Bernhard. It wanders in intention and in meaning, just as its characters wander back and forth, and so I can also see why Sebald liked it. But then everything begins to turn on a mysterious ""prince"" (who is really some sort of circus freak; he initially came to down inside an enormous metal trailer that also held a stuffed whale) whose followers embody a kind of meaningless desire for destruction or limitless action that has echoes of Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and later nihilisms and anarchisms. Why is that disappointing? Because Beckett and Bernhard both demonstrated that moral, ethical, eschatological uncertainty is what counts, not the plot devices that drive that uncertainty, and certainly not whatever flimsy ""explanations"" there might be for the uncertainty. The sentence I quoted, together with the unaccountably blurred characters, are parts of a fictional imagination that is much more dangerous and fascinating than the Ray Bradbury-esque evil ""prince of darkness"" and his inexplicably demented followers. The world Krasznahorkai conjures at the beginning is so much darker than the one he eventually explains away with the paraphernalia of a circus. The lesson of Beckett and Bernhard would seem to be easy to learn, especially for someone like Krasznahorkai who has so clearly experienced many varieties of nameless unease, but for some reason authors like Krasznahorkai, and so many others all the way to Bradbury and King, feel they need the machinery of a plot, the comfort of explanations. I does not help at all that the ""prince"" remains mysterious. He damages the book simply by appearing in it. The title of Krazhnahorkai's newly translated book, ""War and War,"" promises better: but then again so does ""The Melancholy of Resistance,"" which could more accurately have been called ""The Prince of Darkness and the Whale.""On the other hand, the last pages of the book are stupendous. They are an extended allegory of the dissolution of the world, couched as a forensic report on the decay of a corpse -- the same haute-bourgeois woman who opened the novel. It is a spectacular ending, as unexpected in its literal anatomizing as the end of ""Jules and Jim.""...more",Notes are private!,0,14,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/119512.The_Melancholy_of_Resistance

As I write this paragraph, in early spring 2020, I have just finished reading all Bernhard's major texts and many of the minor ones. The idea was to see if I could work through him, if I could get to the point where I would not only no longer take pleasure in the vitriol--I imagined, correctly, that after a point it isn't especially entertaining to be told how many things in the world are appalling--but also somehow perceive his choices as limitations. At the end of this note I'll add a thought about how that went.)This is my fifth and just possibly my last book by Bernhard. He is stupendous, but the problem he raises for me is: When is it time to stop reading him? I haven't got a clear idea about that, but I think it might hinge on whether or not you laugh when you read him. When he piles impossible disaster on implausible condemnation, when each sentence pronounces a verdict more tar-black, more hopeless, more sweeping, more disconsolately angry than the last, do you laugh? I do. I do not think he intends me to. I laugh because after all, how could a twentieth-century writer go on as if he were Jeremiah? Or as if he were Zola, railing against the suffering of the working classes? Or even as if he were Beckett, but burdened with memories Beckett never had, and crippled with an incurable disease, and with an imagination sharpened by an even more shriveled sense of anything outside of complete disaster? So I laugh when the next sentence outdoes the one before. I keep reading, and I am swept along, but still some little damage is done by each laugh. Because if you laugh enough, even tidal waves of half-drowned despair and bile become ridiculous. And after an entire book, or several books, the cascading unstoppable sulphuric vitriol starts sounding a little silly. It doesn't sound wrong or misguided (and in particular it does not sound insane) but it sounds, simply, a bit silly.That has something to do with why I feel like I'm finished reading him. But he is stupendous. There has to be a good reason to stop reading such a person.(And now, having read twenty or more of his books, letters, interviews, texts newly translated online, and prize essays, I appreciate him quite differently. I no longer take much pleasure in his judgments about people and places, even when they risk absurdity in order to be more exquisitely dark, rude, and uncomromising than anyone else's opinions ever have been. I experience the books as unspoolings. The characters and situations are indefinitely permutable, and so are the lodestars of his imagination, Goethe, Wittgenstein, Wright, Mendelssohn, Gould. In that specific sense he did not compose books: he unwound them. As I read, I became aware of that act itself as a limitation: he was confined, as it were, by that thread. Even as I read the last few of his books, I was often amused to follow the thread into someone's demented brain, into their damaged lung, down a tunnel of helpless copulsions, into a wrecked benighted ruined house in a disastrous Austrian village, but I was always following, and the thread seldom broke, and in the end there were more things to do than follow threads.

Russian and French avant-garde works mix with mid-twentieth century American fiction, with an emphasis on Jewish-American themes, World War II memoirs, and women writers. It's a version of the ""New York Review of Books"" itself, with an admixture of Bookforum-style internationalism. By printing central and Eastern European avant-garde fiction along with some surrealism, the series also replicates the conventional interests of North American departments of art history, where surrealism and Cubo-futurism continue to be expected specialties. (It would be interesting to make a graph of the birth dates of the authors in the NYRB list: I imagine they were writing mainly in the period 1920-1970.) Any sense of that larger historiographic and cultural context, and any hope of locating Platonov in relation to it, is blurred by Tatyana Tolstaya's unhistorical and poetic introduction.She bills Platonov as an author with ""no literary predecessors,"" who writes ""as though no one before him had ever written anything"" (pp. ix, x). That is a kind of literary wishful thinking, which might have a function for Tolstaya in her own writing, or perhaps in a sort of generic sense of Russian literature that doesn't notice generational difference. Platonov was in the grip of historical ideals and fantasies; Tolstaya, here, is in the grip of ahistorical fantasy, perhaps one specific to Russian literature.Platonov's predecessors are the Russian avant-garde, including absurdists and existentialists. Tolstaya says Platonov ""never uses... narrative... in a conventional way,"" and that he ""continually undermines the reader's expectations."" But that is only true if the reader's expectations are based mainly on nineteenth-century Russian writing like Chekhov's or Tolstoy's. It's not that Platonov's narratives defy expectations, it's that they make continuous, deliberate, slight deviations from what would have been an expected norm. The effect is not unlike Georges Perec's experiment in ""Life: A User's Guide."" Tolstaya accurately calls Platonov's experiments in form ""microdeviations."" (p. x) What keeps these experiments interesting is the reasoning that apparently drives the microdeviations. Platonov sometimes thinks like a fin-de-siecle short story writer, inserting fragmentary or truncated vignettes, deliberately swerving aside from full psychological portraits, subverting what he clearly imagines are readers' expectations of completed narratives. All that is just part of the history of the short-story form. What makes Platonov different is that some of the microdeviations are made for entirely different reasons: he is in thrall of a certain kind of collectivism and utopianism, and he sometimes writes for, and even writes as, a collective future. He is also hypnotized by the spells of new science, which for him takes two forms: dreams of infinite electric power, inspired largely by Tesla and by large industrial projects; and dreams of railroads, which inhabit his mind as much as they transfix his characters. Both electric power and railroads are animated presences in these stories, capable of collective good but also of unpredictable and inexplicable destruction. They have the power to galvanize men and sometimes women (with ""galvanize"" taken in the original meaning -- the characters are shocked into precipitous action or perpetual stasis). Tolstaya says Platonov's characters inhabit ""a cosmic world, the world before... the appearance of God,"" but that's another piece of poetry (p. xvi). His characters inhabit a world where sometimes the idea of individual action, and even the depthless romantic attachments that are so characteristic of late-Romantic prose, can be instantly and irreparably erased. In the space of a sentence, a character can become the mouthpiece of some physical, electrical, or utopian collective ideal: a strange state of affairs, and an interesting tonic for contemporary fiction, which has forgotten that way of achieving the death of the author. So it's not the microdeviations from the standard, Barthesian characteristics of the late romantic story, as much as the microdeviations from comprehensible characters to instruments of a collective and even inhuman or natural mind, that make these stories so interesting. I don't think they have anything in common with Tolstaya's work....more",Notes are private!,0,16,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/113229.The_Fierce_and_Beautiful_World

She also presents herself as a liar, saying at first it is a typical symptom of epilepsy, but then, when it emerges that she may not have been an epileptic, the lying becomes a narrative strategy for getting at underlying truths.Slater has been ed and discussed widely, but mainly outside literary circles. I can think of several reasons why she hasn't been ed as a serious fiction writer:1. Her strategy of ""lying"" is only controversial if the books are read as nonfiction or as historical scholarship. The blending of fiction and nonfiction ""to get to the heart of things"" (p. 219; cp. p. 192) is not controversial in the domain of writing. What novel isn't about ""narrative truth""? What memoir isn't entwined with fiction? What history isn't narrated? What story isn't a lie? Slater's book is peppered with undergraduate-style allusions to ""postmodernism,"" Heidegger, and others, as justifications for what she's doing: but the very presence of those gestures shows how far she is from literary practice. There are no references to Barth, Barthelme, Auster, Angela Carter, Muriel Spark, and others who have asked the same questions. (Not to mention Ali Smith: wonder if Slater has seen her speech at http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/...?)2. Her writing lacks nuance. It's black and white, and the emotions and scenes are sensationalist. In one episode, her mother berates a hotel pianist for having ""heavy hands,"" and he asks her to sit down and play in his place. Everyone watches as the narrator's mother sits at the piano with a great flourish, and then realizes she actually can't play anything except rudimentary melodies. Her mother then retreats in silence. The next line in the book informs us that Slater had her first epileptic fit that night. There are few scenes in the book that end ambiguously. Slater doesn't evoke or suggest: she dramatizes. The emotional temperature is on high from the first page to the last.3. She isn't especially reflective, even about ideas that are central to the book. There are a couple of pages in which deeper concerns are voiced, but they pass by quickly. In one scene her doctor is interested to learn that she has become interested in religious issues. She gets annoyed at being compared to Saint Teresa and others, because that would mean that her illness was creating her interest. Is religion itself a symptom? she asks. ""Look,"" the doctor answers, ""it's no an either/or thing. Who knows, maybe the disease is God's way of reaching certain people."" (p. 201) His thoughts, and her reactions, go to the heart of difficult issues about faith and mental states, and they should be central for Slater, but she has nothing else to say about them. It's almost as if Slater can't keep her mind on the problem. Perhaps it would be better if she wrote about just one day, preferably an uneventful day, and her attempts to understand it. It's clear she has been struggling to understand her life, and it is a sign of her distress that what counts as understanding a problem is usually coming to a workable solution. Often, I think, that's what she has needed. But it's not what readers need, unless of course they are reading her books as self-help manuals -- in which case they will be annoyed, as they often have been, by her so-called ""lying."" A deeper, more interesting lie, is the one that presents this book as reflective fiction....more",Notes are private!,0,13,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/71960.Lying

Why, after all, should you spend your time reading the s on the English-language Amazon site, Goodreads, or LibraryThing? But I have decided to write this  as if I am writing it to you, because it's in the spirit of your book. And how will I describe this book? It is generous, open, friendly, conversational, and also -- I hope you did not think this was only going to be a friendly  -- also infuriating, loosely written, and sometimes scattered. The book is a treasure trove of wonderful books, because you report on many writers that your reader will not have heard of. I marked the margins of my copy with a dozen names that I will now have to go and read. At the same time, I was delighted to find the names of many others that I know and recognize. And that leads me to my frustration. From very nearly the beginning of the book I found myself arguing with you. Your theme, you say, is 'writers of the No,' meaning writers who have, for one reason or another, stopped writing. But that is the crux of the matter, that 'one reason or another.' Writers stop writing for many different reasons. Beckett is not the same case as Rimbaud, and Melville is not the same as Hawthorne. Some were depressed, some tired, some scared, and some -- I would have thought they would be your only subject -- stopped because they felt that modernism (a word that is unexpectedly absent from your book) has prohibited the endless production of novels.I can hear you saying, Well, yes, but as I say in my book, this is a vast subject, and there are many nuances and many different cases that must be judged and weighed. Exactly. They are different, and where your book falls short (sorry, I am being honest because I do not think you'll see this letter) of, say, Blanchot or even Perec (whom you cite) is where it is necessary to slow down and think about each individual case. Still, even though this is negative and even, I suppose, a bit petulant (or even arch in my mimicry of your easy way of writing), the book is wonderful. One of the most memorable I have read in the past several years.Postscript, added May 9, 2012There is an interesting parallel between the concerns of this book and Craig Dworkin's parting characterization of ""conceptual writing"" in his essay ""The Fate of Echo"" in the book ""Against Expression: An Anthology of Conceptual Writing."" Dworkin ends by listing Borges's Pierre Menard, Bartleby, and Bouvard and Pécuchet. But from Dworkin's perspective, what follows from precedents like those is conceptual writing, which is ""nominalist,"" ""literalist,"" ""genuinely contrarian and oppositional,"" against ""sentiment"" and ""expression."" By Dworkin's standards, Vila-Matas has it all wrong: he continues to write old-fashioned, first-person, expressive, even nostalgic prose, in all the old ways, even though his subject is so much about what Perloff calls ""unoriginality"" and what Dworkin calls ""uncreative writing.""

This novel is life with its content subtracted away. It's about a love affair, but we are scarcely told anything about what either person looks like. We hear, in passing, that the narrator likes to identify species of grass and spiders, but we aren't given any names of grasses or spiders. She falls in love with a man, but we have no idea what kind of person he is. They are both attached to a university, but we hear next to nothing about what they study or teach. She is a translator of French, but there is no French in the book. (That is especially unusual: think of other Francophiles, like Wallace Stevens or John Ashbery, who can't help thinking through French.) Nothing has content, everything is told as her recollections of actions and places. In this contentless and abstract world the writer's voice is all we have. We listen as she wonders whether her memories are correct, and admits that some art not. We hear her descriptions of her own behavior, always written as if she were at some remove from them. When she is suffering most acutely from the absence of the man she fell in love with, we hear that she seems to see herself from a distance. That is the book's strangest moment. We have always seen her from a distance. What kind of narrator could construct a novel so impeccably abstracted from the proper names and the direct emotions of life, and then say that, in her memory, she was only abstracted in that way during a short period of grief? The book is psychologically unusual: deeply sympathetic, sad, and detached, but also, at the same time, entirely perverse and because of that perversity incomprehensible. The book is, in its own way, a masterpiece.Note, added in winter 2017:Some years after I wrote this, I visited Davis at her farmhouse. It was after the publication of ""Cows,"" and she was increasingly central to American writing. I wonder about the effect all that might have on the carelessness of the minimalism in this book, which seems sometimes untended. The recent work has been more aware of its subtractions, more faced outward toward an audience that already expects certain kinds of reticence and abbreviation, more curated and wary of preciousness. I wonder, then, if Davis's work suggests two ways to be minimalist: the first, commoner kind, in which an author knows she is performing minimalist gestures; and the second, rarer and more interesting kind, in which an author is growing into awareness of her minimalisms....more",Notes are private!,0,17,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/113861.The_End_of_the_Story

But it brought Houellebecq into the public eye and set the stage for his later books, so it's worth reconsidering.I think it's weaker than several of the models it attempts to emulate. If you want genuine existential disorientation, read Sartre. If you want intransigent, pithecoid hatred of the human condition, read Celine. If you want a book that actually doesn't flinch in regarding death, try ""Everyman."" If you want a protracted imaginative ventroliquism of motionless despair (like Michel's in this book), read ""The Unnameable."" If you want raw, repetitive, compulsive, unsatisfying sexual excess, read de Sade. (Or Cathy Acker.) If you want the thrill of a science-fiction ending in which humans are regarded as wonderful but primitive things of a happily discarded past, watch ""Star Trek."" Houellebecq's book is is a pastiche of those authors, along with pinches of Sollers, Camus, and Artaud, and many sidelong (and nervous) glances at Nietzsche and Schopenhauer, whom he can't quite bring himself to openly emulate, possibly because then he couldn't continue to be interested in middle-class values. The philosophizing asides are replete with clichés, and the supposedly astonishing scientific passages are cobbled from popular magazines. If you find this novel shocking, you might consider just how immersed in the ""endless middle classes"" you really are: this is café existentialism, a commonplace in popular fiction. It's not difficult to imagine Houellebecq's ideal reader: for such a person, this book is invigorating, challenging, rude, honest, and brutal. It's ambitious because he isn't just ""shooting rabbits,"" as the delightful blurb on the back of the UK edition puts it. He's after ""big game."" That means the book is larded with observations about the decades from the 1940s to the present, their movies, lifestyles, music, politics, sex, and economics. The ideal reader would find these to be both nostalgic and informative. They are intended to give the book scope, make it more like Hugo, Buddenbrooks, or ""Giant"" than an ordinary family story. Mailer, Amis, and many others tried the same strategy. But if you're not convinced by the intrusion of a voice from television documentaries, if you're not shocked by stories about snuff films, boys molesting other boys, or characters endlessly jerking off (I wonder how many orgasms there are in the book: one per page?), if you're not surprised that people are at root damaged, selfish, sexually-driven cowards, then this book won't be illuminating or expressive. Houellebecq could write a strong novel, if he would allow himself to write the excoriating racist screeds that he attributes to one of his two principal characters. (I think he has written that kind of prose: I bet that the excerpts in this book are from his own early manuscripts.)

The continuous infusions of literary references aren't in themselves reasons to avoid him. It's the quality of thought itself that struggles against the floods of literary memories.The main character suffers from ""literature sickness,"" which means he thinks only through literary allusions. He has become so ""literary"" that he even thinks of embodying literature. But there is a gnawing problem here. ""Literature"" here is not really the material and content of novels, stories, and plays. ""Literature,"" in Vila-Matas's mind, is anecdotes about literature, as told by famous writers. Vila-Matas's imagination is overfilled with unprompted memories of clever and curious things writers said in their diaries, letters, and interviews. In the entire book there are no more than a half-dozen quotations from novels and other fiction. And the bizarre and ultimately annoying and dispiriting thing is that Vila-Matas doesn't seem to realize this. He is besotted with the meditations of writers about writing--which is itself interesting--but he seems to be entirely, blandly and happily oblivious to the fact that literature itself does not seem (in the logic of this novel, in the fictional frame of the story) to have made any real impression on him at all.For me one of the oddest signs of this deeper malady--deeper than the one his principal character acknowledges--is when the character tries to get some relief from his barrage of unwanted literary allusions by looking at a sunset, or going for a walk. ""Very soon I shall start thinking about tomatoes and asparagus and all sorts of natural products of the earth and I shall forget about so much literature"" he says at one point. (p. 21) There are many such passages. Am I the only reader who finds this baffling? Have tomatoes and asparagus somehow escaped the attention of novelists, so that their appearance doesn't pull the narrator right back into the world of literary allusions?It is this blindness, and not the wandering, densely allusive, compulsively quotational, deliberately unreliable narrative voice that puts me off.

If it weren't for modernism's (and even postmodernism's) ongoing earnest self-regard, this book would be read alongside Finnegans Wake and other prewar novels that are postmodern avant la lettre. But Gombrowicz's theme in this book prevents him from displaying the sort of formal mastery and control that continues to be expected from maximalist and experimental authors in the wake of early 20th c. modernism. Formal mastery, even if it's ""fractal"" (Wallace's claim about ""Infinite Jest"") or paranoiac (Pynchon) continues to be expected from writers who work with long forms. Gombrowicz knew these expectations perfectly well: after all, the exemplary modernist work when he wrote was ""Ulysses,"" which has comedy, but also a stupendous architecture and an arrogant seriousness of purpose. I imagine Gombrowicz suspected that he was closing doors on himself as he wrote. The closest to ""Ferdydurke"" in this respect is Flann O'Brien's novel ""At Swim-Two-Birds,"" published two years after ""Ferdydurke"" in 1939. It's also vertiginously out of control of its own form, and hysterical about its own humor. I'm not aware of literature comparing them: if anyone knows, please email me.""Ferdydurke's"" protagonist is a serious young novelist who cares about form, and there is a long interpolated chapter in the author's voice (the first ""Preface""), theorizing the importance of form. And yet the book is dedicated to a theme that makes form, seriousness, and the conventional aims of ambition inaccessible or illegible: the fragile, undependable nature of maturity, and how it can be so easily ripped, exposing us to the frantic, ridiculous, misshapen world of immaturity, with its bottomless embarrassments, its awkwardnesses, itches, giggles, blushes, and toilet noises. Personally, I haven't spent much time worrying that I might be infantilized, so this is not a theme I recognize well from my own experience. But it is presented throughout the novel as both the narrator's and the author's special fear. Because I don't especially share this concern, ""Ferdydurke"" doesn't quite work for me as I imagine Gombrowicz hoped it would for his ideal reader. The author and the narrator feel the need to insist that their anxiety and obsession are transparent and universal. What matters, in the end, is not whether or not I share the protagonist's continuous and always justified fear that he will be ""dealt the pupa"" (Gombrowicz's wonderful personal code for the humiliating act of being infantilized). What counts is that ""Ferdydurke"" makes the supposedly bizarre and infantile things that take place make other recent fiction (I'm thinking of Smith or Knausgaard) seem misguidedly stolid and adult. Real comedy is corrosive. Skillful, hyper-eloquent comedy, as in ""McSweeny's,"" is safe by comparison with this book: it's securely mature and annoyingly immune to being dealt the pupa.In line with its hopeless dedication to form in a formless world, the book has lumps and pieces that don't belong, such as the set-piece called ""The Child Runs Deep in Filidor,"" and the hysterical encounter with ""the schoolgirl"" in chapter 6-10. They are sometimes stronger than the intervening material, because they have the form that the narrator otherwise loses. The mass of material in ""Ferdydurke"" comes to seem more like the necessary vomit of excess, excess's proof of its own excessiveness....more",Notes are private!,0,19,1,not set,"Oct 23, 2016","Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/15581.Ferdydurke

What matters isn't the science-fiction frDavid Foster Wallace was right that this is ""pretty much the high point"" of the American experimental novel. What matters isn't the science-fiction frame, in which the narrator is the last living person; and the novel certainly isn't somehow philosophically profound. Reviewers were also distracted by the supposed erudition of the book (the narrator remembers bits and pieces of art history and philosophy). ""Wittgenstein's Mistress"" doesn't address ""formidable philosophic questions"" as the New York Times er said. It doesn't contain ""profound investigations of epistemology,"" as Steven Moore says in his Afterword. (Why did the book need an Afterword? Is it so strange and indigestible that even an experimental press like Dalkey Archive needed to explain it?) It certainly doesn't matter that the narrator's ""cultural allusions... differ from the usual ones"" by placing more emphasis on anecdotes than on the work. (How could that possibly be innovative?) And the book doesn't succeed in ""tempting the reader to equate Western civilization's greatest works of art and philosophy with the futile messages"" the narrator leaves in the streets, hoping somehow to attract some other survivor. I haven't found any , except Wallace's, that sounds right. I agree with his notion that the book is one of the best evocations of Wittgenstein's own frame of mind, including descriptions that are implicit in the philosophic literature from Max Black to the present. Markson has an uncanny ability to conjure a mental state in which a person imagines him- or herself to be the last person on Earth, a person who has been ""mad"" for some long, indeterminate period of time (in the novel, that is the period in which the narrator had desperately searched the world for other survivors). The book is written in short propositional sentences, with complex grammatical links, implying they are all part of one enormous logical statement -- as in the ""Tractatus."" The narrator mistrusts her ability to describe, remember, and recount, and she often moves rapidly back and forth between propositions about states of affairs in the world and propositions about the reliability and sense of the language in which she puts those propositions (as in the transition from the ""Tractatus"" to the later work). She lives in desolate places, as Wittgenstein did, concentrating, apparently, on everyday tasks, as he must have done. There were unspeakable traumas in her past. She wants, above all, to say a few accurate things, which are indisputably true, and -- as in so much of Wittgenstein -- she knows she fails, again and again, although -- unlike in Wittgenstein -- we often know just how she has failed.The concentration on the everyday here makes McCarthy's ""The Road"" look maudlin, cheaply apocalyptic, and self-absorbed, and it makes Barthes's ""The Neutral"" and de Certeau's ""Practice of Everyday Life"" seem inflated and airy.Of many, many passages that deserve to be typed out (again Wallace is right in saying no word is wasted), here is one. The narrator has been recounting, repeatedly (without realizing she's repeating herself), the fact that the actual town of Troy was tiny.""Even if Troy itself was disappointingly small. Like little more than your ordinary city block and a few stories in height, practically.""Although now that I remember, everything in William Shakespeare's house at Stratford-on-Avon was astonishingly tiny, too. As if only imaginary people had lived there then.""Or perhaps it is only the past itself, which is always smaller than one had believed.""I do wish that that last sentence had some meaning, since it certainly came close to impressing me for moment.""There is a great deal of sadness in the Iliad in either case, incidentally."" (p. 126)The book isn't perfect; Markson succumbs to the temptation to have his narrator speculate what would happen if she wrote a novel, and those pages of metafiction -- in which we are invited to remember that we're reading an experimental prose piece on the idea of experimental writing -- don't add anything to the concerted and barely controlled voice that is the book's strength. There is no need to lift the veil of the suspension of disbelief if the entire novel is about failures of belief. In a few places, too, Markson shows off without needing or meaning to. Those passages are helped by a few places where he has his narrator say, ""Perhaps I was just showing off there."" But Markson himself seems to have been unaware how academic it sounds, and how unlikely it is, that a person who does not read German, on looking through a book by Heidegger, will be struck by the recurrence of the word Dasein, which is, as philosophically inclined readers know, actually crucial to the novel's sense. That really is showing off, and it's inadvertent on Markson's part. I also think the book could have done without the very brief synopsis near the end, in which we learn facts about the narrator's family that we didn't need to know, because they don't help us understand her inexorably deteriorating mental state.But the book is astonishing, continuously, and it is also, incidentally to its own project, one of the most provocative readings of Wittgenstein: not because it makes claims about his claims, but because it tests our own understanding of the mental state that could have produced his writing....more",Notes are private!,0,21,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/51506.Wittgenstein_s_Mistress

I assume its popularity had to to with the fact that the main character has lost her entire family, and then loses a kind of surrogate mother (who is also a transsexual) and almost loses a boyfriend (because he is oddly emotionally disconnected). But the writing is thin. Yoshimoto continuously and almost exclusively uses the moon as an index of her character's mood. That's commensurate with a long tradition in Japan, but Yoshimoto's descriptions are simple to the point of being threadbare. The character's emotions are indexed to the moon and the weather, but the moon and weather are described so simply -- almost repetitively -- that it isn't possible to see much nuance in her inner life. And it seems there isn't much, aside from an increasing loneliness. There's a difficult issue here to do with translation: as in some other contemporary Japanese fiction, there is almost no interest in detailed description; no evident experimentation with language or description; no passages where writing is what matters. The book is like a report, in minimal style, of the character's actions and feelings. This is a difficult issue because it doesn't seem to be a matter of the translation. The English is fine and colloquial, but that can only mean that the original is also written in something like a simple, if not a pallid, style. Can that be right? Is what counts as a novel so disconnected from what counts as writing?(Since I wrote this the English novelist and essayist Tim Parks has written some pieces on non-English books that may be deliberately written in a simple style so they can be easily translated into English.

But that's just pWhat is Oulipean ""Style""?In the popular reception, Perec's book is still considered as a linguistic marvel, or a translation marvel. But that's just praising virtuosity: if the book is as important as some of his others, the idea of omitting the letter ""e"" has to have other expressive effects. Perec himself helpfully gives the reasons for his experiment in the penultimate section of the book. He says (1) the book might be a ""stimulant... on fiction-writing today,"" (2) that it would be ""a spur to [the] imagination,"" (3) that it might be a ""wilfully critical"" provocation ""vis-a-vis fiction."" The third of these is apparently intended to be the most substantial. For an ideal reader, then, this book might be a model (or at least a ""provocation"") indicating the kind of radical strategies that have to be adopted to make the novel a viable form. I have no criticism of that ambition. In the years since ""La Disparition"" (1969) and ""A Void"" (1995), the two other unpublished English translations, and the half-dozen translations into other languages that have appeared since 2000, a large scholarly literature has appeared on this and other books that operate by the rule of the lipogram. (For the other English translations see Stephen Frug's excellent essay, tinyurl.com/yazpa32t; for the half-dozen translations into other languages, see the French-language Wikipedia page on ""la Disparition."") Much of the scholarly literature focuses on the politics of the void (and of Perec's autobiographical novel ""W""), mourning, and related themes, or on the social context of Oulipo and Perec's practice. (For example Warren Motte. ""Pereckonings,"" in Yale French Studies, 2004; a good  is Heather Mawhinney, ""Vol du Bourdon,"" Modern Language Review 97, 2002) The academic approaches are similar to the online and newspaper s in that they also tend to focus on meanings that emerge from the book as a whole rather than the reader's page-by-page puzzlement.The difficulty, for me, is in squaring Perec's and others' interest in the abstract challenge of omitting the letter ""e"" with the experience of reading, which is anything but generalized. In order for the book to operate as Perec seems to have hoped, the avoidance of the letter ""e"" has to be seen as putting variable but continuous pressure on ordinary narration: the void has to have an abstract effect, turning the reader's thoughts to questions of what comprises expected forms of narration and what might be done to overturn them. The book can then become a provocation aimed at ""fiction"" in general. Likewise, in order for the book to operate as an instance of the void evoked in ""W,"" the avoidance of the letter ""e"" has to be of interest mainly for its continuous troubling absence. In each kind of reading, there is no for what is normally called ""style"" or ""voice"": they are simply the deliciously mangled remnants of sentences that have had the letter ""e"" plucked out of them. In the reception of Oulipo, asking about style is a sort of faux pas, because it might be evidence that the reader has missed the point of the whole enterprise. The Oulipo is about ""potential"" literature, games and rules that might make a future literature. It's a provocation, not an example of the practices it avoids. That's quite true, and Oulipo is still very much a provocation despite recent critiques. (See Lauren Elkin and Scott Esposito's ""End of Oulipo?,"" ed for example by Mitchell Kerley in ""SubStance,"" 47, 2018.)Yet I think it needs to be said that what happens in reading is quite different from what's implied by the book's critical reception or by the injunction not to read expressively (for ""style""). The overall narrative is very cleverly arranged so that the persistent and almost always unnoticed absence of the letter ""e"" from the lives of the characters is what produces their deaths. But at the level of sentences, phrases, and word choices, the void is often more annoying and repetitive than enabling. Here is an example, using Adair's English translation:""Miraculously, though, Albin got out of Tirana by night and, hiding out in a thick, dark, almost fairy-tale wood, would languish in it for all of six springs and six autumns, a half-moribund survivor...' (p. 159)The phrase, ""half-moribund survivor,"" is apparently a substitute for ""half-dead."" The book is replete with examples of complex, Latinate words substituting for simpler, Anglo-Saxon ones. The result is a quirky and often pleasing archaism and formality. But it's different with ""all of six spring and six autumns."" The book is also replete with versions of that phrase -- ""20 springs,"" ""six springs,"" and so on. All those are presumably to avoid the word ""years."" Now that's not a problem in French, where the word would be ""ans,"" but it is typical of the translation as a whole. ""Springs"" a silly and uninteresting repetition. I imagine it was necessary mainly because Perec didn't need to concern himself with ""ans,"" and so used it more than he would have if it had included an ""e.""""All of six spring and six autumns"" produces a different effect than """"half-moribund survivor."" It's different again with ""fairy-story wood,"" which is presumably a substitute for ""fairy-tale wood."" That is not archaic or expressive. It sounds like a random choice. If it has an expressive value, it's just the very fleeting annoyance I feel at realizing what generated the expression ""fairy-story.""These three different technical problems create three distinct expressive effects. They will remind a reader of different kinds of writing (Latinate, scholarly, gruff, inept, childish...). These three and many more identifiable and guessable solutions to avoiding the letter ""e"" combine and multiply relentlessly, producing a situation in which a reader has, I think, two choices: either stop reading in the ways we have all been accustomed to read literary fiction, and think of ""A Void"" as one enormous conceptual experiment, in the line that lead to Kenny Goldsmith, or continue reading as if this is normative fiction, and be continuously distracted by turns of phrase that seem unaccountably Latinate, strangely scholarly, inappropriately gruff, unaccountably inept, irrelevantly childish, and so on. The difficulty in opting for the general, conceptual reading is that ""A Void"" isn't structured like Goldsmith's ""Day,"" ""Traffic,"" ""Sports,"" or others: ""A Void"" has a narrative, and makes use of all the structures of fiction we have learned to name and analyze since New Criticism, or since Barthes. The many readers who seem to experience ""A Void"" as the product of a single rule end up taking a few exceptional passages to stand for a full reading. I think that is only possible if you skim the book, ignoring its stylistically ragged surface in favor of its single generative rule.The relentless combination of brilliant, adequate, and problematic solutions to avoiding the letter ""e,"" together with the mad variety of styles, historical periods, authors, dialect, patois, and ventriloquized writers' styles conjured by those different solutions makes ""A Void"" an experiment in hokey and apparently inept writing. I don't see evidence in what Perec wrote or said that he intended that effect. In the penultimate section, he says his experiment took him down ""many intriguing linguistic highways and byways,"" and that he honed his ""writing skills"" with ""inspiration"" and ""not without occasional humor."" My sense is that he experienced his experiment as a delightful diversion, requiring all sorts of clevernesses. I don't see how a full, careful, attentive reading of the book can correspond to that sort of description. My interest in Perec's virtuosity, and his translators' virtuosity, wore off in the first fifty pages. After that, their infelicities, awkwardnesses, and unplanned allusions to other modes of writing outweighed my general admiration for the accomplishment. A hundred or so pages in to the book, I realized neither the author nor the translator seemed to experience the many sorts of infelicities as annoyances -- and that that point my reading diverged from what I've characterized as the popular and scholarly receptions. On the other hand: these thoughts apply to lipograms, and most of Perec's work has different constraints. It's the lipogram, especially, that produces the tumultuous inadvertent tour through literary history that has to be resolutely ignored in order to go on praising the book's astonishing technical achievement....more",Notes are private!,0,12,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28294.A_Void

For me, it had the additional attraction that it's set at Snaeffelsjokull, an Icelandic volcano I had just visited, and one of the characters comes from Hafnarfjordur, where I was staying in Iceland. It is a fantastical story of the parish priest ""at the glacier"" (under the volcano), and the mysterious things that happen in his parish; but it is also very much of its time and place, the late 1960s. I found it tremendously disappointing, and I barely got through it. Sontag's ecstatic introduction links the book to a whole list of sorts of novels:Science fictionTale, fable, allegoryPhilosophical novelDream novelVisionary novelLiterature of fantasyWisdom litSpoofSexual turn-on (p. vi)That's her list, and she links ""Under the Glacier"" to all but the last one. She also says it is ""one of the funniest books ever written."" She gives a good account of the elements of comedy in literature, including ""defect of affectivity"" (the protagonist doesn't feel much, or express it if he does), ""repetition,"" ""deficit of understanding,"" and others. That's a good characterization, but it doesn't mean the novel is funny. Here are two examples of what counts as humor to Laxness. At one point there is a possibility that a corpse will be stolen by a South American man who will take it up onto the glacier and shrink the corpse's head. Laxness mentions this wild possibility in the most offhanded possible way: ""I promise to do everything in my power to prevent the body being taken up onto the glacier, its head removed and shrunk, etc."" (p. 155)The ""etc."" is supposed to be humorous here: it's part of the deadpan strategy of comedy. On the next page, the narrator considers some damaged paintings:""I would point out that I have prevented the old paintings... from being scrubbed with caustic soda with the kind of scrubbing brush that Hafnarfj�r�ur people use for scouring the scales off haddock."" (p 156)The strategies of repetition, affectlessness, naivete, and so on, are exactly as Sontag says: but the effect, for me, is not at all comic: it is tedious.But the main difficulty I had with this book, and the revision I would like to have made in its reception, is that the book is clearly about a kind of post-Christian mystical communion with nature. It's a meditation on what spirituality might look like after Christianity. The parish priest who is the subject of the narrator's investigation has boarded up his church, and spends his time shoeing horses. (An echo, risky in its obviousness, of Jesus's washing of the disciples' feet.) He can barely bring himself to read anything from the Bible. (In one passage he is called on to read a prayer, and it takes him several minutes to find one he can agree with.) He has an elusive wisdom and happiness, and he is often called ""he richest person in the world.""As Sontag says, in a footnote (!), the original Icelandic title can be translated as ""Christianity at the Glacier,"" not ""Under the Glacier."" One of the models for this post-Christian spirituality is 12th century Franciscan natural revelation. There are, for example, many pages devoted to observations of birds. Birds follow the pastor around, almost in the fashion of St. Francis, and the narrator observes strange and also natural bird behavior. There are also paragraphs devoted to a calf, lambs, the fields, horses, and the weather. Laxness is careful not to include any actual miracles, but the implication throughout is that nature itself is continuously miraculous. It's a kind of low-energy visionary nature poetry, with the revelations omitted and the rhapsodies are refracted through twentieth-century natural history. As a post-theological position, or even a hint of one, it has a pervasive softness and indecision, and it is animated by an unremitting but low-energy hopefulness. It is true, as Sontag says, that the ""deep questions"" of life are raised here with ""impudent lightness,"" and it is almost true that it is ""a satire on religion,"" and nearly a ""spoof,"" and it's clearly the case that it carefully avoids the supernatural: but it isn't accurate to mention those things only in passing, on the last page of the introduction. The novel is about naturalistic religion from the very beginning. It hides indecision about the sacred under the lightness of its allegory, and it hides a hapless sincerity under the lightness of its satire. It's not necessary to wish this were either religious or anti-religious to be disappointed by its blurred sense of what is, actually, possible.The book may very well be unlike any other Laxness wrote (Sontag says that twice in her introduction, making me wonder how sure she was).

The ""Third Policeman"" is one of the last books Joyce read, and by implication it's is a kind of Doppelgaenger to ""Finnegans Wake."" The book's play with language and its reflexivity about the novel form is somehow parallel to Joyce's.2. The book is an indirect but eloquent record of that generation in Ireland, when the humor could be desperate, when the church was all-powerful, when what's now called ""homosocial"" life in crowded dingy pubs had to stand in for the wider society that Joyce chose. In later life O'Brien was also an alcoholic, even though it's always hard to know what exactly that diagnosis explains (maybe the exaggerrated lucidity of Myles na gCopaleen). (Thanks to Don's comment, below.)3. O'Brien is a member of what Hugh Kenner called ""Irish nihilism."" In this view there is no moral sense in the book, which after all begins with someone's head being crushed by a garden spade. This also supposedly explains the absence of contrition or religious feeling. Denis Donoghue almost assents to this in his strange and covertly Republican Afterword to the Dalkey Archive edition.4. O'Brien is a minimalist, and his deepest ties are to Beckett. This is one of the lines in Fintan O'Toole's 2009  in the ""New York Review of Books.""5. O'Brien's own explanation is that the book is about a dead man, and that the last page shows how the damned suffer their punishments eternally. But that's only an explanation if your idea of hell already includes knives so thin they can't be seen, microscopic carved wooden boxes, and sexually mutable bicycles. Otherwise it doesn't explain anything. The fact that these are forced or otherwise unhelpful may indicate that the book is stranger than its commentators think. The fact that people keep coming up with these one-line explanations shows how the novel keeps prodding its readers: it is just too odd to be accepted as a mid-century modernist novel or even an anachronistic postmodern one; for many readers a theory, no matter how restrictive, helps soothe the discomfort. But what is the avant-garde, if it isn't a thing that is not anticipated? That cannot be accommodated? That wasn't asked for, that solves no problem we ever thought we had? The ""Third Policeman"" is one of the best examples of a genuinely avant-garde modernist work, because it just won't fit into categories, even so many years on.By way of postscript: one thing I especially love about the book is the Irish landscape that it conjures, between its many fantasies and concoctions. If you take away the hallucinated afterlife that occupies most of the narrative, what remains? A poor, simple countryside, with farms and a few police stations and pubs, and miles of bumpy roads, sodden fields, muck, brambles, dripping copses, and gorse. There is almost nothing else: people ride bicycles everywhere. When they think they might become rich, they dream of changes of clothes. There is almost no mention of what they eat or drink. It is an impoverished landscape implying an impoverished society -- and when I think of those things, O'Brien's perverse and perfervid inventions look even more necessary than his humor, and more desperate and painful....more",Notes are private!,0,53,1,not set,"May 10, 2016","Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/27208.The_Third_Policeman

It is about a young man who gives up his school examinations, his friends, and his purpose in life. He does as little as possible, wants as little as possible, takes as little interest in life as he can. He is ""asleep.""The interest here isn't the form of life Perec is trying to imagine, because this is an exercise in writing. (It isn't like Ottessa Moshfegh's ""My Year of Rest and Relaxation,"" superficially for all sorts of reasons, and more profoundly because Perec's subject is writing, not living.) The book is interesting to me mainly because I can't quite tell what the writing exercise is. I can think of five possible precedents or models.1. Because the character does very little, and spends days on end in his tiny garret, it seems to owe its torpor and pessimism to Beckett, especially early Beckett like ""Murphy."" But Beckett's willful self-paralysis is presented as a condition of life, of living. Here, it's something the narrator has to train himself for, and it's also an illness, from which he will finally awaken. The introduction by David Bellos makes it sound as if it's not likely the character will survive his ""hell"": but at the end, the narrator has several crucial insights. ""You were alone and that is all there is to it and you wanted to protect yourself... But your refusal is futile. Your neutrality is meaningless."" A character in Beckett would not be likely to ""wake up"" in that fashion.2. Because the character wanders all around Paris -- the book is practically an inventory of every park, boulevard, and museum in the city -- it's also reminiscent of Guy Debord. But I don't think that's right either, because Perec is at pains to say that his character is not a flaneur: he doesn't take any interest in what he sees, and in fact he trains himself not to care. The only two people in the book who attract the narrator's attention are a possibly psychotic man in a park, who does nothing but sit and stare, and the narrator's neighbor in the garret, whom he hears through the wall. This is the opposite of Debord's psychogeographies and his derive.3. A more plausible source, I think, is Duchamp. The narrator cultivates indifference; he trains himself not to judge, not to care. He has an interest in lack of affect. ""Indifference has neither beginning nor end... indifference dissolves language and scrambles the signs"" (p. 185). There's a telling passage in which he's out in the country, looking at a tree. He says he could spend his whole life looking at the tree, ""never exhausting it and never understanding it, because there is nothing for you to understand, just something to look at: when all is said and done, all you can say about the tree is that it is a tree; all the tree can say to you is that it is a tree."" (p. 153) This particular passage isn't Duchampian--it is more late-Romantic natural philosophy--but what comes next shows that for Perec, the tree is the opposite of affect: ""This is why, perhaps, you never go walking with a dog, because the dog looks at you, pleads with you, speaks to you... You cannot remain neutral in the company of a dog."" (p. 154)4. I wonder if Nietzsche's sense of the animal is behind some of this. Perec's narrator imagines a life without history, without past or future. Simple, self-evident life, ""like a drop of water forming on a drinking tap on a landing, like six socks soaking in a pink plastic bowl, like a fly or a mollusc, like a cow or a snail, like a child or an old man, like a rat."" (p. 177) The character is trying to strip himself of human motivations, which means culture, which means history. ""To let yourself be carried along by the crowds, and the streets. To walk the length of the embankments... to waste your time. To have no projects, to feel no impatience. To be without desire, or resentment, or revolt."" (p. 161)5. Or, in the spirit of constrained writing, the perversity of the contraint itself may be what matters. The narrator reads ""Le Monde"" every day from five to seven o'clock, and sometimes re-reads entire issues. He reads ""line by line, systematically. It is an excellent exercise."" (p. 168) But ""reading Le Monde is simply a way of wasting, or gaining, an hour or two, of measuring once again your indifference."" (p. 169) Perec comes close to the supposedly affectless, rule-bound, rote, non-semantic sort of reading that has become associated with conceptual poetry.I can't decide between these possibilities, and I wonder if the book itself may have been an unresolved experiment for that reason. It isn't like the ""Attempt at Exhausting a Place in Paris,"" for example, which is more pure in its motivations and execution. The book is also interesting for its second-person narration. Perec uses the second-person singular informal French ""tu,"" so that the book sounds, in English, like an inner monologue. But it was not intended that way. This edition has an excellent very brief introduction by Bellos, which quotes a line from a  by Roger Kleman: ""The teller of the tale could well be the one to whom the tale is told... The second person of 'A Man Asleep' is the grammatical form of absolute loneliness, of utter deprivation."" In addition a film version that Perec helped make has a woman's voice narrating the young man's life: all this by way of saying the voice isn't the character's inner monologue, but a speech directed to him....more",Notes are private!,0,9,1,not set,not set,"Oct 09, 2012",,Paperback,view (with text),/book/show/28295.Things

And yet Banville can wrote propulsive, plot-driven fiction, as his detective novels demonstrate. So this is a complex problem. If there is a limitaion to the plotlessness of books like ""The Sea"" it is a lack of distinction between kinds of stasis, motives for torpor.And last: the problem of self-absorption is also a difficult one. I do not mind writers who ignore their readers, who write as if plausible readers do not exist. (Writers like the Joyce of ""Finnegans Wake"" or the Schmidt of ""Bottom's Dream."") But I am insulted by writers who are cocooned in self-regard. (Writers like the late Bellow or Vila-Matas.) The self-regard in which Banville wraps his prose is evident in interviews and lectures, and it even spills into his Wikipedia page, which I would like to propose is either written by him, or by the kind of reader who has helped create his self-absorption.

He wants us to feel a twinge, maybe tear up, hopefully even bawl, and to do it, ideally, on every page. It isn't enough that a man is losing his ability to speak: his wife has to be going blind. It isn't enough that another man hasn't spoken in two decades: he has to have a bed with three thousand nails driven into it, one for each year since his wife died. It isn't enough to have a heart-rending letter from your father: you have to also have one from a convict who doesn't even know he's been in prison forty years, and anther letter, and another. At one point there is an unintentional parody of the pulp paperback one-cathartic-moment-per-page formula, when a woman is abandoned by her husband, and everything moves her: ""A dog following a stranger. That made me feel so much. A calendar that showed the wrong month. I could have cried over it. I did. Where the smoke from a chimney ended. How an overturned bottle rested at the edge of a table."" (p. 180) These sentences are separated by four or five spaces, because it isn't enough just to read them: we have to feel the spaces, the emptiness, in the woman's life, and we have to feel it again every time she says anything.People say the book is well written. But when the writing is good, it is always necessary to say what purpose it serves. The most stupefyingly miasmic adventitious emotional crises are propped up, electrified, by Foer's cleverness: but why do that? Why not write standard Romantic prose? The book is like an emotional Frankenstein, a nineteenth-century romance novel brought to life with McSweeney's style wit and dispatch, given the facsimile of life by jolts of artificial feeling.The book is a swill of perfumed emotions. It is elaborately artificial and yet gluely emotional: as if the exotic perfumes of Huysmans were to meet the kitschy sentimentality of O Henry. What kind of people feel emotion this way? What kind of reader thinks that real, powerful emotion comes in 300-word bursts, repeated 300 times in the course of a novel? What kind of person is always so close to tears that they are moved by this kind of writing?
