What reader would not long for a library that never ends? But I would probably read the back of a cereal box if Mark Lawrence wrote it. He is just that good.In this novel, Mark Lawrence introduces us to intelligent characters, quick thinkers who inhale learning and knowledge like air and who use that knowledge to grow comfortable with the dark and light sides of life. As always, he builds a tale, and a world, that is complex, intriguing, engrossing, and immersive. Most of all, I love his foreshadowing, which is subtle and written with the lightest of touches. It is the single piano note, played softly, which signals the beginning of a melody that is yet to be defined, but ultimately builds to an unmistakable, unstoppable wall of sound riff by the end of the book. Mark Lawrence's novels are not casually read; no simple sentences designed to lull the reader forward with empty calories. No Instagram-ready quick sentence flicks designed to satisfy those who are looking to tell their friends about a book that they just read in two days. Rather, he is a writer at the top of his game, respectfully weaving stories of grace and power. ...more",Notes are private!,0,3,2,Dec 2023not set,"Dec 25, 2023not set","Dec 25, 2023",,Hardcover,view (with text),/book/show/61612864-the-book-that-wouldn-t-burn

Although initially jarring, the book's sudden transition from the now into the past grew on me. Her sense of place is fantastic, especially for those of us who have spent any time in either eastern or western MA. In this novel, she keeps a light hand on introducing the fantastical and perhaps magical, which I much preferred from some of her earlier novels which leaned more heavily into women as witches theme for my taste. ...more",Notes are private!,0,1,1,not set,"Dec 22, 2023","Dec 22, 2023",,Kindle Edition,view (with text),/book/show/63357538-the-invisible-hour
